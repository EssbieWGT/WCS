Four Delaware high school students are gaining national recognition for their leadership and community impact after presenting innovative projects at the YMCA Changemakers Summit in Orlando, Florida.
The students, all participants in the YMCA of Delaware’s Youth In Government (YIG) program, were selected to represent the state at the prestigious summit, where teens from across the country pitched original ideas aimed at solving local community issues.
Jeshen Kannan and Allison Hong received a $1,000 award for their mental health initiative, “It’s Okay Not To Be Okay.”

“We are so proud of these youth leaders who are demonstrating the power of young voices to create real change,” said Jascelyn Parson, Youth In Government Program Director at the YMCA of Delaware. “Their ideas, passion, and commitment to their communities are inspiring and reflect the core mission of the Y.”
The project seeks to reduce the stigma surrounding mental health and improve access to resources for Delaware youth.
Their work includes speaker events, peer-led training, and a 24/7 virtual support hub in collaboration with partners such as UnLocke the Light, Sean’s House, local school districts, and Delaware YMCAs.
Another Delaware team, Audrey Curtis and Iyanna Flores, presented “Kickstart the Game,” an initiative designed to make soccer more accessible to children in underserved communities.
The program offers low-cost soccer opportunities, donated gear, and local partnerships to remove financial barriers and promote youth development through sports.

In response to pharmacy closures across Delaware stemming from Rite Aid’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, state officials are taking swift action to safeguard residents’ access to essential medications.
Delaware Insurance Commissioner Trinidad Navarro has issued Bulletin No. 153, outlining steps that health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) must take to reduce disruption and ensure continuity of care.
“Minimizing disruptions in pharmacy services is vital to ensuring the health and safety of Delawareans,” said Insurance Commissioner Trinidad Navarro. “Insurers and PBMs should ensure access to and coverage for emergency prescription refills, streamline the prior authorization and prescription transfer process, ensure fair reimbursement rates for pharmacies absorbing displaced patients, maintain adequate pharmacy networks, and communicate with affected policyholders.”
The closures could potentially leave thousands of patients without convenient access to their medications, prompting calls for both insurers and patients to act quickly.

Navarro urged residents to proactively transfer prescriptions and encouraged healthcare providers to reach out to patients about switching pharmacies.
According to the Department of Insurance, a surge in prescription transfer requests is expected as displaced Rite Aid customers seek alternative pharmacies.
To address this, the Board of Pharmacy has authorized one-time emergency prescription refills, which insurers are now required to cover—even in cases where a prescriber is unavailable due to the closures.
Prescription records or pharmacy databases may be used for verification in these cases.
Insurers are also required to streamline the prescription transfer process and notify policyholders about closures, offering clear instructions and dedicated support—such as hotlines or web portals—to help facilitate the transition.
The bulletin also mandates automatic transfer of prior authorizations for medications tied to closed Rite Aid locations.
That includes expedited handling for specialty drugs and controlled substances, ensuring patients don’t face delays or added administrative burdens.
PBMs are directed to provide fair reimbursement rates to pharmacies taking in displaced patients and to avoid policies that steer patients toward specific providers or mail-order options—practices that are prohibited under Delaware’s Pharmacy Access Act.
Officials stressed the need to preserve access, especially in rural and underserved communities.
The emergency measures authorized by the Board of Pharmacy will remain in effect for 120 days unless extended or modified.
The Department of Insurance said it will monitor compliance closely and may issue additional guidance as the situation develops.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-06-at-3.38.25-PM.png,,,2025-07-06 16:02:04.238496

(Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)The U.S. Department of Education’s decision last week to hold back $6.8 billion in federal K-12 funds next year has triggered alarm among state education officials, school leaders and advocacy groups nationwide over how the lack of funds will affect their after-school, enrichment and language-learning services.
The Trump administration’s decision to freeze the funding has put states in “triage mode” as they scramble to decide what programs may be cut without that funding, said Mary Kusler, senior director for the Center for Advocacy at the National Education Association. The money was approved by Congress to support education for English language learners, migrants, low-income children and adults learning to read, among others.
As of July 1, school systems are unable to draw down funding, jeopardizing summer programs, hiring and early-year planning for the 2025–26 school year.
The funding freeze affects several core programs: Title II-A (educator training and recruitment), Title III-A (English learner support), Title IV-A (student enrichment and after-school), as well as migrant education and adult education and literacy grants. Trump has proposed eliminating all those programs in his proposed budget for next fiscal year, but that proposal hasn’t gone through Congress.
State superintendents sent out missives to school districts and now are scrambling to make choices.
“This is not about political philosophy, this is about reliability and consistency,” Alabama state Superintendent Eric Mackey said to Politico last week. “None of us were worrying about this.”
The administration says it is reviewing the programs.
“The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities,” the U.S. Department of Education wrote to states in its announcement Monday.
Trump administration tells states it’s freezing $6.8 billion for K-12 school programs

Historically, the department releases allocations by July 1 to ensure schools can budget and plan effectively for the coming school year. Withholding the money could result in canceled programs, hiring freezes and the loss of essential support for English learners, migrant children and other high-need populations, education and state officials told Stateline.
“America’s public school leaders run district budgets that are dependent on a complex partnership between federal, state, and local funding,” said David R. Schuler, executive director of the School Superintendents Association in a statement. “For decades, school districts have relied on timely confirmation of their federal allocations ahead of the July 1 start of the fiscal year — ensuring stability, allowing for responsible planning, and supporting uninterrupted educational services for students.”
The states facing the largest withheld amounts include California ($810.7 million), Texas ($660.9 million), and New York ($411.7 million), according to data from the NEA and the Learning Policy Institute, an education think tank.
For 17 states and territories, the freeze affects over 15% of their total federal K-12 allocations, according to the Learning Policy Institute. For smaller jurisdictions such as the District of Columbia and Vermont, the disruption hits even harder: More than 20% of their federal K-12 budgets remain inaccessible.
Colorado Education Commissioner Susan Córdova urged school districts to begin contingency planning in case funds are not released before the federal fiscal year ends on Sept. 30. California State Superintendent Tony Thurmond hinted at possible legal action, which has become a trend as states fight the second Trump administration’s funding revocations or delays.
“California will continue to pursue all available legal remedies to the Trump Administration’s unlawful withholding of federal funds appropriated by Congress,” Thurmond said in a statement.
The NEA and the NAACP have filed for a preliminary injunction, calling the administration’s delay an illegal “impoundment” — a violation of the federal Impoundment Control Act, which bars the executive branch from withholding appropriated funds without congressional approval.
Education advocates warn the recent decision by the Trump administration to withhold funding reflects a broader pattern of federal disengagement from public education.
Community nonprofits said the withholding could devastate their programming too. The Boys and Girls Clubs of America could have to close more than 900 centers — bringing the loss of 5,900 jobs and affecting more than 220,000 children, said President and CEO Jim Clark in a statement.
The 1974 Impoundment Control Act lets the president propose canceling funds approved by Congress. Lawmakers have 45 days to approve the request; if they don’t, it’s denied. Meanwhile, agencies can be directed not to spend the funds during that time.
A White House statement shared with States Newsroom last week said “initial findings have shown that many of these grant programs have been grossly misused to subsidize a radical leftwing agenda.”
“Kids, educators, and working families are the ones losing,” said Kusler, of the NEA. “We need governors and communities to step up — now.”

(Provided/Gullah Traveling Theater)When George Washington goes to heaven in the Gullah Traveling Theater’s telling of the American Revolution, Saint Peter stops him at the pearly gates.
The country’s first president and commander-in-chief of the Continental Army must first reckon with his ownership of slaves and their lives before he can pass, Saint Peter tells him.
Though that’s obviously a fictional scenario, some historians say Washington did struggle internally with the juxtaposition of securing freedom for a new country while enslaving people. His will, signed six months before his death in 1799, ordered enslaved workers at Mount Vernon freed when his wife, Martha Washington, died, though fewer than half actually were.
In the play, the Virginia planter does make it into heaven.
Through Washington and other famous Revolutionary figures looking back at their lives, the nonprofit theater company tells the often-overlooked story of enslaved people in South Carolina during the Revolution, said director Anita Singleton Prather.


How to see the show
An excerpt of the show will play at 4 p.m. July 9 at Christ Lutheran Church in Hilton Head Island. Tickets are free.
Da’Gullah American Revolution Experience will play at 2 p.m. July 19 at May River Theater in Bluffton. Advance tickets for adults are $45. Youth ages 7 to 17 are $15. Children age 0 to 6 are free. All tickets include a rice tasting. The show will be part of a mini festival taking pace from noon to 6 p.m. at the theater.


“They say behind every great man is a great woman, but I knew behind every great Revolutionary hero was probably some Black folks,” Prather said.
SC250, which is tasked with celebrating the 250th anniversary of the country’s founding, asked the Beaufort theater troupe’s director last year if she would be interested in putting on a show about the Gullah Geechee experience during the Revolutionary War.
Prather jumped at the chance to tell the story, she said.
“A lot of our history has not been included in your normal textbooks or archives,” Prather said.
Research was Prather’s first step.
She, like many people, knew much of the history that has been compiled of enslaved people during the Civil War, but the Revolution remained a dark spot in that history. That wasn’t for lack of trying. Not nearly as much has been written about slaves during that era, she said.
Prather knew that many people were enslaved in Barbados and brought to Charleston, so she visited the country in the Caribbean Sea in January. There, she got a better sense of the slave trade during that time.
She read accounts of the people enslaved to well-known figures during the war in South Carolina, including “Swamp Fox” Francis Marion and “Fighting Gamecock” Thomas Sumter.
Because the play is fictional, Prather used historical accounts as the bones of the stories and filled in the gaps with her own writing, she said.
The play, called Da’Gullah American Revolution Experience, heavily features music, which was another challenge.
Scott Gibbs, the company’s music and art director, wanted to include traditional Gullah Geechee songs from the era, knowing some from the Civil War had survived the years, but he couldn’t find much. So, he rearranged other spirituals to fit the scenes, he said.
“I’ve learned that sometimes [music] lightens the telling of the story,” Gibbs said. “You still have to tell the story. You still have to tell the truth, but it’s how you tell the story and how you tell the truth.”
While the story grapples with an ugly part of history, the point is not to take away from the major contributions and sacrifices the heroes of the Revolutionary War made in founding the country.
Principles of the Declaration of Independence they signed, such as liberty, freedom and the pursuit of happiness, were generally good, Prather said.
The Founding Fathers should have recognized that those principles should have applied to all people in the country, including those who were enslaved, she said. To do that, the play humanizes the people denied the right to freedom for which the heroes of the Revolution fought, she said.
At a time when references to slavery at places such as national parks are being removed, Prather wanted audiences to grapple with the difficult parts of the past, she said.
“If you leave out the Gullah Geechee, then South Carolina history is not complete,” Prather said. “If you leave out South Carolina history, American history is not complete. Without American history, world history is not complete.”
“We have to tell the stories, and history is not good or bad,” Prather continued. “It’s just what happened.”
Those contradictions were what made Prather decide to frame the story through characters looking back on their lives at heaven’s gates as opposed to using a more traditional linear narrative, she said.
A person like Washington, seen as a symbol of freedom during the Revolution, can face the people he enslaved as he never would have in life, she said.
In this version of the afterlife, enslaved people confront the people who owned them. During one act of the play, the characters read fictionalized letters to their masters, saying everything Prather imagined they might have said if given the chance.
For instance, Oscar Marion — who was enslaved by the general who’s the namesake of a South Carolina city, county, and public university — is able to ask Francis Marion how he could enslave him despite them reportedly being friends as children and fighting side by side during the war.
“‘You don’t think I deserve the same freedom I fought for you to have?’” Prather said Oscar Marion asks. “‘You don’t think I deserve the same thing?’”
The play, which showed an abridged preview in May, is only able to tell the story of a handful of enslaved people. Prather wants people to take away a broader curiosity of their role in the war.
“There are so many untold stories that need to be told,” Prather said. “We won’t get to tell them all, but hopefully we’ll give people enough of a taste that they will go and do some of their own research.”

Swaths of western South Dakota are considered legal deserts, where barriers such as poverty, lack of transportation and internet access, combined with a lack of attorneys, make it difficult for people to access legal help.
The new effort helps immediately address the problem while work continues on longer-term solutions, such as the state rural lawyer recruitment and retention program.

Dakota Plains Legal Services used a $125,000 state grant to launch its Justice Bus program. The bus is used to connect South Dakotans with legal aid for civil cases, such as custody, abuse and neglect, or protection orders.
The money came from the Commission on Equal Access to Our Courts, which awards grants funded by a $25 filing fee applied to some court documents.
An inability to access civil legal aid has consequences for South Dakotans, said Jana Gray, director of development and special projects for Dakota Plains.

“They might not be able to gain custody of their children, get a protection order or they might just give up,” Gray said.
The bus has stopped in Pierre, Winner, Gregory and other rural towns in western South Dakota. Gray said the organization plans to attend tribal powwows, known as wacipis in Dakota, Lakota and Nakota, and other community events this summer.
So far, the nonprofit has collected five applications for legal aid at community stops this year. That’s promising, Gray said.
People can fill out applications and receive legal aid on the spot, inside the outfitted vehicle. Gray hopes to regularly schedule visits to communities in the future and provide clinics on specific, prevalent legal issues in a community.
The Justice Bus will be at Eagle Butte’s Hometown Days on July 17, according to the Dakota Plains Legal Services calendar.

One less-known, missing part of many of these communities is legal representation, Peters said, which leaves people without recourse to handle problems of that nature or even the knowledge of when a lawyer is needed.
Peters, joined by two ISU students and future lawyers, conducted a study into lawyer shortages across the U.S. to identify where there is most need and go over practiced and possible solutions to ensure even those living in remote areas have access to the legal help they need.
“Not having enough lawyers puts rural people at a disadvantage because the legal system only really works if you have a lawyer that can either assert your rights or (provide) a mechanism to seek redress,” Peters said.

Emma Bartling graduated from ISU in the spring with a degree in agricultural and rural policy studies, and has enrolled in the University of South Dakota for law school with hopes of returning her home turf in Hardin County to practice. Emily Meyer still has one year of school left before graduation, but Bartling said both of them hope to return to rural areas to practice when they’re ready.

With this in mind, Bartling said she and Meyer got involved in the study to further their understanding of what they were getting into and why others weren’t following their path.
“To us, it was just an opportunity to better our learning and to kind of open a door that we would be going into, but just a little bit sooner,” Bartling said.
Peters was researching population decline in small towns when he came across the lack of private-practice attorneys, even in county seats where many residents go for their health care needs and other services they can’t find in their area.
Rather than just looking at the total population of counties and comparing it to the number of lawyers practicing there, Peters said they used 2022 Census data to find out how many private-practice attorneys are located in each county and held it up to estimated demand for their services. These numbers helped determine if a legal desert exists in a given county and how severe it is.
Looking at more than 2,300 counties across the U.S., the study found that 11% of rural counties are critical legal deserts, with the largest gap between lawyer supply and demand for their services.
One example Peters gave was of Lee County — Iowa’s only county listed as a critical legal desert — where he said around 30 lawyers are practicing. Based on the county’s town populations, employers and other factors, the researchers found the county should have closer to 55 lawyers. Lee County is a “micropolitan county,” Peters said, as it has at least one town of between 10,000 and 50,000 people.
The majority of Iowa counties in the study were classified as having average levels of lawyers or higher, according to the study, with 10 counties identified as having emerging legal deserts. Most of these cases are in southern Iowa, Peters said, where farmland is less expensive and areas are more impoverished.

Bartling said that many counties with legal deserts are clustered together, so those looking for a lawyer might need to travel even farther. This could be especially scary and difficult to deal with for those experiencing domestic violence and the like.
“If those micropolitans, even, don’t have enough lawyers, then that just puts rural counties adjacent to that micropolitan (at an) even bigger disadvantage,” Peters said.
It surprised Peters to learn this, he said, and another shock came when the team learned pay for lawyers in rural areas was fairly similar no matter whether they were practicing in a legal desert or not, and the real pay gap is between urban and rural practices. This shows that using financial incentives to move lawyers into rural markets wouldn’t be very effective, he said.
Bartling and Meyer also looked into existing policy to try and solve this problem and identified their own solution.
Finding solutions to fill the gap
Legal work is not the first thing people think of when they think of industry workforce shortages, Peters said, and in reality it is quite different from what is being experienced in the fields of health care and manufacturing, among others. There are surpluses of lawyers in some urban areas, and there is no federal push to address the issue.
South Dakota has seen success from a rural attorney recruitment program, Bartling said, which lets law students practice in rural counties before they have completed their schooling. The program has seen success, she said, but it won’t fit in every situation, just like other initiatives the team reviewed, like mobile legal clinics and external fellowship programs.
One program they identified as viable is a licensed legal paraprofessional program, Bartling said, where the state would allow those with legal training but not a full degree to practice independently in certain areas, like family law.
It would allow people from rural communities who have some legal training but another profession to fill a need without having to leave for years to get the highest licensure, and still be able to complete their other work when legal help isn’t needed, Peters said.
“I think it’s definitely up to states discretion how they want to implement it, but we saw that that would probably have the most impact, direct impact to the rural community members,” Bartling said.

DemasA barge that has twice sunk into Lake Michigan, has been successfully relocated, the Michigan Department of Attorney General announced Thursday, laying to rest years of environmental concerns and legal proceedings. 
The barge’s owner, Donald Lewis Balcom, 90, of Traverse City, pled guilty last April in the 13th Circuit Court in Leelanau County to one count of Water Resources Protection Violation for Discharge of Injurious Substances to Waters of the State, a two-year felony. The charge stemmed from an incident in November 2020, when the barge sank and released oil into Lake Michigan. 
Under a deferred sentencing agreement, Balcom was given until June 27, 2025 to relocate the barge to a legal location, converting his felony conviction into a one count of Watercraft Pollution – Littering from Vessel, a misdemeanor punishable by up to 92 days in jail. 
According to a press release from Attorney General Dana Nessel. On June 23, the barge was moved to a legal location in West Grand Traverse Bay and has been partially dismantled over the past week. It no longer resides on the state-owned bottomlands of Lake Michigan. 
“After years of environmental concerns and legal proceedings, I am pleased the barge has finally been moved and to announce the resolution of this case,” Nessel said in a statement. “We have made it abundantly clear that the bay cannot be treated as a personal junkyard. My department remains committed to working with the Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy to protect the Great Lakes whenever they come under threat.”
While Balcom is entitled to a reduced sentence, the Court has yet to amend its ruling, according to the department.

(Photo by Mary Swander)Buggyland will never be Buggyland again. The New Order Amish bishop has lifted the ban on bicycles and a wave of motion has washed over us all.
For a hundred years, both the Old Order Amish, the more conservative sect, and the New Order Amish, the more liberal, shunned cars and trucks, sticking solely to their horses and buggies. The Amish drove two-seater and four-seater buggies, one horse or two. They also drove carts with plexiglass enclosures during the bitterly cold winter months. Often, they rode bareback down the road.
Many of the Amish horses were retired harness racing Standardbreds with sleek musculature. They rounded curves with speed and finesse. The horses came to Buggyland with names like Electrify, Speed Demon, and Devil in the Details, soon to take on more Amish horse names like Toby, Stormy, or Harley, adapting to the slower pace of life around here.
The Buggyland Amish also have small tractors and riding lawnmowers. They are not against technology. They are just against technology that will strain family bonds. So, they take the rubber off the wheels of these vehicles and drive on the rims. That way their teenage sons can’t skip chores and drive their tractors to town to hang out with their friends.
And as nostalgic as we might find buggies, you do have to feed and care for the horses, take the time to hitch up your rig, and often take your life in your hands at night when you hope that cars will see your lights and your slow-moving vehicle sign. Lights? Lights, you ask? How do lights work without an electrical system? The Amish often place a solar panel on the roof of the buggy, running a wire to a battery, providing power to red flashing lights.
“In Indiana, they can just hop on their bikes and zip down the road,” my Amish neighbors have complained over and over again through the years. “And all the roads are black-topped there. Here, we have to just ride in our buggies and choke down the dust on the gravel roads.”
In the Amish world, Indiana is the equivalent of California. Shipshewanna might as well be Berkeley, a progressive place where the rules are looser and the living is easier. On a drive through Elkhart County, Indiana, you might see Amish with gas grills and boats parked in the yard. Men might work in a factory instead of on a farm and wear running shoes instead of work boots. And, of course, they all ride bikes.
So, the New Order moved themselves a little closer to Indiana by allowing bicycles. And the Old Order was left to try to enforce the old rules. A couple of years ago, I watched those New Order bicycles begin to roll down the road, baskets and carriers hitched to the back, holding everything from groceries to babies. The Old Order bounced along in their buggies. About six months later, the bikes picked up speed. Wow, look at them pedaling now! They’re moving. Then I realized they weren’t pedaling. They were now riding e-bikes!

Soon, a local Amish man opened a shop, that sold e-bikes and accessories. Our city council adapted our light posts with plugs. The Amish rode their bikes downtown to recharge. Others bought self-charging bikes. I thought the whole endeavor looked like fun, so right about that same time, I bought a nice new recliner chair to crash in after I’d ridden my nice new e-bike. Only one complaint: coasting along the back roads, I wished for a little less dust.
It was a particularly dusty day when Leah Kauffman stopped by and asked if I could quickly run her to her in-laws’ house and back.
“I’m happy to do that,” I said, “as long as it’s a quick trip. I am really behind in my garden.”
Leah looked out on my weedy garden plot, her forehead wrinkling. Weeds were sprouting everywhere — in the walkways between the rows, around the garden fence, in the buckets I use to grow my potatoes.
We struck a bargain. I would drive Leah. On the way home, we would pick up her children and they would all help me in the garden.
Deal. Four children under the age of 11 tumbled out of my car and I equipped them with hoes, rakes and shovels from my garden shed/greenhouse.
Slam, bam. The children pulled the pigweed from the flower bed and hauled it to the compost pile. They dug out pesky burdock root. They yanked the quack grass out of the hosta bed, then mulched with wood chips transported by the garden cart. I wouldn’t have made that much progress in such a short amount of time if I’d hired a dozen English adults.
Assigned tasks completed, the smallest child stopped and looked at me. “Was Kann ich tun? (What can I do?)”
“You can help me plant that clematis that I bought,” I said, climbing up on a step stool in the greenhouse to give the other plants there an extra shot of water, a few drops dribbling down on his head.
“Getauft (Baptized)!” he said.
His older brothers were climbing all over my e-bike, feet on pedals, hands on the gears of the forbidden item.
Uh, oh, I thought. Their mother isn’t going to like this.
“Okay, boys,” Leah called them off the bike, and the boys jumped off immediately, their faces falling in disappointment.
We drifted into the house for a drink of water, Leah remaining outside to weed the herb bed.
“Whoa,” Annie, the oldest girl said. She’d discovered my new recliner and hopped in, instantly finding the control wand. “What does this do?”

I glanced out the window. Whew. Leah was well out of hearing range. This chair was electric and I didn’t see much difference between it and the e-bike. I could be corrupting these kids. But they wouldn’t be driving to town in it. And they were having so much fun…
“Okay, go ahead and press the top button,” I said.
The chair tilted back, Annie’s eyes opening wide.
“Now press the next button.” Ever so slowly, the footrest rose up.
The three boys were mesmerized. They jumped into the recliner and all four children held onto each other, giggling and throwing back their heads, their eyes growing round.
“Take it up,” I told Annie.
She’d quickly understood the controls. The whole chair rose up into the air, then down again. Then the back arched forward and back, forward and back, the footrest tilting the whole recliner into the air as if it were flying in space, the giggling rising into the stratosphere.
“Mom!” one of the boys called.
Oh, no, I thought.
“Mom,” another boy called. “Come here.”
Now, what was I going to do?
Leah was in the house. She wasn’t smiling.
I could be in trouble.
“Mom, try the chair,” Annie said, all the children scampering out.
Slowly, Leah sat down in the chair. Then Annie pressed the controls, and Leah’s head tilted back. Another press and Leah’s legs rose. A faint smile graced her lips. Leah relaxed into the cushions, the tension draining from her muscles, her body limp and loose. Her eyes closed. Her mouth dropped open, exhaling one long breath. “Ahhhhhhhhh.”

The idea, which has long been championed by a Bozeman nonprofit, is part of preliminary 2026 budget documents for the Department of the Interior that simultaneously includes vast budget cuts for various departments, including the National Park Service.
The National Park Service budget shows a request for just $2.1 billion, cutting roughly a third of the agency’s 2025 budget.
But among the streamlining efforts listed in the budget documents, the federal government is proposing to establish a new fee for foreign visitors to some NPS sites, estimated to generate upwards of $90 million “to keep national parks beautiful.”

“An international surcharge is a compelling point because you can raise prices for that cohort, who by definition are spending a lot of money to travel to our country to see these ‘bucket-list’ destinations,” said Tate Watkins, a research fellow at the Property and Environment Research Center. “If you think of the overall trip budget, the gate fee is a small portion of that. It isn’t likely to deter a huge number of people.”
Last year was the busiest on record for the NPS, with more than 331 million visitors spending time at the 433 NPS units, including historic sites, battlefields and monuments, in addition to the 63 national parks.
The increased traffic at the nation’s crown jewels have added to a deferred maintenance backlog of nearly $23 billion to maintain roads, buildings, utility systems and other facilities across the park system.
One method to address that backlog at individual park sites is to consider changing the fee structure charged for visitors at the entrance gates.
Only 106 of the 433 sites managed by the NPS charge entrance fees, ranging from $10 per person to $35 per vehicle, with annual pass options available. There is no differentiation between U.S. residents and foreign visitors.
Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said during a House Committee on Natural Resources hearing earlier this month that the Park Service is “way undercharging” international visitors.
“We’ve done a study on what gets charged if you’re going to go see the gorillas in Rwanda or go to the Galapagos Islands … there could be a billion-dollar revenue opportunity, without discouraging visitors,” Burgum said. “That revenue, if it could be redirected back towards deferred maintenance, staffing, a number of things we could do, that would be fantastic.”
The Galapagos Islands cost $200 for foreign tourists, while Ecuadorian adults pay $30.

Watkins said PERC, a Bozeman-based a “free market environmentalism” nonprofit think-tank, has advocated for changes to the NPS fee structure for years.
“There’s a lot of common models where we do this kind of thing anyway,” he said.
Watkins pointed to states that charge different resident and nonresident fees for hunting and fishing licenses and similar structures for accessing state parks.
In Montana, residents pay a $9 fee with their annual vehicle registration, which covers access to all state parks for the year. Nonresidents, however, are charged an $8 daily entrance fee with a vehicle ($4 to walk or bike in) or $50 for an annual pass. Camping at a state park costs $12 more per night for nonresidents.
The same model could easily be applied nationally.
“The status quo is not one of sustainable and proper management of these sites,” Watkins told the Daily Montanan. “The current model just doesn’t keep up with it.”
In a report released in 2023, Watkins looked at potential revenue streams from charging international visitors additional fees.
Using NPS data showing baseline entry fee revenue of $349 million, PERC calculated a $16, $25 and $40 surcharge for foreign visitors, with an estimate that the surcharge would correspond with a roughly 3% decrease in visitation.
The smallest surcharge would generate an additional $211 million annually, while the highest would bring in $528 million — more than doubling the current revenue.
The current system is relatively blunt — there are lots of margins you can refine in a logical way,” Watkins said. “That’s where I think you can see big changes happen.”
 Doubling Yellowstone’s fee revenue

A new report, authored by University of Wyoming economist Steve Newbold and published by PERC last week, focused on that nation’s oldest national park, Yellowstone, which saw 4.7 million visitors last year, roughly 15% of which came from other countries.

The park’s entry fee is $35 per vehicle, per week, with 80% of fee revenues retained at the park to be spent on visitor experience improvements. Park Service data shows entry fees generated roughly $14.2 million annually for the park in recent years.
The report looked at six different fee structure scenarios and compared the elasticity of demand — how much impact a higher fee will have on visitation — with the increased revenue.
Scenarios included charging all visitors an additional $5 to enter the park; exempting locals but charging all other visitors an extra $10; and various levels of international fees.
Charging foreign visitors a $20 surcharge is estimated to decrease visitation by 13,000, but generate an additional $11.9 million — an 84% increase from 2024 gate revenue.
Bumping the international fee to $100 per person would rake in $55.2 million, with a roughly 57,000 decrease in visitors.
Adding just a $5 per person fee to all visitors to Yellowstone would more than double the revenue from entrance fees.
“In some places you’re hard pressed to find a cup of coffee for five dollars,” Watkins said.
And while that doesn’t make up for the park’s $1.5 billion maintenance backlog — the most of any national park according to the report — it would help, Watkins said.
“I think you could probably ask the superintendent, and he’d say if we can get closer to the maintenance backlog with fee revenue, that would be great,” he said.
Watkins said that PERC is excited that the federal government is considering different models of fees for national parks, and that it might take some time to get it right.
“You’re probably not going to get something that works perfectly the first time,” he said.
But the whole point is the status quo is not sustainable, Watkins said, and the agencies in charge need to think about what they can do to put the future of the park system in a better position.

“A well-funded park that can maintain its trails, protect its wildlife, and conserve its natural wonders will continue drawing visitors for generations—securing the economic lifeline that sustains surrounding communities,” the report states. “The choice is between short-term thinking and long-term prosperity for both the park and the region.”

LAKE PROVIDENCE, La. — East Carroll Parish sits in the northeastern corner of Louisiana, along the winding Mississippi River. Its seat, Lake Providence, was a thriving agricultural center of the Delta. Now, the town is a shell of its former self. Charred and dilapidated buildings dot the small city center. There are a few gas stations, a handful of restaurants — and little to no industry.
Mayor Bobby Amacker, 79, says at one point “you couldn’t even walk down the street” in Lake Providence’s main business district because “there were so many people.”
“It’s gone down tremendously in the last 50 years,” said Amacker, a Democrat. “The town, it looks like it’s drying up. And it’s almost unstoppable, as far as I can tell.”
Now, East Carroll residents stand to lose even more. Like many people in Louisiana, they received a lifeline when the state expanded Medicaid to more low-income adults in 2016. Expansion drove Louisiana’s uninsured rate to the lowest in the Deep South, at 8% in 2023 for working-age adults, according to state data, despite it having the highest poverty rate in the U.S. that year.

This week, Congress approved President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful” tax and spending bill. It includes more than $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, the joint state-federal health insurance program for poor families and individuals, to help pay for tax cuts that mostly benefit the rich. The legislation would cause 11.8 million more Americans to become uninsured by 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
The bill includes new work rules for Medicaid recipients and would require them to verify their eligibility more frequently. It also would limit a financing strategy that states have used to boost Medicaid payments to hospitals.
Republicans say enrollees are taking advantage of the Medicaid program and getting benefits when they shouldn’t be. They say the program costs too much and states are not paying their fair share.
The Delta region, which includes communities in both Louisiana and Mississippi, would suffer under such large cuts. But in Louisiana — where almost half of the state depended on Medicaid in 2023, the Louisiana Department of Health reported — the cuts could be ruinous. Louisiana could lose up to $35 billion in federal Medicaid support over the next decade, according to KFF, a health policy research group. Mississippi, which never expanded Medicaid, could still lose up to $5 billion.
Residents are watching with apprehension, fear and, sometimes, anger, wondering how Congress could be so blind to how much they are struggling.
“If they take that away from us and everyone that really needs it, that’s going to be bad,” said Sherila Ervin, who lives 20 minutes up the road from Lake Providence in Oak Grove and has Medicaid coverage.

Medicaid work requirements and other health care provisions in the bill ignore the reality of living in poorer rural communities, where people struggle to find the jobs, transportation and internet access required to meet the rules, according to interviews with people and providers in the Delta region.
Even though Louisiana and Mississippi have taken very different approaches to Medicaid — one expanded eligibility under the 2010 Affordable Care Act and the other didn’t — both rely heavily on the program to sustain access to medical care for all their residents.
On a hot summer day in June, Ervin walks into the bare-bones 99-cent store in downtown Lake Providence. As she looks over some clothing, she says she’s heard about the potential Medicaid cuts. But she hadn’t heard about the work requirements, and is shocked they’re even on the table.
“I don’t like that. I don’t think they should put a stipulation on that,” Ervin says, exasperated that she would have to report her work hours. It’s hard enough as it is, she says, to thrive in this community.

Ervin, 58, has been working at Oak Grove High School in the cafeteria, serving hot plates to children for two decades. She says it’s one of the good, steady jobs available in this area, but her income is only around $1,500 per month.
Ervin’s job offers health benefits, but she can’t afford the premiums on her salary. She relies on Medicaid for care, including medications for her high blood pressure.
In East Carroll Parish, around 46.5% of people live below the poverty level, meaning the area is overwhelmingly poor, at over four times the national poverty rate, with a median income of $28,321. For Black households, the figure is a mere $16,690.
Expansion was a lifeline for people such as Ervin. Louisiana offers Medicaid to people who earn below 138% of the federal poverty line — currently about $22,000 a year for an individual.
“Sometimes you can work, but then when you work, you still can’t pay to get help,” Ervin said.
It’s a similar economic situation an hour away across the river. Poverty is about three times the national rate in Washington County, Mississippi, where residents in the city of Greenville lament the consequences of not being able to avoid destructive medical debt, which can keep them stuck in a cycle of gig work and of living paycheck to paycheck.
Greenville, the county seat, is among the fastest-shrinking cities in the U.S. It’s still one of the larger rural cities in Mississippi, with coffee shops, restaurants, hotels, a regional hospital and several big-box stores. But the downtown has just a few small businesses and a bank, and residents say jobs are hard to find.
Greenville resident April McNair, 45, remembers giving birth 17 years ago, long before Mississippi extended postpartum Medicaid to a full year. She had Medicaid coverage during pregnancy, but was kicked off shortly after giving birth, despite having post-delivery complications.

The result was a trip to the emergency room and a $2,500 bill she couldn’t cover. Right after giving birth, McNair looked for work. She said potential employers often told her that she was overqualified because she had a master’s degree.
“I had to kind of figure out how to make my ends meet,” McNair said. “I ended up with a significant bill, all because I did not have Medicaid.”
McNair feels like Mississippi leaders are making a mistake by continuing to reject full Medicaid expansion.
“That’s a selfish move. To me, they’re selfish,” McNair said, adding that now she’s worried for neighbors in Louisiana who may lose the lifeline she wishes she had.
“God forbid, hypothetically speaking, what if one of them meets their demise because of this bill that [Congress] passed?”

Hard to thrive

Mississippi experienced its first taste of equalized access to medicine in the late 1960s.
Delta Health Center, the first federally funded health center in the nation, opened during the peak of the Civil Rights Movement in the all-Black town of Mound Bayou, about an hour north of Greenville. The center vowed to care for anyone regardless of race or ability to pay in a region plagued with poverty, poor health and discrimination — and continues to do so to this day.
It was a significant opportunity for generations of African Americans who had gone without health care, in a place where people had no access to clean drinking water, running sewage systems or even food, said Robin Boyles, chief program planning and development officer at Delta Health Center.
But it wasn’t easy for the clinic to mobilize support, even though it was clearly needed. Before its opening, it faced pushback from politicians and even doctors. In a 1966 clipping from a local newspaper, the white-owned Bolivar Commercial, the editorial board railed against the new clinic, saying it would “lead further to socialized medicine.”

The situation is certainly better in Mississippi and Louisiana than it was in the 1960s, but critics say the Medicaid cuts could reverse hard-fought progress.
People who live in the Delta are fiercely proud of their communities, but conditions there make it hard to thrive.
Black residents, who are the overwhelming majority, have had a particularly hard time. After the Civil War, many were relegated to sharecropping of cotton and corn for subsistence. Meanwhile, an elite white class of plantation owners and investors amassed enormous amounts of wealth.
A 2001 report from the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights described the area as one with “limited economic resources; inadequate employment opportunities; insufficient decent, affordable housing; and poor quality public schools.”
“We have a lot of patients that are one health issue away from either being out of a job or being bankrupt because of a trip to the emergency room,” said Dr. Brent Smith, a physician at a primary care clinic at Delta Health System in Greenville.
Even some of the most vulnerable people, such as new moms in Mississippi, still struggle to get basic care, in part because the state has left billions of dollars in federal funding for Medicaid expansion on the table, said Dr. Lakeisha Richardson, an OB-GYN at Delta Health System.
“There are a lot of maternal [care] deserts in Mississippi where women have to travel 60 miles or more just to get prenatal care and just to get to the closest hospital for delivery,” Richardson said. “And I don’t see that getting any better in Mississippi and in rural areas.”
Richardson says nearly all her patients are working moms, many of whom would really benefit from having Medicaid expansion.
“America doesn’t realize that there are people out here struggling for no reason of their own,” she said.
That’s why Medicaid expansion in Louisiana in 2016, much like the community health center movement in Mississippi, was a bright spot in the rural South, said Smith.
“Louisiana expanded Medicaid, a surprising move in the South to see any state expand,” Smith said. “They saw it for what it was, which was a very real opportunity to assist this specific group of patients.”

In Mississippi, 20 rural hospitals are at immediate risk of closure, according to a recent report, more than double the number at risk in Louisiana. In many cases, Medicaid is the largest and most reliable payer for rural hospitals. While Louisiana’s overall uninsured rate plummeted to 8.3% by 2023, in Mississippi it was 10.5%.
“Unlike a lot of our Southern peers, we have not had the same level of closures of facilities,” said Courtney Foster, senior policy adviser for Medicaid, with the nonprofit Invest in Louisiana.
“Medicaid was like a real lifeline for people in transition. Oftentimes it was people who had lost their jobs and were just looking to get back on their feet.”
Now, the new work and reporting requirements could put that progress at risk.

In East Carroll Parish, finding a job — let alone a good-paying one with health benefits — is difficult, says Rosie Brown, executive director at the East Carroll Community Action Agency, a nonprofit that helps low-income people with their rent and utility bills. Many of the jobs available in town pay minimum wage, just $7.25 an hour.
Brown loves living in Lake Providence; this is where her family is. She doesn’t want to move but wishes the government would invest more in her community — not take away benefits that help people who are hanging on by a thread.
“We have one bank. We have one supermarket,” she said. “Transportation isn’t easy either.”
Local infrastructure is so limited, she’s even heard of some people charging residents $20 for a ride to Walmart. Some people have to hitch a ride an hour away to go to work, she said.
“There’s nowhere to go,” Brown said.
Dominique Jones works at the local library, where she helps roughly 75 to 85 people per month apply for programs such as Medicaid and food assistance. Many of the residents she helps don’t have access to the internet or even a computer, a real barrier for people who’d be required to report their working hours to state Medicaid officials.
“This town right here is made up of a lot of old people that need Medicaid and Medicare. And without it, they wouldn’t have any kind of health care at all,” Mayor Amacker said.
  Dilapidated buildings dot downtown Lake Providence, La. (Shalina Chatlani/Stateline)
Even a job in local government in Lake Providence doesn’t offer affordable health insurance.
Nevada Qualls, 25, sits across from Amacker’s office. She earns just $12 an hour as a cashier at city hall. The low pay means she qualifies for Medicaid expansion coverage, which is good because she can’t afford the premiums for private insurance.
“I feel like there should be a higher threshold for people that can get Medicaid, because they’re still struggling,” she said.
At the 99-cent store, school district worker Ervin wonders whether state and federal leaders understand what it’s like to live in her community, urging them to visit and see for themselves.
“They want to do stuff for the rich people that’s already rich,” she said. “What are they doing? It’s almost like there’s no common sense with them.”

‘The tremble factors’

While leaders in the U.S. Senate were working into the night this past weekend debating Trump’s tax and spending bill, Greenville resident Jennifer Morris was praying for the pain to stay away.
Morris, 44, has hemicrania continua, a headache disorder that causes constant pain on one side of her head. There’s no underlying trigger and no cure. Her doctors help her keep the pain to a minimum with regular treatments that include dozens of injections into her head.
“It doesn’t take the pain away,” she said during a late-night gathering in Greenville’s Greater Mount Olivet Missionary Baptist Church in June. “It does reduce the pain so that I’m able to function. But it’s rough.”

Morris is worried about the looming Medicaid cuts. She qualifies for Mississippi Medicaid because her condition counts as a disability, and she depends on the coverage to afford her medications.
Morris’ Medicaid may be safer than that of her Delta neighbors in Lake Providence, as some of the most dramatic Medicaid changes being considered — such as work requirements — target Medicaid expansion states only.
But Mississippi could be hurt by a provision in the Senate bill that would target a strategy states have used to boost the Medicaid dollars they get from the federal government.
Mississippi could see a major hit to its Medicaid funds, which “would be a tremendous decrease in revenue for the state,” harming “services and access to care,” says Mitchell Adcock, executive director at the Center for Mississippi Health Policy.
“It would be just the opposite of expansion. It would be a contraction for the Medicaid program in the state,” he said.
Leonard Favorite, a pastor who was attending the same event at Mount Olivet Church, as Morris, says he grew up on a plantation in Louisiana and worked his way out of poverty by joining the Air Force. This type of journey is hard, he said, when you’re already starting from so far behind. He thinks the “big, beautiful bill” will create more roadblocks for poor people.

“You have people who are already living below the poverty line and they will certainly be submerged into poverty at unspeakable levels,” said Favorite, 70.“ That seems to be the trend of this administration from the point of view of looking from the outside.
“Poor people are beginning to feel the tremble factors of an administration that caters toward the rich.”
National researchers estimate that up to 132,000 Louisianans who gained health insurance under expansion could lose it under work rules.
But national reports that rely on census data likely underestimate the potential Medicaid losses. For example, while 2023 census data show 47% of East Carroll Parish was on Medicaid, state health data reviewed by Stateline and Public Health Watch suggests the number is more like 64%. Similarly statewide, census data showed about a third of Louisianans were on Medicaid. State data shows that percentage is closer to 46.5%.
Experts such as Joan Alker at the Georgetown Center for Children and Families say the undercounts nationally are a well-known issue among researchers, but it’s difficult to correct because the quality of state reporting can be so uneven.
State Medicaid funding is also at risk. For years, both Mississippi and Louisiana have relied on revenue generated through a financing tool — known as a provider tax — to draw down more federal dollars and boost Medicaid reimbursements to providers. But congressional Republicans hope to limit states’ ability to collect those taxes.
Depending on how Congress restricts provider taxes, Mississippi could lose hundreds of millions in federal Medicaid funding, crucial in a state with such a high uninsured rate, said Richard Roberson, president and CEO of the Mississippi Hospital Association.
“It’s unavoidable that when you’re taking that much money out of the system, that there’s not going to be some repercussions felt even in non-Medicaid expansion states like Mississippi,” Roberson said.
Last week, the Louisiana Hospital Association signed a statement calling the package of Medicaid cuts before Congress “historic in their devastation.”
From her small, sunny office in East Carroll Parish, nurse Jennifer Newton can’t understand the attacks on Medicaid.
Newton, who grew up one parish over in West Carroll, is executive director of the Family Medical Clinic, a community health center in Lake Providence and one of the few health providers in town. She says 50% of the clinic’s patients have Medicaid insurance.

Newton has worked in health care in the area for decades and watched as Medicaid expansion made it possible for more patients to access and afford health care they desperately needed, including preventive services. “It’s absolutely helped,” she said. “Absolutely.”
In 2015, the year before Louisiana expanded Medicaid, the uninsured rate among working-age adults in East Carroll Parish was nearly 35%. By 2021, that number was 12.7%.
“Why are we going back?” Newton asked. “We’ve made so much progress.”
Republican supporters of work requirements, including Louisiana representative and U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, argue they will encourage people to find jobs and ensure Medicaid goes to people who need it most. But according to KFF, a majority of Louisiana adults with Medicaid — 69% — already work.
Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that is working with Republicans to formulate Medicaid cuts, is not concerned about eligible people losing coverage, as has happened under previous work requirement efforts. He says the bill has built in exceptions for certain people and requirements “can be met by not just work,” so “concerns seem pretty overstated.”
Medicaid recipients also can meet the requirement by volunteering or attending school for 80 hours per month.
“It’s hard for me to understand that there are areas in the country where there’s not jobs. There’s always work to be done,” Blase told Stateline. Blase said he believes Medicaid is “the government conditioning welfare for able-bodied working-age adults.”

But advocates and experts predict East Carroll, where internet access is notoriously bad, would experience results similar to when Arkansas instituted Medicaid work requirements in 2018: People disenrolled because of lack of awareness and confusion over the policy, as well as paperwork errors — not because they weren’t working enough.
“Unless the beneficiary can navigate that red tape, they’re going to lose coverage and become uninsured,” said Benjamin Sommers, a health economist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
Data shows Arkansas’ experiment did not increase employment, Sommers said, and instead led to more people reporting medical debt and delaying care because of cost.

‘Take a step back’

People in the Delta — where the legacy of government neglect and discrimination are all around — want politicians to visit their towns and see the barriers people face trying to improve their lives and stay healthy.
“People spent their lives uninsured,” said Amy Hale, a nurse practitioner at East Carroll Medical clinic. “Medicaid expansion allowed them to get in here and be treated.”
Lake Providence residents are scared they may find themselves in a similar situation as McNair and other people across the river in Greenville: working, uninsured, and too poor to access health care.
Recent estimates show up to 317,000 Louisianans could lose Medicaid health insurance under Trump’s tax bill. Nearly 33,000 in Mississippi.
“People are actually trying,” McNair said. “I really wish [lawmakers] would look at it from a different lens. What if it was their kid? Or they didn’t have the salaries they have now and your baby is ill. … Like really take a step back and think about what it is that you’re doing.”

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota lawmakers plan to hold a security hearing with the North Dakota Highway Patrol and Capitol Security to discuss the safety concerns of legislators after Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman, and her husband Mark, were killed June 14 in their Brooklyn Park home.
Law enforcement arrested and charged Vance Boelter in connection with the crimes. Boelter is also accused of shooting and seriously wounding state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, at their home in Champlin. A list of dozens of Democratic lawmakers, who were believed to have also been targets, was found inside Boelter’s vehicle at the Hortman residence.
During a meeting of the Legislative Management Committee last month, John Bjornson, director of Legislative Council, told lawmakers the issue would be added to the agenda of the first meeting of the Legislative Procedure and Arrangements Committee.

Legislative Council removed the home addresses of North Dakota lawmakers from their biographical websites immediately after the attacks occurred.
“I have had no great rush of people saying, ‘Put my address back up on the webpage,’ I believe once we probably have the time to catch our breath … that maybe we’ll open that discussion and we can make it optional,” Bjornson said during the meeting.
During each organizational session, prior to the convening of the full Legislature, Bjornson said Legislative Council asks lawmakers what kind of contact information they would like to appear on their webpages.

“I think everybody will take a much more serious look at what that is,” he said.
Senate Minority Leader Sen. Kathy Hogan, D-Fargo, said she hoped to include the Bureau of Criminal Investigation in any security discussions because the assailant was dressed as a member of law enforcement.
“They were responding to a law enforcement person at the door, which we would all open the door, if a cop was at the front door,” Hogan said.
Sen. Ronald Sorvaag, R-Fargo, said he worries about his wife, who lives at his formerly publicized address, while he stays in Bismarck for four months during the legislative session.
“This openness, there’s just got to be some reality check because as that tragedy showed, we’re putting others at risk besides the elected officials,” Sorvaag said. “We can’t get it perfect … but let’s not make it too easy for them is what’s got to be important.”
Sen. David Hogue, R-Minot, chair of the Legislative Management Committee, said he hopes those discussions about security will point out “weak links” in the security of lawmakers and they can address them without limiting accessibility and transparency.
No date has been scheduled for the first meeting of the interim Legislative Procedures and Arrangements Committee.

Althea Gibson became the first African American to win the women’s singles title at Wimbledon and became the top female tennis player in the world. Just six years earlier, she had become the first black player to compete at Wimbledon. 
Born in South Carolina, she grew up in Harlem, where she loved table tennis. A local musician invited her to play tennis, and she became so talented that a year later, she won a local tournament sponsored by the American Tennis Association (formed by African Americans), later winning 12 ATA titles in just 13 years. 
Despite her talent, much of the tennis world remained closed off to her. The breakthrough came in 1950 when tennis legend Alice Marble lambasted the sport for barring Gibson from the world’s best tournaments. The tennis world opened its doors, and Gibson became a Top 10 player in the U.S. 
In 1956, she won the French Open. After winning both the women’s singles and doubles at Wimbledon in 1957, she was welcomed with a ticker tape parade in New York City. She went on to win 56 singles and doubles championships before turning pro in 1959. 
Although she declared that she never considered herself a crusader, there is no question that she opened the doors for many others. She even tried golf, becoming the first black woman to compete on the pro tour. 
After she retired, she was inducted in 1971 into the International Tennis Hall of Fame. She died in 2003 at the age of 77. In 2013, the U.S. Postal Service issued a stamp in her honor.

Massachusetts would do substantially more to reduce carbon emissions if it invested in an electric regional rail system with 15-30 minute frequencies that enabled more people to take the train rather than drive.
The post Why the MBTA’s electric bus mandate is a bad idea appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","THE OFFICIAL POLICY of the Commonwealth, enshrined in law by a well-intentioned Legislature, is that the MBTA cannot purchase any new bus other than an electric bus beginning January 1, 2031, and the T is further directed to operate only electric buses as of January 1, 2041.  
These directives may seem far off, but in the world of transit operations and the time it takes to procure and test equipment and make it ready for service, and build the new garages necessary to house and charge them, these deadlines are imminent. They were part of a larger bill aimed at “driving clean energy” in the Commonwealth. 
The bus mandate is a laudable goal, to be sure, but one that fundamentally misunderstands the significant constraints that have been placed on the US electric bus marketplace. Those constraints place the MBTA, and every other US transit agency pursuing a similar policy, in the position of being forced to purchase the wrong vehicles at the wrong price at the wrong time. 
I am not opposed to the transition to electric vehicles, whether they are buses or private passenger vehicles. Indeed, I view this transition as a necessary, if not inevitable, long-term change in the way we power most forms of mobility.  
Many people are looking forward to a day when we are free from the negative externalities of the current fossil fuel system. Long-time environmental advocate Seth Kaplan recently offered his vision for a future in which electric buses also play an outsized role in stabilizing the power grid.  
I do not question his or others’ enthusiasm, but I think it is important for everyone to have a realistic understanding of bus operations specifically, and the larger landscape of the transition to electric power, because they bear heavily on whether such creative ideas are actionable ideas.  
Specifically with regard to Kaplan’s article, the notion of T bus garages serving as mini power plants misses entirely the way bus transit actually works. The buses he imagines sending power back to the grid during peak power demand hours will, for the most part, be in service during those times, taking people to their destinations. It is not realistic to expect buses to be sitting idle as oversized batteries. Most electric buses will be charged overnight, not at times of peak demand, and I doubt anyone is willing to subsidize, operate, and maintain massive battery storage units, if such units were feasible and available.  
But even if Kaplan’s vision could be achieved, there is a larger concern that must be understood: the underlying assumption that the Commonwealth’s current plan to transition to electric buses on a fairly rapid basis is something that makes sense in this moment, or in the foreseeable future. Unfortunately, that is not the case. The Legislature’s electric bus mandate, in its current iteration, is a great mistake.  
To understand why, it’s important to take a step back and observe the larger transportation decarbonization landscape. The focus on reducing transportation carbon emissions, a large contributor to climate change, has led to many positive initiatives, but it has also contributed to misplaced priorities and flawed policies. Notably, it has ignored other consequences of driving motor vehicles, and those consequences, or “externalities,” have negative impacts on public health, land use, traffic congestion, and a variety of other factors that make up our quality of life.  
Massachusetts’s over-reliance on electric vehicles as a transportation sector solution to carbon emissions stems from the mistaken assumption that the environmental damage caused by cars is attributable predominantly to carbon emissions from internal combustion engine vehicles. This commonly held view ignores the great public health danger posed by all automobiles, including electric vehicles: the generation of particulate matter emissions.  
Particulates are tiny, often invisible fragments or particles generated by activities such tire friction or braking. For all their carbon emissions advantages, EVs will continue to emit particulates in the air. This comes primarily from non-exhaust sources: brake and tire friction, as well as road wear and re-suspended road dust – all of which are exacerbated by the heavier weight of EVs. In Greater Boston, these impacts are heightened in inner core communities like East Boston and Chelsea. 
We ignore the topic of particulate matter at our peril. We know from several studies undertaken since 2020 that long term exposure to particulates causes significant negative impacts on public health. A Harvard Chan School of Public Health study linked long-term exposure to particulates to a 15 percent higher COVID-19 mortality rate.    
Carbon emissions are bad, and they are an issue that has global impact as they influence climate change. Particulate matter emissions are also bad, for different reasons, and they have very specific local public health impacts. Any decarbonization plan that encourages more driving by EVs needs to understand that it is failing to address this critical public health issue.   
Mode shift (getting drivers to reduce driving and shift to public transportation) is a quickly scalable option for both carbon and particulate matter reductions. Mode shift is also largely in the control of the Commonwealth and its transit and transportation agencies, as well as state and local land use and housing policies.  
Mode shift requires more investment in regional rail — a revamped commuter rail system that runs on electric power and provides frequent all-day service — and the Greater Boston subway and bus systems.  
The needed level of investment, however, dwarfs what we are currently doing. Over the next decade, Massachusetts should be spending more on public transportation in Metro Boston than it spends on roads and bridges. That does not mean we should spend less on roads and bridges. It means we should spend more on public transportation, significantly more, in order to achieve long-delayed goals of electric, high-frequency regional rail, subway system connectivity, and accelerated state of good repair. 
All of this bears heavily on the state mandate that the T transition to an all-electric bus fleet on a fairly aggressive timetable. Many well-intentioned lawmakers and others see this as a matter of urgent necessity. They are wrong. There are many reasons why pushing the T toward a very expensive series of investments in equipment, and new garage and charging facilities, all of which are delayed, is a major mistake at this time. Here are three. 
First, the current and foreseeable landscape for US transit agencies seeking to purchase electric bus equipment is not anywhere near what it should be. Here is the dilemma. If the T chooses to use federal money to purchase electric buses, it cannot purchase any bus that comes from (or has parts made in) China. Yet these are the best, least expensive electric buses on the market today and for the foreseeable future. This China ban means that every US transit agency using federal funds is forced to purchase from one vendor, New Flyer.  
This is a classic monopoly marketplace, and you don’t need a degree in economics to understand that such marketplaces do not offer best-value pricing. At a time when the T should be maximizing the use of its financial resources, spending any money on electric buses until we can make purchases of quality equipment in a competitive market makes no fiscal sense.  
Second, most tailpipe carbon emissions are coming from private automobiles, not from T buses. There are over 5 million registered private passenger vehicles powered by internal combustion engines in Massachusetts (as opposed to under 200,000 electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles), so you get a sense of the magnitude of the primary emissions source. Kaplan’s article rightly notes that the MBTA has already taken actions, including moving to compressed natural gas and electric/hybrid buses, that have reduced bus emissions by 90 percent. In this context, buses are inconsequential to the production of harmful emissions in the Commonwealth.  
Third, the capital funds that will have to be spent to meet the legislative directive on electric buses means that the most effective approach to mode shift — regional rail — will continue to lag for want of funding. At a time when the T has acknowledged that its capital needs are significantly underfunded, spending limited resources to support the acquisition and garaging of very expensive electric buses is an irresponsible use of that money.  
Massachusetts would do substantially more to reduce carbon emissions if it invested in an electric regional rail system with 15-30 minute frequencies that enabled more people to take the train rather than drive. The measurable contribution of electric buses to meaningful carbon reductions is miniscule. 
We should stop being beguiled by the shiny object of the electric bus and focus on getting more people to take public transportation. This was the explicit advice offered by Gov. Baker’s Commission on the Future of Transportation. We have never taken that advice, and as a result, we remain stuck with a transport sector decarbonization plan that makes no sense and will not succeed.  
Electric bus fantasies should not be a substitute for intelligent, well-informed public policy. The Legislature needs to relieve the MBTA of its e-bus mandate, and the T needs to start being publicly candid about how terribly misplaced such a mandate is. I know of no major US transit agency leader, and I know many of them personally, who supports a rapid transition to electric bus.  
This would be a good time to set a new agenda for transport sector decarbonization in Massachusetts, one focused more on achievable mode shift and less on a misplaced carbon reduction initiative that, if allowed to continue, will be highly expensive and largely performative.

(Photo courtesy of Connecticut Harm Reduction Alliance, formerly known as Greater Hartford Harm Reduction Coalition)A study published Wednesday in the medical journal JAMA Network Open found that emergency room clinicians were much less likely to refer Black opioid overdose patients for outpatient treatment compared with white patients.
The researchers looked at the medical records of 1,683 opioid overdose patients from emergency rooms in nine states: California, Colorado, Georgia, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Oregon and Pennsylvania.
About 5.7% of Black patients received referrals for outpatient treatment, compared with 9.6% of white patients, according to the researchers, who received a federal grant from the National Institute on Drug Abuse to conduct the analysis.
While the nation saw a decrease in opioid overdose deaths in white people between 2021 and 2022, overdose death rates increased for American Indian, Alaska Native, Asian, Black and Hispanic people. Patients visiting ERs for opioid overdoses are more likely to die from an overdose after the visit, the authors wrote, underscoring the importance of gaining “an improved understanding of disparities in [emergency department] treatment and referral.”
In total, roughly 18% of the patients received a referral for outpatient treatment, 43% received a naloxone kit or prescription, and 8.4% received a prescription for buprenorphine, the first-line medication for treating opioid use disorder.
The researchers used records from 10 hospital sites participating in a national consortium collecting data on overdoses from fentanyl and its related drugs. The patient records were from September 2020 to November 2023.
Another study in JAMA Network Open, released Thursday, found similar disparities: Black and Hispanic patients were significantly less likely than white patients to receive buprenorphine. Black patients had a 17% chance, and Hispanic patients a 16% chance, to be prescribed the therapy, compared with a 20% chance for white patients.
The authors of that study, from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, looked at data from 176,000 records of opioid-related events between 2017 and 2022 across all 50 states.

Doctors knew when the outbreak had started — June 17, 1894 — but they didn’t know what had broken out. 
The symptoms of the many cases erupting in Rutland County that summer varied so much that they made doctors unsure of the diagnosis. A three-year-old boy, labeled Case 1, was a previously healthy, active child who developed a moderate fever and appeared to have indigestion. After three days, his fever broke, but he could no longer walk. After 10 days, he started to move about by holding onto chairs. Then, after three weeks, he regained full use of his legs.
Another child, a six-year-old boy, Case 64, had also been in good health when he developed a high fever, accompanied by vomiting. On the sixth day, he suffered paralysis in his right arm; the next day he could no longer move his left leg. Ten weeks later, he was no better — both extremities were still paralyzed and the muscles were weakening. 
But he was more fortunate than a six-year-old boy, Case 4, who suddenly began convulsing while playing in the street. The convulsions lasted hours. He also exhibited a moderate fever, rapid pulse and vomiting. The muscles in the boy’s neck and back became rigid and his arms and legs became extremely sensitive to the touch. On the sixth day, he died.
The alarming news surely spread more quickly than the disease itself. Newspapers carried brief reports about Vermonters who doctors believed had contracted meningitis. While the papers also covered a number of active epidemics, including smallpox, typhoid and measles, it wasn’t until late August that they connected the dots and reported that these suspected meningitis cases also represented an epidemic.
On Aug. 27, the Rutland Daily Herald reported that doctors believed an epidemic of cerebral meningitis, spinal meningitis and cerebro-spinal meningitis had hit the city and surrounding area. Over the past five weeks, the paper wrote, the outbreak had “been rapidly gaining headway until it has attained serious proportions.”

Fatal cases or ones leading to total paralysis were relatively rare, doctors told the newspaper. However, they noted that many of the infected patients suffered paralysis in at least one limb and “the recovery of the patients (was) doubtful and slow.” Most cases seemed to be spinal meningitis “or a disease closely resembling it,” the Herald stated.
In the same article where it reported that the probable cause was meningitis, the Herald relayed a conflicting theory: “From information gained from physicians in the city yesterday it has been learned that polio-myelitis anterior [commonly known as polio]…seems to be the disease of the epidemic.”
This second diagnosis ultimately proved correct. Although it was buried in an article that was itself buried on Page 4 of the newspaper, the news was earth shattering: Vermont was suffering the first polio epidemic ever in the United States. In fact, this was the largest outbreak yet recorded anywhere. Although few people at the time had heard of polio, the disease would soon become a global terror. 
News that it was polio that had broken out in Vermont came from Charles Caverly, a 37-year-old Rutland doctor. Caverly, who was educated at Brandon High School, Kimbell Union Academy and Dartmouth College before attending medical school at the University of Vermont, had recently become president of the Vermont State Board of Health. As such, Vermont doctors were required to send Caverly detailed reports of any cases they encountered of this perplexing and disturbing disease. Those descriptions enabled Caverly to diagnose the disease correctly as polio, rather than a form of meningitis, making him the first person to identify a polio epidemic. He communicated his findings to the American medical community
“Early in the summer just passed,” he wrote in the November issue of the Yale Medical Journal, “physicians in certain parts of Rutland County, Vermont, noticed that an acute nervous disease, which was almost invariably attended with some paralysis, was epidemic.”

Tracking the disease, Caverly wondered if geography might hold clues as to the source. The first cases were observed in the city of Rutland and the town of Wallingford. While most cases continued to arise in Rutland, they soon also emerged in other area towns. All but six of the reported cases occurred in the Otter Creek Valley, an area measuring roughly 30 miles long and 15 wide. The creek, contaminated with sewage and running at a particularly low level that summer, was a possible source. But Caverly believed he could rule it out. Most people who contracted the disease got their water from wells or mountain streams and springs. Similarly, “general sanitary conditions did not seem to have any influence on the epidemic,” he wrote.
Caverly considered whether animals were the source of the disease. He wrote that that summer, domesticated animals, including horses, dogs and fowl, had been dying of an “acute nervous disease, paralytic in its nature.” It was an intriguing idea. Subsequent research, however, has shown that polio only affects humans.
Polio didn’t appear to be contagious, Caverly wrote. He had received only one report where more than one family member had contracted the disease. But appearances were deceiving. It turns out that most people infected with polio are asymptomatic. (In later years, after studying more cases, Caverly came to accept that polio was contagious.)
Caverly and his fellow doctors faced a massive obstacle in understanding polio. At the time of Vermont’s epidemic, virology was in its infancy. The poliovirus wouldn’t be isolated for another 15 years. Researchers eventually determined that the virus is typically transmitted through contact with an infected person’s feces or through droplets from their sneezes or coughs.  
Although Caverly failed to determine the cause of the outbreak, he provided helpful demographic information that showed the disease, which is sometimes called infantile paralysis, doesn’t only afflict the very young. In fact, he found that 15 cases were reported in people over age 14, including one case involving a 70-year-old. His statistics also showed that males were more prone to the disease; females only represented one-third of the Vermont cases. Research has since shown that both sexes are equally susceptible to contracting polio, but males are at higher risk of suffering paralysis.
After the 1894 epidemic, Vermont experienced a respite, with few cases emerging. Then in the summer of 1910, the state recorded 72 cases. Caverly, who remained in his role as president of the Vermont State Board of Health, was again on the case. A leading authority on polio, Caverly investigated a large outbreak in Vermont in 1916, which saw 64 cases. That year, more than 27,000 cases were reported in the United States, including 2,000 deaths. 

In later outbreaks, public health officials tried to combat polio by quarantining people with confirmed cases. During an epidemic in 1916, New York’s health department put placards on houses to identify where families were quarantining. Photo via March of Dimes
In 1918, Caverly faced a new challenge: charting an epidemic of another frightening disease, a deadly influenza strain. Doctors had little recourse against the outbreak. No vaccine existed. They counseled bedrest and isolation, when possible, to limit its spread. That year, the new influenza killed an estimated 675,000 Americans. Among them was Charles Caverly, who died in October at the age of 62.
He only lived long enough to see the start of the enormous damage polio would inflict, and he didn’t get to witness the medical miracle that all but eradicated the disease. Each summer, parents braced for the arrival of polio season, when the disease always hit some part of the United States and spread overseas. Adults were also susceptible, including future president Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who contracted polio in 1921 at the age of 39.
Fear of polio was part of everyday life. Public officials closed beaches, swimming pools and amusement parks in an effort to stop the spread. Parents warned their children not to drink from water fountains. 
Doctors found that roughly one out of 200 polio infections led to irreversible paralysis and roughly 5 to 10 percent of those cases proved fatal.
In the late 1920s, an artificial ventilator called an iron lung was invented, offering hope to patients who could not breath on their own because their chest muscles were paralyzed. The iron lung became the image many people associated with polio. Patients were slid into these cumbersome, sarcophagus-like machines with only their heads sticking out. Some polio patients required weeks or months inside an iron lung to recover use of their own lungs; others remained in an iron lung for life. The machines soon populated hospital polio wards — as well as the nightmares of parents and children.

Real hope of not just treating polio, but defeating it, arrived in the mid-1950s. Dr. Jonas Salk of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine had started work on a polio vaccine in 1948. By 1953, he was so confident of its safety and effectiveness that he vaccinated himself, his wife and their three sons. Two years later, on April 12, 1955, the American public learned that Salk’s vaccine had proved successful in clinical trials and would immediately be distributed. Across the country, communities celebrated the news by ringing church bells. Newspapers carried triumphant headlines. The Pittsburgh Press declared simply, “Polio Is Conquered.” 
The polio epidemic peaked in the United States in 1952, with nearly 58,000 recorded cases. By 1957, the number of cases had dropped 95 percent to 5,485. By 1964, the number had fallen to 106 cases.
Today, thanks to Salk’s vaccine, which has been further refined, polio is largely a disease of the past. A global survey in 1988 found that there were still roughly 350,000 cases in 125 countries that year.

With an increase in political violence across the nation, one worries what could happen in Vermont. Do our legislators need more security? Are our public officials at risk of attack?
The impulse is to focus on safety measures alone. But that strategy doesn’t address the root cause of the problem. Partisan leaders are quick to denounce the violence on the other side while staying quiet when faced with violence from their side. As long as leaders continue to dehumanize their opponents and excuse their allies, political violence will persist.
Support for political violence has recently surged amongst Democrats. A recent op-ed in the New York Times reported that “About 40 percent of Democrats supported the use of force to remove Mr. Trump from presidency and about 25 percent of Republicans supported the use of military to stop protests against Trump’s agenda.”
Robert A. Pape, the political scientist at the University of Chicago who conducted the survey, urged leaders to do more. “American political leaders need to cross their political divides and make joint statements (and ideally joint appearances).” It’s not enough to hold your own press conference. You need to hold one with your opponent. 
After the shootings in Minnesota, both the Democratic governor and the Republican president decried the actions of the gunman. Each condemned the use of violence in no uncertain terms. But together they did not stand. Had the governor and the president stood in front of the same podium and treated each other with basic courtesy, partisans on both sides would have seen that there could be an alternative to violence. 
Convincing leaders that it is in everyone’s best interest to share the spotlight is a big ask. Politicians in both parties score big dollars when they denounce their opponent as Marxist or Fascist or some other variant of Evil.
“If my opponent wins,” says one side, “you won’t have a country anymore.” “If he gets back in office,” says the other side, “you won’t have a democracy.” If the goal is raking in donations, these are profitable sentences. But if the goal is reducing political violence, those statements are as effective as using a chainsaw to slice butter.
The good news is that people don’t actually like violence. Assassinations and kidnapping tend to sour the stomach. Indeed, there have been cases in which a horrific attack was just what it took to get leaders to cross the political divide. 
After two women were killed by an assassin at two Boston abortion clinics in 1994, leaders from three pro-choice and three pro-life groups agreed to meet. The mediators set the bar very low: meet four times, in private, with no expectation of resolving the abortion debate.
The only goal was to better understand the reasoning of their opponent. Each leader assumed that at the end of the year they would go their separate ways. 
But that’s not what happened. Instead, one year turned into five and an entirely new predicament emerged.  The longer they met, the harder it became to explain why they were meeting. How could they justify spending so much time talking with their opponents? Didn’t their donors count on them to condemn the other side? 
Eventually they issued a joint statement, entitled “Talking with the Enemy,” published in the Boston Globe on the 28th anniversary of Roe v. Wade. In it they described their initial concerns, their enduring disputes, and the fruits of their conversations. 
These clandestine conversations, they explained, “made our thinking sharper and our language more precise.” Through listening and disputing, they became “wiser and more effective leaders.” By avoiding “being overreactive and disparaging to the other side,” they became better at self-control.
And most interestingly of all, these deep deliberations did not change anyone’s mind. “While learning to treat each other with dignity and respect, we have all become firmer in our views about abortion.” What changed is how they thought about their opponents.
In the 1990s, leaders could afford to take five years to bridge the political divide. With the current levels of support for political violence, we don’t have that kind of time.
To our Vermont leaders in Washington and Montpelier, if you are concerned about your personal safety, consider making friends with your enemy. Find a topic that you both care about, such as providing for foster children or fighting malaria abroad
Schedule a press conference and let your defenses drop. Laugh with each other as you disagree about policy differences. Let the disagreements be the glue that binds your friendship. Show the world that politicians can have very strong differences about public policy and still treat each other with respect.
Epilogue: 
After their essay was published in the Globe, the pro-choice and pro-life leaders held a joint press conference. Assuming that only one or two journalists would show up, they were met with a room filled with reporters. 
The reporters had lots of questions about the process, how they learned to trust one another, and how they dealt with their disagreements. The leaders were honest about their enduring differences and their newfound respect for each other.
At the end of the press conference, they received a standing ovation.

One of the new laws that went into effect July 1 has to do with school safety protocols. The safety of Vermont’s school children is of the utmost importance. 
These new protocols ought to include regularly reminding parents and caregivers of Vermont’s law which requires secure firearm storage in homes and vehicles if “a child or prohibited person is likely to gain access to the firearm.”
The law, which went into effect two years ago, is still not widely known. A study published in JAMA Pediatrics has determined that about 42% of adolescent school shooters obtained the gun from a family member, mostly through theft.  
It’s not just an issue at school. Firearm injuries are the leading cause of death for U.S. children and teens. As you are traveling over the summer it’s important to ask how firearms are secured in any camps or homes you may be visiting.
Vermont’s secure storage law is a proactive step we can all take to keep kids safe and more people need to know about it. More resources on secure storage can be found at besmartforkids.org.

We commend the Vermont State Legislature for a job well done on H.480.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Dorrine Dorfman and Charlene Webster: A provision in the miscellaneous education bill expands a Vermont reading law for the better.","This commentary is by Charlene Webster of Arlington and Dorinne Dorfman of Plainfield. Charlene has taught grades 3-6, special education and structured literacy in southwestern Vermont over her 40-year career. Dorinne teaches reading to grades 5-8 at Barre Town Middle and Elementary School, and has served as principal of Leland and Gray Union High School in Townshend and Champlain Elementary School in Burlington.


Although debate about transforming Vermont’s educational system has filled our news headlines for months, we are pleased to share that a small, but mighty provision in H.480 has expanded Vermont reading law for the better, effective immediately.
With its passage, now all students in any grade level (K-12) who significantly struggle in reading can receive supplementary reading instruction. This includes both public and approved independent schools. The revised Sec. 10. 16 V.S.A. § 2903, or “foundation for literacy,” guarantees additional instruction to all students significantly below proficiency in reading or whose poor reading skills impede school progress. 
In May 2024, Act 139 — an act relating to supporting Vermont’s young readers through evidence-based literacy instruction — fundamentally changed K-3 classroom instruction, intervention, assessment, and teacher training. Act 139 marks the moment Vermont abandoned unfounded instructional approaches that taught children to guess and invent instead of directly decoding and spelling the English language.
The law requires K-3 students to be assessed and receive instruction in the five components of reading: phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary and comprehension. Assessments must be valid and reliable, and administered following the test’s technical specifications at least once a year. In addition, the parents/guardians of students found significantly below proficient must be notified. Some schools have chosen to inform all parents/guardians of their students’ progress.
Although H.480 does not require schools to assess reading in grades 4-12, many schools do assess these grades. For students found significantly below in reading, H.480 requires schools to inform parents/guardians of the results and provide supplemental instruction in reading.
Parents/guardians are often well aware of their children’s reading deficits. Schools screening the five reading components in grades 4-12 makes the best sense, since struggling readers can have these deficits no matter what age.
Only an education professional who is highly trained in evidence-aligned reading practices, such as in an Orton-Gillingham-based program, should administer screeners and interpret student performance. Parents/guardians can request all results of reading assessments the school has conducted over the years. This is especially helpful for monitoring progress and determining if reading gaps have narrowed or grown over time. 
We commend the Vermont State Legislature for a job well done on H.480, guaranteeing supplementary reading instruction in all grades for those with significant reading deficits. 
Parents/guardians with concerns about their children’s progress should contact their schools for reading data, learn what supplementary reading instruction is offered, and confirm that evidence-aligned teaching and testing practices are in place. Advocacy from parents/guardians can help speed up the process, from assessing the five components of reading to starting the supplemental instruction their children need to achieve reading proficiency.

The Fourth of July is when we celebrate Thomas Jefferson’s words that proclaimed the American state’s independence from England – on July 2 instead of the fourth.
While independence was proclaimed on July 2, Jefferson’s Declaration of Independence was ratified by the Continental Congress two days later.
About 13 years later, members of the Continental Congress drafted the American Constitution which established the principles that would guide the new nation and shored up in more detail what Jefferson meant by life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
While the Constitution failed miserably in providing those rights to all people — women, Blacks, Native Americans — the rights provided to primarily white men then were pretty special.
Those cherished rights include the right to free speech and to an independent press that has the right — even the responsibility — to question and to challenge our elected leaders.
Those free speech components are the backbone of the country, whose independence we have in recent days been celebrating. And as our nation has matured, those rights have been availed to all.
But there is reason to fear that some of our elected leaders, through at least their words even as we celebrate the Fourth of July, are trying to erode those rights. No example shines brighter than the Trump administration’s  response to press coverage of recent military action.
Most Americans, presumably, would still agree that it is not anti-American to question our elected leaders about whether their desired goals are accomplished when our immense military strength is deployed. It should not be construed as a slap in the face to our brave men and women in the military to ask such questions of elected leaders, especially when American lives and the economy are on the line.
In most instances, questions are asked to determine if our elected leaders choose to use the military in a proper and productive manner — and not to embarrass or criticize the military.
If they can justify that use of force and if the mission was a success, they should be able to defend it without attacking the questioner.
Nobody claimed attacks against the military when many criticized the chaos and deaths that occurred in 2021 during the United States’ withdrawal from Afghanistan when President Joe Biden was calling the shots.
On the other hand, when the press questioned whether recent bombings “obliterated” Iran’s nuclear facilities as President Donald Trump claimed, he and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said to ask such questions was disrespecting our military.
“There are so many aspects of what our brave men and women did and, because of the hatred of this press corps, are undermined because your people are trying to leak and spin that it wasn’t successful. It’s irresponsible,” Hegseth said.
Trump said the pilots who flew the bombing missions to Iran “were devastated” by the questions because “they put their lives on the line.”
In another interview, the president said, “And they (the media) may be prosecuted also for having given false reports on the attack in Iran. They were given totally false reports. It was totally obliterated. And our people have to be celebrated, not come home and say, what do you mean we didn’t hit the target?”
The president and his administration even went a step further, threatening prosecution for reporting on an app that allows people to provide information on the movements of ICE as the federal agency conducts immigration enforcement. Even before the media reports that simply reported about the existence of the app, it already was in the public domain and popular.
Perhaps Trump and Hegseth don’t understand — but hopefully members of the military and the rest of us do and did as we watched recent Fourth of July fireworks shows — that to question our leaders or even their military actions is not an effort to disparage or disrespect the military. The basis for this questioning and the right to even lodge the questioning is, in fact, a display of one of the more patriotic actions we can take as Americans.
That is the guiding principle, the North Star, of what the founders had in mind when they wrote the Declaration of Independence and later the Constitution.
And surely the founding fathers would not approve of President Trump’s recent threat “to prosecute” the media for their reporting.
After all, to obtain and maintain the right to question our leaders is one of the reasons we chose to end our relationship with King George III on July 4, 1776, or thereabouts.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/03095832/AP24187076228493.jpg,,,2025-07-06 08:00:22.911760

This story by Aaron Calvin was first published in News & Citizen on July 3.
A local sculptor whose roadside artwork was destroyed when a commercial truck hit it three years ago has reached a settlement with the insurance company over the value of the destroyed stones.
In April 2022, the driver of an Isuzu street sweeper fell asleep at the wheel on Route 100 near Morrisville, crashing through the Phoenix Helix, a swirling stone sculpture built at the roadside of MyEarthwork, the home gallery of Morrisville artist Thea Alvin.
Alvin told the News & Citizen at the time that the driver had been working all night and was tired, was not injured and sincerely apologized, but emphasized the loss she had suffered in the incident.
“It was a very important part of my identity as a sculptor, as an inventor — defiant and strong and a little insecure, a little imperfect, beautiful and steady and heavy and profound but also carefree,” she said at the time. “When it was crashed into, it felt like my identity was broken.”
Stonemason friends ended up coming to her aid and a new Phoenix Helix rose from the ashes, but a battle with the insurer of her work was more protracted. Three years after the sculpture was destroyed, Alvin said she has finally reached a settlement over the value of the artwork and concluded a disagreement over how the piece should be assessed.
Prior to the final mediation session, she posted on social media that she was close to settling with the insurance company over whether the destroyed sculpture should be considered art or just a stone wall.
“I have stood my ground that art is art, even if it is, especially, if it is, made of stone,” Alvin said.
The settlement was reached in mid-June, but Alvin — after conferring with legal counsel — declined to share the specific terms, prior to leaving to teach stone wall restoration on a private island in Brittany, France.
Alvin confirmed that a monetary compensation was reached, though not for the full appraised value of the work. She also confirmed that the insurer acknowledged that the Phoenix Helix’s value was due to its status as a work of art and not just a wall.
The destruction of the stone wall hasn’t been the only time a driver has veered onto her property off the busy nearby highway; Alvin said an errant driver recently took out her apple tree.
Alvin is well-recognized for her art both locally and internationally, though she’s made more headlines recently for her efforts to preserve open space along the Route 100 corridor. She’s led an effort to oppose the approval of a sprawling new industrial park planned across from the Morrisville-Stowe Airport under Vermont’s environmental regulatory law and put her skills to use in the effort by building handmade dioramas to illustrate the potential impact the development would have on the land.

Two weeks after the state confiscated 39 horses from a horse farm in Townshend, all the horses are stable, but some have a longer “road to recovery” than others, according to Jen Straub, executive director of Dorset Equine Rescue. 
The two horses with critical condition when seized from Friseians of Majesty are still in a veterinary hospital as of Wednesday — a gelding with severe dental issues due to lack of routine dental care and a mare with an acute hoof abscess, Straub said. 
The majority of horses are healing from some combination of lice, mites, roundworm infection and a skin fungus called rain rot. 
“That’s all just due to neglect, not getting proper grooming and bathing, not getting regular care,” Straub said.

After the fourth and largest seizure of horses from the Friesians of Majesty horse farm in two years, Windham County State’s Attorney Steven Brown said the ongoing animal cruelty investigation is a “fairly unique case.” 
The horse farm’s owner, Rober Labrie, pleaded not guilty to criminal charges of animal cruelty and violations of conditions of release on June 18. 
The state is exploring options including a permanent or temporary order barring Labrie from possessing horses, Brown said. The state attempted to request that Labrie turn over the horses still on his property to a third party as a condition of his release at an arraignment hearing, but that motion was denied by the judge due to lack of authority to issue the order, he said. 
The first seizure in July 2023 has been adjudicated, and those 13 horses have been forfeited to be rehomed, Brown said. The second forfeiture request by the state, after 20 horses were seized in September 2024, is also still pending. The state also seized two horses from the farm in June of 2024. In the second forfeiture case, the state filed 16 misdemeanor animal cruelty charges under Vermont’s animal cruelty statute related to the condition of the 20 horses.
The state will file another forfeiture order for the most recent seizure to begin the process of finding permanent homes for the 39 horses, according to Brown. He expressed gratitude for the rescue agencies that have assisted the Vermont Fish & Wildlife Department and taken in horses.
Since the most recent seizure, 25 of the 39 horses have been relocated from their first stop at Dorset Equine Rescue to the Gentle Giants horse farm in Maryland. They are “visibly looking better in even just a week,” said Lorin Grey, the director of growth at Gentle Giants.
“They’re starting to gain weight,” Grey said. “They’re out on pasture and have access to hay, feed, grain, so they are all doing well and settling in, and we’re starting to address any specific medical issues.”
Grey said the organization was contacted by Vermont’s animal welfare partners for help because some stallions needed “specialized housing and individualized turnout,” a practice of allowing horses to graze in a pasture or paddock.
Gentle Giants horse farm is “one of the only rescues on the Eastern Seaboard that are equipped to house a large number of stallions and a large number of horses in general,” she said. 
The Maryland horse farm also took in seven stallions after the seizure from Friesians of Majesty in September 2024. Those horses have all now recovered, but Grey said they were “several hundred pounds underweight” and many had “ongoing, longtime skin issues that hadn’t been addressed.”
The Maine State Society for the Protection of Animals took in six horses on June 20 after they were originally transferred to Dorset Equine Rescue. Peg Keyser, the society’s advancement director, said the horses’ body condition scores were between 1 and 2 — the low end of the scale. Keyser said the horses’ feet and teeth were neglected and their skin was riddled with ticks and parasites, and in at least one case “raging dermatitis.”
The horses have already seen improvement since arriving and are going through veterinary evaluations and refeeding processes tailored to the horses’ individual challenges, Keyser said. But, the neglect and malnourishment the horses experienced for an unknown amount of time has caused compounded stress and chronic health conditions that will likely have lasting effects, she said. 
A more efficient and effective system
Rep. Chea Waters Evans, D-Charlotte, said the previous seizures at the Townshend horse farm, along with the death of goats within her district in 2023, drew attention to the shortcomings of the state’s animal welfare system.
Those two cases prompted Waters Evans to cosponsor H.626, which was signed into law in June 2024. The law created a Division of Animal Welfare, a new governmental arm tasked with creating a more efficient and effective animal welfare system, she said. 
“There are a lot of people who were trying to solve similar problems in a parallel fashion, instead of collaborating together,” Waters Evans said. “Hopefully if we have a more streamlined system, we’ll be able to stop some of these problems before they start.”
Lisa Milot, the state’s newly appointed division director, said she does not have a formal role in the active animal cruelty investigation, but is tasked with creating a comprehensive plan to improve the state’s animal welfare system in the coming months. 
Milot said Vermont has lacked uniformity and a clear process for law enforcement entities in different parts of the state. There is a need to strengthen and simplify the process of reporting, investigating and seeking recourse through the courts in animal cruelty cases, she said. 
“There’s no real consistency in how the cases are handled,” Milot said. “There’s some large cases that have come up in recent years, and (the state) wants both a better approach to investigating and prosecuting them, but also to, long term, preventing these sorts of cases.”
Milot said animal owners accused of animal cruelty are still allowed to own and breed animals while cases are pending because of the presumption of innocence unless proven guilty.
Along with a general backlog of cases in the Vermont courts since the Covid-19 pandemic, Milot said animal cruelty cases can take years to complete because crimes against humans are prioritized over property related crimes. 
Horses and other animals are considered by the state to be “special property,” so animal cruelty cases are litigated before crimes related to inanimate objects. Milot said the “biggest thing that would help with rescues, with the state expense on these cases is speeding up the rate at which the animal can be rehomed.”
Milot said there is no state-run impound center to house animals during animal cruelty cases in Vermont, and that would be very expensive to create. Partner rescue groups must foot the bill to house, feed, care and treat medical conditions of seized horses before they are forfeited and can be adopted, she said.
Milot said she has been reviewing the animal welfare laws in other states, such as legislation to expedite animal cruelty cases and reduce some of the cost burden on rescue agencies. Her goal is to “come up with a plan and procedures that can help alleviate those sorts of strains, but without causing extra strains on taxpayers,” she said.
Straub, of Dorset Rescue, said there has been productive collaboration between her rescue and the state investigators at the Fish & Wildlife Department and law enforcement. But, she said would like to see more attention and investment in the state’s animal welfare system overall.
“There’s a lack of resources for implementing the laws. There needs to be more people that have time to go do welfare checks and follow through on these neglect cases,” Straub said. “There are a lot of animals suffering across the state, and it’s not being dealt with as timely as it should be.”
The Fish & Wildlife Department, the Agency of Agriculture Food & Markets and the Vermont State Police all declined to comment due to the ongoing animal cruelty investigation. 
Labrie’s attorney also said she could not comment while the case is active, and Labrie did not respond to requests for comment.

The Trump administration’s decision to freeze the funding has put states in “triage mode” as they scramble to decide what programs may be cut without that funding, said Mary Kusler, senior director for the Center for Advocacy at the National Education Association. The money was approved by Congress to support education for English language learners, migrants, low-income children and adults learning to read, among others.
As of July 1, school systems are unable to draw down funding, jeopardizing summer programs, hiring and early-year planning for the 2025–26 school year.
The funding freeze affects several core programs: Title II-A (educator training and recruitment), Title III-A (English learner support), Title IV-A (student enrichment and after-school), as well as migrant education and adult education and literacy grants. Trump has proposed eliminating all those programs in his proposed budget for next fiscal year, but that proposal hasn’t gone through Congress.

State superintendents sent out missives to school districts early this week and now are scrambling to make choices.
“This is not about political philosophy, this is about reliability and consistency,” Alabama state Superintendent Eric Mackey said to Politico this week. “None of us were worrying about this.”
The administration says it is reviewing the programs.
“The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities,” the U.S. Department of Education wrote to states in its announcement Monday.
 

Historically, the department releases allocations by July 1 to ensure schools can budget and plan effectively for the coming school year. Withholding the money could result in canceled programs, hiring freezes and the loss of essential support for English learners, migrant children and other high-need populations, education and state officials told Stateline.
“America’s public school leaders run district budgets that are dependent on a complex partnership between federal, state, and local funding,” said David R. Schuler, executive director of the School Superintendents Association in a statement. “For decades, school districts have relied on timely confirmation of their federal allocations ahead of the July 1 start of the fiscal year — ensuring stability, allowing for responsible planning, and supporting uninterrupted educational services for students.”
The states facing the largest withheld amounts include California ($810.7 million), Texas ($660.9 million), and New York ($411.7 million), according to data from the NEA and the Learning Policy Institute, an education think tank.
For 17 states and territories, the freeze affects over 15% of their total federal K-12 allocations, according to the Learning Policy Institute. For smaller jurisdictions such as the District of Columbia and Vermont, the disruption hits even harder: More than 20% of their federal K-12 budgets remain inaccessible.
Colorado Education Commissioner Susan Córdova urged school districts to begin contingency planning in case funds are not released before the federal fiscal year ends on Sept. 30. California State Superintendent Tony Thurmond hinted at possible legal action, which has become a trend as states fight the second Trump administration’s funding revocations or delays.
“California will continue to pursue all available legal remedies to the Trump Administration’s unlawful withholding of federal funds appropriated by Congress,” Thurmond said in a statement.
The NEA and the NAACP have filed for a preliminary injunction, calling the administration’s delay an illegal “impoundment” — a violation of the federal Impoundment Control Act, which bars the executive branch from withholding appropriated funds without congressional approval.
Education advocates warn the recent decision by the Trump administration to withhold funding reflects a broader pattern of federal disengagement from public education.
Community nonprofits said the withholding could devastate their programming too. The Boys and Girls Clubs of America could have to close more than 900 centers — bringing the loss of 5,900 jobs and affecting more than 220,000 children, said President and CEO Jim Clark in a statement.
The 1974 Impoundment Control Act lets the president propose canceling funds approved by Congress. Lawmakers have 45 days to approve the request; if they don’t, it’s denied. Meanwhile, agencies can be directed not to spend the funds during that time.
A White House statement shared with States Newsroom this week said “initial findings have shown that many of these grant programs have been grossly misused to subsidize a radical leftwing agenda.”
“Kids, educators, and working families are the ones losing,” said Kusler, of the NEA. “We need governors and communities to step up — now.”

(Photo by Shalina Chatlani/Stateline)LAKE PROVIDENCE, La. — East Carroll Parish sits in the northeastern corner of Louisiana, along the winding Mississippi River. Its seat, Lake Providence, was a thriving agricultural center of the Delta. Now, the town is a shell of its former self. Charred and dilapidated buildings dot the small city center. There are a few gas stations, a handful of restaurants — and little to no industry.
Mayor Bobby Amacker, 79, says at one point “you couldn’t even walk down the street” in Lake Providence’s main business district because “there were so many people.”
“It’s gone down tremendously in the last 50 years,” said Amacker, a Democrat. “The town, it looks like it’s drying up. And it’s almost unstoppable, as far as I can tell.”
Now, East Carroll residents stand to lose even more. Like many people in Louisiana, they received a lifeline when the state expanded Medicaid to more low-income adults in 2016. Expansion drove Louisiana’s uninsured rate to the lowest in the Deep South, at 8% in 2023 for working-age adults, according to state data, despite it having the highest poverty rate in the U.S. that year.

This week, the U.S. Senate approved President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful” tax and spending bill. It includes more than $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, the joint state-federal health insurance program for poor families and individuals, to help pay for tax cuts that mostly benefit the rich. The legislation would cause 11.8 million more Americans to become uninsured by 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
The bill includes new work rules for Medicaid recipients and would require them to verify their eligibility more frequently. It also would limit a financing strategy that states have used to boost Medicaid payments to hospitals.
Republicans say enrollees are taking advantage of the Medicaid program and getting benefits when they shouldn’t be. They say the program costs too much and states are not paying their fair share.
The Delta region, which includes communities in both Louisiana and Mississippi, would suffer under such large cuts. But in Louisiana — where almost half of the state depended on Medicaid in 2023, the Louisiana Department of Health reported — the cuts could be ruinous. Louisiana could lose up to $35 billion in federal Medicaid support over the next decade, according to KFF, a health policy research group. Mississippi, which never expanded Medicaid, could still lose up to $5 billion.
Residents are watching with apprehension, fear and, sometimes, anger, wondering how Congress could be so blind to how much they are struggling.
“If they take that away from us and everyone that really needs it, that’s going to be bad,” said Sherila Ervin, who lives 20 minutes up the road from Lake Providence in Oak Grove and has Medicaid coverage.

Medicaid work requirements and other health care provisions in the bill ignore the reality of living in poorer rural communities, where people struggle to find the jobs, transportation and internet access required to meet the rules, according to interviews with people and providers in the Delta region.
Even though Louisiana and Mississippi have taken very different approaches to Medicaid — one expanded eligibility under the 2010 Affordable Care Act and the other didn’t — both rely heavily on the program to sustain access to medical care for all their residents.
On a hot summer day in June, Ervin walks into the bare-bones 99-cent store in downtown Lake Providence. As she looks over some clothing, she says she’s heard about the potential Medicaid cuts. But she hadn’t heard about the work requirements, and is shocked they’re even on the table.
“I don’t like that. I don’t think they should put a stipulation on that,” Ervin says, exasperated that she would have to report her work hours. It’s hard enough as it is, she says, to thrive in this community.
Ervin, 58, has been working at Oak Grove High School in the cafeteria, serving hot plates to children for two decades. She says it’s one of the good, steady jobs available in this area, but her income is only around $1,500 per month.
Ervin’s job offers health benefits, but she can’t afford the premiums on her salary. She relies on Medicaid for care, including medications for her high blood pressure.
In East Carroll Parish, around 46.5% of people live below the poverty level, meaning the area is overwhelmingly poor, at over four times the national poverty rate, with a median income of $28,321. For Black households, the figure is a mere $16,690.
Expansion was a lifeline for people such as Ervin. Louisiana offers Medicaid to people who earn below 138% of the federal poverty line — currently about $22,000 a year for an individual.
“Sometimes you can work, but then when you work, you still can’t pay to get help,” Ervin said.
It’s a similar economic situation an hour away across the river. Poverty is about three times the national rate in Washington County, Mississippi, where residents in the city of Greenville lament the consequences of not being able to avoid destructive medical debt, which can keep them stuck in a cycle of gig work and of living paycheck to paycheck.
Greenville, the county seat, is among the fastest-shrinking cities in the U.S. It’s still one of the larger rural cities in Mississippi, with coffee shops, restaurants, hotels, a regional hospital and several big-box stores. But the downtown has just a few small businesses and a bank, and residents say jobs are hard to find.
Greenville resident April McNair, 45, remembers giving birth 17 years ago, long before Mississippi extended postpartum Medicaid to a full year. She had Medicaid coverage during pregnancy, but was kicked off shortly after giving birth, despite having post-delivery complications.

The result was a trip to the emergency room and a $2,500 bill she couldn’t cover. Right after giving birth, McNair looked for work. She said potential employers often told her that she was overqualified because she had a master’s degree.
“I had to kind of figure out how to make my ends meet,” McNair said. “I ended up with a significant bill, all because I did not have Medicaid.”
McNair feels like Mississippi leaders are making a mistake by continuing to reject full Medicaid expansion.
“That’s a selfish move. To me, they’re selfish,” McNair said, adding that now she’s worried for neighbors in Louisiana who may lose the lifeline she wishes she had.
“God forbid, hypothetically speaking, what if one of them meets their demise because of this bill that [Congress] passed?”
 Hard to thrive

Mississippi experienced its first taste of equalized access to medicine in the late 1960s.
Delta Health Center, the first federally funded health center in the nation, opened during the peak of the Civil Rights Movement in the all-Black town of Mound Bayou, about an hour north of Greenville. The center vowed to care for anyone regardless of race or ability to pay in a region plagued with poverty, poor health and discrimination — and continues to do so to this day.
It was a significant opportunity for generations of African Americans who had gone without health care, in a place where people had no access to clean drinking water, running sewage systems or even food, said Robin Boyles, chief program planning and development officer at Delta Health Center.
But it wasn’t easy for the clinic to mobilize support, even though it was clearly needed. Before its opening, it faced pushback from politicians and even doctors. In a 1966 clipping from a local newspaper, the white-owned Bolivar Commercial, the editorial board railed against the new clinic, saying it would “lead further to socialized medicine.”

The situation is certainly better in Mississippi and Louisiana than it was in the 1960s, but critics say the Medicaid cuts could reverse hard-fought progress.
People who live in the Delta are fiercely proud of their communities, but conditions there make it hard to thrive.
Black residents, who are the overwhelming majority, have had a particularly hard time. After the Civil War, many were relegated to sharecropping of cotton and corn for subsistence. Meanwhile, an elite white class of plantation owners and investors amassed enormous amounts of wealth.
A 2001 report from the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights described the area as one with “limited economic resources; inadequate employment opportunities; insufficient decent, affordable housing; and poor quality public schools.”
“We have a lot of patients that are one health issue away from either being out of a job or being bankrupt because of a trip to the emergency room,” said Dr. Brent Smith, a physician at a primary care clinic at Delta Health System in Greenville.
Even some of the most vulnerable people, such as new moms in Mississippi, still struggle to get basic care, in part because the state has left billions of dollars in federal funding for Medicaid expansion on the table, said Dr. Lakeisha Richardson, an OB-GYN at Delta Health System.
“There are a lot of maternal [care] deserts in Mississippi where women have to travel 60 miles or more just to get prenatal care and just to get to the closest hospital for delivery,” Richardson said. “And I don’t see that getting any better in Mississippi and in rural areas.”
Richardson says nearly all her patients are working moms, many of whom would really benefit from having Medicaid expansion.
“America doesn’t realize that there are people out here struggling for no reason of their own,” she said.
That’s why Medicaid expansion in Louisiana in 2016, much like the community health center movement in Mississippi, was a bright spot in the rural South, said Smith.
“Louisiana expanded Medicaid, a surprising move in the South to see any state expand,” Smith said. “They saw it for what it was, which was a very real opportunity to assist this specific group of patients.”

In Mississippi, 20 rural hospitals are at immediate risk of closure, according to a recent report, more than double the number at risk in Louisiana. In many cases, Medicaid is the largest and most reliable payer for rural hospitals. While Louisiana’s overall uninsured rate plummeted to 8.3% by 2023, in Mississippi it was 10.5%.
“Unlike a lot of our Southern peers, we have not had the same level of closures of facilities,” said Courtney Foster, senior policy adviser for Medicaid, with the nonprofit Invest in Louisiana.
“Medicaid was like a real lifeline for people in transition. Oftentimes it was people who had lost their jobs and were just looking to get back on their feet.”
Now, the new work and reporting requirements could put that progress at risk.










America doesn't realize that there are people out here struggling for no reason of their own.

In East Carroll Parish, finding a job — let alone a good-paying one with health benefits — is difficult, says Rosie Brown, executive director at the East Carroll Community Action Agency, a nonprofit that helps low-income people with their rent and utility bills. Many of the jobs available in town pay minimum wage, just $7.25 an hour.
Brown loves living in Lake Providence; this is where her family is. She doesn’t want to move but wishes the government would invest more in her community — not take away benefits that help people who are hanging on by a thread.
“We have one bank. We have one supermarket,” she said. “Transportation isn’t easy either.”
Local infrastructure is so limited, she’s even heard of some people charging residents $20 for a ride to Walmart. Some people have to hitch a ride an hour away to go to work, she said.
“There’s nowhere to go,” Brown said.
Dominique Jones works at the local library, where she helps roughly 75 to 85 people per month apply for programs such as Medicaid and food assistance. Many of the residents she helps don’t have access to the internet or even a computer, a real barrier for people who’d be required to report their working hours to state Medicaid officials.
“This town right here is made up of a lot of old people that need Medicaid and Medicare. And without it, they wouldn’t have any kind of health care at all,” Mayor Amacker said.
  Dilapidated buildings dot downtown Lake Providence, La. (Photo by Shalina Chatlani/Stateline)
Even a job in local government in Lake Providence doesn’t offer affordable health insurance.
Nevada Qualls, 25, sits across from Amacker’s office. She earns just $12 an hour as a cashier at city hall. The low pay means she qualifies for Medicaid expansion coverage, which is good because she can’t afford the premiums for private insurance.
“I feel like there should be a higher threshold for people that can get Medicaid, because they’re still struggling,” she said.
At the 99-cent store, school district worker Ervin wonders whether state and federal leaders understand what it’s like to live in her community, urging them to visit and see for themselves.
“They want to do stuff for the rich people that’s already rich,” she said. “What are they doing? It’s almost like there’s no common sense with them.”
 ‘The tremble factors’

While leaders in the U.S. Senate were working into the night this past weekend debating Trump’s tax and spending bill, Greenville resident Jennifer Morris was praying for the pain to stay away.
Morris, 44, has hemicrania continua, a headache disorder that causes constant pain on one side of her head. There’s no underlying trigger and no cure. Her doctors help her keep the pain to a minimum with regular treatments that include dozens of injections into her head.
“It doesn’t take the pain away,” she said during a late-night gathering in Greenville’s Greater Mount Olivet Missionary Baptist Church in June. “It does reduce the pain so that I’m able to function. But it’s rough.”

Morris is worried about the looming Medicaid cuts. She qualifies for Mississippi Medicaid because her condition counts as a disability, and she depends on the coverage to afford her medications.
Morris’ Medicaid may be safer than that of her Delta neighbors in Lake Providence, as some of the most dramatic Medicaid changes being considered — such as work requirements — target Medicaid expansion states only.
But Mississippi could be hurt by a provision in the Senate bill that would target a strategy states have used to boost the Medicaid dollars they get from the federal government.
Mississippi could see a major hit to its Medicaid funds, which “would be a tremendous decrease in revenue for the state,” harming “services and access to care,” says Mitchell Adcock, executive director at the Center for Mississippi Health Policy.
“It would be just the opposite of expansion. It would be a contraction for the Medicaid program in the state,” he said.
Leonard Favorite, a pastor who was attending the same event at Mount Olivet Church, as Morris, says he grew up on a plantation in Louisiana and worked his way out of poverty by joining the Air Force. This type of journey is hard, he said, when you’re already starting from so far behind. He thinks the “big, beautiful bill” will create more roadblocks for poor people.
“You have people who are already living below the poverty line and they will certainly be submerged into poverty at unspeakable levels,” said Favorite, 70.“ That seems to be the trend of this administration from the point of view of looking from the outside.
“Poor people are beginning to feel the tremble factors of an administration that caters toward the rich.”
National researchers estimate that up to 132,000 Louisianans who gained health insurance under expansion could lose it under work rules.
But national reports that rely on census data likely underestimate the potential Medicaid losses. For example, while 2023 census data show 47% of East Carroll Parish was on Medicaid, state health data reviewed by Stateline and Public Health Watch suggests the number is more like 64%. Similarly statewide, census data showed about a third of Louisianans were on Medicaid. State data shows that percentage is closer to 46.5%.
Experts such as Joan Alker at the Georgetown Center for Children and Families say the undercounts nationally are a well-known issue among researchers, but it’s difficult to correct because the quality of state reporting can be so uneven.
State Medicaid funding is also at risk. For years, both Mississippi and Louisiana have relied on revenue generated through a financing tool — known as a provider tax — to draw down more federal dollars and boost Medicaid reimbursements to providers. But congressional Republicans hope to limit states’ ability to collect those taxes.
Depending on how Congress restricts provider taxes, Mississippi could lose hundreds of millions in federal Medicaid funding, crucial in a state with such a high uninsured rate, said Richard Roberson, president and CEO of the Mississippi Hospital Association.
“It’s unavoidable that when you’re taking that much money out of the system, that there’s not going to be some repercussions felt even in non-Medicaid expansion states like Mississippi,” Roberson said.
Last week, the Louisiana Hospital Association signed a statement calling the package of Medicaid cuts before Congress “historic in their devastation.”
From her small, sunny office in East Carroll Parish, nurse Jennifer Newton can’t understand the attacks on Medicaid.
Newton, who grew up one parish over in West Carroll, is executive director of the Family Medical Clinic, a community health center in Lake Providence and one of the few health providers in town. She says 50% of the clinic’s patients have Medicaid insurance.

Newton has worked in health care in the area for decades and watched as Medicaid expansion made it possible for more patients to access and afford health care they desperately needed, including preventive services. “It’s absolutely helped,” she said. “Absolutely.”
In 2015, the year before Louisiana expanded Medicaid, the uninsured rate among working-age adults in East Carroll Parish was nearly 35%. By 2021, that number was 12.7%.
“Why are we going back?” Newton asked. “We’ve made so much progress.”
Republican supporters of work requirements, including Louisiana representative and U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, argue they will encourage people to find jobs and ensure Medicaid goes to people who need it most. But according to KFF, a majority of Louisiana adults with Medicaid — 69% — already work.
Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that is working with Republicans to formulate Medicaid cuts, is not concerned about eligible people losing coverage, as has happened under previous work requirement efforts. He says the bill has built in exceptions for certain people and requirements “can be met by not just work,” so “concerns seem pretty overstated.”
Medicaid recipients also can meet the requirement by volunteering or attending school for 80 hours per month.
“It’s hard for me to understand that there are areas in the country where there’s not jobs. There’s always work to be done,” Blase told Stateline. Blase said he believes Medicaid is “the government conditioning welfare for able-bodied working-age adults.”
But advocates and experts predict East Carroll, where internet access is notoriously bad, would experience results similar to when Arkansas instituted Medicaid work requirements in 2018: People disenrolled because of lack of awareness and confusion over the policy, as well as paperwork errors — not because they weren’t working enough.
“Unless the beneficiary can navigate that red tape, they’re going to lose coverage and become uninsured,” said Benjamin Sommers, a health economist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
Data shows Arkansas’ experiment did not increase employment, Sommers said, and instead led to more people reporting medical debt and delaying care because of cost.
 ‘Take a step back’

People in the Delta — where the legacy of government neglect and discrimination are all around — want politicians to visit their towns and see the barriers people face trying to improve their lives and stay healthy.
“People spent their lives uninsured,” said Amy Hale, a nurse practitioner at East Carroll Medical clinic. “Medicaid expansion allowed them to get in here and be treated.”
Lake Providence residents are scared they may find themselves in a similar situation as McNair and other people across the river in Greenville: working, uninsured, and too poor to access health care.
Recent estimates show up to 317,000 Louisianans could lose Medicaid health insurance under Trump’s tax bill. Nearly 33,000 in Mississippi.
“People are actually trying,” McNair said. “I really wish [lawmakers] would look at it from a different lens. What if it was their kid? Or they didn’t have the salaries they have now and your baby is ill. … Like really take a step back and think about what it is that you’re doing.”

Mazza/iStock/Getty Images)A group of environmentalists have launched a legal battle to stop a logging project in the Sandwich Range of New Hampshire’s White Mountain National Forest.
The Sandwich Vegetation Management Project, which was approved by the U.S. Forest Service last year, will allow 638 acres in the Sandwich Range to be logged by private companies, reconstruct about 16 miles of roads through the area and authorize prescribed burns on 306 acres. The Forest Service has said that the project will help manage vegetation to provide a sustainable supply of timber for local economies and the burns will help diversify vegetation and wildlife. It’s one of several logging projects in the White Mountain National Forest, several of which are being challenged in court.
“The Forest Service in this project, like in recent projects, is flouting the requirements of federal law as they approve these significant logging projects across the White Mountains,” Christophe Courchesne, the attorney behind the lawsuit, said in an interview with the New Hampshire Bulletin. “And they’re doing less than the bare minimum required reviews of these pretty significant efforts that will really change the face of these areas for decades to come.”
The Sandwich Range Wilderness spans about 35,300 acres within the southern portion of the national forest. It includes Mount Passaconaway, Mount Tripyramid, Sandwich Mountain, several rivers, and about 60 miles of hiking trails.
A allegedly ‘shoddy’ process
In a lawsuit filed in late June, Standing Trees, Inc. — a Vermont environmental group that seeks to protect forests across New England — and attorneys with the Environmental Advocacy Clinic — a project of the Vermont Law and Graduate School — allege the Forest Service didn’t sufficiently prove logging was necessary in the area or go through the proper steps for environmental review and public input.
“If you go down the list of various resources that they were supposed to analyze, and you really look carefully at what they put together, what you see is a pattern of the Forest Service just concluding, without evidence, that the project will have no impact on those resources,” Courchesne, who serves as director of the Environmental Advocacy Clinic, said. “And that doesn’t meet the requirements of federal law.”
The lawsuit argues the project runs counter to guidelines outlined in a plan for the forest established by the federal government in 2005 called the White Mountain National Forest Plan. It claims the project fails to comply with that plan because it doesn’t include any measures to protect the officially designated wild and scenic Cold River and will affect parts of the forest visible to hikers and recreationists in violation of requirements to not impact scenery. The suit also says the Forest Service failed to demonstrate that logging will help manage vegetation and won’t harm the habitats of animals in the forest, including the northern long-eared bat, a federally listed endangered species that lives in the range.










They certainly went through a process, but the process wasn't adequate.

It also alleges the Forest Service plans to build four times as much mileage of roads than authorized in the 2005 plan by classifying the proposed road construction as reconstruction of existing roads. The lawsuit argues those roads have been decommissioned for so long that reforestation has occurred over them.
“The public should have a right to weigh in on these uses of federal public lands, especially, these really beautiful, important areas that have major species and other important water quality benefits and all these sorts of things that that the Forest Service was supposed to take into account,” Courchesne said. “And they really did a very shoddy job in analyzing these impacts.”
The lawsuit also accuses the project of violating the National Environmental Policy Act in numerous ways including by failing the so-called “hard look” test and not properly examining the impacts on forest health, climate, and endangered species.
“They certainly went through a process, but the process wasn’t adequate, especially given the types of information that they presented and the analysis that they did in that review,” Courchesne said. “So it’s not that they didn’t do any review, but the review that they did really fell short of the federal requirements.”
The Forest Service’s stance
The Forest Service has not filed a response to the lawsuit, according to online court records. Officials with the Forest Service and White Mountain National Forest’s Campton office did not respond to the Bulletin’s requests for an interview or comment. However, in a letter outlining approval for the project, Jim Innis, Saco District ranger at the national forest addressed public concern over the project, writing “The National Forest System is managed under a multiple use mission, which not everyone agrees with.”
“Public opinion on forest management has and will continue to be controversial,” he continued. “Federal land management policy can be complex and difficult to understand. My staff and I did our best to explain the ‘why’ of our management actions and will continue this approach for future projects. … I have considered public comments received throughout the analysis and balanced them with the best available science in making this decision.”
The Forest Service had three 30-day comment periods and held five public meetings and five meetings with clubs and organizations on the project.
After those meetings, the Forest Service excluded 50 acres of old-growth forests from the project, Innis wrote. He also said the agency consulted with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which determined “the proposed project may affect, but not is likely to adversely affect the northern long-eared bat.”
Several contested projects
This isn’t the first time Courchesne and the Environment Advocacy Clinic have sued the Forest Service. There are more than a dozen logging projects approved or proposed in the White Mountain National Forest, and the Environmental Advocacy Clinic, partnered with Standing Trees, Inc., have targeted several of them.
“We’ve been very active in this space,” Courchesne said, “challenging the Forest Service and trying to hold them accountable for complying with federal law.”
That includes their lawsuit over the Tarleton Project near Gorham and Lake Tarleton in the western portion of the forest, and a lawsuit against the Peabody Project in the famous northern Presidential Range of the White Mountains. Those lawsuits are ongoing and revolve around similar disputes.
They’ve also challenged logging projects on state land in Vermont and sued chemical manufacturing giant Monsanto over its alleged harmful impacts on water in New England.
New dynamics under Trump
The logging projects have been ongoing across multiple presidential administrations. However, when President Donald Trump retook office in January, Courchesne said he noticed two major conflicting changes happening simultaneously.
“Clearly, at the presidential level and at the top of the agency, there’s a real imperative to get these logging projects going,” he said. “And there’s a real set of commands, through executive orders and other directives, to put more of these national forest lands on the chopping block, so to speak, for reasons that don’t hold up, such as the fact that we have a supposed emergency in the national forests in terms of wildfire risk, which is just not the case in the White Mountains.”
However, at the same time, he said that massive cuts in staffing and funding appear to have hamstrung the Forest Service employees’ ability to work on this quickly.
Trump has taken several actions aimed at opening up more forests to logging across the U.S. Late last month, he announced plans to end the quarter-century-old “roadless rule” and lift restrictions on road construction in nearly a third of U.S. National forest land, a necessary step to build logging infrastructure. Trump also instructed his cabinet secretaries to bypass endangered species laws and other environmental restrictions to allow loggers to tap into more areas. These actions follow a series of executive orders in early March meant to streamline timber production and bypass environmental protection laws on claims of national security and natural disaster risk.

At the Dutch Epicure Shop in Litchfield, Ber and Beverly Welp filled up their basket in no time. Dutch breakfast crisp breads — beschuit as they are known. Two “for now,” Ber says, quickly adding a Dutch breakfast cake and a box of the chocolate sprinkles known as hagelslag that the Dutch eat on bread slathered with butter.


“This reminds me from time as a kid,” said Ber, who grew up in the Netherlands.
Before they are done they will have imported meats, house-baked cookies and of course licorice — to take to their daughter in Alabama. The shop stocks licorice, an obsession among the Dutch, to the tune of about four-dozen different kinds — from sweet to salty, according to owner Wilma Joas.

It is a normal summer Friday in Litchfield County weekender country with a steady stream of customers opting for both Joas’ house-produced baked goods, chocolates and prepared foods as well as the hundreds of items on shelves and cold cases that line and cross the small store.
But for Joas, her current normal may not last much longer. She may soon have to confront yet another challenge on top of several she’s faced over the last decade or so.
This time it’s the Trump tariffs. It doesn’t take much more than a glance around her shop to see why.
All but a few of the products in her store are imported. Most are from the Netherlands with all manner of gouda cheeses, jams, crackers, snacks and of course speculaas — a classic spice cookie — and stroopwafels, which are a coffee-accompaniment wafer cookie with a melting layer in the middle.
There are also Indonesian spices, sauces and noodles — a longstanding byproduct of Dutch colonization of that nation. The rest are from elsewhere in Europe, mainly Germany — an array of mustards and pickled, well, everything. There are French cheeses and butter. And imported meats from all over.
Trump tariffs on the European Union presently are 10%, but are poised to go as high a 50% on July 9 unless Trump changes his mind again. He’s threatened to begin them sooner and then backed off a couple of times already.

Ellie Barrows, a helper at the Dutch Epicure Shop, peers over the cheese counter. All the cheeses are imported from Europe. Most are Dutch Goudas. She thinks tariff-driven price rises on cheese will be more noticeable to customers than those on other imported products because they are considerably more expensive to start with.

Joas isn’t seeing a tariff impact so far. But recently some suppliers began charging her for shipping where they hadn’t before. “It cost me $400 to get a pallet up from New Jersey,” she said.
But she thinks she will be safe even if tariffs kick in. 
“These are such low-ticket items that if it has to go up 50 cents, I think that people are still willing to pay if it’s something that’s so unusual that they can’t get anywhere else,” she said.
“Oh, yeah,” said Beverly Welp. Though Ber hedged a bit. “Depends on if it doubles or something. I don’t know about that,” he said. The couple, who now live in Bethlehem, used to drive an hour or more each way from West Haven just to buy what Joas stocks.
Ines Deseroux, who is French, has been coming to the shop for more than 10 years, first as a part-time renter in the area, now living full time in Litchfield for the past 5 1/2 years.
She was there for ham, cheese, house-made prepared food and Joas’s zucchini cake, a round cake covered in a lemon crunch glaze. Deseroux also often gets candy for her kids, European crackers that are generally unavailable in the U.S., chocolate, sausage, European butter and cream.

And if tariffs cause the prices to go up: “I’ll pay more for stuff that I can only find here, and real ham and real cheese,” she said. “I’m not going to be anti-American, but what she gets is very different.”
Joas is pretty sanguine about the future and has no intention of changing what she sells. This is what the Dutch Epicure Shop is about and has been for nearly 60 years.
“I can’t really do that,” she said, “I’m the Dutch Epicure shop. I’m the last Dutch shop within 100 miles. I can’t believe that a Dutch person is just never going to have anything Dutch again, because it costs a little bit more.”
And she points out, if her prices go up, most likely so will everyone else’s.
“I think the novelty of coming into a shop and seeing those things on the shelf is still what’s keeping me going,” she said. “You just have to learn how to pivot. And after being here all these years since 1967 — you learn how to pivot.”
Pivot — it’s a word she uses a lot.
“Pivot is a great word,” said Danielle Ruggiero, director of programs at the Women’s Business Development Council in Connecticut, or WBDC. “Pivot, nimble, adaptive. Those are all wonderful items to describe any small business owner as they go through their day-to-day.”
Ruggiero said the WBDC is hearing from clients that overseas price quotes now have variables in them based on shipping dates, but not about tariffs specifically.
“This is not unique to the Dutch Epicure shop in Litchfield County. It is happening across the state and across the country,” she said of the need to pivot. “These are not unused muscles for small business owners.”

Pivoting practically nonstop
Tariffs are far from the only seismic changes that have caused Joas to pivot.
A professional chef trained at the Culinary Institute of America, she grew up in the world of baking, which remains her sweet spot — pun intended — along with chocolate making. Joas’ parents bought the shop from a Dutch baker in 1967 when it was a couple of years old. Her father, who is German, was a baker. Her mother, who is Dutch, did the product ordering. 
When they decided to retire in 2002, Joas, at age 31, purchased it from them and came back to Litchfield after years working as a chef for hotels to hospitals, from Colorado to South Carolina and back to New England.
A number of headwinds since then have caused her to pivot. They’ve included Amazon, which made the nationwide product shipping the shop did no longer worthwhile. Twin boys, now 14, made for — well — more than what she and her husband anticipated in baby juggling.
“We thought, ‘oh, we can handle one kid.’ And then, surprise, surprise, here you go. You have twins,” Joas said.
And then there was COVID.

Wilma Joas is a chef by training, but mainly does baking at her Dutch Epicure Shop. Her parents bought the shop in 1967 and she took over from them in 2002. She has adapted to the times over the years, especially during COVID. And she’ll do it again if tariffs hit and to deal with chocolate availability and prices due to climate change. For now she’ll keep making her favorite mocha layer cake. Credit: Jan Ellen Spiegel
Joas said she just kept going. “I heard that they started shutting stores down, and I just stayed open,” she said, telling her husband: “I’m going to work tomorrow. I’m not closing, because if I close, somebody might tell me I can’t reopen.”
It was just her. In at 5 a.m., baking until 9 a.m. and then handling the store all day.
“The store was slammed. We were so busy. Anyone who had a house in New York and a house up here came up here to stay permanently. So all my customers were up here permanently. Every single Airbnb was filled,” she said. “I had people who were buying half a wheel of cheese; they were buying whole salamis.”
Even with lines out the door at times, she shifted to close at 3 p.m. to give herself time to regroup and do all the cooking and baking that was needed. An earlier decision to do more prepared foods like soups and stews turned out to be fortuitous.
“Anything I made, food-wise, prepared-wise, was gone immediately,” she said. “Anything I put out, I sold immediately; literally anything.”
Including toilet paper, which she started stocking for customers who couldn’t get it.
Since then she’s navigated egg shortages and high prices due to bird flu, and ongoing climate-driven high prices due to problems with chocolate crops — both potentially catastrophic for a baker.
She’s downright calm when it comes to tariffs.
“If you’re selling a jar of mustard for $1.40 and it goes up to $2.10 it’s such a small increase,” she said. “It’s not like the car was $20,000 and now it’s $32,000.”
She said she’s set up her business model around, well, pivoting.
“I have a ton of people in the summertime with farmers markets. They bring bread to the farmer market, so I don’t sell as much bread in the summertime,” she explained. “So I just pivoted to something else, and I bought myself an ice cream machine. So in the summertime, I make pints of ice cream.
“I just found a way to have one piece of the business pick up where another piece might fall off.”
Another pivot point: in the aftermath of the popularity surge in the town of Litchfield during COVID, the area is becoming a hot spot for weekend travel — mainly from New York. In the past year or so, three new hotels have opened, along with a new event space for weddings and other celebrations.
The year-round population is stable right now at about 8,200, according to Denise Raap, Litchfield’s first selectman. But weekend visitors want food they can take back to a hotel room or an Airbnb, said Joas.
“That’s why I’m probably going to be pivoting into sandwiches or things they can eat on the road or things they can take back to their room,” she said.
Raap said businesses have always had to do that kind of adaptation. “The ones who are successful, always have to reevaluate their clientele and the ones who don’t usually don’t last,” she said. “We have a lot of longstanding businesses that know what they need to do in order to be successful.”
The Dutch Epicure Shop among them.

Wilma Joas is a trained chef, but baking is her sweet spot. Her father, who owned the shop with his wife from 1967 to 2002, was also a baker.

The next wrinkles
So Joas is already planning ahead, not just for the tariffs that may — or may not — show up, but for the who-knows-what.
She moved to the building next door from the original store about a year-and-a-half ago. “My plan B is I’ll probably cook more, or I will cater in this new store I have here,” Joas said. “I now have a restaurant license, so if I have to start catering, or if I have to start serving food, I have a little area where I could serve food.”
Chocolate, however, that will be a problem and one that will likely get worse, Joas admitted.
“I’ll just feature less things that are chocolate, and the ones that are, will have to go up in price,” she said. “I can see a time where chocolate is a luxury, and it’s not simply something you have all the time because you like it.”
Eggs may not be quite so extreme, since the bird flu problem is expected to diminish. But the pail of broken up eggs she used to get for $40 went up to $120. “Now I’m focusing on recipes that don’t use quite so many eggs.”
Most folks may have forgotten about drought and other issues that affected the California almond crop — the largest in the world — starting several years ago. Joas hasn’t. Almond paste or marzipan is a Christmastime staple and ever-present in much of her year-round baking.
“I remember trying to find buckets of almond paste, looking for different brands, anything I could do to have that in stock,” she said. “That’s a huge money maker for me at Christmastime. So you’re losing a huge portion of your income, and you’re not going to get that back. You can’t start selling Christmas cookies with almonds in January.”
It’s not an unrealistic thing for a small business owner to constantly have to adapt for all kinds of reasons, said Ruggiero of the WBDC. “There’s no shortage of situations for a small business owner where they have to stay nimble,” she said. “It kind of breeds them for these kinds of things like we’re dealing with in terms of tariffs.”
She recommends exactly what Joas is doing: hit it head on, get in front of it and put together a contingency plan.
While she’s calm about handling the impending tariffs, it doesn’t mean Joas isn’t annoyed about them. 
“These are government people who know the effects of what they’re doing I think. They know what a tariff is going to do. No matter how many times you say the Chinese are going to pay for it, that’s just not how it works,” she said. “I don’t think they really care that these small businesses are going to have to bear the brunt of it. There’s a bigger picture that we are simply not part of. We’re the aftereffects.”

Jamie Keppler has been coming to the Dutch Epicure Shop every couple of weeks for years and he will continue to do that if tariffs drive prices up. He says it’s like gas prices: “You can’t worry about what you can’t control.” Credit: Jan Ellen Spiegel
Jamie Keppler of Morris, who says he’s been coming to the Dutch Epicure Shop every couple of weeks “for as long as I can remember,” was in the store for the second day in a row this particular Friday. His dog had gotten the original third-of-a-pound of prosciutto, so he was back for a full pound.
He says he often buys tarts, mustards, all kinds of condiments.
He doesn’t hesitate for a nano-second when asked whether he’ll keep coming if tariffs cause price increases. “Yes,” he says. “It is what it is. Just like gas prices, milk prices, everything. What are you gonna do? You can’t worry about what you can’t control.”
Gayle Carr of Litchfield says she’s been shopping at the store for nearly 30 years. She’s making a pit stop for licorice and candied ginger she calls “the best around.”
“I buy their cheeses. I buy specialty items. I buy bread,” she says. As for tariff driven price increases: “I’m willing to pay it because I am supporting a local business.”
And that local connection is also what buoys Joas, who said sometimes the constant challenges do get disheartening. 
“I have customers who come in here, and I know their children, and I know their grandchildren, and they’ve just been coming here forever. They have the same birthday cake every single year. I have grown men who say, your mom used to give me a cookie all the time,” she said. “It’s such a happy business, and I’m happy to come here every day. It’s really a nice way to spend your career.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Wilma-7-scaled-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-06 05:59:48.563754

The site, pictured in July 2025,  is on East Main Street in Council Grove. (Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)COUNCIL GROVE — Two hundred years ago next month, a trio of white commissioners met with a group of Osage leaders beneath the tallest oak in a mile-wide grove here and, for $800, purchased safe passage and free use of the Santa Fe Trail for trade with Mexico.
It was a steal for the U.S. government.
The Santa Fe Trail was the route, scouted by trader William Becknell in 1821, that connected Missouri to Santa Fe, New Mexico. Most of its 870 miles crossed the length of Kansas, with branching routes in present-day Colorado or Oklahoma. The trail accelerated westward expansion, provided an American invasion route for the Mexican-American war in the 1840s, and was ultimately rendered obsolete in 1880 by the arrival of the railroad in Santa Fe.
Recently I leaned on the iron fence surrounding what is supposed to be the long-dead stump of that great oak, preserved under a kind of mid-century modern pavilion beside East Main Street, and studied the gnarled and knotted wood as if it were a map. Nobody knows if the stump is really from the historic tree that marked the location of the Aug. 10, 1825, treaty, but tradition holds that it is.
When the town celebrated its centennial in 1925, the tree was still living and regarded as the Council Oak. The weeklong event, attended by thousands of white people and a few representatives of the Kaw (or Kansa) Nation, featured fiddling and dancing, a reenactment of the treaty signing, and an airplane that dropped flowers on a newly erected “Tomb of the Unknown Indian.” The rock monument held the skeletal remains of a presumed Kaw chief who had been found washed out in a stream the year before by a group of Boy Scouts, according to a 1990 article by Timothy Fry. A band played a dirge as the body was carried to the monument in a military caisson draped with an American flag.
In visiting the alleged stump of the Council Oak, it occurred to me that no matter how maps are redrawn, the essential character of American power has remained unchanged in two centuries. Since the signing of the Council Oak treaty, political will has been wielded in our name to displace people from their homes. From Native Americans to migrants, the United States has routinely used force to remove or relocate individuals who have committed no crime other than being regarded as alien by the culture in power.
Such an assertion might seem provocative, but not to students of history. In “The Rise and Fall of Indian Country,” the late Willian E. Unrau talks about being handed one of those large maps that used to accompany issues of National Geographic (perhaps they still do, but I haven’t been a subscriber since Rupert Murdoch’s outfit bought the magazine in 2015). The map Unrau referred to defined “Indian country,” in 2004, as 56 million acres of mostly reservation land.
“Above all else the map provided evidence supportive of my own view that Indian country, at bedrock level dating back to 1825,” Unrau writes, “was simply a place, a physical location where the dispossession and suffering of one culture transpired for the benefit of another.”
The idea that we progressively pushed Native Americans from their ancestral homelands to ever smaller reserves in remote and harsh corners of the American West is not new. But the way in which Unrau describes generations of government policy failures that resulted in this diminishment reveals anew our susceptibility to greed, misfired policy and bad faith.
While the acquisition of land is a perennial lure for those who would abuse power, there are other motivators. These include fear, especially during times of war, and the urge to exclude others. These varieties of moral darkness are not unique to the American soul, but we have excelled at practicing them while simultaneously extolling our virtue.
Among the last great abuses was the imprisonment of Japanese Americans in concentration camps during World War II and the Eisenhower administration’s military-style deportations of Mexican nationals in the 1950s, but after a few relatively progressive decades we’ve reverted to our old ways and are again terrorizing migrants. The parallels between our treatment of Native Americans and today’s government-sanctioned war on migrants is striking, with birthright citizenship as a common battleground.
Native Americans weren’t legally counted as Americans until the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924. But because voting rights were controlled by the states, many were denied access to the ballot through literacy tests and other arbitrary measures. Not until the 1970s did the Supreme Court clear away the last voting impediments for Native Americans.
There has hardly been a treaty signed or a promise made to First Peoples that was kept by the U.S. Government, something recognized as early as 1881 by Helen Hunt Jackson in “A Century of Dishonor.” Migrants also face broken promises from a succession of U.S. presidents, from Biden’s clear path to citizenship to Trump’s deportation of those legally in the U.S.
The government’s willingness to honor its obligations appears largely related to the color of one’s skin.
In 1925, the West was widely considered to have been “won” by courage and resourcefulness by settlers of European descent. American power was celebrated by the citizens of Council Grove — and much of the rest of the country — as a near-absolute source of good; the nation depended upon westward expansion to fulfill its God-given destiny. Back in the Council Grove centennial days, Kansas was central to the American narrative. From the coming of Coronado with his (or Father Padilla’s) cross to the opening of the Santa Fe Trail to the last Indian raid, it was all part of the myth of the frontier. At Council Grove the last raid occurred in 1868 when a group of Cheyennes clashed with the Kaw Nation in a dispute over horses. Stories of that largely bloodless confrontation were told and retold during the 1925 celebration.
If you grew up in Kansas, you’re probably familiar with the themes that by 1925 had become state canon. Exploration and faith went hand-in-hand. The historical “Doctrine of Discovery” declared that any lands not held by Christians were ripe for the taking. The Spanish conquistador Coronado came to what is now Kansas in 1541 looking for the golden city of Quivira, guided by a native called “the Turk.” They likely made it as far as present-day Salina but found no riches. Believing “the Turk” had lied, Coronado had him strangled.
With Coronado was Father Padilla, allegedly the first to bring Christianity to America. Coronado returned empty-handed to New Mexico, but Padilla returned to Kansas, the story goes, to minister to the Wichita nation. Venturing against advice into Kaw territory, Padilla was killed. The Kaws say it is unclear who was responsible for his murder.
Coronado and Padilla are traditionally portrayed as heroes in Kansas lore, not as a failed treasure-seeking murderer and a religious zealot. The indigenous peoples they encountered are cast as liars, killers or children awaiting the word of God. Never mind these were members of fully realized civilizations with rich cultures and their own religious and spiritual traditions. My late friend and mentor Don Coldsmith recognized the hypocrisy in the conventional telling and, in 1980, published “Trail of the Spanish Bit,” a novel that flips the story and puts the First Peoples in charge.
Now, in 2025, Council Grove is preparing for its bicentennial.
Instead of a week of events, there is an afternoon of festivities, on Sunday, Aug. 10. Council Grove is a town rich in history — and in historic tree stumps, as Kansas Reflector opinion editor Clay Wirestone noted in a 2022 column. The ostensible Council Oak came down in a storm back in 1958, but the Custer Elm (yes, that Custer) survived to the 1970s and the Post Office Oak made it to 1990.
But history is about more than just dead trees.
Uncomfortable facts about our nation’s past are under increasing attack by the culture currently in power. A recent Trumpian executive order directs federal agencies to present a sanitized version of American history.
“Over the past decade,” the order reads, “Americans have witnessed a concerted and widespread effort to rewrite our Nation’s history, replacing objective facts with a distorted narrative driven by ideology rather than truth. This revisionist movement seeks to undermine the remarkable achievements of the United States by casting its founding principles and historical milestones in a negative light.”
The 1825 treaty with the Osage was certainly a milestone.
Similar treaties were made at about the same time with 10 other plains nations, but it was the Osage and Kaw peoples who had control of most of the territory crossed by the Santa Fe Trail. The Kaws signed on Aug. 16, 1825, at Sora Kansas Creek, in what is now McPherson County. But as Unrau notes in his 2007 book, William Clark — the famed explorer who was made superintendent of Indian affairs by Congress — had already obtained in St. Louis the cession of 20 million acres from the two tribes.
While the Santa Fe Trail enabled remarkable achievement for the dominant culture, it is an objective fact that it contributed to the suppression of others. The recognition that historical events may have had negative consequences is now contrary to the official policy of the executive branch of the United States, which makes an uncensored and inclusive discussion of those events more important than ever.
This is not meant to be an indictment of Council Grove’s bicentennial celebration. Nobody living now is responsible for the events of 1825, or even 1925. The city has the fine interpretive Kaw Mission State Historic Site, where visitors can learn more about the people for whom Kansas was named.
Charles Curtis, who lived as a child on the Kaw reserve, was the first Native American to serve in Congress and as vice-president from 1929 to 1933 under Herbert Hoover. An enrolled member of the Kaw tribe and one-eighth Native American by lineage, Curtis was an advocate of assimilation and the author of an act that called for the abolition of tribal governments.
There are 19 locations across town listed on the National Register of Historic Places, including the Council Oak. Radiocarbon dating on material found at an archaeological site nearby indicates human beings have lived here since about 5,500 years ago.
It is also important to remember that the Kaw were not, and are not, victims, although they have suffered like other nations from U.S. policy. They were forcibly relocated in 1873 from their reservation at Council Grove to Oklahoma, with tribal headquarters at Kaw City. They have a population of about 3,600.
In 2000, the Kaw purchased the land around the Tomb of the Unknown Indian near Council Grove and incorporated it as part of a heritage park. In 2024, a red boulder sacred to the Kaw was reclaimed from Lawrence. The rock had been stolen after the Kansa removal to Oklahoma and, in 1929, refashioned as a monument to European settlers. The rock, whose proper name is Iⁿ‘zhúje‘waxóbe, is now at the Kaw heritage park, within sight of the tomb of the unknown.
“Today, under authority of the U.S. Supreme Court, Indian country is what and where Congress decides,” Unrau concludes. “It can be a high-rise casino encompassing a city block across from a shopping mall. It can be a convenience store and service station complex along a federal or state highway.” And many other things.
In 2125, how will we look back on this period of American history?
Assuming there is still a functioning democracy — which requires more faith with each passing month — will there be interpretive sites dedicated to the mass deportations of the Trump era?
According to the NBC News deportation tracker, there were 55,764 individuals in ICE detention as of June 2. In the previous few months, another 50,000 had been deported. Those numbers, while far short of the millions Trump promised to deport, are similar to the numbers of Native Americans moved west of the Mississippi by the Indian Removal Act of 1830.
There are differences between the removal of Native Americans from ancestral lands and today’s mass deportations, but both have required militarized force by the United States. Then as now, the ultimate fate of the displaced people rests with Congress and the Supreme Court. Birthright citizenship, guaranteed by the 14th Amendment, is under increasing attack by the right.
The weathered trunk of the alleged Council Oak offered me no clues to what the future might bring. But it did offer a reminder of the fluidity of current events, and how those of us whose ancestors were once immigrants are now clamoring to stop others from living on the land we stole.

What is this fascination that people have with monorails?  I can’t tell you how often people suggest them as “the answer” to our state’s clogged roads.
“Why don’t we build a monorail down the middle of The Merritt Parkway?” asked an architect at a recent meeting.  To my astonishment, such an idea was once studied!


As lore has it, back in the mid-1980’s local tech giant Sikorsky was asked by the Connecticut Department of Transportation if a monorail could be built and a plan was submitted.  Sure, such a system could be built, they concluded, but where would you put the stations and the necessary parking?
Since hearing of this white-whale of a tale, shared by Merritt Parkway Conservancy Executive Director Wes Haynes, I have been on a relentless search for details of the proposal, but I’ve come up empty.  Sikorsky has no record of the plan.  CDOT said “Huh?”
Digging through the archives of the Stamford Advocate I found articles from 1985 discussing the idea:  a $700 million monorail down the median of the Merritt Parkway from Greenwich to Trumbull as an alternative to Bridgeport developer Francis D’Addario’s idea of widening the parkway to eight lanes… or double-decking I-95.
Motorists were surveyed and CDOT apparently spent $250,000 for a study.
The amazing research librarians at the State Library dug through their dusty files and came up with a CDOT report from 1987 pooh-poohing the idea, not only on grounds of impracticality but because it would compete with existing rail service.  Heavens no!
In 1998 a monorail was once proposed for Hartford, connecting downtown to Rentschler Field in East Hartford.  It was to cost only $33 million and the cost was supposedly to be paid by the feds.  It never happened.  The idea was revived again in 2006 when the Adriaen’s Landing convention complex was opened, but again, nothing.
A pseudo-monorail “People Mover” system was built at Hartford’s Bradley Airport in 1976 connecting the remote parking to the main terminal, all of seven-tenths of a mile away.  The fixed-guideway system, with cars designed by Ford Motor Company, cost $4 million but never operated because the $250,000 annual operating was cost was deemed impractical.  In 1984 it was dismantled, though you can still see one of the original cars at the Connecticut Trolley Museum in East Windsor.
Whatever your fantasies are about space-age travel by monorail, let me dispel your dreams with some facts.
Monorails are not fast.  The Disneyworld monorail, built by a Japanese company, has a top speed of 55 mph but usually just averages 40 mph.  Even on a bad day Metro-North can better that.  The 3.9 mile long Las Vegas monorail does about 50 mph shuttling losers from casino to casino.
Monorails are expensive.  The Vegas system, opened in 2004, cost $654 million.  That’s why existing monorails like Disney’s have never been extended.
Monorails are not Maglevs.  Don’t confuse the single-track, rubber-tired monorails with the magnetic-levitation technology in use in Shanghai and being tested for passenger trains in Japan.  The Shanghai maglev can travel over 250 mph, the Japanese test trains have hit 374 mph.
No, monorails are not in Connecticut’s future and are not the answer to our woes.​",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/monorail-train.jpg,,,2025-07-06 04:59:31.585297

(Sharon Sullivan for Colorado Newsline)Pedestrians and bicyclists along the Colorado Riverfront Trail in Grand Junction may have noticed something out of the ordinary this spring. In some fenced-off sections near Blue Heron Lake, 700 goats are grazing on an array of invasive species such as tamarisk, Russian olive, kochia, and Russian knapweed.
Grand Junction is using goats to combat noxious weeds to make more room for native plants like cottonwood trees and willows. At the same time, they are lowering the risk of wildfire in this hot, dry, high-desert landscape by reducing the vegetative fuel load.
“It can be hard to stop a fire where there’s lots of vegetation,” said Rob Davis, Grand Junction forester and open space supervisor. “If it gets going on a windy day, and there’s lots of downed debris …with 9 inches of precipitation a year, and high summer temperatures, the fire risk is high. Using goats for grazing is an environmentally-friendly strategy to help us reduce fire risks and knock down some of our invasive weeds.”
Plus, people out recreating enjoy seeing the goats, Davis added.

“There’s that added benefit that people just like it,” he said.
A goatherder watches over the goats and nudges them down the trail after they’ve sufficiently grazed a patch of dead or unwanted vegetation. Goats will typically leave the mature cottonwoods and willows alone. However, the city sometimes places a fence around young trees to keep the goats from munching on the saplings.
On the Front Range in Boulder County, the town of Superior has brought in a herd of 300 goats to graze on its open spaces for both weed control and fire mitigation. The catastrophic Marshall Fire in 2021 destroyed more than 1,000 homes in the region.
Superior first began using goats in 2019, as a sustainable method for vegetation management. After the Marshall Fire the town “doubled down” on using goats for fire mitigation, said Leslie Clark, director of Superior’s parks, recreation and open space.
Superior evaluates its open space properties annually to prioritize where to graze the goats each summer and winter, Clark said. Properties are monitored to gauge results before and after grazing.
“Initial results look positive,” Clark said. “People like the results. The goats reduce the vegetative fuel that contributes to wildfire risk. The goats leave the area looking natural. The city later reseeds the areas with native species to improve biodiversity and reduce the number of noxious weeds.”

Using goats for weed control and fire mitigation is not new. Lani Malmberg, owner of Colorado-based Goat Green, said she was the first company to offer this type of fire mitigation work 25 years ago. She and her goats have been featured in The New York Times, the L.A. Times, and other national publications. She now runs her Goat Green grazing business with her son Donny Benz and his fiancée.
Malmberg, 68, said she conceived the idea of using goats decades ago while studying botany, biology and environmental restoration at then-Mesa State College in Grand Junction. She said she watched how knapweed took over a cornfield while working a summer job in Colorado.
It occurred to her then, “Someone ought to run a business to eat the problem,” Malmberg recalled. “Now there are a lot of goat businesses” — and she has trained people at some of them.
Lockheed Martin uses 1,200 of Malmberg’s goats for fire mitigation at its facility in Littleton. Goat Green has done grazing projects for many Colorado cities in the past, including Castle Rock, Colorado Springs, Castle Pines, Broomfield, Golden, Glenwood Springs and Carbondale.
“Over the past 30 years I have worked in all the Western states, doing fire mitigation in California, New Mexico, Utah, Nevada, Montana and Nebraska,” Malmberg said.
When asked where her company is based, she replied, “Under my hat — wherever I’m on contract.”
“Fire mitigation is a big deal. Open space (managers) are clamoring to get goats. People are jumping into it. It’s an alternative to machinery and chemicals.”
 More environmentally friendly than chemicals

Superior pays for the goat service via grants from FEMA and Boulder County, with matching grants provided by the town of Superior. The program is funded from 2025 through 2027.
Louisville has used goats to control noxious weeds for several years, said Nathaniel Goeckner, the city’s natural resource supervisor. Louisville contracts with Goats on the Go, in Boulder County, to graze 200 goats on open space around Louisville. Depending on the vegetation, the city also uses cattle for fire mitigation work, Goeckner said. Its grazing program is paid for with grants from Boulder County and a city sales tax.
Longmont also uses goats — though not for fire mitigation, said Jim Krick, ecosystem manager for Longmont’s Parks and Natural Resources. The city has brought in goats since 2023 for weed control — targeting kochia in particular, where it competes with native plants. The goats are brought in just before the weeds form and spread their seeds, Krick said. Longmont typically grazes goats on an acre per year based on its budget.

Grand Junction contracts with Ecological Grazing Service, owned by Jennifer Studt, who, along with her husband, raises goats and sheep on a ranch in nearby Loma. She hires a goatherder who stays with the goats the entire time, moving his small camper, and the goats, down the trail when an area is sufficiently grazed.
Studt says goats do particularly well here because they have a more resilient stomach. They can eat poisonous plants like Russian knapweed, which is highly toxic to most animals — but not goats, she said. And, whereas Russian olive seeds pass through other animals’ dung, which then gets repopulated elsewhere, in a goat’s gut the seed won’t survive, Studt said. Therefore, goats don’t spread noxious weeds.
Studt’s goats began grazing along the riverfront May 23 and will finish eating their way along the trail by the end of this month. They’ll return in late October, when other annual weeds begin to germinate.
“There are bucket loads of dead noxious weeds here,” Studt said. “And while goats will eat live plants too, they really like the crunchy, dead material — a lot of other animals not so much. Goats like a lot of roughage in their diet. We’re taking something noxious, poisonous to other animals and turn it into fertilizer which helps overall soil health — which helps the native plants come back.”
Using goats to reduce fuel loads, and invasive plant species is a more environmentally friendly method than using chemicals, Davis said. The Grand Junction program is funded through the city’s operating budget.
Although using goats doesn’t necessarily eliminate the use of herbicides, it reduces the amount of chemicals used in grazing areas, said Grand Junction spokesperson Kelsey Coleman in an email to Colorado Newsline.
The town of Superior contracts with Goat Bros, which Clark said offers educational days when the public can meet the goats close up, and learn how goats improve the environment.
“It’s an opportunity to get closer to the goats,” Clark said. “We don’t want people interacting with them, otherwise — they’re working.”

(Aristide Economopoulos/for NJ MonitorThere’s only one reason gun manufacturers are donating about $2 million to a state-owned shooting range that will open this fall 10 miles north of Rapid City. It’s good business for them. 
And that’s exactly why the South Dakota Department of Game, Fish & Parks, which will manage the facility, is wrong to welcome gun-industry donations. 
I don’t know if spending $20 million to build one of the biggest publicly funded shooting ranges in the nation makes sense as an economic development tool or not. But I’m pretty sure the four gun-industry manufacturers that have pledged $1.9 million in donations to the project — Smith & Wesson, Glock, Aim-Point and Luth-AR — think it will mean bigger profits. 
They will sell more of their product because their names are affiliated with this complex. That’s good news for them, but bad news for most everyone else. It’s bad because, despite the gun industry’s message that the more guns we own, the safer we will be, the truth is just the opposite. America is a country awash in guns, and all the research on gun violence shows that easy, largely uncontrolled access to guns puts all of us in greater danger of being a victim of gun violence.   
Gun-industry companies and groups give $2 million to help build state-owned shooting range

In April, there were 1.2 million guns sold in the U.S. in just one month, according to the federal agency that tracks gun sales. Imagine the profit in those numbers, and the lengths gun companies will go to protect it. More than half of all the guns in private ownership in the world are in the U.S., yet Americans make up only 4% of the world’s population. Ever since 2020, the rate of gun ownership in the U.S. has been on the rise. 
It should come as no surprise that we have experienced a corresponding rise in the rates of gun violence, especially in suicide rates, in that same time period, according to a new report on 2023 gun deaths by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Nearly 80% of gun deaths in South Dakota are suicides, and recent laws passed by the South Dakota Legislature — such as those allowing concealed pistols on college campuses and in bars — may add to those numbers.    
The majority of guns are purchased for reasons that have nothing to do with hunting or shooting sports, and everything to do with the marketing myths created by gun makers. Gun importers looking to sell huge stockpiles of cheap, surplus firearms left over in Europe after World War II found a wide-open market for them in America, and the rest is gun industry history. 
I don’t doubt that the Meade County shooting sports complex will bring economic benefits to local tourism and hospitality sectors, as well as gun and sporting goods stores. Certainly the gun safety training it provides for youth is a good thing. Maybe the range will boost the state’s economy and justify the $13.5 million investment in taxpayer funds it received from the governor-controlled Future Fund. Or maybe it won’t. All that remains to be seen. The only gun owner at our house prefers to take a walk on public lands and shoot at real pheasants, not paper targets, so we won’t utilize the facility. The projected annual cost of running the facility — estimated at $355,000 — might become a burden to the state’s budget that we can ill afford.  
I sympathize with Meade County ranchers and residents who oppose the shooting range. No doubt the sound of firearms discharging — from handguns to .50-caliber machine guns — in what is now quiet grasslands will degrade the quality of life on the surrounding ranches and small rural acreages. It raises concerns about the safety of their livestock and livelihoods, too. Plenty of state lawmakers seemed to agree with the ranchers, given the difficulty the shooting range had in securing state funding before former Gov. Kristi Noem circumvented the Legislature’s will.

Some state legislators say taking donations from the gun industry is bad politics. The critics are right, of course. The optics are bad. Legislators will appear beholden to gun industry interests in the future, given they helped fund a significant portion of a state-run enterprise. But here in South Dakota, the horse is already out of that particular barn. 
The gun lobby hardly needs to purchase more influence with the South Dakota Legislature. Virtually any legislation supported by the gun industry, and the numerous organizations created to promote it, is guaranteed passage in this state. The gun culture is so entrenched here that few legislators dare to question it or support common-sense gun violence prevention legislation such as Red Flag and Secure Storage laws, policies designed to keep guns out of the hands of people who are too young, too untrained, or too emotionally or mentally unstable to buy them. Instead, they vote to welcome guns in bars and on college campuses.    
As a South Dakota taxpayer, I’m opposed to taking funds from the gun industry simply because I don’t want to help them advertise and sell more of their lethal product. The 27 words that comprise the entirety of the Second Amendment speak about the right of citizens to “bear” and to “keep” arms, not any right of corporations to “sell” or “manufacture” or “market” them. 
It’s clear our government has a responsibility to protect the constitutional rights of people to own firearms. But as a country, we have absolutely no responsibility to help the gun industry increase its profits, and we shouldn’t make deals that will do so.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/20230211gunOrama05-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-05 13:16:54.943710

A six-year reconstruction project on the jetty is about to wrap up. (Photo by Taylor Balkom/The Columbian)CLATSOP SPIT — For most of the past two years, Jesse Allen has worked 12 hours a day, seven days a week operating a crane to move sedan-sized boulders miles out into the mouth of the Columbia River.
“You don’t want it to slip out and drop,” Allen said, sitting in the 240-ton crane’s cab Friday. “So when you grab a rock, you just think, ‘Yeah, that’ll work, that should hold,’ and you go for it.”
Allen and nine others at specialized construction firm J.E. McAmis have already precisely placed about 32,000 numbered stones as part of their contract to restore the half of U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ roughly 6-mile-long South Jetty that’s battered by the Pacific Ocean.
Now, after six years of work and with just a couple hundred feet of jetty left to rehabilitate, the $172 million project is nearly complete.
The South Jetty functions alongside two smaller stone barriers in Washington. Together, they allow commercial ships to cross the notoriously dangerous stretch of water where 2 million gallons of Columbia River water crashes into the churning, storm-prone Pacific every second.
The trio of jetties work with dams and channel dredging to support an estimated $31 billion in goods that international shippers move on the river each year. Those products include Japanese cars, American grain and Canadian mineral fertilizers.
“The mouth of the river is the gateway to the entire system,” said Neil Maunu, executive director of the Pacific Northwest Waterways Association, a trade association representing regional shippers, ports, businesses and public agencies. “It must function to allow the whole system to work.”
How the jetty works
Army Corps’ engineer and geologist Colter Bennett runs the jetty restoration project on the government side. As engineer-in-training Taylor Jacobs drove a beefed-up golf cart out on the jetty, Bennett explained the project’s history.
“The original construction of this was absurd,” Bennett called over his shoulder. “Trestle system with rail on top, and then a steam-powered train that would deliver the rocks.”
That 10-year initial project started in 1885, spurred by hundreds of shipwrecks along the ever-changing Graveyard of the Pacific.
Given that it’s battered by continuous surf, as well as periodic 40-foot swells every year, the jetty has needed about a dozen significant repairs throughout its life, Bennett said.
But the current project is the most significant and maybe the most needed.
“What we’re driving on, about 12 feet of it didn’t exist,” Bennett said, bumping down the new construction Friday. “Prior to this project, the ocean had beaten the jetty down to the point where 12 feet of rock essentially was missing through this entire section.”
Other sections had been knocked below water level, even at low tide. Raising the jetty by as much as 22 feet isn’t cheap, and it hasn’t been easy. Standing on Allen’s crane later that day, Bennett explained why the Corps is going to all the trouble.
“If this jetty was gone tonight,” he said, “within a few days — maybe less, a few tide cycles — the federal navigation channel would go from 40, 45 feet deep to too shallow for ships to come in and out.”
That’s because the jetties work to narrow the mouth of the Columbia, pinching the river and speeding up the current to prevent sediment from settling to the bottom.
Although the Columbia stretches to 10 miles wide at some points just upriver, the distance between the north and south jetties is less than one-fourth that.
An engineering marvel
After spending the past six years with J.E. McAmis working his way from a machinery operator miner to quarry supervisor at the firm, Cody Pierson now runs the jetty project for the construction contractor.
Standing 3 miles out on the jetty Friday, Pierson offered details about the team as his walkie-talkie crackled.
“We got three haul truck drivers, one loader operator, two people in the office, me, the crane operator, there’s a spotter and then that excavator operator,” he said, pointing at a giant excavator gripping a Volkswagen Beetle-sized boulder below.
The team works together as a single organism placing stones — some about as big as a 40-foot shipping container and weighing about 40 tons — precisely down to the inch.
The stones are dense Oregon and Washington-mined diabase, blueschist and greenschist. Their time underground is brought to an abrupt end when McAmis miners trigger explosives packed down drilled shafts.
From there, heavy machinery breaks them into chunks before they’re either barged by ocean or driven by truck to Clatsop Spit. Haul truck drivers then take them out on the jetty to Allen, the crane operator, who passes each off to the heavy machine operator aided by a spotter.

That last job is key to making sure this latest version of the jetty enjoys a long life, explained Bennett, the Corps’ engineer.
“Every stone is inspected to be placed a certain way,” he said. “The spotter works in tandem with the operator to inspect all dimensions of the stone.”
Each boulder must fit together snuggly. More complicated still, they must be positioned so their smaller end absorbs the ocean’s blows, and the larger more solid end anchors them in place.
“Every rock that’s put down is touched with survey equipment to make sure it’s within a tolerance,” Bennett said.
Workers make it possible
That high-pressure work is further complicated by the fact construction on the jetty must be halted each winter because of the location’s extreme weather.
Keeping up the work demands an intense focus and dedication from the deft workers that Bennett said shows in a variety of ways.
“They’re essentially just doing a puzzle all day,” he said. “Every operator I’ve ever worked with has said that when they’re going to sleep, they’re seeing this stuff.”
That’s true for Allen, who Bennett said is one of less than 100 people around the country who could do his job — a fact partly responsible for his compensation, which ranges from $220,000 to $250,000 a year.
Outside the crane’s control room Friday, dozens of pelicans swirled above, cormorants dove for young salmon below and sea lions gathered on the last 200 feet of jetty still to be rebuilt.
Allen believes in the work he’s spent the last six years doing, values the camaraderie the jetty team shares and appreciates the scenery. But with a family at home and a ranch to run, too, the 45-year-old estimates he only has another decade before he trades his current riverview for one that’s a little more relaxing.
“We just see all the guys having a good time enjoying the retired life fishing,” he said. With a grin, he added, “We’re thinking where we went wrong.”
The Corps and J.E. McAmis expect the project to wrap up by the end of this summer. Meanwhile, J.E. McAmis is already working on another sediment control project, this one just a few miles away on Sand Island.

But usually, behind every story of someone we’re calling a “squatter” occupying a vacant property is a larger crisis: rising housing expenses, declining wages, and a generational commitment to sabotaging our social safety net.
Squatting in Maryland isn’t new, but recent viral videos and sensationalized news stories have raised concerns about it as a growing threat to property owners and neighborhood safety. This framing is misguided. This isn’t about relative “bad actors.” It is about systemic failings forcing people into dire situations.
If we are to understand the causes for the rise of squatting, we must discuss the absence of affordable housing. The Maryland housing market is increasingly out of reach for low- and moderate-income residents. According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, a full-time worker earning minimum wage in Maryland would need to work 100 hours a week just to afford a modest two-bedroom apartment at fair market rent. And it is even worse in Baltimore, Prince George’s County and Montgomery County, with decades of rent increases far outpacing wage growth.
Public investments in housing have simultaneously dwindled. Federal housing assistance has not kept pace with housing needs, and only one in four eligible households will get help. Maryland also has patchy eviction protection policies and inconsistent enforcement. When individuals slip through the cracks, informal housing alternatives, including squatting, emerge as survival practices.

To be clear, squatting is not a permanent fix, nor should it be glorified. However, we have to stop viewing it as an inconvenience to be legally addressed, and instead, tackle the source of the issue: inequity. A large portion of those seeking shelter in vacant structures are leaving unsafe housing conditions, fleeing domestic violence or are recently evicted. Some are young adults leaving foster care. Some are people with disabilities or unemployed. The commonality is affordable and stable housing.
Squatting is then the visible end of an iceberg. The underbelly of that iceberg includes systems flaws, including a stripped-down social safety net, defunding of mental health services and the criminalization of poverty. And Maryland is not alone. All over the country, municipalities are evicting encampments without solutions, states are passing laws to criminalize homelessness, and federal programs are both inadequate.
The erosion of affordable housing is not incidental; it is the result of policy decisions. Since the 1980s, Democratic and Republican administrations have prioritized tax credits for housing development rather than aggressively building deeply affordable public housing and have not established units for the lowest-income sector. We have a plethora of buildings developed through the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC), but none of the housing is operationalized at the highest need.
Maryland stands at a fork in the road. We can continue excursions in pathologizing poverty and depend upon law enforcement to make them go away. Or we can truly invest in good, durable options, such as expanding Housing First programs, establishing statewide rent stabilization policies, and building deeply affordable housing, not just housing for young people/new workers or market-rate apartments with several units subsidized.
This will take political will and courage. This will mean rejecting the notion that housing instability and homelessness are the consequence of individual dysfunction. This will mean accepting that housing, beyond being a commodity, is a human right.
We also must stop using the term “squatters” and implying that they are “stealing” homes. In most cases, these homes have been abandoned – some in foreclosure limbo, and most owned by absentee owners. The real theft is not around people working to survive; it is a lack of accountability for not honoring the public will to care for others.
If Maryland truly wants to be a model on this front, it cannot rely solely on viral fear-based slogans or strategic, piecemealed solutions, but instead needs an audacious, justice-based housing agenda that prioritizes that all individuals, no matter income levels, have a safe and secure place they can call home.
Squatting is not an epidemic. Inequity is the epidemic. If we want to stop homeless neighbors from occupying vacant buildings and homes, we need to give them real homes.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DSC03645-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-05 11:00:36.272081

But the myth of the loner, tough guy, and emotionally disconnected stoic is the topic of a new memoir, written by notable Montana author Russell Rowland, who also writes a bimonthly column for the Daily Montanan.
“Be A Man: Raised in the Shadow of Cowboys” chronicles Rowland’s life from upbringing to his adulthood in which he struggles with growing up, becoming a man and assimilating into the West, where every male must live up to that archetype, which Rowland said is an untrue creation of Hollywood.
Rowland grew up on a ranch in Wyoming, not far from the Montana border, before moving to Billings. His memoir paints a picture of a father who was aloof and an alcoholic, coupled with a mother with a fiery temper who would avoid discussing the painful parts of life.
That led to Rowland’s own isolation, alcoholism and a pool of anger that would burst out occasionally as rage. The memoir is part explanation, part outreach to let others — especially men — know the manly cowboy image is far from the truth.
Instead, the book also holds up the ideal of working together against a wide-open and sometimes unforgiving environment, relying on community and family, and developing a comfort with feelings. Rowland said those discoveries have taken him more than 20 years of writing and rewriting before finishing the memoir. Along the way, he’s also cut out several passages, rewritten other parts, making it less of a vendetta against the past and those who harmed him, and more about seeing the unreal expectations that the West places on its men.

“We also seem to have this idea that abusive men are incurable,” Rowland said.
He watched the transformation of his father, especially after he quit drinking — a story that replayed itself in Rowland’s life. That transformation that began with sobriety also led to deeper understanding about what is possible.
“This is to let other men and women know that I experienced and overcame uncontrollable anger,” Rowland said. “I wanted to explore where it came from, and why it seemed like I couldn’t stop.”
From a very early age, Rowland said he kept repeating a pattern of frustration, tension and tantrums.
“I had no tools,” he said. “It just didn’t go away. I would replay sh-t in my head until it just exploded.”
He lived in the shadow of his father, who Rowland said was “perpetually unsatisfied by his life” and parents who seemed to always be quarreling.
“My father would just distance himself,” he said.
Rowland’s mother is still living, and he said it was a challenge to write the stories honestly, as it was a challenge for her to read it.
Her reaction has been a mix of feeling horrible and not remembering some of the incidents.
“Naturally, she was concerned with what other people would think,” Rowland said.
Even though his father didn’t live long enough to see “Be A Man” make it into print, Rowland said he’s pretty sure he knows what he’d think.
“I think Dad would have had an easier time with it. He was actually pretty open-minded once he got sober,” Rowland said.
Both father and son trying to live a life of sobriety would sometimes lead to talking about the past.
“We had a lot of pretty frank conversations,” Rowland said. “I just decided the issues were important. The question of how to treat women and develop friendship with other men — we didn’t learn how to do that. We don’t do that in the West.”
What finally nudged Rowland toward finishing the book was during researching what has been arguably his most successful book, “56 Counties” — a travelogue and history of Montana’s 56 counties. It was during researching the history of Montana that he discovered something that struck him: Early pioneer men didn’t quite fit that pattern of stoic, hardened cowboy that is often portrayed.
“They were way more emotionally vulnerable than I had expected,” Rowland said.
Instead, Rowland blames a traveling writer from the East, Owen Wister, who wrote “The Virginian,” which became a runaway success more than a century ago, and the template for many cowboy or western-themed novels, movies and songs.
During research for the book, Rowland said he watched many western films — something he had done often. But this time it was different. He noticed different things.
“I was shocked at how often men would beat women on screen — just smack them around,” he said. “I noticed how often they weren’t married, or didn’t have a girlfriend. And, even when they would kiss a woman, they would just grab the woman and kiss them.
“Men didn’t know how to develop relationships not just with women, but with other men.”
He realize that this was the archetype or character that not only was admired by those living in the West, but the type of person many parents encouraged their young men to emulate.
“The cowboy myth is that if you’re a real man, if you got your sh-t together, nothing bothers you. But nobody is like that,” Rowland said. “We have one of the highest rates of suicide in the nation, especially men in rural communities who aren’t allowed to deal with their problems or what’s troubling them.”
He said that led to a life defined by one emotion, anger.
“I didn’t know how to talk about feelings,” he said. “I had to learn a whole new language.”
That came after he joined the United States Navy and got in trouble while fighting on a ship. The captain recommended he seek some counseling for his anger.
That meant confronting the brokenness in his own relationships, including being a combative if not abusive husband.
“It gave me empathy for my victims,” he said. “That’s not fun. That was tough. You have to realize that you hurt people that you were supposed to be protecting.”
Rowland hopes that by sharing his stories — even the difficult or unflattering ones — that it will give the strength to other men isolated by anger to seek connection and healing.
Ironically, it was working through the mythology of the cowboy that gave Rowland a new appreciation for those things in the western culture that are more savory.
“There are good qualities including perseverance and the ability to adapt and change that come from our Western heritage,” Rowland said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Be-a-Man-Russell-Rowland-scaled-e1751570894673-1024x923.jpg,,,2025-07-05 11:00:36.272081

The detention center was opened on June 16, and, with a capacity of 1,800, the facility has been called the largest detention center in the Midwest, as well as the subject of several earlier protests this year. 
The Independence Day event was organized by local immigrant advocacy groups, including No Detention Centers in Michigan, Cosecha Michigan, GR Rapid Response to ICE, and Lakeshore Rapid Response to ICE.

The date was an intentional choice: July 4, the media release noted, is a day for “reflecting on freedom as an ideal and spending time with family and loved ones.” As such, advocates gathered outside the facility to highlight the apparent disconnect between Independence Day and mass incarceration.
Speakers used the event to emphasize the controversies surrounding the GEO Group— the federally contracted private company that operates the North Lake facility.
As the nation’s primary prison operator, GEO has been scrutinized for influencing immigration and criminal justice policy in ways that expand incarceration for profit.
During the 2024 election cycle, GEO and its subsidiaries donated almost $1,000,000 to political candidates, with around 90% of funds going to GOP candidates. 
In particular, the GEO Group has closely aligned itself with President Donald Trump. Trump’s first term saw 237 new contracts between GEO and the federal government. Furthermore, nearly 71% of the GEO Group’s funding is sourced from ICE. The Trump Administration’s emphasis on mass detention only serves to benefit the GEO Group.
Indeed, the Trump Administration’s budget bill allotted $170 billion to immigration enforcement and detention, with $45 billion earmarked specifically for detention facilities like North Lake.

The People’s Assembly of Detroit was unable to attend the event, but sent a statement that was read aloud at the protest addressing the June 30 ICE arrests on Detroit’s west side resulting in the arrest and detention of Marcos Fabian Arita Bautista, an undocumented immigrant from Honduras 
The group was formed earlier this year in response to the influx of anti-immigrant rhetoric and action and works to provide ongoing support, legal counsel, and mutual aid to families impacted by detention and deportation of their loved ones. Additionally, the People’s Assembly has established a network throughout the area, reaching out to schools, community groups, clubs, and churches.
In a statement to the Detroit Free Press, ICE described Bautista as an “illegal alien from Honduras who had been removed twice from the U.S.” 
Bautista first came to the U.S. in 2015. He was then deported to Honduras. He returned in 2018 and was subsequently deported for a second time. ICE also noted that, in 2022, Bautista pleaded guilty to driving an unregistered vehicle, operating without required financial responsibility, and assigning improper title in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania. 
While ICE’s remarks provide a concise timeline of events, the People’s Assembly offered additional context. The group said Bautista was on his way to work June 30 when he noticed ICE agents were following him, at which point he returned to his home and family. Despite the efforts of neighbors and community advocates, ICE broke down the door, entered the home, and detained Bautista.
In recounting the events, the People’s Assembly elaborated on what this experience was like for the family.
”ICE didn’t care about terrorizing the children. ICE had their sniper guns pointed at a little girl’s bedroom window in the house with young children and Marcos’ pregnant sister inside,” the statement read. “ICE didn’t care about anything. ICE broke the door down violently and invaded the house without permission. ICE has not allowed him to speak with his family at all this week.”
However, the statement went on to add that the family and the community are grateful for the demonstrations of bravery and solidarity.
“This is what we all need to be doing right now,” the message concluded.  “We have to rise up together against fascism, violence, and racism. We have to show that we, the people, do not want more detention centers. We want our community to be cared for, and for families to be able to work, play, worship, and learn in safety and peace.”

(Photo courtesy of Washington governor’s office)Slow revenue growth continues to pinch state budgets across the country, leading governors to propose spending cuts, hiring freezes and some tax increases.
In its spring survey of states, the National Association of State Budget Officers found that general fund spending will hold steady in fiscal 2026 as states expect limited revenue growth but increased costs.
Though most states are meeting or exceeding 2025 revenue projections, a growing number are downgrading their revenue expectations for the next fiscal year, Shelby Kerns, executive director of the national association, said in a news release.
“In a number of states, we’re seeing expenditure projections outpacing revenue growth, forcing policymakers to make hard choices in order to balance their budgets,” Kerns said.
Iowa’s revenue shortfall becomes political fodder for 2026 campaign

States typically wrap up budget work by the end of June, with the next fiscal year beginning July 1. Kerns said the organization anticipates states may need to make mid-year budget adjustments depending on upcoming federal changes in tax policy and spending.
In recent years, many states have been flush with an influx of federal pandemic aid and strong tax revenues from a booming national economy. But with the end of pandemic aid, an uncertain economic future and deep cuts to state taxes, many lawmakers this year confronted major budget challenges in statehouses.
Just weeks after signing a budget that required deep spending cuts and increased taxes, Washington Democratic state Gov. Bob Ferguson told state agencies to prepare for even more belt tightening.
“We will very likely continue to face a challenging state budget environment in the coming year and anticipate increasing caseloads and ongoing uncertainty in the economy and federal funding,” said a June 4 memo from the governor’s budget director to agency leaders, according to the Washington State Standard.
Still, many states continue to tout major levels of reserve funds.
The National Association of State Budget Officers found at least 30 states expect to maintain a rainy-day fund balance exceeding 10% of their general fund expenditures. This year, 29 states grew their reserve funds, with the majority of states expected to continue to grow their savings next fiscal year.
In Tennessee, general fund revenue growth is slowing, but state leaders were able to rely on $1.5 billion in unspent state funds and $700 million in interest earnings from federal pandemic funds, the Tennessee Lookout reported.
“Despite tighter fiscal conditions, states overall remain in a solid fiscal position with rainy day funds at near all-time highs, low debt levels, and strong credit ratings,” David Thurman, Tennessee’s budget director and current association president, said in the group’s news release.

Alaska figures prominently in a new U.S. Geological Survey report about oil and gas potential on the nation's federal lands. (Photo by Bob Wick/U.S. Bureau of Land Management)About half of what’s known as “the estimated undiscovered technically recoverable” oil lying below federal lands is in Alaska, as is more than a quarter of estimated natural gas, according to a new report from the U.S. Geological Survey.
The national total estimate for this category of resources on federal lands is about 29.4 billion barrels of oil and 391.5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, according to the USGS report.
Of that, almost 14.5 billion barrels of oil is in Alaska, with 14 billion of that amount on the North Slope, according to the report. Of these estimates of natural gas on federal lands across the nation, about 111 trillion cubic feet is believed to be in Alaska, with almost all of that on the North Slope as well, according to the report.
Technically recoverable oil refers to the amount that could be recovered through existing technology, regardless of economics. The category differs from economically recoverable oil. And the report only considers what is “undiscovered” — that is, what has not been drilled, but is estimated to exist based on the current knowledge of the geology.
The new report comes as the Trump administration is pushing for expanded oil development on federal territory in Alaska, especially the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, both on the North Slope.
“American Energy Dominance is more important than ever, and this report underscores the critical role science plays in informing our energy future,” Doug Burgum, secretary of the Department of the Interior, said in a statement. “Thanks to the USGS’s rigorous and independent assessment, we’re better equipped to manage America’s vast public lands responsibly while supporting energy security and economic opportunity.” 
The UGSG report, part of a periodic series authorized by laws enacted in 2000 and 2005, uses data from several past resource estimates. Those past recourse estimates generally used different parameters.
A 1998 report issued by the service estimated that U.S. federal lands held 7.8 billion barrels of technically recoverable but undiscovered oil and 201.1 trillion cubic feet of technically recoverable but undiscovered natural gas.
However, that 1998 report considered only conventional oil and natural gas. It did not include unconventional resources — shale oil and what’s known as “tight” oil and gas, trapped in impermeable rock, as well as coal-bed gas – that are now produced through fracking techniques.
The new report includes those unconventional types of oil and gas.
The Alaska estimates in the new report are in line with other past USGS estimates for the state.
The most recent report on estimated technically recoverable reserves in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge had a mean estimate of 7.7 billion barrels for the federal lands within the refuge. That estimate, in a report issued in 2016, excluded Native-owned lands and state territory.
A 2017 USGS report that focused largely on the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska had a mean estimate of 8.8 billion barrels of technically recoverable oil. That report was specifically about the Nanushuk and Torok geologic formations, which lie mostly in the reserve but also extend to state lands. The Willow project being developed by ConocoPhillips is within the reserve and holds oil from the Nanushuk formation. The Pikka project being developed by Santos and Repsol, located on state land just outside the reserve, also holds Nanushuk oil.
The new report splits estimated Alaska resources by geography. While the vast majority of estimated resources are attributed to the North Slope, the report presents estimates for technically recoverable resources in Central Alaska and Southern Alaska as well. For federal lands in Central Alaska, which includes Interior and Western Alaska, the total for oil is 100 million barrels and the total for natural gas is 3.2 trillion cubic feet, according to the report. For federal lands in Southern Alaska, which includes the Matanuska-Susitna Borough and the Kenai Peninsula, the oil total is 299 million barrels and the natural gas total is about 3.75 trillion cubic feet, according to the report.

The nonprofit dedicated to bridging the tech and digital divide in Mississippi focused on AI’s real world impact with talks, virtual sessions, classes and hands-on workshops throughout the month. At this closing event, a suite of eight vehicles parked outside offered a low-key intro to the breadth of EV possibilities. 
Bean Path founder and CEO Nashlie Sephus brought her own 2023 Rivian R1T all-electric pickup to the show-and-tell, pointing out features like the Gear Tunnel where she can stash groceries, a flashlight and speaker that can pop out, a spacious front truck, an air compressor on the back, and plugs and outlets all around. 
“I’m a truck girl,” said Sephus, a principal AI scientist at Amazon Web Services, and also a gardener and a frequent traveler between her Atlanta office and native Jackson. An EV that can haul stuff, make the distance on one charge and work nicely for daily use ticked the boxes. 
She highlighted AI features, too, such as Amazon Alexa, automatic raising or lowering depending on terrain, navigation aid (helpful with Atlanta traffic, she said) and automatic battery cooldown if it anticipates a stop to charge. 
So, it does the thinking for you? “It tries to,” she said. “That’s what AI is supposed to do.” 
In a state rating among the lowest for EV registrations, the show was a chance to chat candidly with dealership reps and private owners, get a closer look and get pictures, too.

Jaden Luckett, 25, was all smiles for photos, sitting behind the wheel of a Porsche Taycan brought by Porsche Jackson. Trying it on for size, he happily reported a good fit and pictured his 1-year-old, Jakari, in the back seat. Could he see one of these in his driveway someday? 
“First, I got to get a driveway,” he joked. But, this opened his mind to possibilities.
Porsche Jackson General Sales Manager Lewis BeCoats said, “This helps us help the community, to show what we have and then get other people exposed to fully electric vehicles, and the advantage they have in your life once you accept them in.” He brought the Taycan and Macan EV, and zoomed through a quick list of benefits, including the absence of oil and filter changes.
Range anxiety and charging opportunities were hot topics for questions. Travelers want to be able to fill up and drive all the way to their destination, BeCoats said, but “there’s not many cars that do that on gas.” 
Rest stops are also a good time to recharge the EV. “As long as you plan, it’s the perfect vehicle.” People are often quick to embrace the quiet, smooth ride and performance, he said. And, “for those who are green leaf people, it doesn’t put any emissions into the atmosphere.”

Mart Shearer’s “Use Lightning, Not Dinosaurs” T-shirt fit the occasion as he leaned against his small blue 2017 BMW i3 (his second EV) and talked up its suitability for an urban commuter. Fuel efficiency and gas savings started him on this road back in 2003 with a Toyota Prius Hybrid, and he had been looking at EVs since 2012. When an electric smart car turned up at the Mercedes dealer in 2019, he drove up for a look. It didn’t have much charge, they told him, but a turn around the lot was all it took. 
“Just in the drive around the parking lot, every problem with the gasoline version of the car was gone.”
A member of EV Mississippi car club on social media, Shearer sees a pretty rapid adoption rate for EVs for a predominantly rural state. 
“There are places like Jackson or Southaven or the Golden Triangle or the Gulf Coast, you see EVs everywhere,” he said, noting that even a small town Mississippi police department added a Tesla to its patrol fleet. “That tells you somebody made the calculations, ‘Is this going to save money for the public?’ and the answer is ‘Yes.’” 
Chargers will come, Shearer said. Jackson just added 10 new public chargers in June. “People look at public charging and we need more of it,” he said, “but the reality is, most of your charging is done at home in your own driveway, unless you live in an apartment.” 
“Cute, isn’t it?” Celestial Gordon-Griffin said, admiring the breezy blue and white Volkswagen Buzz, sporty Porche Taycan and more. “I’m always so in awe about everything that the Bean Path is doing.” 
She is keen to have her two teenagers realize the importance of tech. 
“My son loves to play video games, and I keep telling him if he learns how to code, he can build his own… I want him to just get bitten by the bug.” She hoped this EV focus could capitalize on his fascination with cars, plus, “Knowing that we’re really doing our part for global warming … It’s really good to see this.”
Making emerging technologies approachable and non-intimidating is key at the Bean Path, as is targeting those who usually lack access and exposure to them. 
“We cover senior adults, we cover our K-12, we also cover our mom and pop shops, our small business owners, our startup companies,” Sephus said. 
“We meet people where they are,”  zeroing in on their core interests to show technology links and spark curiosity. “That’s how we build our ecosystem here in Mississippi.”
Cameron Wilson, a volunteer with American Association of Blacks in Energy (AABE) was on hand as a ChatGPT coach, helping those at computer stations craft questions for generative AI to write a story, start a nonprofit to solve a community problem or start a business. 
“The biggest thing that I say is to not be afraid of technology, and to use it for positive and good things.
“The hardest thing to do is start,” he said. “Once you get the question in the door, and you see that ChatGPT really has the power to give you in-depth details, it’s just using your imagination and going from there.”
Brittany Myburgh of Family STEAM Day partner Mississippi AI Collaborative noticed the growth from 2024’s first AI Month, when many needed a basic AI 101 course, to participants’ growing confidence and curiosity for specific applications this year. 
“It feels like there is momentum. There’s a movement.”
Retiree Jesse Huffman was among those catching the wave. He learned about working a laser, 3D printing and drone flying at the Bean Path, and now enjoys projects on his own printer and flies his own drone. 
“There’s some knowledge down here at the Bean Path,” said Huffman, who helped himself to it. “I tell everybody, it’s just like a gym, though instead of exercising your muscles, you exercise your brain.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/03154937/NashlieSephustruck1.jpeg,,,2025-07-05 10:01:42.247144

Sign up for their newsletter here.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency placed 139 employees on administrative leave Thursday, an agency spokesperson confirmed, after they signed a “Stand Up for Science” petition using their official titles and EPA positions.
The affected employees received an email, shared with Inside Climate News, informing them that they are on leave through July 17, pending an investigation into whether they used work time or resources when signing the petition.
The email emphasizes that “this is not a disciplinary action.”
One employee, who asked not to be named, said they signed the petition “on a Sunday on my own device.”
“I’d be shocked if anyone used work resources,” the employee went on. “We’ve taken ethics training and are aware of the law.”
While the employees are on leave, they are prohibited from using government equipment, including cell phones, logging into government-issued computers, contacting any EPA employees for access to information and performing any official EPA duties.
An EPA spokesperson wrote in an email that the agency “has a zero-tolerance policy for career bureaucrats unlawfully undermining, sabotaging, and undercutting the administration’s agenda as voted for by the great people of this country last November.”
The EPA also alleged that the petition contains misleading information, but did not specify what is incorrect.
The petition, addressed to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin and members of Congress, is a “declaration of dissent” with the administration’s policies, “including those that undermine the EPA mission of protecting human health and the environment.”
“Since the Agency’s founding in 1970, EPA has accomplished this mission by leveraging science, funding, and expert staff in service to the American people,” the petition reads. “Today, we stand together in dissent against the current administration’s focus on harmful deregulation, mischaracterization of previous EPA actions, and disregard for scientific expertise.”
More than 200 EPA employees, including retirees, signed the petition, some of them only by initials. The document criticizes the agency for “undermining the public trust” by issuing misleading statements in press releases, such as referring to EPA grants as “green slush funds” and praising “clean coal as beautiful.”
The petition also accuses the administration of “ignoring scientific consensus to benefit polluters,” most notably regarding asbestos, mercury and greenhouse gases.
Health-based regulatory standards are being repealed or reconsidered, including drinking water limits for four PFAS “forever chemicals” that cause cancer.
“The decisions of the current administration frequently contradict the peer-reviewed research and recommendations of Agency experts. Such contradiction undermines EPA’s reputation as a trusted scientific authority. Make no mistake: your actions endanger public health and erode scientific progress—not only in America—but around the world.”
Signatories also lambasted the EPA for reversing progress on environmental justice, including the cancellation of billions of grant dollars to underserved communities and the removal of EJScreen, a mapping analysis tool that allowed the public to see pollution sources, neighborhood demographics and health data.










“These are trumped-up charges against EPA employees because they made a political statement the Trump administration did not like.”


– Nicole Cantello, American Federation of Government Employees


The petition also opposes the dismantling of the Office of Research and Development, whose work forms the scientific basis for federal rulemaking.
Nicole Cantello is president of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) Union Local 704, and leader of AFGE Council 238, a nationwide union that represents over 8,000 EPA employees.
She said the EPA’s allegations are baseless.
“These are trumped-up charges against EPA employees because they made a political statement the Trump administration did not like,” Cantello said. “Now the Trump administration is retaliating against them.”
Cantello said the union will fight for the employees on several legal grounds, including First Amendment protections and employment contractual rights. “We’ll be using all of them to defend our people,” she said.
Matthew Tejada, the former director of the EPA’s environmental justice program and currently senior vice president of environmental health at the Natural Resources Defense Council, blasted the Trump administration for going after the EPA employees who signed the letter.
These civil servants, he said, were “totally within their rights” to speak out. “This is a public declaration by those employees that they continue to fight to do their jobs to help people across this country live healthier, safer, more prosperous lives,” Tejada said.
Tejada emphasized that the individuals involved were not working in coordination with advocacy groups, but acting independently in defense of the agency’s mission and the public interest.
He called the administration’s reaction “another indication that this administration is unique in modern times for having zero regard for the Constitution, for protecting and supporting the people of the United States.”
“We are in completely unprecedented waters here,” Tejada said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/PFAS_firefighting-foam-FEMA-photo-1024x512-1.jpg,,,2025-07-05 09:03:50.043782

(Photo by Shalina Chatlani/Stateline)LAKE PROVIDENCE, La. — East Carroll Parish sits in the northeastern corner of Louisiana, along the winding Mississippi River. Its seat, Lake Providence, was a thriving agricultural center of the Delta. Now, the town is a shell of its former self. Charred and dilapidated buildings dot the small city center. There are a few gas stations, a handful of restaurants — and little to no industry.
Mayor Bobby Amacker, 79, says at one point “you couldn’t even walk down the street” in Lake Providence’s main business district because “there were so many people.”
“It’s gone down tremendously in the last 50 years,” said Amacker, a Democrat. “The town, it looks like it’s drying up. And it’s almost unstoppable, as far as I can tell.”
Now, East Carroll residents stand to lose even more. Like many people in Louisiana, they received a lifeline when the state expanded Medicaid to more low-income adults in 2016. Expansion drove Louisiana’s uninsured rate to the lowest in the Deep South, at 8% in 2023 for working-age adults, according to state data, despite it having the highest poverty rate in the U.S. that year.

This week, the U.S. Senate approved President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful” tax and spending bill. It includes more than $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, the joint state-federal health insurance program for poor families and individuals, to help pay for tax cuts that mostly benefit the rich. The legislation would cause 11.8 million more Americans to become uninsured by 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
The bill includes new work rules for Medicaid recipients and would require them to verify their eligibility more frequently. It also would limit a financing strategy that states have used to boost Medicaid payments to hospitals.
Republicans say enrollees are taking advantage of the Medicaid program and getting benefits when they shouldn’t be. They say the program costs too much and states are not paying their fair share.
The Delta region, which includes communities in both Louisiana and Mississippi, would suffer under such large cuts. But in Louisiana — where almost half of the state depended on Medicaid in 2023, the Louisiana Department of Health reported — the cuts could be ruinous. Louisiana could lose up to $35 billion in federal Medicaid support over the next decade, according to KFF, a health policy research group. Mississippi, which never expanded Medicaid, could still lose up to $5 billion.
Residents are watching with apprehension, fear and, sometimes, anger, wondering how Congress could be so blind to how much they are struggling.
“If they take that away from us and everyone that really needs it, that’s going to be bad,” said Sherila Ervin, who lives 20 minutes up the road from Lake Providence in Oak Grove and has Medicaid coverage.

Medicaid work requirements and other health care provisions in the bill ignore the reality of living in poorer rural communities, where people struggle to find the jobs, transportation and internet access required to meet the rules, according to interviews with people and providers in the Delta region.
Even though Louisiana and Mississippi have taken very different approaches to Medicaid — one expanded eligibility under the 2010 Affordable Care Act and the other didn’t — both rely heavily on the program to sustain access to medical care for all their residents.
On a hot summer day in June, Ervin walks into the bare-bones 99-cent store in downtown Lake Providence. As she looks over some clothing, she says she’s heard about the potential Medicaid cuts. But she hadn’t heard about the work requirements, and is shocked they’re even on the table.
“I don’t like that. I don’t think they should put a stipulation on that,” Ervin says, exasperated that she would have to report her work hours. It’s hard enough as it is, she says, to thrive in this community.
In the Deep South, health care fights echo civil rights battles

Ervin, 58, has been working at Oak Grove High School in the cafeteria, serving hot plates to children for two decades. She says it’s one of the good, steady jobs available in this area, but her income is only around $1,500 per month.
Ervin’s job offers health benefits, but she can’t afford the premiums on her salary. She relies on Medicaid for care, including medications for her high blood pressure.
In East Carroll Parish, around 46.5% of people live below the poverty level, meaning the area is overwhelmingly poor, at over four times the national poverty rate, with a median income of $28,321. For Black households, the figure is a mere $16,690.
Expansion was a lifeline for people such as Ervin. Louisiana offers Medicaid to people who earn below 138% of the federal poverty line — currently about $22,000 a year for an individual.
“Sometimes you can work, but then when you work, you still can’t pay to get help,” Ervin said.
It’s a similar economic situation an hour away across the river. Poverty is about three times the national rate in Washington County, Mississippi, where residents in the city of Greenville lament the consequences of not being able to avoid destructive medical debt, which can keep them stuck in a cycle of gig work and of living paycheck to paycheck.
Greenville, the county seat, is among the fastest-shrinking cities in the U.S. It’s still one of the larger rural cities in Mississippi, with coffee shops, restaurants, hotels, a regional hospital and several big-box stores. But the downtown has just a few small businesses and a bank, and residents say jobs are hard to find.
Greenville resident April McNair, 45, remembers giving birth 17 years ago, long before Mississippi extended postpartum Medicaid to a full year. She had Medicaid coverage during pregnancy, but was kicked off shortly after giving birth, despite having post-delivery complications.

The result was a trip to the emergency room and a $2,500 bill she couldn’t cover. Right after giving birth, McNair looked for work. She said potential employers often told her that she was overqualified because she had a master’s degree.
“I had to kind of figure out how to make my ends meet,” McNair said. “I ended up with a significant bill, all because I did not have Medicaid.”
McNair feels like Mississippi leaders are making a mistake by continuing to reject full Medicaid expansion.
“That’s a selfish move. To me, they’re selfish,” McNair said, adding that now she’s worried for neighbors in Louisiana who may lose the lifeline she wishes she had.
“God forbid, hypothetically speaking, what if one of them meets their demise because of this bill that [Congress] passed?”
 Hard to thrive

Mississippi experienced its first taste of equalized access to medicine in the late 1960s.
Delta Health Center, the first federally funded health center in the nation, opened during the peak of the Civil Rights Movement in the all-Black town of Mound Bayou, about an hour north of Greenville. The center vowed to care for anyone regardless of race or ability to pay in a region plagued with poverty, poor health and discrimination — and continues to do so to this day.
It was a significant opportunity for generations of African Americans who had gone without health care, in a place where people had no access to clean drinking water, running sewage systems or even food, said Robin Boyles, chief program planning and development officer at Delta Health Center.
But it wasn’t easy for the clinic to mobilize support, even though it was clearly needed. Before its opening, it faced pushback from politicians and even doctors. In a 1966 clipping from a local newspaper, the white-owned Bolivar Commercial, the editorial board railed against the new clinic, saying it would “lead further to socialized medicine.”

The situation is certainly better in Mississippi and Louisiana than it was in the 1960s, but critics say the Medicaid cuts could reverse hard-fought progress.
People who live in the Delta are fiercely proud of their communities, but conditions there make it hard to thrive.
Black residents, who are the overwhelming majority, have had a particularly hard time. After the Civil War, many were relegated to sharecropping of cotton and corn for subsistence. Meanwhile, an elite white class of plantation owners and investors amassed enormous amounts of wealth.
A 2001 report from the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights described the area as one with “limited economic resources; inadequate employment opportunities; insufficient decent, affordable housing; and poor quality public schools.”
“We have a lot of patients that are one health issue away from either being out of a job or being bankrupt because of a trip to the emergency room,” said Dr. Brent Smith, a physician at a primary care clinic at Delta Health System in Greenville.
Even some of the most vulnerable people, such as new moms in Mississippi, still struggle to get basic care, in part because the state has left billions of dollars in federal funding for Medicaid expansion on the table, said Dr. Lakeisha Richardson, an OB-GYN at Delta Health System.
“There are a lot of maternal [care] deserts in Mississippi where women have to travel 60 miles or more just to get prenatal care and just to get to the closest hospital for delivery,” Richardson said. “And I don’t see that getting any better in Mississippi and in rural areas.”
Richardson says nearly all her patients are working moms, many of whom would really benefit from having Medicaid expansion.
“America doesn’t realize that there are people out here struggling for no reason of their own,” she said.
That’s why Medicaid expansion in Louisiana in 2016, much like the community health center movement in Mississippi, was a bright spot in the rural South, said Smith.
“Louisiana expanded Medicaid, a surprising move in the South to see any state expand,” Smith said. “They saw it for what it was, which was a very real opportunity to assist this specific group of patients.”

In Mississippi, 20 rural hospitals are at immediate risk of closure, according to a recent report, more than double the number at risk in Louisiana. In many cases, Medicaid is the largest and most reliable payer for rural hospitals. While Louisiana’s overall uninsured rate plummeted to 8.3% by 2023, in Mississippi it was 10.5%.
“Unlike a lot of our Southern peers, we have not had the same level of closures of facilities,” said Courtney Foster, senior policy adviser for Medicaid, with the nonprofit Invest in Louisiana.
“Medicaid was like a real lifeline for people in transition. Oftentimes it was people who had lost their jobs and were just looking to get back on their feet.”
Now, the new work and reporting requirements could put that progress at risk.











America doesn't realize that there are people out here struggling for no reason of their own.


– Dr. Lakeisha Richardson, OB-GYN at Delta Health System



In East Carroll Parish, finding a job — let alone a good-paying one with health benefits — is difficult, says Rosie Brown, executive director at the East Carroll Community Action Agency, a nonprofit that helps low-income people with their rent and utility bills. Many of the jobs available in town pay minimum wage, just $7.25 an hour.
Brown loves living in Lake Providence; this is where her family is. She doesn’t want to move but wishes the government would invest more in her community — not take away benefits that help people who are hanging on by a thread.
“We have one bank. We have one supermarket,” she said. “Transportation isn’t easy either.”
Local infrastructure is so limited, she’s even heard of some people charging residents $20 for a ride to Walmart. Some people have to hitch a ride an hour away to go to work, she said.
“There’s nowhere to go,” Brown said.
Dominique Jones works at the local library, where she helps roughly 75 to 85 people per month apply for programs such as Medicaid and food assistance. Many of the residents she helps don’t have access to the internet or even a computer, a real barrier for people who’d be required to report their working hours to state Medicaid officials.
“This town right here is made up of a lot of old people that need Medicaid and Medicare. And without it, they wouldn’t have any kind of health care at all,” Mayor Amacker said.
  Dilapidated buildings dot downtown Lake Providence, La. (Photo by Shalina Chatlani/Stateline)
Even a job in local government in Lake Providence doesn’t offer affordable health insurance.
Nevada Qualls, 25, sits across from Amacker’s office. She earns just $12 an hour as a cashier at city hall. The low pay means she qualifies for Medicaid expansion coverage, which is good because she can’t afford the premiums for private insurance.
“I feel like there should be a higher threshold for people that can get Medicaid, because they’re still struggling,” she said.
At the 99-cent store, school district worker Ervin wonders whether state and federal leaders understand what it’s like to live in her community, urging them to visit and see for themselves.
“They want to do stuff for the rich people that’s already rich,” she said. “What are they doing? It’s almost like there’s no common sense with them.”
 ‘The tremble factors’

While leaders in the U.S. Senate were working into the night this past weekend debating Trump’s tax and spending bill, Greenville resident Jennifer Morris was praying for the pain to stay away.
Morris, 44, has hemicrania continua, a headache disorder that causes constant pain on one side of her head. There’s no underlying trigger and no cure. Her doctors help her keep the pain to a minimum with regular treatments that include dozens of injections into her head.
“It doesn’t take the pain away,” she said during a late-night gathering in Greenville’s Greater Mount Olivet Missionary Baptist Church in June. “It does reduce the pain so that I’m able to function. But it’s rough.”

Morris is worried about the looming Medicaid cuts. She qualifies for Mississippi Medicaid because her condition counts as a disability, and she depends on the coverage to afford her medications.
Morris’ Medicaid may be safer than that of her Delta neighbors in Lake Providence, as some of the most dramatic Medicaid changes being considered — such as work requirements — target Medicaid expansion states only.
But Mississippi could be hurt by a provision in the Senate bill that would target a strategy states have used to boost the Medicaid dollars they get from the federal government.
Mississippi could see a major hit to its Medicaid funds, which “would be a tremendous decrease in revenue for the state,” harming “services and access to care,” says Mitchell Adcock, executive director at the Center for Mississippi Health Policy.
“It would be just the opposite of expansion. It would be a contraction for the Medicaid program in the state,” he said.
Leonard Favorite, a pastor who was attending the same event at Mount Olivet Church, as Morris, says he grew up on a plantation in Louisiana and worked his way out of poverty by joining the Air Force. This type of journey is hard, he said, when you’re already starting from so far behind. He thinks the “big, beautiful bill” will create more roadblocks for poor people.
Glaucoma-related vision loss is often preventable, but many can’t afford treatment

“You have people who are already living below the poverty line and they will certainly be submerged into poverty at unspeakable levels,” said Favorite, 70.“ That seems to be the trend of this administration from the point of view of looking from the outside.
“Poor people are beginning to feel the tremble factors of an administration that caters toward the rich.”
National researchers estimate that up to 132,000 Louisianans who gained health insurance under expansion could lose it under work rules.
But national reports that rely on census data likely underestimate the potential Medicaid losses. For example, while 2023 census data show 47% of East Carroll Parish was on Medicaid, state health data reviewed by Stateline and Public Health Watch suggests the number is more like 64%. Similarly statewide, census data showed about a third of Louisianans were on Medicaid. State data shows that percentage is closer to 46.5%.
Experts such as Joan Alker at the Georgetown Center for Children and Families say the undercounts nationally are a well-known issue among researchers, but it’s difficult to correct because the quality of state reporting can be so uneven.
State Medicaid funding is also at risk. For years, both Mississippi and Louisiana have relied on revenue generated through a financing tool — known as a provider tax — to draw down more federal dollars and boost Medicaid reimbursements to providers. But congressional Republicans hope to limit states’ ability to collect those taxes.
Depending on how Congress restricts provider taxes, Mississippi could lose hundreds of millions in federal Medicaid funding, crucial in a state with such a high uninsured rate, said Richard Roberson, president and CEO of the Mississippi Hospital Association.
“It’s unavoidable that when you’re taking that much money out of the system, that there’s not going to be some repercussions felt even in non-Medicaid expansion states like Mississippi,” Roberson said.
Last week, the Louisiana Hospital Association signed a statement calling the package of Medicaid cuts before Congress “historic in their devastation.”
From her small, sunny office in East Carroll Parish, nurse Jennifer Newton can’t understand the attacks on Medicaid.
Newton, who grew up one parish over in West Carroll, is executive director of the Family Medical Clinic, a community health center in Lake Providence and one of the few health providers in town. She says 50% of the clinic’s patients have Medicaid insurance.

Newton has worked in health care in the area for decades and watched as Medicaid expansion made it possible for more patients to access and afford health care they desperately needed, including preventive services. “It’s absolutely helped,” she said. “Absolutely.”
In 2015, the year before Louisiana expanded Medicaid, the uninsured rate among working-age adults in East Carroll Parish was nearly 35%. By 2021, that number was 12.7%.
“Why are we going back?” Newton asked. “We’ve made so much progress.”
Republican supporters of work requirements, including Louisiana representative and U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, argue they will encourage people to find jobs and ensure Medicaid goes to people who need it most. But according to KFF, a majority of Louisiana adults with Medicaid — 69% — already work.
Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that is working with Republicans to formulate Medicaid cuts, is not concerned about eligible people losing coverage, as has happened under previous work requirement efforts. He says the bill has built in exceptions for certain people and requirements “can be met by not just work,” so “concerns seem pretty overstated.”
Medicaid recipients also can meet the requirement by volunteering or attending school for 80 hours per month.
“It’s hard for me to understand that there are areas in the country where there’s not jobs. There’s always work to be done,” Blase told Stateline. Blase said he believes Medicaid is “the government conditioning welfare for able-bodied working-age adults.”
Republicans target a tax that keeps state Medicaid programs running

But advocates and experts predict East Carroll, where internet access is notoriously bad, would experience results similar to when Arkansas instituted Medicaid work requirements in 2018: People disenrolled because of lack of awareness and confusion over the policy, as well as paperwork errors — not because they weren’t working enough.
“Unless the beneficiary can navigate that red tape, they’re going to lose coverage and become uninsured,” said Benjamin Sommers, a health economist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
Data shows Arkansas’ experiment did not increase employment, Sommers said, and instead led to more people reporting medical debt and delaying care because of cost.
 ‘Take a step back’

People in the Delta — where the legacy of government neglect and discrimination are all around — want politicians to visit their towns and see the barriers people face trying to improve their lives and stay healthy.
“People spent their lives uninsured,” said Amy Hale, a nurse practitioner at East Carroll Medical clinic. “Medicaid expansion allowed them to get in here and be treated.”
Lake Providence residents are scared they may find themselves in a similar situation as McNair and other people across the river in Greenville: working, uninsured, and too poor to access health care.
Recent estimates show up to 317,000 Louisianans could lose Medicaid health insurance under Trump’s tax bill. Nearly 33,000 in Mississippi.
“People are actually trying,” McNair said. “I really wish [lawmakers] would look at it from a different lens. What if it was their kid? Or they didn’t have the salaries they have now and your baby is ill. … Like really take a step back and think about what it is that you’re doing.”

Those are the findings of new Census numbers that show the number of Marylanders age 65 and older grew by 3.35% from 2023 to 2024, while the number of those under age 18 fell by 0.06%. Nationally, the increase of older adults rose 3.1% while those under 18 shrank by 0.10%.
The state’s population overall rose by more than 45,000 last year, the most since 2015. While the one-year numbers are relatively small, analysts say they continue recent trends: The country’s median age and the population’s share of older adults are both continuously increasing.
“Children still outnumber older adults in the United States, despite a decline in births this decade,” Lauren Bowers, chief of the Census Bureau’s Population Estimates Branch, said in a statement. “However, the gap is narrowing as baby boomers continue to age into their retirement years.”
The number of states where those over age 65 now outnumber children has grown from just three in 2020 to 11 in 2024, though Maryland is not yet one of those states.
While the state’s 6.2 million residents overall are aging slightly faster than the rest of the U.S., some of the fastest aging is occurring in central Maryland counties, while some of the rural counties are seeing their populations age differently.

In Western Maryland counties like Allegany and Washington, for example, or Somerset and Talbot counties on the Eastern Shore, the 65-and-over population rose less than 2% year to year. And the median age fell or stayed the same in all four counties.
Among counties with rising median ages, Howard County saw the largest increase, going from 39.9 years in 2023 to 40.3 in 2024, according to the Census data.
Jie Chen, director of the University of Maryland, College Park’s Center on Aging, said the aging disparity between rural and urban areas stems from differences in resources. Most communities that can work to make themselves age-friendly tend to be in urban areas, she said.
“The rural areas usually have worse access to health care, housing and transportation,” Chen said. The lack of rural hospitals can lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment for older residents, she said.
She said communities are aging primarily due to advancing technology and the state’s improving economy.
“People live happier and longer,” said Chen, also the chair of the university’s Health Policy and Management department. “It’s not a bad thing.”
But, Chen added, the declining birthrate among young people has led to the state’s disproportionate ratio of older and younger residents. She attributed that decrease in birthrate to cultural shifts and reluctance to start a family given the high cost of living.
Chen said there is plenty room for improvement in how resources are allocated for aging residents, especially in the health care system, to ensure aging residents can live happily and healthily “without sacrificing anyone else’s benefits.”

Benjamin Orr, president of the Maryland Center on Economic Policy, said the trend is nothing surprising.
“The United States as a whole, our population is getting older,” Orr said. “Maryland’s population is no exception.”
Orr said the goal is for the state to have a healthy “working age” and under-18 population, but the state doesn’t need “explosive growth” in those groups.
An aging population can lead to slower economic growth, he said, and shifting government spending priorities as the state covers increasing health care and Medicare costs.
“We also know that people who are still in the workforce typically pay more taxes,” Orr said. “So an aging population can put further strain on government budgets, not just because they may need more services, but also because they may be paying” less payroll taxes or not spending as much.
Orr added that Maryland is already doing many of the right things to attract working age adults and young families, such as a higher minimum wage and good public schools.
The Census data also showed a continuing shift in Maryland’s racial demographics over the last five years.
Since 2020, the state’s Hispanic population has increased by almost 14%, while its Black and Asian populations saw more moderate increases. The number of non-Hispanic white residents shrank by more than 100,000 people, while the state’s Hispanic population last year alone grew by about 30,000 people.
In an interview with Maryland Matters, Bowers said the trend in Maryland also mirrors the rest of the country. Since 2020, the U.S. Hispanic population has increased by just more than 6 million people, she said.

When the online review platform Yelp added a “Black-owned” tag in 2020, it boosted the visibility of Black-owned restaurants in Detroit. It also caused their ratings to drop, according to our recent study.
Both local and nonlocal reviewers who showed awareness of a restaurant’s Black ownership rated restaurants 3.03 stars on average. Those who did not acknowledge Black ownership gave a rating of 3.78 stars on average. The tag seems to have caused the average rating to drop by attracting more reviewers who were aware of Black ownership.
 Why it matters

Technology companies often introduce new features and tools to influence user behavior and make their platforms more usable.
Although Yelp intended to support Black communities with the Black-owned tag, the design intervention was harmful to Black restaurant owners in Detroit because Yelp failed to consider platform and community-based factors that significantly shape user interactions.
Yelp’s user base is predominantly white, educated and affluent. Making Detroit’s Black-owned restaurants more visible to Yelp users may have amplified cross-cultural interactions and frictions. For example, non-Black users sometimes mentioned “slower” and “rude” service as justifications for lower ratings. Close readings of these reviews hinted at intercultural and communicative clashes.
And even businesses that don’t select the tag are identified within searches as Black-owned, based on user reviews and relevant links. Yelp doesn’t provide a way for the business to opt out of these search results.
 How we did our work

To examine the local impacts of Yelp’s Black-owned tag, we collected over 250,000 Yelp reviews of Black- and non-Black-owned restaurants in Detroit and Los Angeles.
We identified Black-owned restaurants through community-sourced lists for Detroit and Los Angeles and then generated a random sample for the non-Black-owned restaurants.
We then identified reviews that explicitly noted “Black ownership” for closer analysis.
Detroit’s Black-owned businesses saw a greater loss in business compared with “ownership-unreported” restaurants during the COVID-19 pandemic. This means they also potentially had more to gain from the new tag.
We found the awareness of Black ownership on Yelp significantly increased following Yelp’s addition of the Black-owned tag in June 2020. A year after the tag was added, reviews in Detroit mentioned Black ownership 4.3% more often than a year before it was rolled out.
﻿
Detroit Black-owned restaurants also saw a small temporary spike in their number of reviews, largely around the time Yelp added the Black-owned tag. At the same time, the restaurants’ average star ratings dropped from 3.91 to 3.88. In contrast, non-Black-owned restaurants’ ratings stayed relatively steady at 3.90.
This metric is an aggregate of all Detroit restaurants’ Yelp reviews over their entire existence, so a .03-star rating change is small but significant.
Even minor changes to star ratings affect the number of diners restaurants attract, their earning potential and the likelihood they will sell out of food.
Adding obstacles in digital platforms serves to reproduce and amplify inequalities these businesses already face, rather than alleviate them. For example, Black-owned businesses have a harder time getting loans and are relatively underrepresented in Michigan as a whole.
These findings may seem surprising given that Detroit is a majority Black city. However, Black users on Yelp are a minority. Keeping in mind the skewed user base of Yelp, we hypothesize the lower reviews for businesses featuring a Black-owned tag reflect existing racial and digital divides in the city.
﻿
Generally, our study provides additional evidence that digital interventions are not “one-size-fits-all,” nor is digital visibility inherently positive for all businesses.
The Research Brief is a short take on interesting academic work.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)The U.S. Department of Commerce’s announcement that it will withdraw from an agreement with Mexico controlling tomato imports is being applauded by Florida lawmakers, who say it will allow Florida and other U.S. farmers to catch up to what the agency has labeled “unfairly produced Mexican imports.” 
But the proposal is fiercely opposed by lawmakers in Arizona and Texas, who claim the tariff being placed on Mexican tomatoes will harm their own economies and provide consumers with less choice and higher prices.
There’s no question that right now the winners in this situation are Florida tomato growers, who for years have been calling upon the Commerce Department to terminate the 2019 Tomato Suspension Agreement (TSA).
They contend that growers in Mexico have been selling their products at below U.S. market prices — a practice known as “dumping.” The Commerce Department’s decision, announced in April, means there will soon be a 17.09% tariff on Mexican tomatoes, which now dominate the U.S. market.
“The termination of the suspension agreement will allow U.S. tomato growers to compete fairly in the marketplace,” reads a letter penned by Sens. Rick Scott and Ashley Moody and a dozen Florida Republican U.S. House members upon the announcement that the TSA will be terminated.
“This has been a priority of ours for years in Florida,” added North Central Florida GOP U.S. Rep. Kat Cammack in a separate statement. “For half a decade now, our producers have been subject to an unfair marketplace. In the past five years alone, Mexican tomato producers have violated the suspension agreement over 100 times. The economic impact of these violations has been catastrophic on our domestic tomato producers.”
No one disputes that the industry isn’t what it once was in the Sunshine State. Industry officials observe that going back to when the first Tomato Suspension Agreement was reached in the mid-1990s, there were almost 300 tomato producers in Florida. Now they say, there’s just a few more than 30.

“There have been over 100 incidents documented of violations by the Mexicans by the Commerce Department, so this is just a reoccurring problem that has devastated our industry,” said Tony DiMare, president of DiMare Fresh, a produce repacking and distributing company that started business in Boston 97 years ago and has maintained shipping operations in both California and Florida for decades.
In 2023, Florida produced $494 million of fresh market tomatoes, according to the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.  That’s second only to California in the U.S. However, the Golden State tomatoes are primarily used for processing into products like ketchup, tomato paste and other sauces, whereas most of Florida’s tomato crops are for fresh market consumption.
Although the Commerce Department’s decision to kill the TSA is a welcome boost for tomato growers in Florida, Georgia, and other states in the South that grow tomatoes, it’s been denounced elsewhere, specifically Arizona and Texas. U.S. importers there they say the tariffs will result in higher costs for them, leading to higher prices for consumers.
Last month, Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott signed a resolution encouraging the Department of Commerce to maintain the existing TSA rather than terminate it. In April, Arizona Democratic U.S. Sen. Ruben Gallego sent his own letter to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, calling upon him to keep the suspension agreement in place.
“The result of terminating this agreement will be higher prices for American families, few options at the grocery store, and fewer American jobs. Indeed, studies show that families could see tomato prices rise by an average of 50% if your Department does not reverse course,” Sen. Gallego wrote.
Officials in those states also cite an economic analysis from Texas A&M University, published earlier this year, estimating the direct and indirect economic benefits associated with the import and sale of Mexican fresh tomatoes in the U.S. at $8.33 billion, with fresh tomato imports supporting more than 46,000 full- and part-time jobs across the United States.
Robert Guenther, executive vice president of the Florida Tomato Exchange (FTE), says that the termination of the TSA will allow U.S. growers to stay in business, keep people employed, and save family farms. And he insists that consumers won’t be hit with higher prices.
“We do not expect any significant changes with retail prices for consumers with the termination of the agreement,” he told NPR last month.
DiMare noted that when the TSA was terminated for four months in 2019, “prices actually went down at that period of time.” And he rejects terming the penalty on Mexican tomatoes a tariff. He insists it’s an anti-dumping penalty for violating U.S. trade law.
“When we negotiate all of these fair trade agreements, there are parameters,” he said. “There are guidelines with which trading countries have to comply, and if those guidelines are not adhered to and rules are broken, there are penalties. And the penalties in this case for numerous years of violations of adhering to the minimum reference price is the anti-dumping duties.”
 The greenhouse revolution
The first Tomato Suspension Agreement between the United States and Mexico was enacted on Nov. 1, 1996, nearly three years after NAFTA (the North American Free Trade Agreement) began. The rules evolved following an antidumping investigation aimed at detecting whether fresh tomatoes from Mexico were being sold at less than fair market value.
Under the ’96 TSA, Mexican producers agreed to sell fresh tomatoes in the United States at set reference prices, with the U.S. suspending the anti-dumping investigation. Since then, revised suspension agreements were reached in 2002, 2008, 2013, and most recently on Sept. 19, 2019.
In 2023, FTE, the Florida exchange, asked the Department of Commerce to terminate the 2019 agreement, saying lingering loopholes remained a problem.
“It’s become clear that these agreements are simply not enforceable, at least when it comes to the tomato trade with Mexico,” said Michael Schadler, then-executive vice president of the FTE. “Suspension agreements might be an effective tool for products that can be kept in storage until market conditions improve but, for highly perishable items like fresh tomatoes, there is just too much incentive to evade the reference prices when markets are oversupplied.”
However, representatives from other parts of the country argue the tomato market has evolved since the mid 1990s, when the first suspension agreement went into effect. Mexican imports have superseded Florida’s home-grown tomatoes because of what they call the “greenhouse revolution” — a new way of farming embraced by Mexican, Canadian, and some U.S. tomato growers, but not in Florida.
By the early 2020s, greenhouse tomatoes represented 60% of the total fresh tomato import volume, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). By investing in greenhouse technology, Mexican growers have been able to grow specialty tomatoes versus the mainly round tomatoes produced in Florida, said Skip Hulett, chief legal officer of NatureSweet, a Texas company that grows and sells greenhouse tomatoes in Mexico and the United States.
“The market has evolved dramatically since 1995-1996, and so consumers now expect the greenhouse-grown vine-ripe varieties, like the grape and the cherry, many of which didn’t exist in the ’90s,” he said.
“The domestic growers who petitioned Commerce for duties have failed to innovate, growing what in the industry are called ‘gas green tomatoes’ or round tomatoes that are picked green and then induced to turn a pale red after being placed in gas rooms and exposed to ethylene gas,” the Fresh Produce Association of the Americas says in a press release. “This kind of tomato has lost market share as consumers and restaurants have shifted to tomato varieties that naturally ripen on the plant, just like in nature, with a natural deep red color and superior flavor.”
DiMare objects to that claim.
“Yes, the Mexican industry has shifted their way of growing to a greenhouse product, but the actual production of the type of tomatoes is the same, whether it’s greenhouse produced or open field produced,” he said. “A round tomato is a round tomato. A Roma tomato is a Roma tomato. And we all share and compete at times in the marketplace with our products.”
 A matter of taste
William Alexander is the author of 2022’s “Ten Tomatoes that Changed the World,” a history of the tomato. He argues the problem with Florida tomatoes is that they’re “not bred to taste good.”
“These are green and rock hard and they’re bred for all kinds of things — to look pretty, to look fresh after they’re sliced, to look exactly the right size to withstand all of the horrible weather that you can have in Florida, and they’re not able to do all of that and also to breed for flavor,” he told the Phoenix.
Alexander recently wrote an op-ed in The New York Times, contending that the “last thing that American consumers need is a revitalization of Florida’s withering tomato industry.”
Florida’s natural environment isn’t conducive to producing great tomatoes, Alexander says, referring to the fact that they’re grown in sandy soil. “That sand never freezes, unlike a New Jersey field, and so it never kills off things like nematodes” he said.
For his part, Robert Guenther of the Florida Tomato Exchange told NPR recently that “there are no differences between quality, freshness, taste of tomatoes.”
With the clock ticking before the TSA is officially terminated, the lobbying is expected to prove intense on both sides of the issue. Whether that will result in a higher price of tomatoes is unclear.
“We certainly anticipate that if the tariffs do go into effect,” said Tom Stenzel, executive director of the Controlled Environment Agriculture Alliance, a membership trade association representing greenhouse producers growing fruits and vegetables in a controlled indoor environment.
“That’s not going to happen,” DiMare insists. “I don’t see that prices are going to escalate because the agreement is going to terminate.”
The termination of the TSA is set for July 14.

So pulses quickened when Zohran Mamdani, a self-described democratic socialist, won New York's Democratic mayoral primary","New York City mayoral dandidate Zohran Mamdani celebrates his Democratic primary victory with leaders and members of a number of city labor unions. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)Maryland is traditionally a top-down state politically.
Until recently, the state’s political landscape has been dominated by senior Democrats, whose centrist, establishment politics continue to hold sway in the State House and in many local governments. Young, aspiring politicians are frequently told, implicitly if not explicitly, to wait their turn before seeking higher office. Even in a state legislature with Democratic supermajorities, progressive initiatives are often held at bay.
So the pulses of young progressives in Maryland quickened considerably last week when a 33-year-old self-described democratic socialist, Zohran Mamdani, emerged as the unlikely victor in the Democratic primary for mayor of New York City and is now the frontrunner in the November general election. And the Democratic establishment and donor class, in the city and beyond, are assessing whether to embrace Mamdani and his movement or continue strategizing for ways to suppress it.
“It’s certainly an exciting moment because it’s a people-powered victory very clearly – an underdog story,” said Montgomery County Councilmember Kristin Mink (D), a leading progressive voice in local and state politics. “Any time we see a number of people engaged and able to defeat big money, it’s important to take note of that.”
It’s hard to extrapolate much from a single local election – especially one in such a unique environment as The Big Apple, where Mamdani’s principal primary opponent was the uniquely flawed former governor, Andrew Cuomo. But pundits across the political spectrum are calling the primary results an earthquake – and earthquakes can have reverberations far from their fault lines.
As the 2026 election cycle heats up in Maryland, and as Democrats here and nationally continue to reel from the 2024 election and its profound implications, it’s worth examining whether Mamdani’s message and winning coalition provide some lessons that can be applied here.
A parade — of speakers — and a hint of rain at annual Hoyer bull roast, but no hints on his plans

Mamdani’s victory was partly generational and partly ideological. The state assemblyman from Queens had an expansive economic agenda that focused on affordability and the New Yorkers who are struggling to survive in a hyper-expensive city. He highlighted proposals for rent freezes, free transit, affordable child care and government-sponsored grocery stores in food deserts, among others.
Mamdani’s thoroughly modern campaign, fueled by nontraditional media outreach, produced an array of responses from Maryland political leaders on social media last week.
Lt. Gov. Aruna Miller (D), a fellow Indian-American, offered congratulations on X to Mamdani “and everyone who fought alongside him. You stood up for the underdog – and won.”
Ian Miller, a 23-year-old member of the Baltimore County Democratic Central Committee who has frequently clashed with party insiders, on Facebook called Mamdani’s victory “the Gen Z Obama moment.”
Former U.S. Rep. John Delaney (D) offered a more nuanced analysis on X, recognizing Mamdani’s appeal to “base” Democratic voters, but asking, “How do people reconcile the fact that (more centrist) Andrew Cuomo’s campaign was funded by mega donors and he won the low income neighborhoods and (more progressive) Zohran’s campaign was grass roots and he won the wealthy neighborhoods?”
Some national political analysts said they saw Mamdani’s victory as reflecting economic jitters across all classes – and the pent-up frustrations of younger Democrats who don’t see senior party leaders standing up to President Trump and other MAGA Republicans. Do some of the same conditions exist on the ground in Maryland that helped propel Mamdani to victory? Where can political parallels be drawn between New York and the Free State?
Larry Stafford, executive director of the group Progressive Maryland, said New York voters produced results that have already been evident in pockets of Maryland in recent years.
“I see this victory as part of a trend that’s emerging,” he said. “Like a lot of movements, first it goes forward, then it stumbles back, then it moves forward again.”
Generational change
There is no question that Maryland is in the midst of a generational shift politically. It began with the departures of Attorney General Joe Curran (D) and Comptroller (and former governor) William Donald Schaefer (D) following the 2006 election, and has accelerated with the retirements of multiterm U.S. Sens. Barbara Mikulski (D) and Ben Cardin (D), the deaths of record-serving House Speaker Michael Busch (D) and Senate President Mike Miller (D), the defeat of four senior members of the state Senate in 2018 Democratic primaries, and the retirements of three Democratic members of Maryland’s U.S. House delegation last year.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The state made history in 2022 by electing its first Black governor and attorney general, its first female state comptroller and its first woman of color to serve as lieutenant governor – each considerably younger than their predecessors. Two of the state’s new members of Congress, Reps. Sarah K. Elfreth (D-3rd) and Johnny Olszewski Jr. (D-2nd), are 36 and 42, respectively. Brandon Scott was the youngest mayor of Baltimore ever elected in 2020, when he was 36 years old.
With the swearing in of a new member last month, the 11-person Prince George’s County Council now has five millennials, led by full-throated progressives Ed Burroughs (D) and Krystal Oriadha (D).
Four years ago, there were none.
“I think that’s to the benefit of the county because we have a younger population,” said Councilmember Tom Dernoga (D), who is 66. “I think it’s better that we reflect the population than with older folks like me, and I’ll be retiring soon so I’ll be replaced by someone younger and we’ll be skewing even younger.”
There have been distinct progressive victories in Democratic primaries over the years in Maryland – some representing significant upsets – though they haven’t necessarily changed the overall political arc of the state.
One such political victory came in 2006, when constitutional law professor Jamie Raskin ousted veteran Montgomery County state Sen. Ida Ruben in the Democratic primary. Now a congressman, Raskin has since become an icon of the left nationally.
Another came in 2018, when former NAACP president Ben Jealous, a lifelong progressive activist and Bernie Sanders acolyte, defeated more established Democratic politicians in the primary for governor. Jealous’ victory came on the same night that a 27-year-old bartender named Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez shocked a top congressional Democrat, Rep. Joe Crowley, in the New York Democratic primary – so Jealous never quite got his due, especially after losing the general election that year.
“The national landscape never took note of that victory as much,” Stafford said.
That same year, an avowed democratic socialist, Marc Elrich, was elected Montgomery County executive, narrowly defeating a self-funding multimillionaire in the process – and narrowly beating him again in a rematch four years later. Prince George’s voters recently elected a longtime political outsider, Aisha Braveboy (D), as county executive – though it remains to be seen if she will govern as far to the left as some of her allies on the county council would like her to.

Gov. Wes Moore (D) won election at the age of 44, with big ideas to alleviate childhood poverty, create an equitable economy and tackle generational challenges like climate change. But constricted by budgetary challenges, some of his own cautious impulses, and institutional roadblocks in Annapolis, the governor has found that transformational change isn’t all that easy.
Stafford predicted that Maryland progressives will take the winning formulas of certain successful candidates, along with Mamdani’s, and apply it to the upcoming election cycle – and to working with allies inside and out of government.
“It will look different than it has in the past,” he said. “The coalitions will look different.”
Mink, the Montgomery County councilmember, said she believes progressive policy progress can be achieved more easily at the local level than in the State House, because there aren’t so many powerful forces working in opposition.
“It’s much easier to secure a people-powered win at the county level,” she said.
‘Hell yes, it emboldens me’
One 2026 Democratic candidate who is already making the generational case against a long-time incumbent is Harry Jarin, the small business owner and volunteer firefighter who is challenging 86-year-old U.S. Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-5th), the longest-serving Democrat in the House of Representatives. Asked in an interview last week whether Mamdani’s victory emboldens him, Jarin replied, “Hell yes, it emboldens me.”
Jarin said that even if Mamdani’s policy prescriptions didn’t appeal to every voter, “he tapped into that insecurity that a lot of younger voters feel and the feeling that establishment Democrats haven’t done anything to address it. It’s voters rejecting the status quo, just as they did in November when they elected Donald Trump. And right now, the establishment Democrats are the status quo.”
Hoyer has not yet said whether he will seek a 23rd full term next year, and several elected officials, including some with close ties to the veteran lawmaker, could jump into a race to replace him. But Jarin said he’s ready to pivot if circumstances change without having to change his strategy.
“Even if he does drop out, I expect he’ll try to shove some other establishment Democrat with no real-world experience down our throats,” Jarin said. “To me, this has never been just about age. For me this has always been about the need to reconnect the Democratic Party with the working class electorate it has lost ground with and continues to lose ground with.
“It makes no difference if my opponent is 86 or 31. My message will be the same: We need people with experience away from the political system to serve in office,” he said.
Another key race where Mamdani’s playbook could come into play is in the Democratic primary to replace Elrich as Montgomery County executive, where Councilmember Will Jawando (D), who is running with Elrich’s endorsement, is almost certain to stake out multiple positions to the left of his principal opponents – who by most standards are pretty liberal themselves.
“The path to success is through people power,” said Mink, who has also endorsed Jawando’s bid for executive. “People are very hungry for electeds whose words, whose actions, whose opinions match the urgency of what’s happening on the ground. There’s important lessons to be learned from New York.”

It took a little time for Greg Freeman’s debut record to really make its mark. 
The Burlington-based singer-songwriter released “I Looked Out” in July 2022 on the tiny Oregon label Bud Tapes to little fanfare and sparse reviews. About five months later, Freeman and his band took the record on tour outside of Vermont. 
By then, the album had begun to develop a following, an authentic word-of-mouth success that has gradually picked up steam, making Freeman something of a cult figure among those in the know.
“The reception was pretty slow building, I guess,” Freeman said recently, reclining on the porch of his Burlington home, one of the many faded clapboard houses that line the city’s downtown streets. 
Just a few weeks prior, the Vermont musician had returned from his first extended tour in Europe, where he was pleasantly surprised by the turnout he generated.
“People came to the Paris show,” Freeman said, nodding happily. “The England shows that we did were really great too.”  
This past fall, Freeman was signed to Canvasback, an imprint of Transgressive Records, which promptly reissued “I Looked Out” on vinyl. 
In August, the label is releasing Freeman’s second LP, “Burnover,” which is poised to be a career defining success, the kind of thing you could hear blasting in dorm rooms and dive bars alike for the rest of the year.

It’s a sprawling, dreamlike collection of elegant indie gems and hard rock epics, anchored by razor sharp guitar riffs and the distinctly airy voice that has earned Freeman comparisons to Neil Young and Jason Molina, of Songs: Ohia fame.
Freeman said he wrote a good portion of the album in a single sprint, a month long period after his first tour for “I Looked Out” that he spent hunkering down with his guitar back in Vermont.
“I just woke up in this house every day, and everyone was at work, and I played music and watched movies all day long,” Freeman said, looking across his porch. “I think once you do that for long enough, things start flowing better.”  
Shortly thereafter, a steady stream of retrospective praise for his debut and raucous live performances began to lay a long runway for the new album’s arrival.
Last spring, he and his band appeared at South by Southwest and were singled out in subsequent coverage of the Texas music festival. 
Write ups in Paste, Stereogum and Rolling Stone have since followed, with some heralding Freeman as the next MJ Lenderman — the 26-year old Asheville-based musician and current golden boy of indie rock. 
Freeman has also been getting invitations to share the stage with larger names. Prior to his jaunt in Europe, he supported Walkmen singer Hamilton Leithausser for a stretch of his solo tour, and in the Fall he’ll be opening for the iconic indie band Grandaddy for a series of shows in the Northeast. 


Freeman grew up in Bethesda, Maryland, playing guitar in his room while nursing an obsession with traditional blues greats like Robert Johnson and Blind Lemon Jefferson from an early age. 
The White Stripes, with their Son House covers and blues-inflected garage jams, served as a gateway drug from the early masters to the classic rock and contemporary indie records that Freeman began to favor more throughout high school and college. “That was the first, like, contemporary band that I was super into,” he said.
Before attending the University of Vermont, he took a gap year and played alone at open mics across the country, often sleeping in his car as he hopped from town to town. 
When Freeman finally arrived in Burlington in 2017, he was bowled over by the vitality of the local music scene. “I came here and everyone was in bands, and there was so much music everywhere,” Freeman said. “That was really a first for me.” 
Freeman joined the fray, playing basement shows before moving up to venues like Radio Bean and Artsriot, where he mostly performed as a solo artist backed by many of the musicians that remain in his band today.
In the years since, Freeman has stayed around the Queen City, becoming a mainstay in the city’s burgeoning indie scene alongside friends and contemporaries like the band Robber Robber and singer-songwriter Lily Seabird, who played with Freeman’s band for several years. 
With its tight-knit social scene and sprawling bucolic surroundings, Burlington is, for Freeman, a city of contradictions that has given him much of his material. Scraps of overheard dialogue make it into his work, as do shades of the more complicated social dynamics that come with living in such a small city.
“There’s kind of like a suffocating social environment here sometimes,” he said, grinning. “But then there’s also, you know, so much green, beautiful space.” 
The odd contrast is something Freeman said he tried to evoke in Burnover. For all its catchy hooks and colorful guitars, the record is a study in the peculiar feeling of loneliness that you get from never quite being alone. 
“My thoughts die out slowly on the blood swept plains / where I see you every night,” Freeman sings on “Curtain,” one of the singles from the record.
Rejecting the term “concept album,” Freeman said that “Burnover” was more intentionally cohesive than his last, with sonic motifs and language that recur throughout.
“I want you to be able to visualize a certain place when you listen to the whole thing,” he said. 
The place isn’t Vermont or New England exactly, he said, but something similar, something green, gothic, weird.
“I’m always kind of trying to write about the places where I live — the spaces around me and the people around me,” he said.
Accordingly, whatever comes after “Burnover” could represent a change of pace for the Vermont musician. 
Before he accompanied Leithauser on tour, he headed to New Mexico, where he spent almost a month alone in the desert, writing the bulk of what will be his third album. 
“It was pretty out there,” Freeman said. 
He returned home with a batch of new songs, but his sojourn out west hasn’t made him want to leave. For now, he said, he would be in Burlington for the foreseeable future.
“It’s weird, though, how much has happened in this neighborhood,” he said as he peered down the road. “I’ve lived on all these streets.”

The Trump administration’s decision to freeze the funding has put states in “triage mode” as they scramble to decide what programs may be cut without that funding, said Mary Kusler, senior director for the Center for Advocacy at the National Education Association. The money was approved by Congress to support education for English language learners, migrants, low-income children and adults learning to read, among others.

As of July 1, school systems are unable to draw down funding, jeopardizing summer programs, hiring and early-year planning for the 2025–26 school year.
The funding freeze affects several core programs: Title II-A (educator training and recruitment), Title III-A (English learner support), Title IV-A (student enrichment and after-school), as well as migrant education and adult education and literacy grants. Trump has proposed eliminating all those programs in his proposed budget for next fiscal year, but that proposal hasn’t gone through Congress.
State superintendents sent out missives to school districts early this week and now are scrambling to make choices.
“This is not about political philosophy, this is about reliability and consistency,” Alabama state Superintendent Eric Mackey said to Politico this week. “None of us were worrying about this.”
The administration says it is reviewing the programs.
“The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities,” the U.S. Department of Education wrote to states in its announcement Monday.
Trump administration tells states it’s freezing $6.8 billion for K-12 school programs

Historically, the department releases allocations by July 1 to ensure schools can budget and plan effectively for the coming school year. Withholding the money could result in canceled programs, hiring freezes and the loss of essential support for English learners, migrant children and other high-need populations, education and state officials told Stateline.
“America’s public school leaders run district budgets that are dependent on a complex partnership between federal, state, and local funding,” said David R. Schuler, executive director of the School Superintendents Association in a statement. “For decades, school districts have relied on timely confirmation of their federal allocations ahead of the July 1 start of the fiscal year — ensuring stability, allowing for responsible planning, and supporting uninterrupted educational services for students.”
The states facing the largest withheld amounts include California ($810.7 million), Texas ($660.9 million), and New York ($411.7 million), according to data from the NEA and the Learning Policy Institute, an education think tank.
For 17 states and territories, the freeze affects over 15% of their total federal K-12 allocations, according to the Learning Policy Institute. For smaller jurisdictions such as the District of Columbia and Vermont, the disruption hits even harder: More than 20% of their federal K-12 budgets remain inaccessible.
Colorado Education Commissioner Susan Córdova urged school districts to begin contingency planning in case funds are not released before the federal fiscal year ends on Sept. 30. California State Superintendent Tony Thurmond hinted at possible legal action, which has become a trend as states fight the second Trump administration’s funding revocations or delays.
“California will continue to pursue all available legal remedies to the Trump Administration’s unlawful withholding of federal funds appropriated by Congress,” Thurmond said in a statement.

The NEA and the NAACP have filed for a preliminary injunction, calling the administration’s delay an illegal “impoundment” — a violation of the federal Impoundment Control Act, which bars the executive branch from withholding appropriated funds without congressional approval.
Education advocates warn the recent decision by the Trump administration to withhold funding reflects a broader pattern of federal disengagement from public education.
Community nonprofits said the withholding could devastate their programming too. The Boys and Girls Clubs of America could have to close more than 900 centers — bringing the loss of 5,900 jobs and affecting more than 220,000 children, said President and CEO Jim Clark in a statement.
The 1974 Impoundment Control Act lets the president propose canceling funds approved by Congress. Lawmakers have 45 days to approve the request; if they don’t, it’s denied. Meanwhile, agencies can be directed not to spend the funds during that time.
A White House statement shared with States Newsroom this week said “initial findings have shown that many of these grant programs have been grossly misused to subsidize a radical leftwing agenda.”
“Kids, educators, and working families are the ones losing,” said Kusler, of the NEA. “We need governors and communities to step up — now.”

Thirty years after wolves were brought back from near extinction in the U.S. Rocky Mountains, the state of Idaho is back in the wolf-killing business.
Based on direction from the Idaho Fish and Game Commission, the Idaho Department of Fish and Game is working to reduce the state’s wolf population by more than 60% over six years.
According to the Idaho Gray Wolf Management Plan 2023-2028, the state’s goal is to reduce the wolf population down from the estimated average of 1,270 wolves to a new average of about 500 wolves, with a low of about 350 wolves.
Based on the population dynamics in Idaho’s wolf population, the state estimates humans would need to kill about 37% of Idaho’s estimated wolf population each year for six years to reach the goal of an average population of 500 wolves
While nearly everyone in the wolf debate says it’s extremely difficult to get an accurate count of the animals within the state’s borders, some wolf advocates don’t agree with Idaho officials on how many wolves are actually in the state due to the research methods used until recently.
And some worry that if the state doesn’t have an accurate wolf population count, it doesn’t know how many wolves should be killed under the management plan.
 Current wolf hunting, trapping policies a grim reminder of eradication campaign from the past, early wolf member of wolf management team says

Idaho legislators are driving the policy by responding to concerns from farmers and ranchers who have had animals like sheep and cattle killed by wolves.
Between 2014 and 2023, wolves in Idaho killed a minimum of 1,291 domestic livestock animals, according to state records. The losses affected 299 different ranchers and farmers.
But for Marcie Carter, one of the early members of the Nez Perce Tribe’s program that managed wolves in Idaho, the expansion of wolf hunting and trapping and the government-sponsored killing of wolves in Idaho is a grim reminder of the eradication campaign that nearly killed off all wolves in the U.S. Rocky Mountains by the 1940s.
Wolves are a native species in Idaho and all across the U.S. But as setters moved West, the U.S. government passed wolf-killing bounties meant to encourage westward expansion. By 1926, rangers had killed the last wolves in Yellowstone National Park. The last wolf in Idaho was killed in the 1930s, according to the Idaho Department of Fish and Game.
In one of the most successful and controversial wildlife comeback stories in American history, the U.S. government reintroduced wolves to Yellowstone and Idaho in 1995.
“We did all this great work, and we spent hours and hours out in the woods and then to come to this point where they’re treated like vermin, it’s really disorienting,” said Carter, who now works as the watershed coordinator for the Nez Perce Tribe’s Department of Fisheries Resource Management.
 The impact of wolves on livestock in Idaho

Having livestock killed is a big deal to the rancher who owns that animal.
But some wolf advocates say that, big picture, the number of livestock killed by wolves is pretty low every year.
From 2018 to 2022, there were an average of 259 livestock deaths each year in Idaho that were deemed “confirmed” or “probable” wolf kills, according to the Idaho Department of Fish and Game. (Depredation is the term officials use when a predator like a wolf kills or maims livestock like cattle. Idaho Department of Fish and Game officials said “confirmed” or “probable” determinations are dependent on sufficient evidence remaining, which is dependent on very rapid detection and investigation of the carcass and minimal disturbance by scavengers. Those criteria often aren’t met in remote environments, therefore the documented “confirmed” and “probable” depredations should be considered a minimum number, Fish and Game officials said.)
That’s in a state with about 2.5 million head of cattle and 235,000 sheep – including on feedlots and dairies where wolves and other predators are not present. 
That means wolves kill an average of about 0.01% of Idaho’s combined cattle and sheep population each year.
 How does Idaho estimate its wolf population?

All sides in the wolf debate agree it is extremely difficult to produce an exact population count of wolves in Idaho.
The state is too big, the terrain is too rugged and wolves are too elusive for that to happen.
Instead, officials use multiple different techniques to estimate that wolf population.
Until recently, Idaho Fish and Game officials used wildlife trail cameras and a statistical model to estimate the state’s wolf population.
Some outside researchers expressed concern with the accuracy of using wildlife cameras to estimate wolf populations.
Scott Creel, an ecologist and conservation biologist who works for Montana State University, has studied carnivores since 1987 and studied wolf-elk interactions since the 1990s.
Creel has been critical of wolf population methods used in Montana and Idaho.
“I was frustrated with seeing methods being used to estimate wolf numbers that were very indirect and, in my opinion, were unlikely to produce accurate estimates,” Creel said. “I was particularly worried that the methods I was seeing used would produce estimates that wouldn’t change, even if the wolf numbers were really changing. So the wolf population would appear to be constant, even though the policy changed just because of the way we were counting them, which is extremely oblique in both of the two methods that I was reviewing.”

The Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks declined an interview request for this story.
Creel stressed that accurately estimating wolf populations is extremely difficult.
Idaho Department of Fish and Game officials disagree with Creel’s criticism, but acknowledged trail cam population estimation methods become less reliable when the number of images of wolves from the trail cameras declines.
In July 2024, Idaho Fish and Game announced a new wolf population estimation procedure.
Instead of using trail cams, officials are using new methods involving combination of genetic and information taken from a tooth of every wolf mortality documented by the state, information on the biological range of wolf population dynamics, a statistical model, and actual wolf hunting and mortality data.
It’s called the ABC method, short for Approximate Bayesian Computation, which Idaho Fish and Game officials said has been used widely in other scientific fields like epidemiology and population genetics. Biometricians use that method to estimate the total number of new litters of wolf pups each year and the average estimated wolf population.
When he introduced the new wolf population estimate in July 2024, Idaho Fish and Game Wildlife Bureau Chief Shane Roberts said the new population estimation method independently produced similar population estimates to the trail cam method’s population estimates from 2019 to 2022 using different data.
Roberts said that gives him confidence the new method produces consistent and reasonable population estimates. He also said it backs up the old trail cam method that outside researchers have publicly criticized.
“Although no population estimation technique is perfect, we now have an independent source of information that validates the camera-based estimates that we’ve been using to guide wolf management since 2019 and refutes the idea that those estimates are wildly erroneous, as some have claimed,” Roberts said during the July 2024 Idaho Fish and Game Commission meeting.
But for 2023, the trail cam method and the new method produced different population estimates.
The new method estimated 1,150 wolves, while the trail cam method estimated 840 wolves, Roberts said.
Even though it has been a year since Idaho Fish and Game officials announced their new estimation methods, the methods do not appear on the Idaho Department of Fish and Game’s website for public review.
Howl reporters Clark Corbin and Heath Druzin asked Idaho Fish and Game officials for a copy of the state’s new methods for estimating the wolf population.
In March, Fish and Game officials said the only available information is a YouTube video of officials announcing their wolf population presentation. The relevant discussion takes place more than four hours into a six-hour Idaho Fish and Game Commission meeting on July 24, 2024.
Officials said they are working to publish their methods.
“We are in the process of preparing a manuscript for peer-reviewed publication on the method, which we hope to have submitted for publication later this spring or early summer,” Roberts said in March.
As of June 24, the department had not yet published its new wolf population estimation methods in a peer-reviewed publication. Roberts said June 24 that officials are close to submitting it and hope to have it submitted for peer-reviewed publication before the upcoming July 17 Idaho Fish and Game Commission meeting.
Despite questions and criticisms of past methods, Roberts said he is confident in using the new population estimation to drive wolf management decisions in Idaho.
“Because we were able to produce five years of virtually identical estimates between (the new methods) and the camera-based methods we’ve used before, we are confident this transition will result in consistent information to inform wolf management in the state,” Roberts said during the July 2024 Idaho Fish and Game Commission meeting.
 Why Idaho’s wolf population estimate is important

Bob Crabtree, who founded the Yellowstone Ecological Research Center, said accuracy in wolf population estimates is extremely important.
“It’s like asking a business owner to try to make a profit or try to avoid losing money by not knowing what items they have on the shelves that they stock in their store,” Crabtree said. “Population size, or abundance, is the No. 1 criteria used to successfully manage and conserve and restore wolves. And without it, you just can’t.”
Many wolf laws and policies rely on wolf population estimates.
State Sen. Van Burtenshaw, a Republican rancher from the town of Terreton, Idaho, sponsored Senate Bill 1211, which Gov. Brad Little signed into law in 2021.
The law removed the limit on the number of wolf tags hunters could buy each year, legalized wolf trapping year round on private property and allowed the state of Idaho to contract with federal agencies and other third parties to kill wolves.
Burtenshaw said he pushed for the law because his constituents told him there are too many wolves eating too much livestock.
“The big thing was the amount of farmers and ranchers that were dealing with significant losses because of the wolf population,” Burtenshaw said. “Originally when the wolf was reintroduced, they were talking about 150 or something in the Idaho region. And we had well over 1,500, almost 1,600, for a long time. So the depredation cost was huge to those that had livestock and other animals as well.”
“That population has kind of got out of balance, and that’s what we’re trying to figure out is where that balance is,” Burtenshaw said.
 The impact of wolf hunting in Idaho

Idaho sold more than 53,000 wolf tags to hunters in 2023 even though there are only an estimated 1,150 wolves in the state, according to documents provided by the Idaho Department of Fish and Game.
More than half of those wolf tags were sold in the popular “sportsman’s package,” which includes a hunting/fishing combo license and tags for deer, elk, bear, wolf, mountain lion, turkey, salmon and steelhead. (State officials said they do not know the percentage of hunters who bought a wolf tag because wolves are the primary animal they are hunting vs. the percentage of hunters who primarily hunted other animal species but still bought a wolf tag.)
From the 2019-20 wolf hunting season through the 2023-24 hunting season, hunters and trappers killed an average of more than 400 wolves a year in Idaho, according to Idaho Fish and Game.
In addition to expanding wolf hunting and trapping, Idaho also financially reimburses expenses for hunters who successfully kill a wolf.
Since 2019, the state of Idaho has paid out $849,750 in reimbursements to successful wolf hunters, according to data provided by the Idaho Fish and Game.
The money is Idaho Fish and Game funding that is transferred to the Wolf Depredation Control Board for the Foundation for Wildlife Management’s reimbursement program, Fish and Game officials said. Separately, the foundation has applied for and received Idaho Fish and Game Commission Challenge Grants.
“Our end (goal) in this originally was focused on trying to direct the harvest where we were seeing the greatest impacts – chronic livestock depredation, elk populations below objective, where predation was a factor – to try to focus that effort where harvest at that time was not sufficient to stabilize the wolf numbers,” said Idaho Fish and Game Deputy Director of Operations Jon Rachael, who was an original member of the wolf recovery team.
In the context of hunting, the word harvest means successfully killing a game animal such as a wolf.
The reimbursement money can be used for firearms, ammo, traps, trail cameras, gear, license fees, fuel and even ATV vehicles used to scout or hunt wolves, according to the foundation.
Rusty Kramer, the president of the Idaho Trappers Association, said he has used state reimbursement money to make payments on his truck, which he uses when he is tracking and trapping wolves.
The standard reimbursement in Idaho is capped at $750 per wolf.
But in areas where elk populations are below their objective, or livestock have been repeatedly killed by wolves, the reimbursement limit increases to $2,000 per wolf.
Some wolf supporters call the program a bounty system and scoff at the idea of the state sending checks to people who shot wolves to help pay off their trucks and ATVs.
But Idaho Fish and Game officials insist it is only a reimbursement program – not a bounty.
“Any of the funds that come from the state of Idaho, from the Wolf Depredation Control Board, or, in the past, from the Fish and Game Commission Challenge Grants did require that this money was not just a straight payment of a certain amount, but rather the individual claiming compensation present evidence of their expenses,” Rachael said. “And so in that regard, it was compensation for their investment of buying traps or fuel to run a trap line.”
 U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed it killed juvenile wolves in Idaho

When the state kills wolves, it doesn’t just kill adult wolves that are confirmed to have attacked livestock.
The state, other government agencies like the U.S. Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services and third party contractors can kill wolf pups in their dens and their nursing mother – even if those specific wolves never attacked a cow or sheep.
“You can kill wolf puppies,” said Carter Niemeyer, a former government trapper who helped bring wolves back to Idaho and Yellowstone National Park 30 years ago and opposes killing wolf pups and many of Idaho’s wolf policies. “They’re plum legal if you kill them at a day old. Stomp their head in with your boot if you want to.”

Students at Timberline High School in Boise spoke out a few years ago after the U.S. Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services killed wolf pups from a pack that the school symbolically adopted, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported.
In an October 2021 letter to Suzanne Asha Stone, a prominent Idaho wolf expert and a member of the wolf reintroduction team, former U.S. Department of Agriculture Undersecretary Jenny Lester Moffitt, confirmed the government killed eight juvenile wolves in Idaho in an attempt to relocate the larger pack and reduce the number of livestock killed.
Carter, who was on the Nez Perce Tribe’s wolf reintroduction team in the 1990s, is sickened that the state would authorize the killing of wolf pups that never disturbed livestock.
“I mean, it’s one thing to shoot an adult,” Carter said. “But to trap puppies in the den hole? It’s just so awful. And I don’t understand how people can be that hateful to one species of animal that has a right to be here. But for sure, the state has not done their due diligence.”
“I‘ll just stop there,” Carter added. “The state of Idaho is not taking care of this species.”
Since wolves were removed from the Endangered Species List in 2011, the USDA Wildlife Services and other agencies have killed 961 wolves in Idaho, according to Idaho Department of Fish and Game documents.

Since 2018, Idaho Fish and Game has spent $817,668 on lethal control actions to kill wolves in Idaho, according to documents the department provided. That total specifically refers to Idaho Fish and Game funding through the Wolf Depredation Control Board that was not spent on reimbursements made by the Foundation for Wildlife Management.
One of Idaho’s policies is that even when nonlethal tools are available to reduce conflicts between livestock and wolves, the state can kill wolves without first trying the nonlethal tools.
“Livestock producers may use deterrents to aid in protecting their property; however, they are not a prerequisite for lethal removal,” the Idaho Gray Wolf Management Plan 2023-2028 states. “Regardless of use or success of nonlethal methods, landowners may request a special kill permit from IDFG for use on lawfully permitted public and private lands. IDFG will continue to employ lethal removal as needed to address both individual depredations and overall population goals”
 30 years after wolf reintroduction, some of the people who brought wolves back worry about their future

Longtime wolf advocates say the government-sponsored killing of wolves and expansions in hunting and trapping is reducing the number of wolves.
Now, 30 years after the first wolves were returned to Idaho and 14 years after they came off the Endangered Species List, several prominent members of the team that brought wolves back worry about the threats wolves face today.
Niemeyer is a longtime government trapper who has tracked wolves across Idaho and Montana since before reintroduction in 1995. Intimately familiar with wolves, he was a member of the team that traveled to Canada 30 years ago to capture wolves to reintroduce them to Idaho and Montana.
For years after reintroduction, Carter studied the packs and knew the location of many dens in central Idaho.
Niemeyer was so confident in his ability to find wolves that he regularly guided donors who supported conservation organizations into the wild to see wolves.  He knew the landscape well enough he could set up camp just close enough for the donors to see and howl for wolves as Niemeyer cooked cowboy-style dinners for the group.
But those days are over.
Over the last few years, Niemeyer said he and his longtime contacts are no longer seeing wolves in the wild the same places they always used to.
“When they’re in there, they see virtually little or no sign of any wolf existence in the Frank,” Niemeyer said, referring to the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness. “If you put together what I’m seeing, or better yet, what I’m not seeing…. Nobody’s finding any wolf evidence. So where are these 1,300 or 1,500 wolves?”
Niemeyer’s luck isn’t any better than his friends.
During a Howl reporting trip in July 2024, Niemeyer found wolf scat and wolf tracks, but no wolves. And during another, separate expedition in 2024, he said he struck out entirely – he didn’t even see a wolf track.
“The Big Buck Pack, Steel Mountain Pack, Jackson Pack, Archie Pack, I can name all these packs up there, Thorn Creek – there’s no packs in those places anymore, mostly because of domestic sheep that came in there and Wildlife Services just went to hammering wolves,” Niemeyer said. “And then you’ve got the recreational hunting and trapping that started when (wolves) were delisted.”
“You’ll still find a wolf track up in that country,” Niemeyer said. “But to say there’s anything like the numbers there were, I don’t believe it. You wouldn’t convince me.”
Carter worries about new expanded wolf hunting, trapping and lethal control policies in the state of Idaho.
“The state of Idaho is going to – if they haven’t already – plunge wolves back towards extinction, at least in Idaho,” Carter said.
“How do you manage if you don’t know how many you have?” Carter added.
She isn’t alone in worrying about the state management of wolves and the removal of limits on hunting and trapping.
“Is it a violation of our treaty?” Nez Perce Tribal Executive Committee Chairman Shannon Wheeler said. “Is it a violation of something that we were meant to protect? Of course it is. Of course it’s a violation of what was here in 1855 and before then. And that’s a part of tamáalwit, or the unwritten law, which we know that Article Three and the Treaty of 1855 with the Nez Perce represents.”
Some members of the wolf reintroduction teams say attitudes are even worse today than they were 30 years ago.
“Our country’s worse now than it was in terms of polarization, so those extreme divisions have only widened and become more cemented,” said Stone, executive director of the International Wildlife Coexistence Network and a co-founder of the Wood River Wolf Project. “ Back then, if I had told anyone from the opposition that didn’t want to have wolves back that they would be trapping and killing wolves 365 days of the year, using bounties to kill even pups in the den, they would have told me I was crazy and that would never happen – never happen. And we’re living it today. That is the reality on the ground today.”

Stone isn’t alone.
“Oh, I’m pretty worried,” said Doug Smith, who headed up the wolf program at Yellowstone National Park for nearly 30 years until he retired in 2022.
“Attitudes haven’t changed,” Smith said. “The fact is, they’re worse now. I’ve been studying wolves for over 40 years, and wolves have always been controversial. There’s always been people who like wolves and people who hate wolves. Now it’s like people are willing to do anything to get rid of wolves or anything to protect wolves, and they don’t want to talk to each other. I don’t think that’s progress, and right now the anti-wolf forces are winning in Idaho and Montana especially.”
Journalists Clark Corbin and Heath Druzin reported and wrote Howl over the course of 14 months, trekking deep into the backcountry in some of the most remote places in the Lower 48 chasing the story of America’s wildest and most controversial wildlife comeback story – wolf reintroduction.

The colors around the thermal features are locations of different thermophile communities. These thermophiles fix carbon, both from the atmosphere and from the hot water. (Jim Peaco/National Park Service)On the morning of June 21, visitors at Grand Prismatic Spring in Yellowstone National Park observed a bison slip into a shallow part of the hot spring. Clearly alarmed by the hot water — up to about 192 degrees Fahrenheit, which is just below boiling temperature at that elevation — the animal stumbled as it tried to get out and ended up stepping into an area of deeper water and quickly perished.
Yellowstone National Park officials decided not to remove the carcass. Such work would be dangerous and could cause extensive damage to the colorful bacterial mats that give Grand Prismatic Spring its name — that sort of damage can take more than a year to naturally repair itself. The bison’s body will break down quickly in the near-boiling water, and soon only the bones will be left.
Although rarely witnessed, it is not unprecedented that animals fall into hot springs. For example, an elk calf died while struggling to extract itself from mud pots in West Thumb Geyser Basin several years ago.
There are also animal skeletons visible in many hot springs, like Gentian Pool, Ojo Caliente, and the aptly named Skeleton Pool. Unexpectedly in 2022, University of California at Berkeley researchers found an elk skeleton in Doublet Pool, located on Geyser Hill near Old Faithful, when they put a camera into the spring as part of a study of hydrothermal activity. Similar incidents may have gone unwitnessed in the backcountry, or in winter or at night.
Animals can obviously feel the heat of thermal areas through their feet or hooves, but that doesn’t necessarily mean they never make mistakes near hydrothermal features. Most of these wildlife fatalities probably take place when animals break through thin crusts on the edges of springs.
The unfortunate incident of the bison at Grand Prismatic Spring provides an opportunity to revisit a common misconception about hot springs in Yellowstone, and also emphasize how to safely enjoy viewing the thermal features in the park.
Many visitors to Yellowstone believe that all of the hot springs in the park are acidic (pH lower than 5), and that the water will cause an acid burn on contact and dissolve any animals or people that fall into the springs. But nearly all major hot springs and geysers in Yellowstone are actually neutral (pH of around 7) or alkaline (pH greater than 7), including almost all of the geysers and hot springs in the famous thermal basins along the Firehole River.
Acidic features tend to be the fumaroles (gas vents), mud pots, and frying pans, which are all dominated by the release of acidic gases. One of the most acidic front-country features in the park is Sulphur Cauldron, in the Mud Volcano area. Fluids there have a pH less than 2, which is an acidity between that of stomach acid and lemon juice. Fortunately, acid concentrations are low, so mud and water from these features will not burn on contact, although it can cause skin irritation.
What kills most animals and occasionally people who fall into hot springs is not acidity, but temperature. Many hot springs are at or near boiling temperatures, and animal life will not survive for long when exposed, even if only briefly, to water that hot.
This is why staying on boardwalks in thermal areas of Yellowstone National Park is a requirement and is so important for visitor safety. Many thermal areas have thin crusts at the surface that overlie boiling waters or even hotter steam. Many injuries and fatalities to people have happened off boardwalk, when people have broken through these crusts, stepped on an unsupported sinter ledge, or stumbled into springs that were obscured or not obvious.
Yellowstone is a wild and dynamic place and can be hazardous. Fortunately, humans (and most animals) can recognize and avoid those hazards. So be sure to enjoy Yellowstone’s magnificent thermal areas from the safety of trails and boardwalks, and don’t forget to stay a safe distance from wildlife wherever you may encounter the park’s charismatic megafauna.

(Courtesy of Sgt. Christopher Richardson)LINCOLN — A new state law that took effect this week authorizes emergency medical services crews to provide care or transportation to Nebraska K-9s if one is ever injured in the line of duty.
Lawmakers, by a 47-0 vote in April 2024, approved a measure from State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston allowing emergency medical services for K-9s after July 1, 2025. It covers law enforcement canines owned or employed by state or local law enforcement, the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services, local fire departments or the State Fire Marshal’s Office.
K-9s aiding in the detection of criminal activity, flammable materials or missing persons; enforcement of laws; investigation of fires or apprehending criminal offenders would be covered.
Riepe said K-9s have proven beneficial and he hopes the law works out well.
“I think most people have a real kind spot in their heart for both dogs, cats, and probably some other animals that I’m not even aware of,” Riepe said this week.

Cody Thomas, a spokesperson for the Nebraska State Patrol, which employs and trains police service dogs, said the canines are “an extension of the officers they work with every day.” Such work can be dangerous for K-9s, with at least 10 killed in the line of duty nationwide already in 2025, he said.
“In the event one of our K-9 partners is injured in the line of duty, we would be grateful for any assistance provided by EMS teams, including transportation to an emergency veterinary hospital,” Thomas said in an email to the Nebraska Examiner.
At least two Nebraska K-9s have been killed in the past decade: K-9 Kobus for the Omaha Police Department in 2016 and K-9 Nitro II for the York County Sheriff’s Department in 2022.
More than a dozen states have similar laws.
Riepe’s legislation began at the initiative of Nebraska City Police Department Sgt. Christopher Richardson. Richardson sought to get around a state law forbidding any emergency care for an animal, including the bandaging of a minor cut.
“These dogs are alone and untreated, wasting valuable time and preventing lifesaving measures from being performed,” Richardson testified at a February 2024 hearing.
Richardson, who has taken multiple K-9s under his wing, told the Examiner in 2024 that in the case of Nebraska City, it can be a 45-minute delay to the nearest applicable care facility should his K-9 be harmed. He had said K-9 handlers spend more one-on-one time with their dogs, who he said can save an officer’s life without hesitation, than with their families.
“They’re not just another tool that’s on our duty belt,” Richardson previously told the Examiner.
  State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston. April 8, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
The new law still gives humans priority in the need of medical care or transport. EMS teams, including volunteer departments, would not be required to implement the new law. Any EMS workers operating in “good faith” to care for the dogs would be given civil and criminal immunity.
“We just want to make sure we don’t leave a dog that was injured in duty behind, which seems like a very common-sense thing,” Riepe told the Examiner in 2024.
The law authorized the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services to implement additional regulations. Instead, DHHS and the state’s Board of Emergency Medical Services and Board of Veterinary Medicine adopted multiple recommendations.
Among the recommendations for EMS teams that take on the new law:

Have a backup ambulance or plan to respond to emergency calls while caring for or transporting a K-9.
Certification in basic life support through the RECOVER initiative.
Specific training in K-9 care.
Close alignment with a local veterinary or pet care facility that would continue K-9 care after transport..
Medical equipment suitable for animal use, including oxygen masks and/or respiratory barrier masks for “mouth to snout” use.”
Written policies and procedures crafted with a local veterinarian for appropriate training, including safe handling for injured K-9s, such as muzzles, response coordination with a law enforcement officer trained in handling police dogs and decontamination procedures after K-9 transportation.

“We don’t want to have to transport our dogs in an ambulance,” Richardson said last year. “But if it comes to that, having that ability is huge.”

(contributed)Small communities in North Dakota can soon apply for grant money to support their grocery stores.
Lawmakers set aside $1 million for the grant during the 2025 legislative session out of concern for rural North Dakota towns that struggle to attract or sustain businesses that sell high-quality food. 
Successful applicants can receive up to $150,000.
The program is open to local governments — including tribal governments — with populations of 4,500 people or fewer.
Applicants must be able to match the grant money by 20%. Projects have to be completed within a year-and-a-half.
The Department of Commerce says it’s looking for proposals that show cooperation between “food providers, schools, restaurants and other local entities” to improve food access and support economic development in rural communities.
In testimony submitted in support of the grant earlier this year, North Dakota Grocers Association President John Dyste said food deserts are growing across the state.
“What rural grocers need is access to funding that will allow them to upgrade their facilities and equipment,” Dyste said. “They also need reliable, affordable access to groceries and perishable products.”
He added that people looking to buy independent rural grocery stores often have trouble securing financing.
The program follows a pilot rural food sustainability grant established during the 2023 legislative session.
The application window for the rural grocery store grant opens at 3 p.m. Wednesday and closes Sept. 3 at 5 p.m. For more information, visit the link program’s webpage.
A separate Department of Commerce grant puts a total $15 million up for grabs to support North Dakota tourism. 
The idea is to support projects that will draw out-of-state visitors to North Dakota recreational locations that reflect the state’s “culture, identity or landscape.”
Individual awards can range from $25,000 to $5 million. The grant is for projects that are shovel-ready, according to the Department of Commerce. Matching funds are also required.
Previous recipients of Department of Commerce tourism grants include: 

Shores Event Center in Devils Lake
Thrill Hills, a ski hill in Fort Ransom
Indian Hills Resort, a hunting and fishing resort in Garrison

The Legislature approved the grant during the 2025 legislative session to support the state’s tourism industry.
Applications opened earlier this week and will close July 31 at 5 p.m.

(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)With burgers sizzling and classic rock thumping, many Americans revel in summer cookouts — at least until that wayward cousin asks for a “pop” in soda country, or even worse, a “coke” when they actually want a Sprite.
Few American linguistic debates have bubbled quite as long and effervescently as the one over whether a generic soft drink should be called a soda, pop or coke.
The word you use generally boils down to where you’re from: Midwesterners enjoy a good pop, while soda is tops in the North and far West. Southerners, long the cultural mavericks, don’t bat an eyelash asking for coke — lowercase — before homing in on exactly the type they want: Perhaps a root beer or a Coke, uppercase.
As a linguist who studies American dialects, I’m less interested in this regional divide and far more fascinated by the unexpected history behind how a fizzy “health” drink from the early 1800s spawned the modern soft drink’s many names and iterations.
 
Bubbles, anyone?
Foods and drinks with wellness benefits might seem like a modern phenomenon, but the urge to create drinks with medicinal properties inspired what might be called a soda revolution in the 1800s.
The process of carbonating water was first discovered in the late 1700s. By the early 1800s, this carbonated water had become popular as a health drink and was often referred to as “soda water.” The word “soda” likely came from “sodium,” since these drinks often contained salts, which were then believed to have healing properties.
Given its alleged curative effects for health issues such as indigestion, pharmacists sold soda water at soda fountains, innovative devices that created carbonated water to be sold by the glass. A chemistry professor, Benjamin Stillman, set up the first such device in a drugstore in New Haven, Connecticut, in 1806. Its eventual success inspired a boom of soda fountains in drugstores and health spas.
By the mid-1800s, pharmacists were creating unique root-, fruit- and herb-infused concoctions, such as sassafras-based root beer, at their soda fountains, often marketing them as cures for everything from fatigue to foul moods.
These flavored, sweetened versions gave rise to the linking of the word “soda” with a sweetened carbonated beverage, as opposed to simple, carbonated water.
Seltzer — today’s popular term for such sparkling water — was around, too. But it was used only for the naturally carbonated mineral water from the German town Nieder-Selters. Unlike Perrier, sourced similarly from a specific spring in France, seltzer made the leap to becoming a generic term for fizzy water.
 
Regional naming patterns
So how did “soda” come to be called so many different things in different places?
It all stems from a mix of economic enterprise and linguistic ingenuity.
The popularity of “soda” in the Northeast likely reflects the soda fountain’s longer history in the region. Since a lot of Americans living in the Northeast migrated to California in the mid-to-late 1800s, the name likely traveled west with them.
As for the Midwestern preference for “pop” — well, the earliest American use of the term to refer to a sparkling beverage appeared in the 1840s in the name of a flavored version called “ginger pop.” Such ginger-flavored pop, though, was around in Britain by 1816, since a Newcastle songbook is where you can first see it used in text. The “pop” seems to be onomatopoeic for the noise made when the cork was released from the bottle before drinking.
Linguists don’t fully know why “pop” became so popular in the Midwest. But one theory links it to a Michigan bottling company, Feigenson Brothers Bottling Works — today known as Faygo Beverages — that used “pop” in the name of the sodas they marketed and sold. Another theory suggests that because bottles were more common in the region, soda drinkers were more likely to hear the “pop” sound than in the Northeast, where soda fountains reigned.
As for using coke generically, the first Coca-Cola was served in 1886 by Dr. John Pemberton, a pharmacist at Jacobs’ Pharmacy in Atlanta and the founder of the company. In the 1900s, the Coca-Cola company tried to stamp out the use of “Coke” for “Coca-Cola.” But that ship had already sailed. Since Coca-Cola originated and was overwhelmingly popular in the South, its generic use grew out of the fact that people almost always asked for “Coke.”

As with Jell-O, Kleenex, Band-Aids and seltzer, it became a generic term.
 
What’s soft about it?
Speaking of soft drinks, what’s up with that term?
It was originally used to distinguish all nonalcoholic drinks from “hard drinks,” or beverages containing spirits.
Interestingly, the original Coca-Cola formula included wine — resembling a type of alcoholic “health” drink popular overseas, Vin Mariani. But Pemberton went on to develop a “soft” version a few years later to be sold as a medicinal drink.
Due to the growing popularity of soda water concoctions, eventually “soft drink” came to mean only such sweetened carbonated beverages, a linguistic testament to America’s enduring love affair with sugar and bubbles.
With the average American guzzling almost 40 gallons per year, you can call it whatever you what. Just don’t call it healthy.

(Washington State Parks)Though Washington State Parks, like other parts of state government, did not make it through this year’s legislative session with its budget unscathed, park visitors shouldn’t notice any staffing or service changes this summer, according to the agency.
“We were fairly fortunate in that we were able to make mostly non-staffing cuts to be able to stay within budget,” said Sarah Fronk, a State Parks spokesperson.
New budget, some new state laws take effect today in Idaho

The agency’s operating budget for the 2025-27 biennium is $257.6 million, about $14.7 million less than its budget for the 2023-25 biennium.
State Parks cut nine vacant positions and made other reductions, such as limiting staff travel, to stay within its tighter budget.
“It’s really being extremely mindful of where we’re spending and what our priorities are,” Fronk said of managing the cuts, adding that maintaining safe and clean parks is the agency’s primary focus.
In addition to a smaller budget, State Parks is now expected to fund 71% of its costs with revenue from Discover Passes and other fees, up from 65% in the last budget cycle.
Discover Pass prices will rise from $30 to $45 on Oct. 1. Transaction fees can also apply to pass purchases, including a $5 charge for online sales. The passes are required for motor vehicle access to state parks and other recreation sites.
The Legislature approved the Discover Pass price increase during last year’s session. It’s the first price increase since the passes were introduced about 14 years ago.
“We’re really grateful to the Legislature for having our backs and kicking a little more revenue support our way,” Fronk said. “With the Discover Pass, I really can’t reiterate enough that it really does go to support your state parks and the stewardship and recreation work that we’re doing, because so much of our agency’s revenue is dependent on those sales.”
Washington State Parks manages about 123 developed parks, 6,000 campsites, 800 historic buildings and 1,300 miles of trails across 12,000 acres of land.
State Parks’ busy summer season runs from Memorial Day weekend in May to Labor Day weekend in September.
“We’re anticipating that there’ll be a lot of visitors to state parks this year, and so we’re definitely gearing up for that,” Fronk said.
In an effort to support staff with a smaller budget, State Parks is bolstering its education programs “so that people coming into the park don’t need quite as much help, and we can stay focused on cleaning and doing interpretive work,” Fronk said.
New this summer, State Parks has partnered with the Washington State Parks Foundation and the online education platform Fridie Outdoors to create an educational video series for park visitors.
State Parks also has a variety of outdoor guides and other resources available on its website to help visitors build outdoor literacy.
“I really believe that, once people get those experiences outdoors and understand more what they’re seeing around them, they’re going to be more excited and interested in helping protect that, as well,” Fronk said.

Military aircraft including a B-2 bomber flew over the White House as the national anthem was sung.Trump saluted 150 airmen and their families at the event from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri, where the B-2s that bombed Iran in June originated their flights.But he also attacked Democrats who opposed his legislation, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., who gave a speech on the floor in opposition on Wednesday that broke a House record for its length.Members of the Cabinet were present for the bill-signing as well as Speaker of the House Mike Johnson and House Majority Leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana, House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota, Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee and Mike Crapo of Idaho and other top GOP members of Congress.The president signed the bill seated at a desk in front of the picnic-goers, with lawmakers and Cabinet members surrounding him. Johnson presented Trump with the gavel that Johnson said he used when the vote closed to pass the “big, beautiful bill.” Trump pounded on the desk with the gavel and handed out pens to those gathered around him.Medicaid slashedIn order to fulfill priorities in the tax and spending cut bill, congressional Republicans scaled back spending on Medicaid, food assistance for low-income people and clean energy programs.Democrats objected to the cuts to Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, and other provisions. But because Republicans have unified control of Congress, the GOP was able to pass the bill through a complex process known as reconciliation, skirting the Senate’s 60-vote threshold.The Senate passed its version of the bill after Vice President JD Vance cast the tie-breaking 51-50 vote Tuesday. The House managed Thursday to pass the new version of the bill after two chaotic days negotiating with far-right members who initially objected to the bill and later acquiesced, with a vote of 218-214.The only Republicans to object in the Senate were Maine’s Susan Collins, Kentucky’s Rand Paul and North Carolina’s Thom Tillis. The House GOP members who voted with Democrats were Kentucky’s Thomas Massie and Pennsylvania's Brian Fitzpatrick.Also tucked into the bill is a provision that raises the country’s debt ceiling by $5 trillion, which has brought objections from Republican fiscal hawks like Paul.",,,,2025-07-04 19:03:46.736062

(Courtesy of Ned Pillersdorf)Prestonsburg attorney Ned Pillersdorf is hoping to unseat longtime Republican U.S. Rep. Hal Rogers next year. 
Pillersdorf was scheduled to formally announce his candidacy at the Rosenberg Square in the Floyd County seat Friday afternoon, but he spoke with the Kentucky Lantern earlier this week about his plans. Pillersdorf, a Democrat, said his decision to run stems mostly from Rogers’ support for the sweeping GOP megabill that includes cuts to social safety net programs on which many people in the district depend.
Rogers, of Somerset, has represented Kentucky’s 5th Congressional District for nearly 45 years. The region includes much of Appalachian Kentucky. 
The congressional district is also one of the nation’s poorest and one of the most dependent on Medicaid. Almost half of the constituents in the district — 44% — rely on the state-federal program to pay for their health care and it has been critical to sustaining hospital services in Eastern Kentucky.
Pillersdorf — whose law office proclaims, “We represent underdogs” — is known as the attorney who stepped up to represent thousands of Eastern Kentuckians who lost disability benefits after being represented by disgraced attorney Eric Conn.
Conn was convicted of defrauding the Social Security Administration and sentenced to prison. Pillersdorf is featured prominently in the 2022 Apple TV+ documentary series, “The Big Conn,” which recaps the case and Conn’s capture after he fled to Honduras. 
Pillersdorf also is no stranger to politics, as he helped run nonpartisan campaigns for his wife, former Kentucky Supreme Court Justice Janet Stumbo. She became the first woman elected to the state’s high court in 1993.

However, Pillersdorf says this campaign is “not so much about me” but “what’s on the horizon” for people who will lose safety net resources under the GOP bill. 
Pillersdorf said Rogers’ backing of the legislation is “a betrayal of the needs of our citizens,” as the legislation “will cause incalculable damage to this region.” As the legislation moved through Congress, Pillersdorf said he decided to combine his campaign announcement with a protest against the safety net cuts. 
“I just think that that bill will have tremendous impacts across the board, and Hal Rogers truly betrayed the needs to protect the safety net,” Pillersdorf said. 
The Democratic candidate also has concerns about other clawbacks of federal funding for local programs under the Trump administration, such as a shutdown of Job Corps programs and education funding that is now up in the air. Within the congressional district, Letcher County Schools planned to use its remaining $3 million in pandemic relief funding to replace 25 school buses lost during 2022 floods, but Trump’s U.S. Department of Education nixed the reimbursement. The Trump administration also canceled a grant to the Hindman Settlement School in Knott County that was to support reading and math intervention programs.
“There is just a systemwide attack on the safety net on multiple fronts, and my criticism of the Democratic Party is we don’t pay attention to rural voters, and we are a rural district, and we are under attack,” Pillersdorf said. “And I intended to be an independent Democratic voice for our rural community to fight back about what’s going on on multiple fronts.” 
Pillersdorf acknowledged that the Democratic Party’s reputation in rural America right now is “problematic.” Kentucky Democrats have faced a recent setback in Eastern Kentucky after longtime state Sen. Robin Webb, of Grayson, joined the Republican Party. However, Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin told Kentucky Democrats during a June dinner that he is focused on getting “the DNC out of D.C.” in hopes of bringing rural voters back into the fold. 
The political landscape “is radically changing” as voters hear more about the GOP megabill, Pillersdorf said. He added that he believes the legislation “has reshuffled the deck” for Democrats.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ned-1024x643.jpg,,,2025-07-04 17:05:17.539217

Jazon Gonzalez Perez, granted a $2,500 bond by a judge Wednesday in immigration court, was spotlighted in a recent Nebraska Examiner story. His friend and mentor, lifelong Nebraskan Richard Randall, Sr., described how his own support and view of President Donald Trump’s immigration strategy had shifted. 
Randall said the arrest of his “little buddy,” Gonzalez Perez, “hit home” and did not represent the type of enforcement he had bought into when he voted for Trump last November. The case reflected stepped-up tactics at worksites, on streets and in courthouses coinciding with quotas demanded by the Trump administration.
When arrested, Gonzalez Perez had been looking for a bank branch to deposit funds on behalf of work. A cellphone search led him toward a branch on Offutt Air Force Base. He was detained at a checkpoint when he could not produce a valid driver’s license.

Base personnel called U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Gonzalez Perez called Randall. 
As agents took Gonzalez Perez, Randall recalled saying, “Hey wait, he’s not a terrorist. He manages a restaurant. I thought we were arresting gang members, murderers and rapists. He’s none of those.”
Gonzalez Perez’s attorney, Erika Buenrostro, said her client was released on bond pending resolution of his civil case in immigration court. He is accused of unauthorized U.S. presence. Given the court backlog, local attorneys say such cases can take years to resolve.
Upon his release from nearly a month in jail, Randall said his buddy expressed gratitude for Plattsmouth area community members who showed support, and that Gonzalez Perez was happy to be home with family and friends.
“Our community spoke up for Jazon and he is touched by all of the support,” said Randall.

John C. Hughes is, at root, a storyteller. As he marks the end of a nearly six-decade career that spanned hot-type newspapering on the coast to crafting the biographical record of Washington’s political and civic leaders, he recognizes a shift in his own disposition. Once sanguine about civic life, even with all its faults, he finds himself in a funk at this time of transition — morose, melancholy, and discouraged.
As he prepares to retire, Hughes leaves behind a shelf full of books, countless oral histories, and a warning: The decline of journalism and civic memory threatens democracy itself.
His body of work began in his hometown, where he still lives. “Grays Harbor is one of those places that has terroir, a sense of place,” Hughes said, explaining his lifelong connection to the timber town of Aberdeen, where he spent 42 years at The Daily World, eventually rising to editor and publisher. He turned down jobs at larger newspapers, including offers from The Seattle Times, out of a commitment to community journalism. “There was something in my blood,” he said. “It’s where I think I belong.”
In a wide-ranging and often poignant conversation with Austin Jenkins on TVW’s Inside Olympia, Hughes said his career began as a reporter in the mid-1960s. Washington had dozens of small daily newspapers with vibrant newsrooms. The Daily World boasted a staff of 21 reporters at its peak. Today, Hughes noted, the paper employs just three journalists and its circulation has plummeted below 5,000. “We had three great photographers on staff, we did investigative work, we went toe to toe with the big-city papers,” he recalled.
The loss, he said, is not just in jobs or prestige. It’s civic. “There’s a direct line between the decline of newspapers and the decline of civic engagement,” Hughes said. “When people don’t know their own stories, they don’t know how to defend their communities.”
As chief historian for Legacy Washington, a project of the secretary of state’s office, Hughes transitioned from reporting the present to preserving the past. In that role, he conducted hundreds of interviews and authored or co-authored 17 books over 17 years, telling the stories of governors, judges, lawmakers, civil rights pioneers, and cultural figures, all of whom left an indelible mark on the state. His subjects include Gov. John Spellman, Sen. Slade Gorton, columnist Adele Ferguson, and former first lady Nancy Evans.
When asked which of his books he considers most consequential, Hughes pointed to “John Spellman: Politics Never Broke His Heart,” praising Spellman as a one-term Republican governor who vetoed a massive pipeline project out of environmental concern. “The Inimitable Adele Ferguson” stands out for its portrait of the legendary Bremerton political columnist who held Olympia’s feet to the fire. And “Slade Gorton: A Half Century in Politics” documents the arc of a brilliant, if polarizing, legal and political career.
His most recent book, “New Land,” co-authored with historian Ed Echtle, tells the story of Washington’s resettlement of Southeast Asian refugees after the Vietnam War. Hughes credits former Gov. Dan Evans, former Secretary of State Bruce Chapman and then special emissary to the governor Ralph Munro as exemplars of what he calls “latter-day profiles in courage.”
“These are stories that animate us toward citizenship,” he said. “They’re about people who did the right thing when it wasn’t easy.”
Despite working for a statewide elected official, Hughes has maintained a fierce sense of professional independence. “I am in no way a spokesman for the Office of the Secretary of State,” he said. “There hasn’t been a partisan litmus test, not once.”
His ability to write 17 books in 17 years? That, he said, comes from the rigors of daily journalism. “When you become an accomplished journeyman deadline reporter, then you can write quickly,” he said. “I just love storytelling.”
That storytelling instinct was reinforced early by Murray Morgan, the renowned historian and author of “Skid Road,” who once advised Hughes to “be a newspaperman first” to sharpen his writing and his instincts.
But along with the pride in his work comes melancholy. Hughes has written about many people who are now gone — including Gorton, Spellman and Ferguson. “My mom always said the best thing about people who were so alive when they were alive is that when they’re gone, it’s like they’re really still here,” he said. “But you still miss them.”
That sense of loss extends to institutions. Hughes mourned the state’s decision to shutter the Washington State Library and the Talking Book & Braille Library due to budget cuts. “I can’t think of anything more gratuitously stupid than to close a great cultural institution like the Washington State Library,” he said.
Looking back on his hometown, Hughes has also witnessed political realignment. Grays Harbor, once a Democratic stronghold, has voted for Donald Trump in three consecutive elections. Hughes was not surprised. “The grievance on Grays Harbor is that the Democratic Party has, in essence, said, ‘Let them eat cake.’”
He spoke of the disappearance of “lunch-bucket Democrats” — moderate, labor-aligned lawmakers like Sid Snyder, Jim Hargrove and Brian Blake. “A breed of Democrat that’s pretty much extinct at this point. Maybe [they’ve] gone the way of the spotted owl.”
Ultimately, Hughes worries about the future of democracy. “I believe these are perilous times for American democracy,” he said. “If we don’t understand our history — if we don’t teach civics and truth—then we lose the shared values that hold us together.”
After a career that spanned both headlines and history books, Hughes summed it up simply: “I count every day as a real blessing. And I get to tell these stories.” Affirming Morgan’s famous formulation, Hughes says, “Journalism is the sport of kings.”

He visited Stewpot Community Services during its daily free lunch hour Thursday to discuss new state laws, which took effect two days earlier, targeting Mississippians experiencing homelessness.
“I understand that you are going through some hard times right now. That’s why I’m here,” Wade said to the crowd. “I felt it was important to come out here and speak with you directly.”
Wade laid out the three bills that passed earlier this year: House Bill 1197, the “Safe Solicitation Act,” HB 1200, the “Real Property Owners Protection Act” and HB 1203, a bill that prohibits camping on public property. 
“Sleeping and laying in public places, you’re not going to be able to do that anymore,” he said. “There’s a law that has been passed that you can’t just set up encampments on public or private properties where it’s a public nuisance, it’s a problem.”
The “Real Property Owners Protection Act,” authored by Rep. Brent Powell, R-Brandon, is a bill that expedites the process of removing squatters. The “Safe Solicitation Act,” authored by Rep. Shanda Yates, I-Jackson, requires a permit for panhandling and allows people to be charged with a misdemeanor if they violate this law. The offense is punishable by a fine not to exceed $300 and an offender could face up to six months in jail. Wade said he’s currently working with his legal department to determine the best strategy for creating and issuing permits. 
“We’re going to navigate these legal challenges, get some interpretations, not only from our legal department, but the Attorney General’s office to ensure that we are doing it legally and lawfully, because I understand that these are citizens,” he said. “I understand that they deserve to be treated with respect, and I understand that we are going to do this without violating their constitutional rights.”

Wade said the Jackson Police Department is steadily fielding reports of squatters in abandoned properties and the law change gives officers new power to remove them more quickly. The added challenge? Figuring out what to do with a person’s belongings. 
“These people are carrying around what they own, but we are not a repository for all of their stuff,” he said. “So, when we make that arrest, we’ve got to have a strategic plan as to what we do with their stuff.” 
Wade said there needs to be a deeper conversation around the issues that lead someone to becoming homeless. 
“A lot of people that we’re running across that are homeless are also suffering from medical conditions, mental health issues, and they’re also suffering from drug addiction and substance abuse. We’ve got to have a strategic approach, but we also can’t log jam our jail down in Raymond,” Wade said. 
He estimates that more than 800 people are currently incarcerated at the Raymond Detention Center, and any increase could strain the system as the laws continue to be enforced.
“I think there’s layers that we have to work through, there’s hurdles that we are going to overcome, but we’ve got to make sure that we do it and make sure that my team and JPD is consistent in how we enforce these laws,” Wade said.
Diners applauded Wade after he spoke, in between bites of fried chicken, salad, corn and 4th of July-themed packaged cakes. Wade offered to answer questions, but no one asked any.
Rev. Jill Buckley, executive director of Stewpot, said that the legislation is a good tool to address issues around homelessness and community needs. She doesn’t want to see people who are homeless be criminalized, but she also wants communities to be safe.
“I support people’s right to self determine, and we can’t impose our choices on other people, but there are some cases in which that impinges on community safety, and so to the extent that anyone who is camping or panhandling or squatting and is a danger to themselves and others, of course, I fully support that kind of law. I don’t support homelessness being criminalized as such,” Buckley said.

Many of the people Wade addressed while they ate Thursday said they have housing, don’t panhandle, and shouldn’t be directly impacted by the legislation. But Marcus Willis, 42, said it would make more sense if elected officials wanted to combat the negative impacts of homelessness that they help more people secure employment.
“There ain’t enough jobs,” said Willis, who was having lunch with his girlfriend Amber Ivy.
The two live in an apartment together nearby on Capitol Street, where Ivy landed after her mother, whom Ivy had been living with, suffered a stroke and lost the property. Similarly, Willis started coming to eat at Stewpot after his grandmother, whose house he used to visit for lunch, passed away.
Willis holds odd jobs – cutting grass, home and auto repair – so the income is inconsistent, and every opportunity for stable employment he said he’s found is outside of Jackson in the suburbs. The couple doesn’t have a car.
Making rent every month usually depends on their ability to find someone to help chip in, said Ivy, who is in recovery from substance abuse. She said she’s watched problems surrounding homelessness grow over the years in Jackson. Ivy grew up near Stewpot and has lived in various neighborhoods across the city – except for the times she moved out of state when things got too rough.
“There was just moments where I just had to leave,” Ivy said. “Sometimes if you hit a slump here, there’s almost no way for you to get out of it.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/03143348/Chief-Wade-at-Stewpot-4.jpg,,,2025-07-04 14:09:32.645224

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson’s entry into the 2026 race for South Dakota governor launches him into a Republican primary in which a competitor is making allegiance to President Donald Trump a main issue.
Johnson announced his candidacy Monday with a pledge to focus on “addition and multiplication” rather than division and anger. That same day, a political action committee issued a statement accusing Johnson of being insufficiently loyal to Trump.
“Dusty Johnson is South Dakota’s Never-Trumper-In-Chief,” said Drew Dennert, chairman of Dakota First Action.

The group was founded by Toby Doeden, an Aberdeen businessman who announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination for governor in May. On Tuesday, some South Dakotans received a large postcard from Doeden’s campaign featuring a photo of a bloody Trump after an assassination attempt, with the headine “Will you answer President Trump’s call?”
The other declared Republican candidate for governor is the speaker of the state House of Representatives, Jon Hansen, who announced in April. Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden — who is serving the remainder of Kristi Noem’s term after she resigned for a post in the Trump administration — has not announced whether he’s running.
Johnson said accusations that he’s not supportive of Trump “are not criticisms I generally hear these days.”
“We’re in a political environment where people love to level accusations. And the reality is, I kind of reject the labels,” Johnson said. “I’m just a conservative who’s trying to get things done. And clearly, that means working with President Trump, and we’ve got a great working relationship. He’s had me down in Mar-a-Lago. He’s had me at the Super Bowl. We talk regularly about policy.” 
Johnson, 48, is a married father of three from Mitchell who is currently serving his fourth term as South Dakota’s lone member of the U.S. House of Representatives. 
The following conversation with Johnson has been edited for length and clarity.
Why do you want to be South Dakota’s governor instead of its congressman? 
I love the state. I think the next 20 years for South Dakota could be the best in our history, but I don’t think that’s a sure thing. I think to realize that future, we need a real plan. I think we need real leadership, and I’m excited to be the person who pulls together that plan and pulls together that team. 
In many respects, I think the challenges facing South Dakota right now are the right fit for my skill set. 
Some Republicans claim you are not a “real” conservative. How will you address that? 
The proof is in the pudding. Ultimately, the Republican voters get a say. The Republican voters like the job I do, they understand the conservative and pragmatic worldview that I bring to my work, and they like it. 
You voted to certify the 2020 election and voted against Trump’s border wall emergency declaration during his first term. How will you address accusations that you don’t support the president?
Those are not criticisms I generally hear these days. I mean, I think if you were to ask Chat GPT to gather up all of the political articles of the last two years, I think one narrative would be that Dusty Johnson is just too close to Donald Trump. 
I don’t try to be any particular type of Republican. I just try to be a conservative who gets things done. 
The whole label conversation is kind of ridiculous. It maybe tells you what a dysfunctional age we’re in that I can be an architect of some of the major successes of the House in the last seven months — securing the border, cutting spending and reforming welfare — and somehow, for some people, that’s not enough.
Trump’s cuts to the federal government have resulted in South Dakota’s state government losing $24 million thus far, according to the state Bureau of Finance and Management. You’ve been generally supportive of those cuts. How would you address that lost funding as governor?
Anytime the federal government cuts anything, there is a narrative that the sky is falling. And clearly, some of these cuts are uncomfortable, and I don’t want to be cavalier about them. I mean, these are real programs that matter. And yet, $24 million out of a $7 billion state budget is about one-third of 1% of the state budget. 
South Dakotans are resilient enough. We’re resourceful enough to be able to tighten our belt and still get the important things done, even in the face of a federal government that absolutely must move toward fiscal responsibility. 
I’m proud of those fiscally responsible votes that I’ve taken. I know they’re not always easy, but if we don’t take care of business, our country will go bankrupt.

What areas of state government would you first look at when considering cuts?
Number one, we do need to cut property taxes. And unlike some, I think we need to do it in a responsible way that protects those core services and roads, bridges, cops and schools. 
Number two, we need to make college and technical school more affordable. And we need to double down on the programs and the research that really moves South Dakota forward. 
In K-12, we need to be relentless about student achievement. We are not talking enough about student achievement. We need to set real goals, we need to use real data. We can’t be afraid to lead. 
We need to focus more on drugs and addiction if we want safer communities. We need new interdiction teams, and we need smarter training and treatment within the walls of our prisons. 
And we need to grow this economy so we can keep taxes low. That’s going to come from new small businesses, new energy production, dairy expansion and bringing high-tech jobs home to South Dakota. 
How would you go about cutting property taxes? 
I think we need to focus our property tax relief on the owner-occupied residential, and really, the farmer-managed ag property. 
We have plenty of out-of-staters who own plenty of property in South Dakota, and I’m just not as interested in giving them a tax break. 
Several failed bills last legislative session in Pierre aimed to create some form of school vouchers using public funds to support non-public educational options. Would you support legislation to establish a voucher program?
I’m a big supporter of educational choice and properly funding our public schools. 
I’ve got three sons who are products of public schools, and our Mitchell schools have done an incredible job with my boys. 
We’re very involved parents. We spend a lot of time focusing on what they’re learning. And I think the quality of the education is excellent. And I think, as long as we are properly funding our public school systems, then I think we’re allowed the flexibility to ask if there are other educational opportunities that we can invest in as well.
Last legislative session, lawmakers passed and Gov. Larry Rhoden signed a bill banning eminent domain — a legal process for obtaining land access — for carbon dioxide pipelines. As governor, how would you have navigated that?
It’s not my interest in re-litigating every decision that the last administration has done. Fundamentally, this has got to be a forward-looking campaign. And so I just don’t know that there’s any benefit in me being critical of anything that Governor Rhoden has done. 
South Dakota has long struggled with workforce shortages in health care and child care. How would you address these chronic issues? 
First off, let’s put this into context: This is not a South Dakota problem. It’s a problem in South Dakota, but it’s a problem everywhere. Literally, every one of the 50 states has chronic and severe workforce shortages in child care and health care. 
So, I think we need to be honest with ourselves that this is going to take a multi-year, focused effort to solve. This is, in part, closing the skills gap. I think we need to identify people who can go into those fields and do a better job of getting them the education they need. 
There is no silver bullet. It will be 100 solutions that address this problem, not one big one. 
President Trump has deployed military forces on U.S. soil during protests without state consent, attempted to redefine birthright citizenship by executive order, fired independent inspectors general, deported people allegedly without due process, threatened to annex Canada and Greenland, and intimidated dissenting media. What do you say to protesters in South Dakota worried that America is moving toward authoritarianism?
We have to care about the rule of law. And so, what does the rule of law mean? That means that you only get to do those things that are lawful exercises of power. 
Here’s what we know: The federal judiciary has said that the way the president handled the birthright citizenship case is permissible for now; they have said that his use of the National Guard is permissible for now; the firing of independent inspectors general was also permissible.
And so, it’s an interesting allegation for people to say that the president is being an authoritarian when he is following court orders. He has won in these court cases. 
I feel like it would be inappropriate for him to ignore a federal court order, but he hasn’t. He’s been winning these things, so it’s an odd accusation for them to make that he’s the one who is violating the rule of law.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2550-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-04 13:14:23.133911

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The average cost for a 10-person Fourth of July will be $70.92 this year, 30 cents less than last summer but the second-highest cookout cost since 2013 when the American Farm Bureau Federation began its annual survey on the topic.
Beef, canned goods and hand-picked crops saw the highest price increases from last year, due likely to low domestic cattle inventory, aluminum tariffs and the cost of labor.
The American Farm Bureau survey assumes a gathering of 10 people who will consume: cheeseburgers, chicken breasts, pork chops, potato chips, canned pork and beans, fresh strawberries, homemade potato salad, fresh-squeezed lemonade, chocolate chip cookies and ice cream.
Cans of pork and beans had the steepest increase, up 8.2% or 20 cents, from last year. The bureau said labor costs along the supply chain and steep tariffs on aluminum are likely to blame.
Homemade lemonade will also cost 20 cents more per pitcher this year, and strawberries 8 cents more per pound, due to a continued trend of high labor costs in the specialty crop sector.
The cost of ground beef also increased to $13.33 for two pounds, which is nearly 60 cents more than the $12.77 it cost in 2024. While normally a crowd favorite, it will cost families nearly $20 to make 10 cheeseburgers this weekend, according to the survey prices.
U.S. cattle herd size has been declining since 2019, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported the 2025 herd size was 8% lower than 2019 herd. The amount of beef imported to the U.S. has also gone up in that time frame.
Pork chops, on the other hand, had the largest decrease in price from last year. Three pounds of pork chops this weekend should run consumers about $14.13, which is nearly 9% less than the cut cost last year. The survey concludes this is due to high domestic pork supplies.

The cost of chicken breasts declined slightly from last year’s cookout prices but the cost of eggs increased, which made potato salad about 20 cents more expensive this year. Poultry have been affected by the ongoing highly pathogenic avian influenza, which has caused fluctuating prices as the supply chains are impacted.
Since January, the U.S. has imported about 10 times the amount of eggs it imported in the same period in 2024 as part of the administration’s plan to combat the bird flu. Wholesale egg prices have declined by more than 60% since January, but the American Farm Bureau report shows the cost for consumers for just four eggs is up 54% from last summer.
The bureau survey also breaks prices down by region and found cookouts on the East Coast are the cheapest this year at $63.79, followed by the South — which includes Maryland, in the Farm Bureau report — where a party of 10 can be fed for $68.93. Gatherings in the West average at $73.50 and Midwestern gatherings come in as the second most expensive at $69.87.
Farmers not pocketing fair share, advocates say
Consumer increases don’t necessarily mean higher earnings for farmers, however. On average, farmers and ranchers receive about 16 cents per consumer dollar spent on food, according to the latest “Farmer’s Share” report from National Farmers Union.
Rob Larew, the organization’s president said it’s important to highlight the “growing imbalance” in the food system.
“Family farmers and ranchers are working harder than ever, yet taking home less, while corporate monopolies in processing, distribution and retail rake in record profits,” Larew said. “Farmers deserve a fair share of the food dollar, and consumers deserve a food system that works for everyone, not just a handful of powerful corporations.”
According to the report, a rancher takes home $2.08 on a one pound package of ground beef sold for $5.99. A lettuce farmer gets an even lower cut, receiving about 8.2% of the consumer dollar.
Consumers also feel like their dollars don’t stretch as far. According to the latest food and farm index from the Iowa Farm Bureau, price is the number one factor for Iowa shoppers as they fill their grocery carts, even as more consumers say they want to buy locally raised products.
Christopher Pudenz, an Iowa Farm Bureau economist, said price changes in Iowa-grown commodities “mostly reflect” supply and demand cycles.
“The Fourth of July is, of course, a celebration of our freedom but also a celebration of the American spirit, one embodied by our nation’s farmers,” Pudenz said in a press release. “Despite challenges like rising costs and weather impacts, Iowa farmers continue to do what they’ve always done — work hard, adapt and provide for American families.”

Wes Moore said the state will find a new location for its planned $7 million cannabis incubator project, after local opposition to the original choice at the Maryland National Guard’s William J. Witte Armory in Catonsville.
In a statement Wednesday, Moore said that after further review of the project, he decided that the state “should explore new options” for the incubator’s location. The three agencies leading the project — the Maryland Cannabis Administration, the Department of General Services and the Maryland Economic Development Corporation (MEDCO) — will immediately begin a new search process to find potential sites.
“As part of their site review, I have instructed the agencies to identify locations that are not within close proximity to residential communities and schools,” Moore wrote. “The agencies will begin this new process immediately, conduct extensive community and stakeholder engagement, and work quickly to move the project forward.”
The announcement comes after the incubator’s planned location drew opposition in recent weeks from some local residents because the site is in a residential area and close to a nearby elementary school, a temple and a day care center.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Catonsville resident Josh Jackson launched a Change.org petition in early June opposing the project and calling for greater transparency from the state throughout the process. The petition notes potential problems of having the incubator in the community, including security concerns from the site’s cannabis storage, nuisance smells and traffic issues.
“Whether or not you support cannabis rights, creating a cannabis incubator, or spending up to $7 million on such a project, the community where this business is to be located should have been informed and should have had their input considered,” the petition read. “There are plenty of other opportunities in the State to create a safe and secure space for business growth in existing commercial or industrial areas after clear communication and public input.”
In a December 2023 report, MEDCO listed 37 locations across the state which were submitted for consideration and reviewed as potential sites for the incubator. Notably, the armory was not included on that list of potential locations.
The project aims to be the country’s first-ever state-owned cannabis incubator. Up to 110 microbusinesses would be able to use the incubator to securely store their product before delivery or to process cannabis products using the building’s shared commercial kitchen and equipment, according to written

His statements from that time may inform the present moment.
Sherman was a key figure in the drafting of the Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation, the United States Constitution, and the amendments that came to be known as the Bill of Rights. He also revised the Acts and Laws of the State of Connecticut in 1784, including an Abstract and Declaration of the Rights and Privileges of the People of this State, asserting that Connecticut “shall forever be and remain a free, sovereign and independent State … under the sole authority of the People thereof, independent of any King or Prince whatever.”


Also in 1784, Roger wrote in defense of the Articles of Confederation, “The Honorable Continental Congress have taken due care to secure the rights of the separate states,” and “Each state retains its SOVEREIGNTY, FREEDOM, and INDEPENDENCE, and every power, jurisdiction and right, not expressly delegated to the United States in Congress assembled.”
In the Connecticut Courant in 1788, Sherman wrote, “The immediate security of the civil and domestic rights of the people will be in the governments of the particular states. And as the different states have different local interests and customs which can best be regulated by their own laws, it would not be expedient to admit the federal government to interfere with them any further than necessary for the good of the whole.”
Sherman was also concerned about executive power. He believed that the President of the United States should be “nothing more than an institution for carrying the will of the Legislature into effect,” and he “was against enabling any one man to stop the will of the whole,” as the legislature “was the depository of the supreme will of the Society.”
Despite these early warnings, our history has found it expedient to admit federal interference in the states and to relinquish powers to the President. Now that interference, and the abdication of power by the legislature, threaten the security of the civil and domestic rights of the people in Connecticut. The current federal administration is testing the limits of executive authority with orders that violate the most basic individual rights despite Connecticut’s own strong guarantees to equal protection and due process.
Concerns about the erosion of civil-rights protections by devolution under a new federalism assume that federal protections are stronger than the protections offered by the state. This moment in Connecticut turns that argument on its head. Though the Fourteenth Amendment enabled the United States to impose civil rights to emancipation, equal protection, public education, and accommodations for disabilities, among others, the same “power to enforce” now brings regressive and repressive federal actions.
Under a new progressive federalism, Connecticut can be a safe haven of civil rights for our residents. If there are any federal protections that exceed those assured by our state laws and Constitution, then we can ask our General Assembly and our governor to enact those protections here.

(USDA photo courtesy of Humane World for Animals) An Iowa-based animal welfare organization has conducted what may be the first nationwide study of regulatory violations among dog breeders who supply brokers and retailers with animals.
The study shows that more than half of the breeders or brokers who supply retail stores with puppies, and who have been tracked over the past three years by the nonprofit organization Bailing Out Benji,  have been cited for regulatory violations.
Mindi Callison, executive director of the Iowa-based nonprofit organization, says that for decades, there has been a lack of data surrounding the pet-acquisition industry — particularly with regard to the complicated intersection of breeders, brokers and sellers.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
To address that issue, Callison says, Bailing Out Benji has widened its scope of research from federally licensed breeders who sell to pet shops to include state-licensed breeders and dealers as well as online sellers and the brokers who act as “middle men” in the trafficking of animals.
The research, she says, paints a fuller picture of the issues that the commercial dog-breeding world faces, and is the first of its kind. It’s based on an analysis of five years of data on the thousands of breeders who are licensed at the federal and state level, plus three years of data on the breeders who supply pet stores.
“For the first time ever, the commercial dog breeding and sales industry has been audited,” she said. “These facts and figures will allow for us to track progress on the national level, while giving us a more clear picture on where the problem areas are so they can be addressed.”

She said the first step toward meaningful change is having a clear understanding of the scope of the problem. “This data will be a game changer for those who are passionate about using real facts to drive that change for animals and the people who love them,” she said, adding that the data will help her and others track progress when advocates and lawmakers are trying to pass legislation related to animal welfare.
The data, Callison said, provides national averages for regulatory violations among licensed breeders, the breeders and brokers who supply pet stores, the breeders who supply third-party brokers, and the breeders and brokers who sell through online websites.
She said that in Iowa, specifically, about 33% of the brokers and breeders licensed at the state and federal level have been cited for regulatory violations at some point in the past five years.

“That is slightly lower than what we are seeing as the national average and is based on 678 facilities we are tracking in Iowa — which includes breeders who recently canceled their licenses after they had violations,” she said. “On the pet-store side, we are seeing that 28% percent of the breeders in Iowa that have sold to pet stores in the last three years have had violations.”
Among the study’s national findings:
— Violations by breeders: 41% of the licensed breeders have incurred state or federal violations during the past five years.
— Breeders to stores: 36% of the 1,946 licensed breeders who directly supplied pet stores in the last three years have incurred state or federal violations.
— Breeders to brokers: 34% of the breeders found to be supplying brokers in the last three years had incurred state or federal violations. Callison notes that this finding is based on preliminary data that may be updated since it does not reflect every breeder who sells through brokers.
— Puppy stores: 63% of the 542 puppy stores that have been tracked over the last three years have purchased puppies from breeders or brokers with known regulatory violations. This data excludes stores with common, shared ownership and which don’t receive shipments directly from the breeders or brokers.
— Online sales: 42% of the licensed breeders known to be supplying online brokering websites or online marketplaces have incurred state or federal violations. This data doesn’t capture every breeder who sells through an online broker, with Callison noting that some breeders who sell through such websites are unlicensed.
With regard to the online brokers and the unlicensed breeders who supply them, Callison said Bailing Out Benji is currently tracking thousands of unlicensed breeders and is in the process of auditing more than 20,000 online sellers who traffic animals through three brokering websites.
Once Bailing Out Benji has more conclusive data to share on that universe of sales, she said, the organization will update its reporting.

According to the Iowa Board of Mental Health Professionals, Abigail Doerder, 43, who practiced social work in Nevada and currently lives in Boone, is charged with negligence in the practice of the profession, unethical conduct, and violating the terms of an agreement or contract with the Impaired Practitioner Review Committee.
As is usually the case when charges are filed by Iowa’s licensing boards, the Board of Mental Health Professionals has not publicly disclosed the nature of the alleged conduct, or when it may have occurred.
It’s not clear what impact the charges might have on Doerder’s licensing status since, according to the board, her license expired in December 2024.
A hearing on the matter is scheduled for July 9, 2025. The Iowa Capital Dispatch was unable to reach Doerder for comment.
Court records show that in 2022, Doerder was arrested and charged with driving while barred as a habitual offender. Boone County prosecutors later amended the charge to the misdemeanor offense of improper taillights and Doerder was fined $30.
That case followed a 2018 incident in which Doerder was arrested in the parking lot of the Boone County Hospital and charged with third-offense drunken driving.

(Photo provided by Bullets and Bandaids)Since publishing its first volume more than a decade ago, Bullets and Bandaids has worked with more than 100 veterans, mostly from South Carolina, giving them a platform to share their experiences through written stories and art.
And in the last two years, the organization has reached some 60,000 people through traveling art shows and events around the state and country.
Now, the veteran-founded nonprofit is preparing to launch its fifth edition. Supporters gathered in Columbia ahead of the July Fourth holiday to celebrate and raise the funds to make it happen.
“The amount of healing that we have done is wild,” founder Robert LeHeup told the SC Daily Gazette.
LeHeup was among the first groups of United States Marines to push into Afghanistan following 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon. His unit helped take control of the Kandahar airport in 2001 and then secured the U.S. Embassy in Kabul.
LeHeup left the Marine Corps in 2004 as a sergeant, returning to South Carolina and enrolling at the University of South Carolina, where he earned a writing degree and began working with different media forms.
“I was dealing with the same issues as so many other veterans when they first get back, which is violence and anger without a place to put it — substance abuse, depression, suicidal ideation — and I hadn’t even really addressed it,” he said.
Then, about 13 years ago, LeHeup gave a talk in Columbia. He spoke about a snowy night on patrol during his final weeks in Kabul. His unit was on high alert after they were told there could be members of the Islamic militant group Al-Qaeda in a nearby home. What LeHeup heard drifting over the embassy walls instead was music from a man playing a homemade flute. He stood listening to the man’s song and icicles like wind chimes in the trees as snowflakes fell around him.
“In the writing of it, I gained a sense of ownership over the story,” LeHeup said. “But that wasn’t anything compared to after I had performed it, because that’s when I knew that my story had been heard. This profound sense of isolation, which had caused all of these different problems, was being addressed through my telling of the story and knowing that people had heard it.”
He started Bullets and Bandaids to give other veterans a similar experience.
LeHeup records interviews with veterans, friends and family. Then, that recording is fact checked and shared with a volunteer writer, often someone who has not been in the military, who turns it into a written story. Finally, an artist will create a painting, music poetry or other work of art inspired by the story.
“We’ve had people say things like, I wouldn’t have been able to tell my wife this story were it not for Bullets and Bandaids. I’m still alive today because you guys are continuing to tour. I wouldn’t be here were it not for the connections that I had made,” LeHeup said.
By pairing veterans with civilian writers and artists, LeHeup said the group also works to bridge the divide that often exists between military members and those without a military connection.
“I think veterans are forced to be in one of two boxes, either they are broken or they are heroes that need nothing,” LeHeup said. “I believe that our humanity, our lives, are in the gray area in between. And I hope that civilians will recognize that we live in that gray area, and that both civilians and veterans find the strength in acknowledging that shared human journey.”
Kristine Hartvigsen, of Columbia, was never in the military herself but her father spent his career in the U.S. Army as a physician. Her aunt was an Army nurse during the war in Vietnam. Her son enlisted, too, deploying twice — in 2017 to Afghanistan and last year to Syria — and currently stationed at Fort Benning in Georgia.
“I do have just a real strong affinity for veterans and am trying to understand my son’s experience better by learning from other vets, because he was definitely changed when he came home,” Hartvigsen said.
About four years ago, she volunteered as a writer for Bullets and Bandaids after learning about it from a friend.
“What I really hear is the stuff that I think about when my son is deployed. I’m trying to picture where he is, what he sees, what he’s doing. So it’s the little details that veterans share,” Hartvigsen said.
One story that particularly stuck with her came from Corey Norrell, a self-proclaimed Navy brat who enlisted when he turned 18. He told her about a rite of passage in the U.S. Navy, known as the crossing the line ceremony, held when a sailor crosses the equator for the first time and becomes a “trusty shellback” or a “Son of Neptune.”
The “shellbacks” crawl on their hands and knees across the non-skid deck with a surface so rough “sandpaper doesn’t hold a candle to it,” he said.
“It’s not a combat story, but it’s part of the experience, because there’s a brotherhood and sisterhood that forms among military service members,” Hartvigsen said.
Hartvigsen said her son prefers not to speak about his deployments but she does remember talking to him on the phone and him telling her he could see enemy soldiers in the distance from the wall he was standing on.
“It was just shocking to me that he could see them across the way. But unless they fire, they’re all just watching each other and that’s stressful in itself, just not knowing what’s going to happen,” Hartvigsen said.

Unlike Hartvigsen, Andrew Cooke was in the military — the U.S. Air Force — and also produces art for Bullets and Bandsaids.
Cooke retired from the Air Force as a staff sergeant in 2012 after developing a heart condition following an injury sustained during an attack on Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan, where he was deployed in 2010. He’d also done earlier tours in Kandahar and Al Dahfra, in the United Arab Emirates.
After leaving the Air Force, Cooke took up photography as part of therapy. He particularly liked photographing storms and landscapes near his home in Tucson, Arizona. Being in nature and away from crowded spaces calmed him.
The Darlington native then moved back to South Carolina and currently lives in Spartanburg, working as a construction manager. He still does photography on the side.
Cooke, who is now on the board of directors for Bullets and Bandaids, finds value in how the organization connects civilians and veterans and the level of appreciation that develops between the soldiers and their story tellers.
Cooke said Bullets and Bandaids needs financial help from the community to keep going. The organization is supported both by private donations and government grants, including a $10,000 grant from the state Arts Commission for 2025 and $10,000 from the state Humanities Council in 2024.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/480254257_958379533058526_6374661688534519078_n-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-04 12:15:47.707735

Barry Usher, R-Billings area, against members of the public and another Democratic legislator.
Dunwell is making the allegations with the Montana Human Rights Bureau, which enforces laws that prohibit discrimination as part of the Department of Labor and Industry.
Usher, who served as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he does not believe the bureau has jurisdiction.
However, if it does, Usher said he expects to prevail — as he did in a similar case Dunwell filed during the 2025 session with the Legislative Services Division.
In a summary of initial allegations Dunwell submitted to the Human Rights Bureau, Dunwell argues Usher’s behavior constituted unlawful discrimination against members of the public who testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee, and against Sen. Andrea Olsen, D-Missoula, who served as vice chairwoman of the committee.
“There were numerous instances of Sen. Usher shutting down, belittling and verbally and emotionally abusing (members of the public and committee members) or silencing and refusing them questions, especially Minority Party Vice Chair of Judiciary Committee Andrea Olsen,” said the summary of allegations.
Olsen could not be reached for comment through voicemails left Wednesday and Thursday. The allegations also state she was treated unfairly after raising concern about the lack of public notice for a hearing.
Dunwell said the Human Rights Bureau initially accepted the case, and she is submitting additional material and may name more respondents.
Montana Human Rights Bureau Chief Tim Little could not be reached late Wednesday or Thursday about the status of the case.
In a description of its process, the Human Rights Bureau website said it will draft a formal complaint “if the facts indicate illegal discrimination may have occurred” following an intake interview.
The allegations Dunwell submitted to the agency and shared with the Daily Montanan cover incidents during the 2025 Montana Legislature when Usher led the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee.
The Senate Judiciary Committee reviews some of the most controversial bills of the session and often elicits emotional testimony.
The allegations include harassment, retaliation and discrimination based on political belief, sex, and gender identity by Usher “against others with less power than him.”
In an interview, Dunwell said members of the public have the right to share their opinions even if they run contrary to the political beliefs of the chairperson.
She also said she wants to set a standard for more respectful behavior at the Capitol in the future, and she believes women and people who are LGBTQ+ were especially abused.
“I’m going to come and go. He’s going to come and go,” Dunwell said of Usher. “At some point, we just need to say, ‘Stop,’ because we have devolved so much in our decorum and in our treatment of one another.”
The summary of allegations said at least 20 other members of the public and legislators relayed experiences of bullying and harassment by Usher but would not consent to have their names used for fear of retaliation.
In an interview, Usher said he doesn’t believe the Human Rights Bureau, part of the executive branch, has jurisdiction in the case because of the separation of powers. He also said he believes he has legislative immunity.
However, Usher said he treats everyone the same — “whether you’re a Democrat or a Republican or a male or a female.”
For example, Usher said in the past, he shut down Dunwell when he felt “she got out of control” at a hearing, but he also shut down Republican Rep. Braxton Mitchell when he “went off the rails” as a bill sponsor.
As committee chairman, Usher said he enforces decorum. Some people at the podium aren’t familiar with the rules, and in those cases, he said he provides instruction to them to keep meetings on track.
“If we have decorum, then we can make it through our agenda,” Usher said.
Dunwell said an attorney advised her the case might butt up against a claim of legislative immunity. However, she said many people who were poorly treated by Usher during the session are quietly encouraging her to pursue the complaint.
An email from Dunwell to the Human Rights Bureau said political activist Evan Barrett will join her in alleging unfair treatment, and Barrett confirmed Thursday he believes Usher trampled on his right to participate and abused his power.
Barrett, a Butte Democrat, said when he tried to testify by video in a hearing against a bill to require judges to declare a political party, Usher cut off testimony. Barrett said he alerted Olsen that he — and later, he found out, a couple of others — still hadn’t testified.
Olsen alerted Usher, but the chairman refused to recognize him, Barrett said. Barrett said he later emailed Usher and informed him he was violating the state Constitution by suppressing the right to participate.
After “rattling his cage,” Usher finally relented and scheduled a time for Barrett and a couple of judges who had been left out to testify, Barrett said, but he said Usher then failed to allow Olsen to ask them questions, which is part of the process.
Barrett said he’s a “known commodity as a Democrat” in Montana, and he wonders if his political affiliation influenced Usher’s decision not to recognize him.
Usher said in general, people register in advance to testify, and if they aren’t on his list of registrants, he doesn’t call on them. He said he isn’t vetting lists for people’s political affiliations. He said in this case, a “software glitch” meant Barrett wasn’t on the list, but he testified at a later date.
In a narrative of the allegations, Dunwell outlined more than a dozen instances she said are just some examples of when Usher bullied or shut out the public, Olsen, and other committee members.
In one incident, Olsen tried to point out members of the public who had their hands raised to testify online. Usher said he did not see anyone, but Olsen said she saw at least two hands raised.
Usher said he’d been watching the computer for the last hour, and one person who had their hand raised wasn’t on the list of people who had signed up to testify, a prerequisite.
“I didn’t know if you wanted to do my job?” Usher says to Olsen.
“I’d be happy to, Mr. Chair,” Olsen replies.
“Well, actions have consequences,” Usher says.
In the allegations and phone interview, Dunwell said she had filed an earlier harassment and discrimination complaint against Usher during the 2025 session with the Legislative Services Division.
A Legislative Conduct Panel convened, directed an investigation be conducted, and confirmed the complaint was found to be unsubstantiated, according to a copy of the determination notice Dunwell shared.
It said Sen. Laura Smith, D-Helena, also made “informal complaints” regarding the same allegations.
The determination was signed by two Republican leaders, Senate President Matt Regier and House Speaker Brandon Ler, and two Democrats, Senate Minority Leader Pat Flowers and House Minority Leader Katie Sullivan.
Asked if the outcome of the Legislative Conduct Panel could indicate Usher’s behavior steps up to a line but doesn’t cross into discrimination, Dunwell said she doesn’t have enough information to know; Dunwell said she requested a copy of the investigation, but she was denied the file based on privacy even though Usher is a public figure.
She said she believes Usher retaliated against her as well by ensuring her bills didn’t pass after she raised concerns with HR.
Usher said he wouldn’t ever ask anyone to take votes they don’t believe in.
He said HR interviewed the parties involved, and the matter, as he sees it, comes down to decorum. He said he and Olsen have a good relationship outside of the committee and talk frequently.
However, in committee, he said, he had to quiet Olsen at times because she would offer longwinded testimony when it was time for questions.
“It appears that sometimes she can’t help herself,” Usher said.
During the session, Olsen had emailed Usher and other committee members in an attempt to ensure legislators were respectful and welcoming to the public and did not “lecture them, argue with them, shame them.”
Sent in late March, the email is part of the packet of materials Dunwell provided to the Human Rights Bureau and shared with the Daily Montanan.
In it, Olsen acknowledged she needed to do a better job of asking “to-the-point” questions, but she said all committee members owe the public respect and decorum.
“I am writing to request that we all remember our obligation to the public, to welcome them to our committee, to allow them to participate, and to hear what they have to tell us about their concerns and perceived consequences of a bill,” Olsen said in her letter.
Olsen forwarded the email to Senate Minority Leader Pat Flowers, D-Belgrade, and told him she wished she’d had sent it in January when the session started. She said people were afraid to testify to the Senate Judiciary Committee.
“Without full public participation, we create bad law with blinders on,” Olsen said in the email.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Senate_door_2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-04 12:15:47.707735

“There could be no better birthday present for America than the phenomenal victory we achieved just hours ago, when Congress passed the one big beautiful bill to make America great again,” Trump said.
While the gathering was officially linked to the country’s anniversary, much of the discussion at the event was centered around the passage of the tax and spending budget reconciliation bill that passed the U.S. House and was sent to Trump’s desk earlier Thursday.
US House passes massive tax break and spending cut bill, sending it to Trump

The bill, which passed the House in a 218-214 vote is the controversial measure that would implement Medicaid work requirements, shift more funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program from the federal government to states, and extend the 2017 tax cuts approved during Trump’s first term. It also provides more than $170 billion in funding for the federal government to carry out mass deportations and raises the national debt limit by $5 trillion.
Trump said he plans to sign the bill into law Friday, July 4, while military planes fly overhead.
The president told the crowd of more than 1,000 that “this whole two weeks has been incredible” – pointing to the budget reconciliation bill that passed earlier Thursday, recent U.S. military strikes on Iran and his administration reaching trade deals with other countries.
Trump announces UFC fight at White House
Though much of his speech to the crowd gathered reflected what Iowans may have heard at campaign rallies during recent caucus cycles, Trump’s first Iowa event since January 2024 was the start of a yearlong celebration leading up to America’s 250th anniversary. Organized by America250, which also planned the Washington, D.C. military parade in June, Trump said there will be a year of celebrations, including sporting events and fairs.
“Every one of our national park battlefields and historic sites are going to have special events in honor of America250 and I even think we’re going to have a UFC fight,” he said.
Trump announced plans to host a Ultimate Fighting Championship fight with up to 25,000 spectators at the White House as part of his America250 celebration. Trump said UFC CEO Dana White would be organizing the fight. According to a White House Pool report, Trump is “dead serious” about plans for a fight on White House according to Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt.
He also said he plans to bring America250 programming to fairgrounds across the country with the first event taking place at the Iowa State Fairgrounds. He announced these would culminate in a “giant patriotic festival” with exhibits from all 50 states displayed at the National Mall during the festival.
“We will be orchestrating what we’re calling The Great American State Fair and we’ll start right here in Iowa,” he said.
Speaking to reporters, Iowa GOP chair Jeff Kaufmann said “aside from politics, this is a big deal that he’s starting in Iowa” for the year of events, saying he was hopeful the event and others planned throughout the country will lead to people coming together for patriotic celebrations.
“This is a really big deal for Iowa,” Kaufmann said. “… I know it’s very political, I know it’s going to be very combative, you know, today, in terms of when we talk policy – I get that. God bless America. But there’s got to be moments during this next year when we can take a time out for just a bit.”
Trump supporters emphasize trust
Lori Coltrain, a Des Moines resident who came with her granddaughter to the event, said she wanted to “hear the truth” from Trump about the bill and other policies advanced by his administration.
“I just hate all the negativity about it,” Coltrain said. “People should just celebrate that he’s actually gotten it through.”
Though many attendees spent several hours Thursday afternoon with temperatures above 90 degrees, spirits were high among many who were excited to hear from the president following the successful passage of one of Republicans’ major policy proposals.
Keith Reicks of Ridgeway said he was excited to hear from the president and Iowa Republican leaders about bringing the bill to the finish line. He said he was not concerned about the protests and public opposition from Democrats and others about the legislation – and said he trusts Trump to sort out any unexpected issues that could be caused by the measure.
“I think if something turns up, Trump will straighten it out,” Reicks said. “It seems like he always does. And I believe in the man. When I was younger, I didn’t think too much of Donald Trump, because I always thought he was a pusher, but now I’m glad he’s pushing.”
He also said he does not believe the discontent with the bill and some Trump policies will result in major Democratic gains during the 2026 election, saying Democrats are more focused on “complaining” about Republicans and Trump than putting forward their own ideas.
He said Iowans and most Americans still support Trump and believe he is doing a good job in the White House.
“I think he’s doing a good job,” Reicks said. “I’d vote for him again if he was running, but I don’t think he’s going to.”
Trump said he has delivered on many of his campaign promises through the budget reconciliation bill and other actions since taking office earlier in 2025.
“The people gave us a historic mandate to cut taxes, raise take-home pay, bring back jobs, stop the invasion – the horrible invasion,” Trump said. “… Deport the illegals and slash hundreds of billions of dollars of waste and fraud, and that’s what we’re doing. With this bill, every major promise I made to the people of Iowa in 2024 became a promise kept.”

Tien Tran, a California dentist who flew to Iowa for the event, said he does not know all the details in the legislation but supports the measure.
“I don’t even know all the details but I know and I trust this president because he promised. Whatever he promised, he kept,” Tran said. “… President Trump has saved a lot of money for this country. President Trump with his executive order has saved a lot of lives.”
Kaufmann called for Republicans to stand strong in support for the measure despite widespread opposition.
“Listen to this very carefully, folks: Do not cede an inch when you’re talking to your neighbors and friends,” Kaufmann said. “And it says this – if you work and if you’re legal, you’re not going to get kicked off Medicaid, that’s a lie. It’s a lie for desperate people.”
All four of Iowa’s U.S. House members – Reps. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, Ashley Hinson, Zach Nunn and Randy Feenstra – voted in support of the bill. They, alongside  Secretary of Interior Doug Burgum, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, flew with Trump to Iowa on Air Force One following the House vote.
Though the four representatives did not speak at the event, Trump praised them as a “good group,” saying, “boy, they were so happy at that victory today.”
Trump says legislation planned to allow undocumented workers to stay
In addition to speaking on the budget reconciliation bill, Trump also highlighted legislation and executive action taken on immigration policy, talking about mass deportations under his administration.
However, he shared that there could be a potential caveat to some deportations of undocumented immigrants coming under his administration for people working in the agriculture sector who are not in the country legally. He said he is working with Noem and U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins on legislation that would allow undocumented workers to stay in the country if they  can get the support and backing of their employers, he said.
“Brooke Rollins brought it up and she said, ‘So we have a little problem, the farmers are losing a lot of people,’” he said. “And we figured it out, and we have some great stuff being written. And let the farmers be responsible.”
He joked, “and if the farmers don’t do a good job, we’ll throw them the hell out of the country,” while adding he believed the media would not acknowledge the comment as sarcasm.
U.S. Sens. Joni Ernst and Chuck Grassley both spoke before Trump’s appearance, speaking about their support for the budget reconciliation bill. Grassley highlighted what he called his biggest contribution to the legislation as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee – saying he was a major backer for the provisions to increase funding for immigration enforcement and border security and for detention centers. These are all steps to “make America safe again,” Grassley said.
Ernst also talked about Republicans’ immigration policy, pointing to Trump signing the immigration bill that included “Sarah’s Law,” a provision requiring the detainment of undocumented immigrants who commit crimes resulting in death or serious bodily injury.
This measure was named after Sarah Root, a 21-year-old Iowan killed by a drunk driver who was an immigrant who lacked legal status. Ernst said this measure passing was one of many actions taken by Trump she supports on immigration.
Protesters outside the US House make a last stand against the GOP megabill

Iowans gather to protest Trump visit
Around 100 people gathered outside of the fairgrounds Thursday evening with protest signs, upside down American flags and megaphones to protest the president’s visit to Des Moines.
One protester, Maureen Ogle of Ames, waved her flag rightside up and pumped a cane in the air as cars drove past, honking in support of the protesters.
Ogle said she flew a flag upside down during the entirety of Trump’s first term, but now she wants to “reclaim” the national symbol. 
“I want to save the Republic,” Ogle said. “The constitution has been demolished.”

We already know that in Iowa, at least 20 rural hospitals are seriously threatened with closing and six are almost certainly gone. The problem is greater than hospitals closing or individuals being denied immediate, necessary medical care. The impact is going to be felt by the communities that are home to those medical care centers.
Our challenge will be, as a state, how we handle the impact of loss for many of those on Medicaid coverage, and the drastic cutbacks on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The real proof of the magnitude of the problem is that nationwide, 70 million people are on Medicaid and 40 million are beneficiaries of SNAP.  Furthermore, the effect is even greater in rural states.
Our first concern must be for care centers and hospitals.  Hospitals are rather mysterious places by design. This is because the nature of the work is confidential. Everyone is entitled to privacy when treated medically. In addition, the institution funding is a total dark web with government payments, insurance coverage, write-offs, etc.  So, they exist somewhat in isolation from the rest of town.
But the individuals who work at hospitals are not a secret. They are your neighbors, shop at the same stores, serve on their church communities, coach the little league softball and baseball teams, send their kids to our schools, and take a place on the school board or city councils.
But when the hospital closes, they will be different because (a) they will be unemployed and (b) they will find work someplace else.  It is not just the medical staff, nurses, doctors, techs, and the bookkeepers who chase the insurance companies for reimbursement (may God have mercy on their souls), but the electricians, the administrative staff, and the janitors, all or most who will be moving on and taking their kids out of the rural public schools.
We need to face the reality of the situation now.  The impact of this legislation is going to affect more than the patient.  It is a body blow not only to employees but to the very town in which the hospital resides. Yes, the bill includes $50 billion for rural hospitals affected by Medicaid cuts. It’s not nearly enough.
The solution isn’t rocket science. Rural states, like Iowa, are going to have to find money to replace the lost revenue from a former Medicaid patient who shows up at the hospital for treatment without insurance coverage. Both Iowa law and most hospitals’ mission statement requires that the patient receive treatment.  This may surprise the proponents of kicking patients off Medicaid, which flies in the face of their belief that if coverage is cut, then people would just decide not to get sick.) We can’t just lock them out.
The approach needs to be systematic and focused first on the rural hospitals most at risk. We need to examine and reduce or eliminate the cost of a rule, regulation, or statute that is not essential to the practice of good medical care.
The utility costs of the individual institution should be examined and either the state or the utility should determine whether the fees charged can be reduced or even eliminated. It is better to have less revenue from the cost of the operation of the buildings than none.
The mission and resources assigned to the Iowa Economic Development Authority should be amended to target rural health care.  The state’s entire economic development budget, which goes to various agencies, is about $40 million for next year (and should be increased). While it is great to lure foreign business entities to our state or convenience those that are departing, our first priority should be state resources for Iowans first, then others. The truth is that a hospital in a smaller community is an asset and should not be thrown out because of this legislation.
Those are a few of the steps that we can take to overcome these new laws. I reason that if towns like Marshalltown, Greenfield, Parkersburg and others can overcome and rebuild after tornadoes, we can do the same with this economic windstorm.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/hopsital-image-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-04 11:04:23.716928

A sprinkle of rocking chairs, kitchen sinks and family photos in Mississippi Museum of Art’s “2025 Mississippi Invitational” exhibition pepper the galleries with near universal touchstones. Signs of love and signs of loss, frayed connections, conflicting expectations, notions of belonging and the creep of time come through in artworks, too, evoking the deeply personal relationships and complex emotional ties forged in that place called home.
The museum’s 14th biennial survey of recent works by contemporary visual artists living and working in the state opens a fresh window into Mississippi and into this particular moment. The exhibition is on view through Sept. 7.
Its 12 featured artists were selected from about 180 applications and 37 studio visits across the state. Guest curator TK Smith, an Atlanta-based writer, curator and cultural historian, drew on his conversations with artists in their studios and tapped into his own summer visits with grandparents in Mississippi for the exhibition’s “Call Home” theme.
“All of these artists are reaching out — reaching to connect in some way, either to their audiences, to other artists, to communities, for political reasons, personal reasons,” Smith said. “Everybody is just kind of yearning, and I think that is shaping the work that’s in the show.”
Both up-and-coming and established artists are among the show’s 12, with creations covering a broad swath of media. Painting, printmaking, ceramics, sculpture, photography, film, assemblage, installation and more deliver a diverse, vibrant and provocative portrait of the state of art in Mississippi. Unfolding across three sections, or “three breaths” in Smith’s words, the exhibition explores home as a physical space, as a body and beyond, and artists’ works in each section showcase their individual range.
An actual phone opens the exhibition — the vintage Panasonic Easa-Phone telephone and answering machine in artist Emma Lorenz’s “You Have XX Messages.” Personal voicemails and audio from the Golden Record combine in Lorenz’s study of how technological progress can risk losing touch with the past, and how even content inaccessible in the moment is still proof of life, care and love.
Lush hues on handmade paper lend beauty, depth and inviting texture to domestic scenes in a suite of paintings by Ocean Springs artist Jerrod Partridge. An open fridge, a puddle of clothes, even a laundry room peek of a baby lulled to sleep by the dryer, put viewers right at home in the messy comforts of daily life. Other exhibition works highlight coastal natural surroundings and, in a nod to the much-traveled artist’s global home, a series of drawings from Italy. Partridge was awarded the Invitational’s Jane Crater Hiatt Artist Fellowship, a $20,000 grant that he will use to develop a series of paintings about communities within the Gulf Coast’s seafood industry.
Laser cut metal fronds arc up from a circle of sandbags, forming a prickly dome in “Garden Pavilion (Cutgrass)” by Connor Frew of Jackson. Inspired by a semi-aquatic grass with serrated leaves that can cut skin, Frew tucked in concepts of resilience and resistance in wilderness, likening the sandbags’ text to a search engine query of how to grow strong enough to destroy the blades (in stronger language). 
“It’s this idea of wild, unrestrained growth and collectivity as a means of resisting attempts at culling, or destroying a particular community.”
Wander through the large-scale pop-ups in Sue Carrie Drummond’s installation “My Mold Garden,” drawn from an artist book collaboration with a cultural anthropologist (digital copy of the book also on display). Post-heartbreak grief coupled with mold growth in the home became a journey to emotional self-help. 
“It puts you in the experience of someone who is dealing with slow breakdown, and then how they put themselves back together. And, the mold mimics that,” Drummond said, breaking down matter to raw material that can be re-used. 
“A Beautiful Snare,” another interactive installation, confronts ideas of femininity through the etymology of lace. Its maze of voile, chiffon, charmeuse and cotton panels deepen from white to reddish hues, with increasingly intense coil designs the farther inside you wander. Is it fragile or strong? A lure or a snare, enticement or entrapment, or maybe both?
Artist Alexis McGrigg’s works in photography, film and painting embody deep family and ancestral ties, as in “A Personal Constellation.” There, gold leaf signifies departed members in a collection of old family photographs, to moving effect. Those are the souls that have touched “The Beloved” (her term for a heaven-like space, or origin of humanity). 
“We have these people that are connected to us, that are no longer here,” McGrigg said, thinking of them as guardians who still watch over her.
A family photo finds a place, too, in Christina McField’s home scene installation, soothing in its details of a crocheted afghan on a rocking chair, worn books, antique table and the framed 1920s photo on its surface. It pictures her great-grandmother with her grandfather, then a small child, standing atop that very table. 
“I wanted to bring them back to life and honor them,” McField said, fondly recalling family visits to Philadelphia, Miss., as a child. “This is what I think about when I think about calling home.” 
Elsewhere in the exhibit, her sculptural triptych assembles architectural scraps — ceiling tiles, spindles, brackets — in a meditation on past lives, the erosion of time and enduring fragments of memory.
Groupings of Hattiesburg ceramicist Allen Chen’s remarkable vessels channel generations of ancestors and migratory patterns, from the “original tribe” of earthen-hued pairs to different colored and carved “offsprings” bearing the changes new environments bring. 
Forms are similar, “the bones” are the same, he said, but colors — a surface quality, like skin tone — are different. 
“Home is not really a static place. We would like it to be, but wherever you end up comes from long lines of people moving around.” 
Chen’s “Passage of the Spine,” with its concentric ceramic shapes suspended in a horizontal line, may call to mind ancient whale fossils. The shadow this large piece casts only heightens its dramatic appeal.
“2025 Mississippi Invitational” selected artists also include: Rylee Brabham, with sculptures and installations exploring gender and society, with a dash of humor; Kaleena Stasiak, with windsocks, mobile and folk warnings about the weather conveying whimsy and wisdom; Ashley Gates, whose touching installation overlays images of her late mother with projections of a solar eclipse; and documentary photographer Betty Press, whose eye for intimacy and design shines through in photos of home births, pairings of Kenyan and Mississippi storefronts and more.
Three larger-than-life sculptures by Jason Kimes of Laurel follow a life cycle through the galleries, each one bearing a name that, together, form Julius Caesar’s famous phrase. A fetal position baby in clear epoxy is the blank-slate start (“Veni’). The 8-foot striding figure in weathering steel, made of thousands of individually welded squares, carries the rusty patina of experience (“Vidi”) and a noble skull in polished stainless gleams at the exhibit’s close (“Vidi”).
 “You start with nothing. You build up all the way through until you end up with something praiseworthy,” Kimes described a lifespan. And then, “It’s the ultimate call home.”
“2025 Mississippi Invitational” is on view at the Mississippi Museum of Art, 380 S. Lamar St. in Jackson, through Sept. 7.

[…]","Topeka Police Officers line the first floor rotunda area of the Statehouse during a May 2023 ceremony. (Chloe Anderson for Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas’ crime rate in 2024 reached its lowest mark in at least 20 years, according to recently released data, and some attribute the drop to law enforcement success.
Violent crimes saw a five-year low in 2024, and property crimes maintained a downward trend, per the Kansas Bureau of Investigation’s annual crime index report.
“We believe the collaborative efforts of law enforcement agencies throughout Kansas have an impact on bringing down crime, as does the public’s cooperation and assistance when major crimes are committed,” said KBI director Tony Mattivi.
The report has been published in some form at the KBI since 2003. It compiles data from local and state law enforcement agencies, creating a snapshot of the year’s crimes while reflecting greater trends when compared to past years.
A crime index rate is the number of recorded crimes per 1,000 people in a given year. Kansas’ rate decreased from 27 crimes per 1,000 people in 2023 to 23.3 in 2024. The report said it’s the lowest rate in more than 20 years.
“When assessing crime on a statewide basis, it is difficult to understand what drives crime from year to year because so many factors influence crime trends,” Mattivi said.
The state’s murder rate, for instance, fell below the 10-year average. With 117 murders in 2024, it marked a more than 25% decrease from 2023.
“Finding a common circumstance for these murders is difficult,” the report said, “as 46.2% of the reports indicated ‘unknown circumstance.’ ”
Murders in 2024 involved arguments, domestic violence and unknown suspects. Making up smaller fractions were illegal drug transactions, which totaled 2.6% of murders, and gang activity and drive-by incidents, which made up less than 1% of murders in 2024.
All crime categories decreased in 2024. Some numbers were fractions of pre-pandemic averages and others made history. Around 7,100 burglaries were reported in Kansas in 2024, the lowest number since 1966, when around 10,700 burglaries were reported, according to the report.
Wyandotte County had the highest reported crime index rate in the state, with nearly 47 crimes per 1,000 people. Sedgwick County was a close second with a rate of nearly 44. The lowest reported crime index rate in 2024 was 0.7 in Jewell County, though the county sheriff’s office only reported seven months out of the year.
The number of law enforcement officers employed in Kansas is inching closer to its pre-pandemic level of 3.84 officers per 1,000 people, according to data from the FBI. The number of employed law enforcement officers rose between 2023 and 2024 from 3.44 to 3.69.
Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach took credit for the decrease in crime rates, attributing it to his “law and order approach.”
“Kansans are less likely to be the victim of a crime today than at any time in the past 20 years,” Kobach said in a news release, which referred to him as Kansas’s chief law enforcement officer.
While crime has decreased nationally in the past three decades, Americans still worry just as much — if not more — about their safety and the presence of crime, according to Gallup polling.
Around half of Americans who participated in 2024 surveys worry about crime a great deal, and few are satisfied with policies addressing crime. Americans perceive that crime is growing in the areas where they live. Almost half of Americans polled in 2024 thought crime increased over the previous year, when crime nationwide has been on a steep downward trend since the 1990s.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/05182023-officervigil-6-1024x640.jpg,,,2025-07-04 11:04:23.716928

(Phot courtesy of the National Archives)Exactly 249 years ago, a group of flawed-yet-visionary men signed a document in Philadelphia that was (and remains) remarkable.
It founded a nation that’s been a beacon of hope to the entire world. Is America perfect? No, of course not, and it never has been. But the grand experiment that is American democracy is certainly worth celebrating.
So, we’re running the text of the Declaration of Independence in full as a reminder of the nation’s foundational ideals of freedom and equality. Before the cookouts and fireworks, read the reason for the holiday:  
In Congress, July 4, 1776
The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. – That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, – That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. – Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.
He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.
He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.
He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.
He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.
He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.
He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.
He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.
He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.
He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.
He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.
He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.
He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.
He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:
For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:
For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:
For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:
For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:
For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:
For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences
For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:
For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:
For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.
He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.
He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.
He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.
He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.
He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.
In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.
Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.
We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The average cost for a 10-person Fourth of July will cost $70.92, which is 30 cents less than last summer, but the second highest cookout cost since 2013 when American Farm Bureau Federation began its annual survey on the topic.
Beef, canned goods and hand-picked crops have the highest price increases from last year, due likely to low domestic cattle inventory, aluminum tariffs and the cost of labor.
The American Farm Bureau survey assumes a gathering of 10 people who will consume: cheeseburgers, chicken breasts, pork chops, potato chips, canned pork and beans, fresh strawberries, homemade potato salad, fresh-squeezed lemonade, chocolate chip cookies and ice cream.
Canned of pork and beans had the steepest increase, 8.2% or 20 cents, from last year. The bureau said labor costs along the supply chain and steep tariffs on aluminum are likely to blame.
Homemade lemonade will also cost 20 cents more per pitcher this year, and strawberries 8 cents more per pound, due to a continued trend of high labor costs in the specialty crop sector.
The cost of ground beef also increased to $13.33 for two pounds, which is nearly 60 cents more than the $12.77 cost in 2024. While normally a crowd favorite, it will cost families nearly $20 to make 10 cheeseburgers this weekend, according to the survey prices.

U.S. cattle herd size has been declining since 2019, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported the 2025 herd size was 8% lower than 2019 herd. The amount of beef imported to the U.S. has also gone up in the time frame.
Pork chops, on the other hand, had the largest decrease in price from last year. Three pounds of pork chops this weekend should run consumers about $14.13, which is nearly 9% less than the cut cost last year. The survey concludes this is due to high domestic pork supplies.
The cost of chicken breasts declined slightly from last year’s cookout prices but the cost of eggs increased, which made potato salad about 20 cents more expensive this year. Poultry have been affected by the ongoing highly pathogenic avian influenza, which has caused fluctuating prices as the supply chains are impacted.
Since January, U.S. has imported about 10 times the amount of shell eggs it imported in the same period in 2024 as part of the administration’s plan to combat the bird flu. Wholesale egg prices have declined by more than 60% since January, but the American Farm Bureau report shows the cost for consumers for just four eggs is up 54% from last summer.
The bureau survey also breaks prices down by region and found cookouts on the East Coast are the cheapest this year at $63.79, followed by the south who can feed a party of 10 for $68.93. Gatherings in the West average at $73.50 and Midwestern gatherings come in as the second most expensive at $69.87.
Farmers not pocketing fair share, advocates say
Consumer increases don’t necessarily mean higher prices for farmers, however. On average, farmers and ranchers receive about $0.16 per consumer dollar spent on food, according to the latest “Farmer’s Share” report from National Farmers Union.
Rob Larew, the organization’s president said it’s important to highlight the “growing imbalance” in the food system.
“Family farmers and ranchers are working harder than ever, yet taking home less, while corporate monopolies in processing, distribution, and retail rake in record profits,” Larew said. “Farmers deserve a fair share of the food dollar, and consumers deserve a food system that works for everyone, not just a handful of powerful corporations.”
According to the report, a rancher takes home $2.08 on a one pound package of ground beef sold for $5.99. A lettuce farmer gets an even lower cut, receiving about 8.2% of the consumer dollar.
Consumers also feel like their dollars don’t stretch as far. According to the latest food and farm index from Iowa Farm Bureau, price is the number one factor for Iowa shoppers as they fill their grocery carts, even as more consumers say they want to buy locally raised products.
Christopher Pudenz, an Iowa Farm Bureau economist, said price changes in Iowa-grown commodities “mostly reflect” supply and demand cycles.
“The Fourth of July is, of course, a celebration of our freedom but also a celebration of the American spirit, one embodied by our nation’s farmers,” Pudenz said in a press release. “Despite challenges like rising costs and weather impacts, Iowa farmers continue to do what they’ve always done—work hard, adapt and provide for American families.”

You can read more about the section here.

Everything seems to be turned upside down.
President Donald Trump is asking the federal courts to ignore what our United States Constitution says and to rule against birthright citizenship.
The president is asking the Supreme Court to reverse what has been law since 1868 when the 14th Amendment to the Constitution was ratified. The 14th Amendment states clearly that people born in America are American. It is known as birthright citizenship.
As director of the Lowndes County-based Saving Grace Mission, I hear from people — including many children — who unfortunately say their American citizenship is being questioned.
I was born in Louisiana to Mexican-American parents with indigenous roots and grew up in Texas before moving to my adopted Mississippi. As an advocate for immigrants and the daughter of immigrants, it breaks my heart what American children are having to go through.
“You can’t just take away someone’s birthright,” said a 17-year-old Hispanic female from Caledonia High School, a school that had the nickname the “Confederates” until it was finally changed in 2020.

“The kids in my class threaten to call ICE on my parents every day,” said a 13-year-old at the same school. “I’m bullied just because I’m Hispanic, but I’m American. I was born here.”
When I see the fear of our own community members who serve and give back, fear for their lives, it is very alarming. It is especially alarming when it is the federal government responsible for this fear — fear even being experienced by U.S.-born children.
It is unfortunate for American children to be so afraid of their own government.
“Save the children” is our U.S. motto, and we shouldn’t allow our president to torment our own with fear of separation of families who are part of closely knit groups in these communities.
“Would you know where to go?” I asked a 43-year-old mother of four and grandmother of two who is a native of Mexico, but has been a resident of north Mississippi for the past 24 years. Her children and grandchildren live in the area, too, and are U.S. citizens — born right here in Mississippi.
“No, where would we go?” she asked. “This is our home, and we have a new baby. We can’t go anywhere.”
I asked her if she is afraid.
“I trust the Justice Department, but it seems like he (Trump) gets to do whatever he wants and gets away with whatever he wants anyway, so that’s what’s scary,” she said.
Another scare tactic the Trump administration has used to diminish people of color is the 1798 Alien Enemies Act law, which gives the president the authority to remove non-citizens in times of war.
Sadly, depression and anxiety are at an all-time high with the lack of community resources due to lack of funding for the immigrant population — especially here in Mississippi.

Connecticut Mirror reporters, who had followed dozens of bills from the concept phase and through committee votes, were keeping tabs on when they’d be called for votes in the House and Senate. Some sailed through, some were slowed down by proposed amendments or filibusters. And some died before receiving a final vote.
Around half of the bills CT Mirror tracked this session did not make it through both chambers — or died in committee, before even reaching the House or Senate. 
Out of the 107 bills CT Mirror tracked this session, 32 were rolled into other legislation, most often the state budget — a sprawling 795-page bill outlining how the state will raise and spend money. Many bills that pass through committees are appended to the budget bill as the final days of the session near, particularly legislation that comes with a significant pricetag.
Five bills CT Mirror tracked never made it beyond the committee phase, where legislation is first raised and debated. Every bill in Connecticut’s legislature has to go through at least one committee before reaching the House or Senate.
Of the bills we tracked that received favorable committee votes, 45 failed to come up for a vote in either the House, the Senate, or both. 
Bills that do pass both chambers are then sent to Gov. Ned Lamont to be signed into law. So far, 21 of the bills CT Mirror tracked have been signed into law and two are still waiting for the governor’s signature. 
Of all the bills that have reached Lamont’s desk as of July 1st, he has signed 165 bills, signed and line-item vetoed 2 bills, and vetoed 2 bills. Committees and members of the General Assembly — which is made up of 151 state representatives and 36 state senators — raise bills for consideration. The Office of Legislative Research assigns each bill to the relevant committee. Leaders of those committees decide whether to hold public hearings on each bill, after which committee members vote on whether to advance the legislation. If they do, those bills land before House or Senate leadership.
During the final weeks of the session, caucus leaders negotiate with their members to add or rewrite language in legislation in order to secure support before bringing bills up for votes. Some of those conversations are happening right up until the final hours on the last day of the session.
A bill must pass both chambers, before heading to the governor’s desk for a signature — or veto.

At background are Senate President Gary Stevens, R-Kodiak (left) and Speaker of the House Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham (right). (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Alaska’s lone member of the U.S. House of Representatives said Thursday that he had “no doubt” that he was going to vote for the Republican-drafted budget bill that passed the House on a 218-214 vote Thursday.
In a phone call after the vote Rep. Nick Begich III, R-Alaska, said he was pleased that it provides additional opportunities for oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, and Cook Inlet. 
“I think the bill has some incredible provisions for Alaska. We have been trying for decades to unlock the energy potential of our state, and this bill does that,” Begich said. “There’s 30 million acres mandated as a minimum lease sale amount in ANWR, NPR-A and the Cook Inlet that gives us the oil and gas that we need to refill our our state coffers, ensure that the Permanent Fund is well funded into the future, that we can continue to pay PFDs well into the future.”
Begich had proposed that 90% of federal revenue from federal leases in those areas be returned to the state. The final version of the bill will send 70%, starting in 2034. 
Current law states that 50% of revenue is reserved for local communities. The remaining 20% will be available for the state’s general fund, Begich said. 
In an interview with reporters on Wednesday, Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, said he believes no state fared better than Alaska in the negotiations around the bill.
“I think it is true when you look at just the pure acreage (available for oil leasing). Just on this one provision alone, Alaska stands to gain tremendously,” Begich said.
Most criticism of the bill has focused on its effects on Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, better known as food stamps.
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a progressive think tank opposed to the bill, estimated that 35,000 Alaskans would lose health insurance if the bill becomes law, both from Medicaid cuts and from scaled-back tax credits used to pay for individual policies.
In a town hall meeting Wednesday night, State Rep. Genevieve Mina, D-Anchorage, said she estimates the bill will add $100 million to $200 million in Medicaid costs to the state, and SNAP changes will require the state to pay up to $50 million per year within a few years.
The bill increases the size of a rural hospital fund, which will send $200 million to $300 million to Alaska, Sens. Sullivan and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said on Tuesday. 
“There’s a lot of uncertainty with a new program,” Mina said, “whereas Medicaid has reliably funded our rural areas and supported our communities and has been a fabric of our health care economy for so long.”
She also pointed out that the bill creates a work requirement for Medicaid.
“Given the fact that we already know so many Alaskans who are behind on their SNAP and Medicaid benefits for months, this is going to add more paperwork and bureaucracy for our state, but then also for people on the ground, they’re going to be kicked off of Medicaid because of additional paperwork, even though folks are working,” she said.
Asked whether he thinks Alaska will be entirely shielded from the effects of those cuts, Begich implied that the answer is no, but he believes “we have significant runway that’s been provided for Alaska” via various sections of the bill.
“Traditional recipients of Medicaid will continue to receive the same benefits that they deserve to receive. There are no changes to the traditional Medicaid system,” Begich said.
When it comes to the work requirement, there are “exclusions for folks who are caregivers to family members, for folks who are looking for work but haven’t found it yet, for folks who are in counties or boroughs with more than one and a half times the national average unemployment rate. It has exclusions for people who volunteer 20 hours a week.”
“If someone is able to work or contribute in some way, even volunteer, they should do that. And I think that’s a smart provision. It’s a provision that’s really targeted, and it’s been designed just for that sub-population of folks who could be helping and are not currently doing so,” he said.
During his campaign for U.S. House in 2024, Begich told the Fairbanks Chamber of Commerce that Alaskans should expect him to seek less federal spending because he is concerned about the size of the national debt. 
The Congressional Budget Office expects the new budget bill to increase the federal debt by more than $3.4 trillion over the next 10 years.
“Well, I think I would dispute that,” Begich said, explaining that he believes the CBO is underestimating economic growth that will take place because of the tax cuts within the bill.
“We’re on the cusp of an AI revolution, a robotics revolution, tremendous gains are on the horizon for labor productivity. We’re seeing the labor market remain strong. … I think the challenge with the CBO and some of the other models is that they’re scoring the assumptive growth rate exceptionally low.”
The 2017 federal tax cuts being extended by the new bill have thus far failed to create growth necessary to balance the deficits they created.
Begich said he’s been a strong supporter of the budget bill since even before it was proposed at the start of the new Congress.
“There was no doubt I was going to vote for this bill,” he said. “I started working on this bill before I was even sworn into Congress. I approached leadership when it looked like we were going to win this seat. And I told them, budget reconciliation is around the corner.”
Begich said that House leaders tried to reassure him that ANWR drilling provisions would be in the bill, but he advocated more drilling, in NPR-A and Cook Inlet, and additional provisions to support mining and logging.
“So when this bill came back from the Senate, I was enthusiastically supporting it, and I told others in the House that this is an important priority for us, certainly, but it’s really important for the rest of the nation,” Begich said.

(Getty Images)We’re republishing the text of the Declaration of Independence in full today on America’s 249th birthday.
In Congress, July 4, 1776
The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.–That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, –That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.–Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.
He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.
He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.
He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.
He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.
He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.
He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.
He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.
He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.
He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.
He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.
He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.
He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.
He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:
For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:
For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:
For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:
For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:
For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:
For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences
For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:
For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:
For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.
He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.
He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.
He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.
He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.
He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.
In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.
Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.
We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)President Donald Trump took a victory lap celebrating the passage of the “big, beautiful bill” through Congress during an event at the Iowa State Fairgrounds Thursday evening while sharing plans for the upcoming year of celebrations for the nation’s 250th anniversary.
“There could be no better birthday present for America than the phenomenal victory we achieved just hours ago, when Congress passed the one big beautiful bill to make America great again,” Trump said.
While the gathering was officially linked to the country’s anniversary, much of the discussion at the event was centered around the passage of the tax and spending budget reconciliation bill that passed the U.S. House and was sent to Trump’s desk earlier Thursday.
The bill, which passed the House in a 218-214 vote is the controversial measure that would implement Medicaid work requirements, shift more funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program from the federal government to states, and extend the 2017 tax cuts approved during Trump’s first term. It also provides more than $170 billion in funding for the federal government to carry out mass deportations and raises the national debt limit by $5 trillion.
Trump said he plans to sign the bill into law Friday, July 4, while military planes fly overhead.
The president told the crowd of more than 1,000 that “this whole two weeks has been incredible” – pointing to the budget reconciliation bill that passed earlier Thursday, recent U.S. military strikes on Iran and his administration reaching trade deals with other countries.
Trump announces UFC fight at White House
Though much of his speech to the crowd gathered reflected what Iowans may have heard at campaign rallies during recent caucus cycles, Trump’s first Iowa event since January 2024 was the start of a yearlong celebration leading up to America’s 250th anniversary. Organized by America250, which also planned the Washington, D.C. military parade in June, Trump said there will be a year of celebrations, including sporting events and fairs.
“Every one of our national park battlefields and historic sites are going to have special events in honor of America250 and I even think we’re going to have a UFC fight,” he said.
Trump announced plans to host a Ultimate Fighting Championship fight with up to 25,000 spectators at the White House as part of his America250 celebration. Trump said UFC CEO Dana White would be organizing the fight. According to a White House Pool report, Trump is “dead serious” about plans for a fight on White House according to Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt.
He also said he plans to bring America250 programming to fairgrounds across the country with the first event taking place at the Iowa State Fairgrounds. He announced these would culminate in a “giant patriotic festival” with exhibits from all 50 states displayed at the National Mall during the festival.
“We will be orchestrating what we’re calling The Great American State Fair and we’ll start right here in Iowa,” he said.
Speaking to reporters, Iowa GOP chair Jeff Kaufmann said “aside from politics, this is a big deal that he’s starting in Iowa” for the year of events, saying he was hopeful the event and others planned throughout the country will lead to people coming together for patriotic celebrations.
“This is a really big deal for Iowa,” Kaufmann said. “… I know it’s very political, I know it’s going to be very combative, you know, today, in terms of when we talk policy – I get that. God bless America. But there’s got to be moments during this next year when we can take a time out for just a bit.”
Trump supporters emphasize trust
Lori Coltrain, a Des Moines resident who came with her granddaughter to the event, said she wanted to “hear the truth” from Trump about the bill and other policies advanced by his administration.
“I just hate all the negativity about it,” Coltrain said. “People should just celebrate that he’s actually gotten it through.”
Though many attendees spent several hours Thursday afternoon with temperatures above 90 degrees, spirits were high among many who were excited to hear from the president following the successful passage of one of Republicans’ major policy proposals.
Keith Reicks of Ridgeway said he was excited to hear from the president and Iowa Republican leaders about bringing the bill to the finish line. He said he was not concerned about the protests and public opposition from Democrats and others about the legislation – and said he trusts Trump to sort out any unexpected issues that could be caused by the measure.
“I think if something turns up, Trump will straighten it out,” Reicks said. “It seems like he always does. And I believe in the man. When I was younger, I didn’t think too much of Donald Trump, because I always thought he was a pusher, but now I’m glad he’s pushing.”
He also said he does not believe the discontent with the bill and some Trump policies will result in major Democratic gains during the 2026 election, saying Democrats are more focused on “complaining” about Republicans and Trump than putting forward their own ideas.
He said Iowans and most Americans still support Trump and believe he is doing a good job in the White House.
““I’d vote for him again if he was running, but I don’t think he’s going to,” Reicks said.
Trump said he has delivered on many of his campaign promises through the budget reconciliation bill and other actions since taking office earlier in 2025.
“The people gave us a historic mandate to cut taxes, raise take-home pay, bring back jobs, stop the invasion – the horrible invasion,” Trump said. “… Deport the illegals and slash hundreds of billions of dollars of waste and fraud, and that’s what we’re doing. With this bill, every major promise I made to the people of Iowa in 2024 became a promise kept.”

Tien Tran, a California dentist who flew to Iowa for the event, said he does not know all the details in the legislation but supports the measure.
“I don’t even know all the details but I know and I trust this president because he promised. Whatever he promised, he kept,” Tran said. “… President Trump has saved a lot of money for this country. President Trump with his executive order has saved a lot of lives.”
Kaufmann called for Republicans to stand strong in support for the measure despite widespread opposition.
“Listen to this very carefully, folks: Do not cede an inch when you’re talking to your neighbors and friends,” Kaufmann said. “And it says this – if you work and if you’re legal, you’re not going to get kicked off Medicaid, that’s a lie. It’s a lie for desperate people.”
A plan to allow some immigrants to stay
In addition to speaking on the budget reconciliation bill, Trump also highlighted legislation and executive action taken on immigration policy, talking about mass deportations under his administration.
However, he shared that there could be a potential caveat to some deportations of undocumented immigrants coming under his administration for people working in the agriculture sector who are not in the country legally. He said he is working with Noem and U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins on legislation that would allow undocumented workers to stay in the country if they  can get the support and backing of their employers, he said.
“Brooke Rollins brought it up and she said, ‘So we have a little problem, the farmers are losing a lot of people,’” he said. “And we figured it out, and we have some great stuff being written. And let the farmers be responsible.”
He joked, “and if the farmers don’t do a good job, we’ll throw them the hell out of the country,” while adding he believed the media would not acknowledge the comment as sarcasm.
U.S. Sens. Joni Ernst and Chuck Grassley both spoke before Trump’s appearance, speaking about their support for the budget reconciliation bill. Grassley highlighted what he called his biggest contribution to the legislation as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee – saying he was a major backer for the provisions to increase funding for immigration enforcement and border security and for detention centers. These are all steps to “make America safe again,” Grassley said.
“We’re going to finish the wall,” Grassley said. “… We’re going to add tremendously to the number of people patrolling that border, but more importantly, the number of people that are going to enforce the immigration laws (on the) interior, not just at the border.”
Trump highlights recent trade negotiations
Though Trump did not make major announcements about deals reached with any countries Thursday, he highlighted recent trade negotiations he said will benefit Iowa during his speech.
Earlier this year, Trump announced plans to set a baseline 10% tariffs on international imports, while he set a 90-day pause shortly after the announcement; they are set to go into effect on July 9.
Trump said he plans to begin sending letters to countries Friday dictating tariff rates.
Though the contents of these letters were not discussed in his remarks, Trump did highlight the trade deal reached with Vietnam Wednesday that was a part of the larger push to renegotiate tariffs.
In a social media post Wednesday, Trump wrote there will be a 20% tariff on goods imported to the U.S. and 40% on goods shipped through Vietnam, but that in return, Vietnam will “give the United States of America TOTAL ACCESS to their Markets for Trade.”
Details on the trade deal with Vietnam have not yet been released. But Trump said the deal will have substantial impacts on Iowa agriculture by allowing more American products to enter Vietnam, “with zero tariffs.”
“You’re going to be giving them vast amounts of farm product, including beef, pork, poultry, dairy and pure Iowa ethanol,” Trump said. “You’re going to be giving all of those, all of those products.”
He also said he got “beef and ethanol into Europe,” speaking on a trade deal reached with the United Kingdom in May.
Many farmers, businesses owners and agricultural producers have expressed concern that they will be unable to absorb the added costs of the tariffs leading to disruptions for their business and higher costs to consumers. A study by Farmers for Free Trade found tariff costs for Iowa importers increased by 304%, roughly $68 million, from April 2024 to April 2025 and are set to increase going forward.
Iowans gather to protest Trump visit to Des Moines
Around 100 people gathered outside of the fairgrounds Thursday evening with protest signs, upside down American flags and megaphones to protest the president’s visit to Des Moines.
One protester, Maureen Ogle of Ames, waved her flag rightside up and pumped a cane in the air as cars drove past, honking in support of the protesters.
Ogle said she flew a flag upside down during the entirety of Trump’s first term, but now she wants to “reclaim” the national symbol. 
“I want to save the Republic,” Ogle said. “The constitution has been demolished.”

Some cars drove past Ogle and other protesters along East University Ave and hurled expletives and flipped birds. Protesters yelled things like “you’re in a cult” and “Trump’s coming after you too” as cars turned into the gates of the fairgrounds at East 33rd Street.
Ogle said the sitting president is the only thing she has protested as passionately as she protested the Vietnam war in her 20s.
Stephanie Shearer, from Des Moines, said if it were a different president visiting, she probably would not have shown up — as an attendee or protester —but, she said Trump needs to be held accountable.
“Hes’ so controversial that I have to be here,” she said.
Shearer said she wanted immigrants and other communities who feel attacked by the administration to know there are Iowans “on the good side.”
Plus, she said the passing of the mega budget bill earlier in the day means more people are targeted by the Trump agenda.
“We all have to keep showing each other that we’re here for each other,” Shearer said. 
Marianne Satinsky drove down from the Iowa City region to protest. She said being able to protest was a way for her to express the feelings she had, especially after the passing of the big beautiful bill.
“I felt like if I were at home right now … I would be so mad,” Satinsky said. “So this is something I can do.”
Satinsky said she hoped the presidential motorcade came past the crowd on its way to the grandstands.
“He’s got to see not everyone is happy with what he’s doing,” Satinsky said.
A handful of protesters also gathered on overpasses along Intestate 235 with large signs, hoping to picket the presidential motorcade on its route to the state fairgrounds.
The 50501 Iowa Coalition, which has organized a number of protests against the current administration, was one of the groups organizing protesters Thursday afternoon. Erienne Becker, an organizer with the coalition, said the Iowans she knows are “not OK with what is happening right now.”
“Our goal for this is to let Trump, and his supporters in our state know, and by his supporters I mean (elected officials), but we want to make sure that he knows hate is not welcome in our state,” Becker said.
Becker said she was “so upset” with Iowa congressional leaders for “not listening to their constituents” and voting in favor of the bill, and it weighs “heavy on our hearts.”
“But it’s all the more reason for us to stand up, and stand against this,” Becker said.

Since Congress had appropriated the money in the recent continuing resolution, we had no reason to believe otherwise.”
The U.S. Department of Education informed states on Monday that it would withhold the $6.8 billion in grants, one day before they were due to be sent out. The notice did not provide any timeline or reason for the move, saying “decisions have not yet been made concerning submissions and awards for this upcoming academic year.”

Richard Franklin, president of the Birmingham chapter of the American Federation of Teachers, said in an interview Thursday that the withholding of congressionally-approved funds should have never happened in the first place.
“They’re using our kids as political pawns to prove a point politically, when we should all be providing our kids with an education,” he said. “That’s the one thing we should be doing, the one thing we’ve always done in this country.”
Michael Sibley, the director of communications at ALSDE, did not have an available list of programs affected or a copy of the email sent to superintendents. The affected programs, according to the Democrats on the Senate Appropriations Committee, include:

Title I-C, on migrant education
Title II-A, on improving the effectiveness of teachers and school leaders
Title III-A, on English language acquisition
Title IV-A, on STEM education, college and career counseling and other activities
Title IV-B, on before- and after-school programs and summer school programs
Grants geared toward adult education and literacy programs

Franklin said with school starting in just over a month, it was one of the worst times to change funding. Because of the short notice, if local school districts cannot afford to pay the impacted teachers’ salaries, they would likely be let go.
“It’s just so dangerous what they’re doing, and we’re so close to school,” Franklin said. “They don’t have a lot of guidelines to what they’re doing, just to say ‘we’re investigating.’”
He said that rural and inner city school systems would be the most impacted by the lack of funds, like Montgomery Public Schools and Gadsden City Schools. A message seeking comment with both systems’ superintendents was left Thursday.
“We are hopeful that the review period will be expedited, and funds will be released quickly,”  Mackey wrote. “However, we look forward to working expeditiously with our colleagues in Washington as we are only weeks away from the beginning of a new school year and wish to avoid any disruption in services for our students and their families.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/trumpmcmahon-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-04 09:03:35.531180

(Photo by Michael Smith/Getty Images)Almost every year, a wildfire is started somewhere in Utah because of fireworks. Just this week, the Draper Fire Department said a small fire was started in the foothills above the city, likely from someone shooting fireworks from the window of a passing car. 
Crews were able to extinguish the fire by early Thursday morning, but it serves as a reminder of how quickly Fourth of July celebrations can spiral out of control. 
When are fireworks allowed in Utah? 
The Fourth of July is one of four holidays where setting off fireworks is allowed in Utah for a period of time. The other three are Pioneer Day on July 24, New Year’s Eve and Chinese New Year’s Eve. 
Hot and windy weather prompts statewide fire restrictions and a call for prayer

Typically there’s a two-day buffer around the holiday itself. For instance, this month fireworks are permitted between July 2-5, and July 22-25, according to the State Fire Marshal. 
Where can you set off fireworks? 
Even with that window, fireworks are still prohibited in much of the state. Utah is currently under State 1 fire restrictions, which bans fireworks on all state and federally managed land, and all unincorporated land (land that is not within a city’s jurisdiction). 
That means no fireworks are allowed in state parks, national parks, Bureau of Land Management land, national forest or other public land. 
Most of the state’s main population centers also have some kind of restriction in place. But that doesn’t mean you can’t set off fireworks, and Utah code actually prevents cities from enacting a citywide ban of state-approved explosives in most cases. 
Instead, cites can only restrict fireworks “in certain areas with hazardous environmental conditions,” which includes mountainous areas covered in brush, forest or dry grass, areas near a river, ravine or wash, undeveloped wildland or agricultural land and more.  
That’s still a pretty broad definition, so most municipalities are able to ban fireworks in the majority of land within their borders.

Salt Lake City, for instance, bans fireworks everywhere except for two stretches between Glendale Park and Interstate 80, and between 900 West and 900 East, south of South Temple.  
Draper bans fireworks everywhere except for a small section between State Street and 1300 East. And St. George bans fireworks in most of the city, except for the more densely populated neighborhoods away from open space and major roadways. 
State law requires municipalities make their firework restrictions easily accessible, and provide residents with an interactive map.
Curious where fireworks are permitted in your city? See the State Fire Marshal’s list of restrictions. 
For Salt Lake County-specific information, see Unified Fire Authority’s interactive map. 
Fire danger in Utah
This year’s holiday comes as most of the state is either in severe or moderate drought, which means fire danger is high. That’s the reasoning behind the fire restrictions, and officials from cities, counties and the state are urging Utahns to celebrate responsibly. 
Most of Utah now in severe or moderate drought

Despite some recent monsoonal moisture giving relief to parts of the state, northern Utah is still abnormally dry. Plus, monsoons can sometimes bring dry lightning and high winds, a near-perfect storm for fire danger. 
Most fires this year — 336 of 448 — have been human caused, resulting in more than 1,000 acres burned.
The cause of the state’s two largest fires have been natural. The France Canyon Fire is currently burning at about 33,300 acres and is 66% contained, while the Forsyth Fire, which destroyed homes in the Pine Valley community north of St. George, is at 13,500 acres and 43% contained.
On Wednesday, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox declared July 2 Wildland Firefighter Day in an effort to recognize the work firefighters do to protect homes and forests in the state. 
“Our wildland firefighters are heroes. They face incredible risks to keep us safe and protect the places we love,” Cox said in a statement. “We owe them our gratitude, and that starts with doing our part. This summer, use fireworks wisely, follow local rules, and help prevent the next fire.”

(Courtesy photo)One of the biggest misconceptions about COVID-19 is that the pandemic is over, said Dr. Michelle Harkins, a physician and clinical researcher at the University of New Mexico.
“Well, it’s not over,” Harkins told Source NM in an interview this week. “The pandemic is smoldering. There are still people that are getting sick. You can still get COVID. There’s still a significant burden of Long COVID that we’re going to have to address.”
The most recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention national early indicators, updated on July 30, show that 3% of tests for COVID are coming back positive, and 0.4% of patients in emergency rooms have the infection.
Harkins works as co-medical director of the Post-COVID Primary Care TeleECHO program, which is meant to help primary care providers recognize and diagnose Long COVID, a chronic condition defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as an illness that follows a SARS-CoV-2 infection and is present for at least three months. Long COVID includes a variety of symptoms, including respiratory, neurological and digestive ones.
Harkins also is the division chief at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center’s Department of Pulmonary, Critical Care & Sleep Medicine. UNM on June 24 promoted Harkins and four others to distinguished professors, after UNM HSC Internal Medicine Department Chair Mark Unruh nominated her.
“I’ve just been afforded a lot of opportunity here and a lot of great support from my colleagues and my mentors, and I just love my job,” Harkins said. “It is an incredible honor.”
Harkins said there’s a lot of misinformation that claims people no longer need to receive vaccines or wear masks. In fact, vaccination is protective against severe sickness and Long COVID, she said.
“I personally still wear a mask when I’m on a plane and in the airports, because I don’t want to get sick, and I don’t want to bring it home to a family member, or ruin a trip that I’m supposed to go on because I have COVID,” Harkins said.
While no therapies currently exist for Long COVID, Harkins told Source NM that she advises doctors to talk to their patients, believe them and work with them to figure out their goals as we wait to understand what treatments will help.
“Long COVID is not one-size-fits-all,” she said. “We know it’s a huge burden to patients, and patients need answers. No one was listening to them. People were gaslighting them, and it’s real.”
Her co-director Dr. Alisha Parada runs the only Long COVID clinic in New Mexico, where Harkins follows up with patients in her research.
What’s needed are multidisciplinary clinics to address the myriad of symptom complexes that Long COVID patients face, Harkins testified before Congress in January 2024.
“A Long COVID patient might come to a multidisciplinary clinic and need to see a neurologist, a cardiologist, and an internist, all for the same diagnosis of Long Covid,” Harkins told the U.S. Senate HELP Committee.
Earlier in the pandemic, Harkins started a different Project ECHO training program for doctors to treat patients hospitalized with acute COVID-19. She turned her focus to a Long COVID clinic for primary care providers when she received new funding.
She led clinical trials for acute COVID treatments, including those that established the effectiveness of antiviral remdesivir and anti-inflammatory baricitinib.
Those led Harkins and her team to become involved in the National Institutes of Health’s RECOVER study, which is due to end in October. She and her colleagues have been observing 148 adult patients as part of that study.
Harkins said her team has finished a clinical trial for the oral antiviral Paxlovid, and are currently running two other trials, RECOVER-ENERGIZE Post-Exertional Malaise and RECOVER-SLEEP Complex Sleep Disturbances.
In August, Harkins, Parada and UNM nurse practitioner Debora Bear will join leading Long COVID and other infection-associated chronic condition researchers at a conference in Santa Fe, where they will meet others who manage the disease.
“I’m very excited to go,” she said. “We will learn from others and share our experiences, and see what we can bring home.”

(Courtesy photo)Corey Roybal has dedicated his career to victim services at the state level, starting in 2013 when he joined the New Mexico Crime Victims Reparation Commission, a state agency that works to provide financial and other assistance to victims of crime in New Mexico.
He joined Adult Protective Services within the state’s Aging and Long Term Services Department in 2018 as an investigative caseworker. Since then, he has been promoted to a supervisor, regional manager and deputy director. In June, he became its director. 
“His deep knowledge of adult protective services, combined with a harm-reduction and trauma-informed approach make him the right leader to guide this vital division forward,” ALTSD Secretary Emily Kaltenbach said in a written statement.
Source NM recently spoke with Roybal about his work at APS and his approach to helping adult New Mexican victims. The following interview has been edited for clarity and concision.
 
Source NM: How might your time at the New Mexico Crime Victims Reparation Commission inform your work at APS?
Roybal: One of the things that I learned there is how to be victim-centered and to really focus on how [we are] being trauma-informed and working with clients at their level. I think a lot of times you focus on the specific individual who’s been the victim, but victimization, it has a ripple effect. It spreads from the victim to the family members to anybody who has direct contact with that client.
I’m sure you know somebody or have come in contact with somebody who has been a victim. And how that network and that community around that individual comes together to support them really builds the foundation for their recovery.

One of the big things that I promote is our job is to inform, educate and empower. Not everybody in caregiving is fully trained.  Sometimes you fall into it just by necessity. And sometimes you slip and you trip up and you may do things that unintentionally are hurtful.
How many cases would you say APS typically responds to in a year? 
It’s always going to fluctuate, but I would say for this last fiscal year, we saw just a little bit over 6,400 APS investigations. I would say that’s an honest number from year-to-year. 
And one thing too that I want to emphasize is Adult Protective Services isn’t just elder adults. We are 18 and older, so our vulnerability population and the responses vary,  because you have to be reactive to the current situation. 
What kind of cases do you frequently see in New Mexico? 
As rural as New Mexico is, there’s a lot of isolation so a lot of self-neglect occurs and sometimes it’s unknowingly or knowingly.  
And exploitation, we’ve seen a huge increase just because scams are growing, the way they’re doing scams. We all get them, right?  It’s not specific to vulnerability. Everybody’s a potential victim. And when you are a vulnerable adult, that risk increases, so you see a lot of those tech scams. And then romance scams are another one.
What are the differences between abuse, neglect and exploitation?
Abuse is knowingly, intentionally and negligently inflicting physical pain or injury or mental anguish on a vulnerable adult. Signs of abuse come in various ways, and it’s not always the obvious black eye, broken nose. It could be scratches, small cuts or wounds, grab marks, certain bruises that aren’t always so obvious, any unexplainable injuries, bed sores. Some of the more kind of scary ones is physical confinement, sexual assault or any sort of verbal or psychological abuse.
Neglect – it’s the failure of the caretaker of an adult to provide the basic needs of an adult, such as food, shelter, supervision, the physical, mental health, in terms of the care that goes into that. Some signs of that are starvation, signs of dehydration, over- and under medicating an individual, unsanitary living environments. Things like hoarding, lack of personal hygiene or failure to go to specific medical care.
Exploitation is the unjust, improper use of an adult’s money or property for their own personal gain. So signs of exploitation [are] really the misuse or change in somebody’s money, income or property. We see this quite a bit with people transferring the deeds of family members’ homes because they’re incapacitated, which isn’t in the best interest of the client or part of any sort of legal document or process.
Now that you are in the role of director of APS, what changes or additions do you want to bring to your department?  
My goal is for us to continue to grow the program – to be proactive when it comes to behavioral health and substance use disorder. We continue to hear that there’s a growing concern [in these areas], and APS is very much in agreement that we are seeing that increase. My goal is to continue to promote the growth within the department…and that’s just by making sure that we’re staying up-to-date with the changes and what’s being reported by the state.
What draws you to this work and working with this population of New Mexicans?
I love New Mexico and I love being here, and I want everybody here to have that same experience that I have. I did have my grandparents who fell into that need for caregivers and my family stepped up wonderfully and was supportive. So I just want to make sure that everybody has that opportunity to age in place.
I think the most important thing is I want to be part of a program that’s going to maybe one day have to take care of me.  So I would like to make sure that I’m doing my very best to promote the success of this program.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/roybal-1024x472.jpeg,,,2025-07-04 09:03:35.531180

While heavy rains on Thursday threatened communities along the burn scars, Independence Day is forecast to be mostly sunny and hot for nearly all of New Mexico. More than 90% of the state is experiencing some level of drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor, with parched plants creating potential fire fuels.
NM Gov declares state of emergency for ongoing drought, fire risk

As of July 3, 12 New Mexico counties are under some level of fire restrictions, in addition to two towns — Cloudcroft and Ruidoso — and one tribal jurisdiction — Mescalero Apache. Eight of the counties are under burn bans that explicitly ban fireworks. Those counties are: Colfax, Lincoln, Luna, McKinley, Rio Arriba, Sierra, Torrance and Valencia.
So far this year, 531 confirmed wildfires have ignited in New Mexico, burning more than 140,000 acres, according to the Southwest Coordination Center. Of them, 345 were human-caused, 71 were naturally caused and 115 had “unknown” causes. Frequently, wildfires initially deemed “unknown” later turn out to be human-caused.
Fireworks are not allowed anywhere in National and State forests, National Parks and other public lands.
A 1996 law vests municipalities with the power to regulate fireworks, but only with 20 days notice and limited to certain kinds (listed as missile and stick-type rockets, helicopters, aerial spinners and ground-audible devices).
The City of Albuquerque and Bernalillo County also banned aerials and devices that can be heard from the ground. All fireworks must be used on paved surfaces, with a nearby bucket to extinguish any errant sparks and cannot be discharged in the Bosque, open space areas or city parks.
Colfax and Otero counties banned firework sales determining the dry and hot conditions posed too high a fire risk.
Santa Fe County enacted a fireworks ban last month through July 10. “This fireworks ban is a preventive measure to protect lives, property, and the environment,” Santa Fe County Fire Marshal Jaome Blay said in a statement. “We urge all residents to avoid personal use of fireworks and instead attend professionally produced public displays.”

As a refugee, I bought this flag not because America is perfect, but because of its promise.
The first time I saw the American flag, I was nine years old. My family and I were at the Pakistan–Afghanistan border, preparing to return to Afghanistan after years of fleeing the Taliban and living in exile. 
We waited to be vaccinated and processed for return, and the American flag was attached to the back of a U.S. Army vehicle. My uncle, pointing at the flag, said, “Look, now we will be safe.” At that moment, the American flag felt like a promise. 
Since then, the flag’s meaning has shifted, but I refuse to let hate define it.
Years later, I was granted a student visa and arrived in the United States as an international student. In the airport, I stood again in front of the American flag, where it waved its thirteen red and white stripes and fifty stars. It was a profound moment when I felt welcomed. I knew then, deep in my heart, that I was safe and my life was full of possibilities. 
As I experienced America and life in it, that sense of safety changed. Slowly, I began to fear the flag that once gave me hope.
I saw the American flag in the hands of people shouting vulgar things about immigrants. I saw it on t-shirts worn by those who looked at me with hate. I started to believe that when an American flag was hanging on someone’s porch or painted on their truck, it meant I wasn’t welcome. The flag that once symbolized safety and freedom slowly started to feel like a warning.
But, a few days ago, I found myself revisiting the most joyful moments of my life in this country: arriving in the U.S. for the first time, the day I became a U.S. citizen, my siblings making it to America safely, and my mother stepping off a plane onto American soil. 
In every photo from those moments, we are smiling—some of us crying—with the American flag waving in the background. Despite everything, that flag was always there, not just in fear, but in celebration of survival and homecoming.
This Independence Day, I bought an American flag.
I do not believe this country is perfect, but I believe we belong in it. I know we are part of America’s flawed, painful, and beautiful story. I bought the flag because we, too, arrived here with teary eyes and hopeful hearts. Like that little girl at the border all those years ago, I still choose to believe in the promise of safety, dignity, and a better life.
But belief alone is not enough. We must act.
When you turn on the news or scroll through social media, the stories are grim. The Trump administration continues to sow fear and division. In states where refugees are revitalizing communities, federal policies are stripping refugee resettlement while programs have been indefinitely paused. Funding cuts have gutted resettlement and legal support systems. Fundamental rights, such as asylum and due process, are under constant attack. Families are being separated. People from entire countries are once again banned from entering America. Refugee and immigrant rights organizations are being systematically targeted. 
Last year, 625 refugees found safety in Maine, bringing their resilience, vibrancy, and skills to a state facing an aging population and labor shortages. Maine’s essential refugee agencies are now grappling with how to preserve basic services after federal funding cuts gutted their support systems. These actions are a cowardly way to treat people who have crossed continents and oceans, left everything behind, and risked it all to come home.
For many of us, America was not our first choice. However, it is our last hope. And still, we love this country not because it’s easy, but because we’ve invested our futures in its promises and potential. Refugees know that we are not just part of America—we help make it whole.
As we step into a new chapter of American history, the flag belongs to us all. The flag, and the country for which it stands, belongs to those who believe in something better, kinder, and in the promise of liberty and justice for all. It belongs to everyone who dares to hope, who fights for compassion, and who still—despite everything—believes in its promise. This flag is our flag.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The average cost for a 10-person Fourth of July will cost $70.92, which is 30 cents less than last summer, but the second highest cookout cost since 2013 when American Farm Bureau Federation began its annual survey on the topic.
Beef, canned goods and hand-picked crops have the highest price increases from last year, due likely to low domestic cattle inventory, aluminum tariffs and the cost of labor.
The American Farm Bureau survey assumes a gathering of 10 people who will consume: cheeseburgers, chicken breasts, pork chops, potato chips, canned pork and beans, fresh strawberries, homemade potato salad, fresh-squeezed lemonade, chocolate chip cookies and ice cream.
Canned of pork and beans had the steepest increase, 8.2% or 20 cents, from last year. The bureau said labor costs along the supply chain and steep tariffs on aluminum are likely to blame.
Homemade lemonade will also cost 20 cents more per pitcher this year, and strawberries 8 cents more per pound, due to a continued trend of high labor costs in the specialty crop sector.
The cost of ground beef also increased to $13.33 for two pounds, which is nearly 60 cents more than the $12.77 cost in 2024. While normally a crowd favorite, it will cost families nearly $20 to make 10 cheeseburgers this weekend, according to the survey prices.

U.S. cattle herd size has been declining since 2019, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported the 2025 herd size was 8% lower than 2019 herd. The amount of beef imported to the U.S. has also gone up in the time frame.
Pork chops, on the other hand, had the largest decrease in price from last year. Three pounds of pork chops this weekend should run consumers about $14.13, which is nearly 9% less than the cut cost last year. The survey concludes this is due to high domestic pork supplies.
The cost of chicken breasts declined slightly from last year’s cookout prices but the cost of eggs increased, which made potato salad about 20 cents more expensive this year. Poultry have been affected by the ongoing highly pathogenic avian influenza, which has caused fluctuating prices as the supply chains are impacted.
Since January, U.S. has imported about 10 times the amount of shell eggs it imported in the same period in 2024 as part of the administration’s plan to combat the bird flu. Wholesale egg prices have declined by more than 60% since January, but the American Farm Bureau report shows the cost for consumers for just four eggs is up 54% from last summer.
The bureau survey also breaks prices down by region and found cookouts on the East Coast are the cheapest this year at $63.79, followed by the south who can feed a party of 10 for $68.93. Gatherings in the West average at $73.50 and Midwestern gatherings come in as the second most expensive at $69.87.
Farmers not pocketing fair share, advocates say
Consumer increases don’t necessarily mean higher prices for farmers, however. On average, farmers and ranchers receive about $0.16 per consumer dollar spent on food, according to the latest “Farmer’s Share” report from National Farmers Union.
Rob Larew, the organization’s president said it’s important to highlight the “growing imbalance” in the food system.
“Family farmers and ranchers are working harder than ever, yet taking home less, while corporate monopolies in processing, distribution, and retail rake in record profits,” Larew said. “Farmers deserve a fair share of the food dollar, and consumers deserve a food system that works for everyone, not just a handful of powerful corporations.”
According to the report, a rancher takes home $2.08 on a one pound package of ground beef sold for $5.99. A lettuce farmer gets an even lower cut, receiving about 8.2% of the consumer dollar.

,California,2025-07-04 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,California’s politics drifts rightward while New York’s leans left,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/07/california-politics-new-york-leans-left/,"In contrast to New York voters favoring a ""democratic socialist,"" Californians chose moderate politicians like Gov. Gavin Newsom and San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie.","The Democratic Party’s eight months of internal debate, recriminations and soul searching that followed Donald Trump’s win and Kamala Harris’ loss in last year’s presidential duel got another jolt last month, when an otherwise obscure 33-year-old state legislator finished first in New York City’s mayoral primary.
Many Democratic leaders have concluded that Trump’s win was rooted in the image of their party reflecting priorities of college-educated coastal elitists rather than everyday issues affecting blue-collar families, such as inflation, crime and immigration.
The remedy, many concluded, lies in turning a bit to the right, downplaying such issues as climate change and paying more attention to bread-and-butter concerns.
However, the surprise primary win in New York by declared “democratic socialist” Zohran Mamdani, making him the favorite to become mayor of the nation’s largest city, creates a new wrinkle in the Democrats’ post-election debate.
Mamdani stressed the cost of living and other working class issues, promising that if elected he would make life easier for New Yorkers. He’s advocated for rent freezes, increases in minimum wages and having the city open its own grocery stores to drive down food costs.
Mamdani’s emergence as a new party leader with a pronounced left-of-center campaign resonates a continent away in California, a one-party state whose dominant Democrats are often divided along ideological lines, pitting Mamdani-like progressives against business-oriented moderates.
In the main, progressives have been losing ground to the mods, even in the San Francisco Bay Area, the bluest region in a deep-blue state. Daniel Lurie’s recent election as mayor of San Francisco, on pledges to balance the city’s deficit-ridden budget and crack down on street crime, is one indication of that trend. The recall or rejection of other Bay Area progressive officeholders in recent elections is another.
As the political website Politico noted recently, “Zohran Mamdani’s rise in New York enraptured progressives across the country. But for activists in San Francisco, it’s a sobering reminder of just how far they’ve fallen in this onetime bastion of progressivism.”
The conflict is also very evident in the state Capitol, with the political arc of Gov. Gavin Newsom a pithy example.
While running for governor in 2018 Newsom — the former mayor of San Francisco — paddled his political canoe to the left, embracing such leftist iconic causes as single-payer health care.
However, over the next six years Newsom slowly drifted rightward in policy terms, calling for tougher attitudes toward encampments of homeless people, dispatching Highway Patrol officers to fight street crime and, most recently, opposing transgender women competing in women’s sports.
Newsom even dropped his advocacy of single-payer health care in favor of wider coverage by the state’s Medi-Cal program, then sought to cut back on that coverage to close a state budget deficit this year.
As Newsom distanced himself from the progressive agenda — perhaps to make himself more viable as a presidential candidate in 2028 — its advocates found that the Legislature became less amenable as well. Progressive agenda bills could often gain passage in one legislative house only to die, almost always without any formal votes, in the other house.
Last year’s election also indicated that while California is a blue state, it’s nowhere close to embracing the democratic socialist program. Not only did Trump do surprisingly well against Kamala Harris in California’s presidential voting, but voters passed Proposition 36, an anti-crime measure that most Democratic leaders, including Newsom, opposed as a regression from criminal justice reforms.
This week’s passage of two Newsom-backed bills to overhaul the California Environmental Quality Act over the opposition of major environmental groups was another indication that, if anything, California’s politics are drifting slowly rightward.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/082024_CA-Dem_REUTERS_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-04 08:00:37.129473

Clyde Kennard — railroaded in 1960 because he dared to try to enroll at an all-white college in Mississippi — died of cancer just months after being freed from prison. He died on the anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, which promised “all men are created equal.” 
After World War II ended, Kennard taught denazification classes to German students. Years later, he served as a paratrooper in the Korean War. Afterward, he attended the University of Chicago, where he worked on a political science degree, only to have to return home to help his mother after his stepfather died. 
He started a chicken farm to help her make ends meet and tried to finish his degree by applying to attend the nearby college, now known as the University of Southern Mississippi. 
The State Sovereignty Commission, headed by the governor, used Black leaders to try and dissuade Kennard from enrolling at the all-white college. When that failed, there was a plot to plant a bomb in the Mercury car he drove. 
On Dec. 6, 1958, he wrote a letter to the editor of the Hattiesburg American, questioning the logic of the “separate but equal” approach: “After our paralleled graduate schools, where do our parallels of separate but equal go? Are we to assume that paralleled hospitals are to be built for the two groups of doctors? Are we to build two bridges across the same stream in order to give equal opportunities to both groups of engineers? Are we to have two courts of law so as to give both groups of lawyers the same chance to demonstrate their skills; two legislatures for our politically inclined, and of course two governors?” 
Months later, when he attempted to enroll at the college, constables claimed they found whiskey under the seat of his car, despite the fact he was a teetotaler. When he continued his fight to attend, he was arrested on charges, this time for reportedly stealing chicken feed.

Clyde Kennard — railroaded in 1960 because he dared to try to enroll at an all-white college in Mississippi — died of cancer just months after being freed from prison. He died on the anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, which promised “all men are created equal.” 
After World War II ended, Kennard taught denazification classes to German students. Years later, he served as a paratrooper in the Korean War. Afterward, he attended the University of Chicago, where he worked on a political science degree, only to have to return home to help his mother after his stepfather died. 
He started a chicken farm to help her make ends meet and tried to finish his degree by applying to attend the nearby college, now known as the University of Southern Mississippi. 
The State Sovereignty Commission, headed by the governor, used Black leaders to try and dissuade Kennard from enrolling at the all-white college. When that failed, there was a plot to plant a bomb in the Mercury car he drove. 
On Dec. 6, 1958, he wrote a letter to the editor of the Hattiesburg American, questioning the logic of the “separate but equal” approach: “After our paralleled graduate schools, where do our parallels of separate but equal go? Are we to assume that paralleled hospitals are to be built for the two groups of doctors? Are we to build two bridges across the same stream in order to give equal opportunities to both groups of engineers? Are we to have two courts of law so as to give both groups of lawyers the same chance to demonstrate their skills; two legislatures for our politically inclined, and of course two governors?” 
Months later, when he attempted to enroll at the college, constables claimed they found whiskey under the seat of his car, despite the fact he was a teetotaler. When he continued his fight to attend, he was arrested on charges, this time for reportedly stealing chicken feed. 
Kennard went to Parchman prison, where he was forced to pick cotton from daylight to dark. In 1961, he was diagnosed with colon cancer, but wasn’t released from prison until two years later, just months before he died.

Credit: National Archives.Editor’s note: With all the political division confronting Americans these days, we at the Phoenix thought it right to look to our roots as a country. To that end, we’re republishing one of our charter documents, the Declaration of Independence. Happy Fourth of July!
When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume, among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That, to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. That, whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government, laying its foundation on such principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.

Prudence, indeed, will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and, accordingly, all experience has shown, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.
But, when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such government, and to provide new guards for their future security. Such has been the patient sufferance of these colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former systems of government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states. To prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world.

 Refusal to enact needed laws

He has refused his assent to laws the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.
He has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.
He has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of representation in the legislature; a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.
He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.
He has dissolved representative houses repeatedly, for opposing, with manly firmness, his invasions on the rights of the people.

He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the legislative powers, incapable of annihilation, have returned to the people at large for their exercise; the state remaining in the meantime exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.
He has endeavored to prevent the population of these states; for that purpose obstructing the laws for naturalization of foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new appropriations of lands.
He has obstructed the administration of justice, by refusing his assent to laws for establishing judiciary powers.
He has made judges dependent on his will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.
He has erected a multitude of new offices, and sent hither swarms of officers to harass our people, and eat out their substance.
He has kept among us, in times of peace, standing armies, without the consent of our legislatures.
He has affected to render the military independent of and superior to the civil power.
He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his assent to their acts of pretended legislation:
For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us;
  The U.S. Supreme Court (Susan J. Demas illustration)
 Mock trials

For protecting them, by a mock trial, from punishment for any murders which they should commit on the inhabitants of these states;
For cutting off our trade with all parts of the world;
For imposing taxes on us without our consent;
For depriving us, in many cases, of the benefits of trial by jury;
For transporting us beyond seas to be tried for pretended offenses;

For abolishing the free system of English laws in a neighboring province, establishing therein an arbitrary government, and enlarging its boundaries, so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these colonies;
For taking away our charters, abolishing our most valuable laws, and altering fundamentally the forms of our governments;
For suspending our own legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.
He has abdicated government here, by declaring us out of his protection, and waging war against us.
He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.
He is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to complete the works of death, desolation, and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the head of a civilized nation.
He has constrained our fellow citizens, taken captive on the high seas, to bear arms against their country, to become the executioners of their friends and brethren, or to fall themselves by their hands.

 Exciting domestic insurrections

He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian savages, whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes, and conditions.
In every stage of these oppressions, we have petitioned for redress, in the most humble terms. Our repeated petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.

Nor have we been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred, to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, enemies in war, in peace friends.
We, therefore, the representatives of the United States of America, in General Congress assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name, and by authority of the good people of these colonies, solemnly publish and declare, that these United Colonies are, and of right ought to be free and independent states; that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the state of Great Britain is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that, as free and independent states, they have full power to levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances, establish commerce, and to do all other acts and things which independent states may of right do. And for the support of this declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Brissia Hernandez and Heidi Perez: Students like us will finally be able to go to college in the state.","This commentary is by Brissia Hernandez of Enosburg and Heidi Perez of Milton, members of Migrant Justice who have recently graduated from high school. Heidi Perez is currently in immigration detention after being detained by Border Patrol.


Going to high school in Vermont is really hard when you don’t speak English. We both moved here a couple of years ago to be with our families. We had to leave behind everything that we knew and start completely over: new classes, new friends, new language, new country. 
Everything here is very different. People judge you for being an immigrant. We both got lost on the way to class at first, and it was really hard to ask for help. It all makes you feel so alone. At first, they don’t even put you in classes with other students.
But finally, with an interpreter to help, we could start going to normal classes, although it was only in Spanish class that we could talk normally. And now that a few more immigrant students are coming to our schools, we at least have some other classmates who understand. 
When we first moved to Vermont, there was basically no hope for students like us to go to college, even though we have been dreaming of it since we were little. College helps you grow as a person and learn so many new things. It gets you ready to help other people and support your community. It helps you get over your fears and be a better person. It helps you become someone important. 
Our parents came to this country and work hard every day to fight for a better life for us. But college is really expensive. It wasn’t until last year that we could really hope to make our dreams of going to college come true. Last January, a group of immigrant activists called Migrant Justice started going to the Statehouse to talk with legislators about making college more accessible for students like us. 
We both got involved because our moms are community leaders with Migrant Justice. It was weird at first to be there. From the outside, the Statehouse looks like a big castle. But we knew how important it was to be there.
Together, we explained the discrimination that we face and also the dreams that we have. We even talked to reporters and gave interviews that got played on TV. Even though it made us nervous to be in front of so many cameras, we shared our stories because it’s important that our community and our voices are heard. 
And we won! Last May, the bill that we fought so hard to pass got signed into law by Gov. Phil Scott. On July 1, 2025, it finally went into effect.
Students like us will finally be able to go to college in the state. We’ll be treated like any other Vermonter and pay the same in-state tuition rates. We will be able to get the same scholarships to help pay for college. These changes will let us go to college in Vermont, close to our families, instead of being separated again. 
We still don’t know what we want to be when we grow up. Maybe a dentist. Maybe an architect. Maybe organizers like our moms. Or maybe a plastic surgeon like on Brissia’s favorite TV show. But now we have the chance to find out.

Advocates hope the heat-related death of a worker in Madison last year will spur them to action this fall. (Spencer Platt | Getty Images)Days after a record-breaking heat wave in New Jersey, the Legislature recessed for the summer without moving legislation that would mandate protections for workers who spend hours outdoors in the blistering heat. 
Sen. Joe Cryan (D-Union), who has sponsored a version of the measure since 2023, said he’s aggravated at the uphill battle this controversial bill has faced when he believes it’s “common sense.” 
“Everybody knows that we just had two of the hottest days in years. We look at people working outside while we drive and say, ‘Wow, look at that, that’s something I don’t want to be doing.’ But yet, we don’t care enough to provide the standards that they need and deserve,” Cryan said. 
His latest proposal would require employers to develop heat-related illness and injury prevention plans, and mandate the state labor commissioner to create heat stress levels that trigger those plans. Employers would be required to regularly monitor workers for exposure to heat, provide cool water, cool-down areas and paid rest breaks, limit the time employees are out in the heat during the workday, postpone non-essential tasks, and limit exposure to work in sources of heat. 
Prevention plans also would have to include annual training for employees working in the heat, along with record-keeping requirements and emergency response procedures, according to the bill. The Labor Department could issue stop-work orders for employers who don’t comply with the bill’s provisions, and fine businesses $2,000 for each day they violate the stop-work order.   
The bill, introduced in November, has not been scheduled for a hearing in the Senate. The Assembly’s companion bill also awaits a hearing in that chamber’s appropriations committee.
After another year of the legislation languishing, Cryan is mulling introducing yet another version, in hopes of garnering more support from business groups who have vehemently opposed the legislation. Provisions in previous bills he considered straightforward have become an odyssey, he said, with critics targeting the temperature of water or shade requirements.  
The New Jersey Business and Industry Association has testified against several iterations of the bill, saying the requirements would be onerous to businesses that already maintain effective work safety plans. 
“Our members have found that it would be extraordinarily difficult for them to comply with this legislation given its sheer impracticality, vagueness, costs, and industrial workplace-oriented standards that do not fit the needs of all businesses and clearly makes New Jersey an outlier regarding this new overly burdensome mandate,” Elissa Frank, the association’s vice president of government affairs, told the Assembly Labor Committee during a February hearing. 
As lawmakers stall, Garrett O’Connor of Make the Road New Jersey, an immigrant labor advocacy group, noted that a federal agency recently confirmed the heat-related death of a New Jersey worker last summer. 
“Advocates for a workplace heat standard had said that over and over again, had made it clear, that a delay in getting workers protected would be deadly, and that’s exactly what we saw,” O’Connor said. 
According to an OSHA report, the 49-year-old worker was pouring concrete in Madison on July 8, 2024, when he began to “experience symptoms of heat stress and exhaustion due to high environmental temperatures” and collapsed. The National Weather Service had issued a heat advisory that day, with temperatures up to 97 degrees forecasted. 
He was taken to a local hospital, where he died, according to the OSHA report.










Advocates for a workplace heat standard had said that over and over again, had made it clear, that a delay in getting workers protected would be deadly, and that’s exactly what we saw.


– Garrett O'Connor of Make the Road New Jersey


The employer was fined $5,000 following an “informal settlement.” The citation states that employees were exposed to “high ambient heat” and “aggravating factors including an estimated moderate workload level.”
In 2022, three Amazon employees died at warehouses across the state — with at least one death occurred during a heat wave. The company denied heat played a role in their deaths.
As many as 170,000 workers fall victim to heat-stress incidents nationwide annually, according to consumer advocacy group Public Citizen. Lower-wage workers are five times more likely to face heat-related injuries, and farmworkers face up to 35 times higher risk of dying from heat exposure than the rest of the U.S. workforce, the group said in a 2023 study.
O’Connor hopes that OSHA’s determination that heat contributed to last year’s death of the worker in Madison will move legislators to act on Cryan’s bill after they return to Trenton in the fall. 
States like California, Oregon, Washington and Minnesota have passed laws to protect workers from extreme heat, O’Connor pointed out. 
“There’s been this big misunderstanding with legislators that the sky is falling, but those predictions from opponents have not proven to be true elsewhere,” he said.

When land management decisions about trail development are being made in our towns, we humans need to choose reality over wishful thinking.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Nancy Zimny: Recreational trails affect nature and wildlife.","This commentary is by Nancy Zimny of Richmond.


What Vermonter has not enjoyed the thrill of a fast downhill ski run, the adrenalin of a mountain bike turn, the wonderful exhaustion after a long hike or cross-country ski, the quiet pleasure of a walk in the woods or the “awesomeness” of the view from a mountaintop? Outdoor recreation feeds our spirit, strengthens our bodies, often supports the local economy, and therefore has exploded in popularity.
Consequently, Vermont communities face pressure to provide more access to more land to accommodate more outdoor recreation opportunities. And providing human access for outdoor recreation usually means trails.
Because the effects of recreation trail traffic on wildlife and nature are often more subtle and indirect, and not as immediately visible to the human eye as other activities like housing, logging or road construction, recreational trails may seem to have relatively little environmental impact, promoting conservation over development — a “win-win” situation: good for us and good for nature.
Is our human use of recreational trails as benign or beneficial as many outdoor recreationists, the public and even some land stewards seem to believe? This attractive premise is accepted readily as true, and the underlying “win-win” assumption is so ubiquitous that few question its validity. 
But scientific concerns about the impact of recreational trails on wildlife and natural habits have existed since the 1980s. Trails essentially provide a gateway for what are called cumulative effects to occur. These are persistent, repetitive, seemingly inconsequential — but ultimately negative — stresses on wildlife and nature caused by a high volume of recreational traffic. And these effects can occur well beyond the physical trail itself — in zones of influence that surround the trail. 
Trails have various possible effects. Habitats fragmented by recreational activity can disturb key animal movement patterns. Human presence alone can affect where and how wildlife live, forage and procreate by inducing repetitive flushing and flight behaviors. This imposes an increase in energy demands that increases animals’ stress and mortality — especially if it occurs during winter or other periods of limited food — and may decrease nest fidelity, or drive habitat abandonment.
Behavioral alterations associated with breeding and prey-predator relationships in plant and animal species can occur. Ultimately, species fitness, sustainability and diversity are compromised.
We use recreational trails in a variety of ways — walking, running, hiking, skiing or biking. Some behaviors. such as having dogs on or off leash, loud sounds, hikers cutting switchbacks, or bikers creating rogue trails, are likely to exacerbate problems. But even well-behaved trail recreationists can’t negate the conservation impact of repetitive high-volume use, and newer recreation technology that may further stress wildlife and nature.
No type of outdoor recreation can escape its responsibility in producing trail-based effects on conservation. However, the exponential rise in mountain biking draws particular attention to its role. Its popularity alone drives an intensive push for more trails to accommodate growing numbers of participants, and since bicycles allow people to go farther into the land’s interior, any negative effects on conservation are spread more broadly, potentially extending into areas that used to otherwise provide safe refuge for wildlife from human activity.
Furthermore, characteristics that humans consider highly desirable in mountain biking, such as separate trails for ascent and descent, loops, maximizing variety and technical challenges, and inter-connectivity of trails to form extensive networks, are all ancillary features that expand the human footprint and its effects on wildlife and habitat.
The call for “sustainable” trail-building within the mountain biking community is directed primarily at issues of soil erosion and water drainage — a laudable nod to conservation of the trails themselves — but these efforts alone do little to minimize the human impact on wildlife and habitat that more “sustainable” trails still invoke.
Many outdoor recreationists likely consider themselves conservationists. However, given the constellation of positive health, pleasure and economic factors that drive the popularity of outdoor recreation today, it is not surprising that any recreation trail-based concerns about impact on wildlife and habitat — even though known for many years — have gained little traction in the minds of outdoor recreationists or the public.
Attention to human impact of recreation trails on wildlife and habitat is growing. Studying it presents some logistical and scientific challenges. Still, just because we don’t know everything, doesn’t mean we know nothing.
In systematic literature reviews of the impact of recreation on wildlife, most show a generally negative effect that includes impact not only on well-recognized mammals, but also insects, herpetofauna, and birds.
Other studies reveal the negative effect of human presence on wildlife is potentially stronger, more widespread, or serious than humans are aware of or are willing to believe, and that human interpretation of wildlife behavior can be fraught with inaccuracy. Certainly, enough information already exists to warrant significant skepticism that trail-based recreation is either innocuous or benign.
Trail-based recreation benefits humans. But when land management decisions about trail development are being made in our towns, we humans need to choose reality over wishful thinking. We need to be mindful of the potential impact our personal outdoor recreational activities have on nature and wildlife habitats, and stay wary of the power of our anthropocentric beliefs that may lead us to ignore or dismiss scientific knowledge about what nature truly needs.
If we cannot be honest, humble or smart enough to do so, we risk making a dangerous Faustian bargain that may have enormous human appeal in the short term, but over time, will inevitably reveal itself as a very bad deal for nature and us.

Editor’s note: Below are some excerpts from a speech on the meaning of the Fourth of July delivered by Frederick Douglass in Rochester, New York, July 5, 1852. 
Fellow-citizens, pardon me, allow me to ask, why am I called upon to speak here to-day? What have I, or those I represent, to do with your national independence? Are the great principles of political freedom and of natural justice, embodied in that Declaration of Independence, extended to us? And am I, therefore, called upon to bring our humble offering to the national altar, and to confess the benefits and express devout gratitude for the blessings resulting from your independence to us?
Would to God, both for your sakes and ours, that an affirmative answer could be truthfully returned to these questions! Then would my task be light, and my burden easy and delightful.
…But, such is not the state of the case. I say it with a sad sense of the disparity between us. I am not included within the pale of this glorious anniversary! Your high independence only reveals the immeasurable distance between us. The blessings in which you, this day, rejoice, are not enjoyed in common. — The rich inheritance of justice, liberty, prosperity and independence, bequeathed by your fathers, is shared by you, not by me… This Fourth of July is yours, not mine…
…My subject, then fellow-citizens, is AMERICAN SLAVERY. I shall see, this day, and its popular characteristics, from the slave’s point of view. Standing, there, identified with the American bondman, making his wrongs mine, I do not hesitate to declare, with all my soul, that the character and conduct of this nation never looked blacker to me than on this 4th of July! Whether we turn to the declarations of the past, or to the professions of the present, the conduct of the nation seems equally hideous and revolting. America is false to the past, false to the present, and solemnly binds herself to be false to the future. Standing with God and the crushed and bleeding slave on this occasion, I will, in the name of humanity which is outraged, in the name of liberty which is fettered, in the name of the constitution and the Bible, which are disregarded and trampled upon, dare to call in question and to denounce, with all the emphasis I can command, everything that serves to perpetuate slavery — the great sin and shame of America! “I will not equivocate; I will not excuse;” I will use the severest language I can command; and yet not one word shall escape me that any man, whose judgment is not blinded by prejudice, or who is not at heart a slaveholder, shall not confess to be right and just.
But I fancy I hear some one of my audience say, it is just in this circumstance that you and your brother abolitionists fail to make a favorable impression on the public mind. Would you argue more, and denounce less, would you persuade more, and rebuke less, your cause would be much more likely to succeed. But, I submit, where all is plain there is nothing to be argued. What point in the anti-slavery creed would you have me argue? On what branch of the subject do the people of this country need light?
…At a time like this, scorching irony, not convincing argument, is needed. O! had I the ability, and could I reach the nation’s ear, I would, to-day, pour out a fiery stream of biting ridicule, blasting reproach, withering sarcasm, and stern rebuke. For it is not light that is needed, but fire; it is not the gentle shower, but thunder. We need the storm, the whirlwind, and the earthquake. The feeling of the nation must be quickened; the conscience of the nation must be roused; the propriety of the nation must be startled; the hypocrisy of the nation must be exposed; and its crimes against God and man must be proclaimed and denounced.
What, to the American slave, is your 4th of July? I answer: a day that reveals to him, more than all other days in the year, the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim. To him, your celebration is a sham; your boasted liberty, an unholy license; your national greatness, swelling vanity; your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless; your denunciations of tyrants, brass fronted impudence; your shouts of liberty and equality, hollow mockery; your prayers and hymns, your sermons and thanksgivings, with all your religious parade, and solemnity, are, to him, mere bombast, fraud, deception, impiety, and hypocrisy — a thin veil to cover up crimes which would disgrace a nation of savages. There is not a nation on the earth guilty of practices, more shocking and bloody, than are the people of these United States, at this very hour.
Go where you may, search where you will, roam through all the monarchies and despotisms of the old world, travel through South America, search out every abuse, and when you have found the last, lay your facts by the side of the everyday practices of this nation, and you will say with me, that, for revolting barbarity and shameless hypocrisy, America reigns without a rival.
…The church of this country is not only indifferent to the wrongs of the slave, it actually takes sides with the oppressors. It has made itself the bulwark of American slavery, and the shield of American slave-hunters. Many of its most eloquent Divines. who stand as the very lights of the church, have shamelessly given the sanction of religion and the Bible to the whole slave system. They have taught that man may, properly, be a slave; that the relation of master and slave is ordained of God; that to send back an escaped bondman to his master is clearly the duty of all the followers of the Lord Jesus Christ; and this horrible blasphemy is palmed off upon the world for Christianity.
For my part, I would say, welcome infidelity! welcome atheism! welcome anything! in preference to the gospel, as preached by those Divines! They convert the very name of religion into an engine of tyranny, and barbarous cruelty, and serve to confirm more infidels, in this age, than all the infidel writings of Thomas Paine, Voltaire, and Bolingbroke, put together, have done! These ministers make religion a cold and flinty-hearted thing, having neither principles of right action, nor bowels of compassion. They strip the love of God of its beauty, and leave the throng of religion a huge, horrible, repulsive form. It is a religion for oppressors, tyrants, man-stealers, and thugs. It is not that “pure and undefiled religion” which is from above, and which is “first pure, then peaceable, easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.” But a religion which favors the rich against the poor; which exalts the proud above the humble; which divides mankind into two classes, tyrants and slaves; which says to the man in chains, stay there; and to the oppressor, oppress on; it is a religion which may be professed and enjoyed by all the robbers and enslavers of mankind; it makes God a respecter of persons, denies his fatherhood of the race, and tramples in the dust the great truth of the brotherhood of man…
Americans! your republican politics, not less than your republican religion, are flagrantly inconsistent. You boast of your love of liberty, your superior civilization, and your pure Christianity, while the whole political power of the nation (as embodied in the two great political parties), is solemnly pledged to support and perpetuate the enslavement of three millions of your countrymen. You hurl your anathemas at the crowned headed tyrants of Russia and Austria, and pride yourselves on your Democratic institutions, while you yourselves consent to be the mere tools and body-guards of the tyrants of Virginia and Carolina. You invite to your shores fugitives of oppression from abroad, honor them with banquets, greet them with ovations, cheer them, toast them, salute them, protect them, and pour out your money to them like water; but the fugitives from your own land you advertise, hunt, arrest, shoot and kill. You glory in your refinement and your universal education yet you maintain a system as barbarous and dreadful as ever stained the character of a nation — a system begun in avarice, supported in pride, and perpetuated in cruelty. You shed tears over fallen Hungary, and make the sad story of her wrongs the theme of your poets, statesmen and orators, till your gallant sons are ready to fly to arms to vindicate her cause against her oppressors; but, in regard to the ten thousand wrongs of the American slave, you would enforce the strictest silence, and would hail him as an enemy of the nation who dares to make those wrongs the subject of public discourse! You are all on fire at the mention of liberty for France or for Ireland; but are as cold as an iceberg at the thought of liberty for the enslaved of America. You discourse eloquently on the dignity of labor; yet, you sustain a system which, in its very essence, casts a stigma upon labor. You can bare your bosom to the storm of British artillery to throw off a threepenny tax on tea; and yet wring the last hard-earned farthing from the grasp of the black laborers of your country. You profess to believe “that, of one blood, God made all nations of men to dwell on the face of all the earth,” and hath commanded all men, everywhere to love one another; yet you notoriously hate, (and glory in your hatred), all men whose skins are not colored like your own. You declare, before the world, and are understood by the world to declare, that you “hold these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal; and are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; and that, among these are, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness;” and yet, you hold securely, in a bondage which, according to your own Thomas Jefferson, “is worse than ages of that which your fathers rose in rebellion to oppose,” a seventh part of the inhabitants of your country.
Fellow-citizens! I will not enlarge further on your national inconsistencies. The existence of slavery in this country brands your republicanism as a sham, your humanity as a base pretence, and your Christianity as a lie. It destroys your moral power abroad; it corrupts your politicians at home. It saps the foundation of religion; it makes your name a hissing, and a bye-word to a mocking earth. It is the antagonistic force in your government, the only thing that seriously disturbs and endangers your Union. It fetters your progress; it is the enemy of improvement, the deadly foe of education; it fosters pride; it breeds insolence; it promotes vice; it shelters crime; it is a curse to the earth that supports it; and yet, you cling to it…
…Allow me to say, in conclusion, notwithstanding the dark picture I have this day presented of the state of the nation, I do not despair of this country. There are forces in operation, which must inevitably work the downfall of slavery. “The arm of the Lord is not shortened,” and the doom of slavery is certain. I, therefore, leave off where I began, with hope. While drawing encouragement from the Declaration of Independence, the great principles it contains, and the genius of American Institutions, my spirit is also cheered by the obvious tendencies of the age. Nations do not now stand in the same relation to each other that they did ages ago. No nation can now shut itself up from the surrounding world, and trot round in the same old path of its fathers without interference. The time was when such could be done. Long established customs of hurtful character could formerly fence themselves in, and do their evil work with social impunity. Knowledge was then confined and enjoyed by the privileged few, and the multitude walked on in mental darkness. But a change has now come over the affairs of mankind. Walled cities and empires have become unfashionable. The arm of commerce has borne away the gates of the strong city. Intelligence is penetrating the darkest corners of the globe. It makes its pathway over and under the sea, as well as on the earth. Wind, steam, and lightning are its chartered agents. Oceans no longer divide, but link nations together. From Boston to London is now a holiday excursion. Space is comparatively annihilated. Thoughts expressed on one side of the Atlantic, are distinctly heard on the other. The far off and almost fabulous Pacific rolls in grandeur at our feet. The Celestial Empire, the mystery of ages, is being solved. The fiat of the Almighty, “Let there be Light,” has not yet spent its force. No abuse, no outrage whether in taste, sport or avarice, can now hide itself from the all-pervading light…",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/frederick-douglass-696x523-1.jpg,,,2025-07-04 07:06:14.411317

First, do no harm.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  8 Vermonters: A plea from rural Vermont — our education system Is not the enemy.","This commentary is by Seth and Kate Leach of Pawlet, Hanna Fay of Pawlet, Shawn and Sara Gingue of Waterford, Jeremy Russo of Rupert, and Christopher Smid and Hilary Solomon of Middletown Springs.


For the past year (and more), we have watched while Vermonters concerned about the cost and quality of education have debated the knotty issue of education finance reform. We have been saddened to see various groups (such as the Friends of Vermont Public Education) leverage this important public debate as an opportunity to attack our unique education system and our local independent schools. These efforts do nothing other than take educational opportunities away from our kids in rural communities like ours.
With the passage of H.454, we hope that all Vermonters — including those of us in the communities historically served by independent schools—can recognize that our leaders in Montpelier may have come up with a cure that isn’t worse than the disease. One that encourages efficiencies that don’t come at the cost of excellence and equity, and that does not “fix” our state’s education affordability crisis by requiring areas like ours to spend money we don’t have on new schools we don’t need.

In a line that runs diagonally from Bennington County in the southwest all the way up to the Northeast Kingdom, independent schools have stepped in, not to compete with public schools, but to fill gaps in the public system.
These independent schools have pioneered programs to support students living in poverty, and offer alternative paths to graduation for kids who might otherwise drop out. They have strong anti-discrimination policies, restorative justice practices that keep kids in school and high academic standards that prepare students for the futures they want to build.
All that for kids, like ours, from families who wouldn’t dream of trying to find five figures a year to pay elementary or high school tuition. Our children have incredible learning opportunities — nurturing teachers, AP classes, internships, travel opportunities, International Baccalaureate classes — because our tax dollars go to these independent schools, most of which raise money themselves to make up the difference and pay for the buildings and tools they need to teach.
To be clear, we’re not talking about a “voucher” system, taking dollars from existing public schools — we’re talking about town tuition going to approved independent schools where public school grades don’t exist. 
We literally didn’t build the public schools that our independent schools are supposedly competing with unfairly; we didn’t need to. We don’t want to now. Why spend tens of millions of dollars duplicating resources we already have, especially when the crisis Vermont education is facing is a fiscal one? 
There is no question that Vermont’s school funding model has been in dire need of reform, and we support the notion of more efficient administration, and even the painful truth that some schools may have to close. But there is no reason to target independent schools that have stepped in to fill an educational void for our students in rural Vermont, and have done so cost-effectively and incredibly well. 
The framework agreed upon is a starting point, and the devil is always in the details; clearly, the process of designing the new districts will be yet another opportunity for those who don’t understand these independent schools to try to eliminate them. But in this moment, we are incredibly grateful to all those in the state house who stayed focused on the real financial issues facing our entire system, and were unwilling to scapegoat the incredible schools that serve our kids with misinformation and rhetoric that simply does not align with the facts.
To everyone who’ll have a hand in this process going forward, please just remember the immortal advice of the great teacher Hippoccrates: first, do no harm.

(Washington State Parks)Though Washington State Parks, like other parts of state government, did not make it through this year’s legislative session with its budget unscathed, park visitors shouldn’t notice any staffing or service changes this summer, according to the agency. 
“We were fairly fortunate in that we were able to make mostly non-staffing cuts to be able to stay within budget,” said Sarah Fronk, a State Parks spokesperson. 
The agency’s operating budget for the 2025-27 biennium is $257.6 million, about $14.7 million less than its budget for the 2023-25 biennium. 
State Parks cut nine vacant positions and made other reductions, such as limiting staff travel, to stay within its tighter budget. 
“It’s really being extremely mindful of where we’re spending and what our priorities are,” Fronk said of managing the cuts, adding that maintaining safe and clean parks is the agency’s primary focus. 
In addition to a smaller budget, State Parks is now expected to fund 71% of its costs with revenue from Discover Passes and other fees, up from 65% in the last budget cycle. 
Discover Pass prices will rise from $30 to $45 on Oct. 1. Transaction fees can also apply to pass purchases, including a $5 charge for online sales. The passes are required for motor vehicle access to state parks and other recreation sites.
The Legislature approved the Discover Pass price increase during last year’s session. It’s the first price increase since the passes were introduced about 14 years ago.
“We’re really grateful to the Legislature for having our backs and kicking a little more revenue support our way,” Fronk said. “With the Discover Pass, I really can’t reiterate enough that it really does go to support your state parks and the stewardship and recreation work that we’re doing, because so much of our agency’s revenue is dependent on those sales.” 
Washington State Parks manages about 123 developed parks, 6,000 campsites, 800 historic buildings and 1,300 miles of trails across 12,000 acres of land. 
State Parks’ busy summer season runs from Memorial Day weekend in May to Labor Day weekend in September. 
“We’re anticipating that there’ll be a lot of visitors to state parks this year, and so we’re definitely gearing up for that,” Fronk said. 
In an effort to support staff with a smaller budget, State Parks is bolstering its education programs “so that people coming into the park don’t need quite as much help, and we can stay focused on cleaning and doing interpretive work,” Fronk said. 
New this summer, State Parks has partnered with the Washington State Parks Foundation and the online education platform Fridie Outdoors to create an educational video series for park visitors. 
State Parks also has a variety of outdoor guides and other resources available on its website to help visitors build outdoor literacy. 
“I really believe that, once people get those experiences outdoors and understand more what they’re seeing around them, they’re going to be more excited and interested in helping protect that, as well,” Fronk said.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ParadisePoint_Campground.jpg,,,2025-07-04 07:06:14.411317

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The average cost for a 10-person Fourth of July cookout will cost $70.92, which is 30 cents less than last summer, but the second-highest cookout cost since 2013, when the American Farm Bureau Federation began its annual survey on the topic.
Beef, canned goods and hand-picked crops have the highest price increases from last year, due likely to low domestic cattle inventory, aluminum tariffs and the cost of labor.
The American Farm Bureau survey assumes a gathering of 10 people who will consume: cheeseburgers, chicken breasts, pork chops, potato chips, canned pork and beans, fresh strawberries, homemade potato salad, fresh-squeezed lemonade, chocolate chip cookies and ice cream.
Canned pork and beans had the steepest increase, 8.2% or 20 cents, from last year. The bureau said labor costs along the supply chain and steep tariffs on aluminum are likely to blame.
Homemade lemonade will also cost 20 cents more per pitcher this year, and strawberries 8 cents more per pound, due to a continued trend of high labor costs in the specialty crop sector.
The cost of ground beef also increased to $13.33 for two pounds, which is nearly 60 cents more than the $12.77 cost in 2024. While normally a crowd favorite, it will cost families nearly $20 to make 10 cheeseburgers this weekend, according to the survey prices. 
U.S. cattle herd size has been declining since 2019, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported the 2025 herd size was 8% lower than 2019 herd. The amount of beef imported to the U.S. has also gone up in the time frame.
Pork chops, on the other hand, had the largest decrease in price from last year. Three pounds of pork chops this weekend should run consumers about $14.13, which is nearly 9% less than the cut cost last year. The survey concludes this is due to high domestic pork supplies.
The cost of chicken breasts declined slightly from last year’s cookout prices but the cost of eggs increased, which made potato salad about 20 cents more expensive this year. Poultry have been affected by the ongoing highly pathogenic avian influenza, which has caused fluctuating prices as the supply chains are impacted.
Since January, U.S. has imported about 10 times the amount of shell eggs it imported in the same period in 2024 as part of the administration’s plan to combat the bird flu. Wholesale egg prices have declined by more than 60% since January, but the American Farm Bureau report shows the cost for consumers for just four eggs is up 54% from last summer.
The bureau survey also breaks prices down by region and found cookouts on the East Coast are the cheapest this year at $63.79, followed by the south who can feed a party of 10 for $68.93. Gatherings in the West average at $73.50 and Midwestern gatherings come in as the second most expensive at $69.87.
 Farmers not pocketing fair share, advocates say

Consumer increases don’t necessarily mean higher prices for farmers, however. On average, farmers and ranchers receive about $0.16 per consumer dollar spent on food, according to the latest “Farmer’s Share” report from National Farmers Union.
Rob Larew, the organization’s president, said it’s important to highlight the “growing imbalance” in the food system.
“Family farmers and ranchers are working harder than ever, yet taking home less, while corporate monopolies in processing, distribution, and retail rake in record profits,” Larew said. “Farmers deserve a fair share of the food dollar, and consumers deserve a food system that works for everyone, not just a handful of powerful corporations.”
According to the report, a rancher takes home $2.08 on a one-pound package of ground beef sold for $5.99. A lettuce farmer gets an even lower cut, receiving about 8.2% of the consumer dollar.
Consumers also feel like their dollars don’t stretch as far. According to the latest food and farm index from Iowa Farm Bureau, price is the number one factor for Iowa shoppers as they fill their grocery carts, even as more consumers say they want to buy locally raised products.
Christopher Pudenz, an Iowa Farm Bureau economist, said price changes in Iowa-grown commodities “mostly reflect” supply and demand cycles.
“The Fourth of July is, of course, a celebration of our freedom but also a celebration of the American spirit, one embodied by our nation’s farmers,” Pudenz said in a press release. “Despite challenges like rising costs and weather impacts, Iowa farmers continue to do what they’ve always done—work hard, adapt and provide for American families.”

In the earliest days of the United States, John Adams wrote to his wife Abigail about the celebration of independence, “It ought to be solemnized with Pomp and Parade, with Shews, Games, Sports, Guns, Bells, Bonfires and Illuminations from one End of this Continent to the other from this Time forward forever more.”
“Bonfires and illuminations” refer directly to what we know as pyrotechnics and firework displays.
I’m a chemist and also president of Pyrotechnics Guild International, an organization that promotes the safe use of fireworks and using them here in the U.S. to celebrate Independence Day and other festivals throughout the year. As a chemist, and someone who leads demonstrations for chemistry students, I consider fireworks a great example of combustion reactions that produce colored fire. But the invention of colored fireworks is relatively recent and not all colors are easy to produce.
Early history of fireworks

Firecrackers were first invented serendipitously by the Chinese in 200 B.C. But it wasn’t until one thousand years later that Chinese alchemists developed fireworks in 800 A.D. These early fireworks were mostly bright and noisy concoctions designed to scare evil spirits – not the colorful, controlled explosions we see today. Fast forward another millennium and the Italians figured out how to add color by introducing various elements to the flammable mix. Adding the element strontium to a color pyrotechnic mix produces a red flame; copper, blue; barium, green; and sodium for yellow.
Too much or too little of the chemicals make significant changes in the temperature and thus the wavelength of color seen. The proper mixture of chemicals when ignited produce enough energy to excite electrons to give off different colors of light.
Even though the chemistry of these colors isn’t new, each generation seems to get excited by the colors splashed across the sky. We now have a wide range of flame colors: red, green, blue, yellow, purple, and variations of these.
Each color works the same way. As different elements ignite they release different wavelengths of light which translate as different colors.
Making the perfect blue
Not all colors of fireworks are equally easy to create. I believe several of my colleagues in pyrotechnic research and development would agree with me that blue is the most difficult color to produce.

  Pill box blue is the trickiest color firework to produce. (Tom Handel, CC BY-SA)
That is because the evening sky is a shade of blue, which means that most blues do not show up as well. If you try to make the blue brighter to contrast with the background it can look washed out. The right balance of copper and other chemicals in the flame or combustion reaction produce the best blue color flame in a firework.
I have taken this into account when trying to create the best blue flame color, which I call pill box blue. It is just bright enough to stand out against the night sky but still a rich blue. I have over 20 blue pyrotechnic formulas and I have found one that comes very close to this elusive hue.
Another difficulty in creating an intense blue color is that the chemistry is not simple. It requires a combination of several chemicals and the element copper. When copper ignites, the electrons surrounding the copper atoms get excited and energized in the flame. When the electrons release this energy, it appears to observers as blue light. Each color works the same way. As different elements ignite they release different wavelengths of light which translate as different colors. So when you see blue-colored dots of light creating a pattern in the night sky, you really are seeing excited electrons releasing energy as blue light.

But it’s a different type of cow — the cash cow of an online school — that makes Union anything but a typical rural school district.
State legislators say they have put Union on the chopping block because of poor performance. But district leaders believe the real reason is so the state can reap the benefits of the Indiana Digital Learning School, a virtual school Union has overseen since 2017 — growing to 7,500 students and paying the district an estimated $3 million in oversight fees annually.
That school is now the latest battleground in a years-long controversy in Indiana and nationally over who should oversee and earn money from online schools and the millions in tax dollars flowing through them.
Citing poor test scores, Indiana’s state legislature voted in April to close the Union schools by 2027 and send its 300 students who attend classes in-person to neighboring districts miles away.
The online school would then be on its own and either shut down or bring its millions to another partner, either another district, the state or as a charter school.
Tucked into a major state tax reform bill as a last minute amendment, the legislature’s vote came as a surprise to the district, with no opportunity for debate.
Union is challenging the vote in court, saying it was singled out and that the legislature violated state law. Angry residents are defending the district, with even the electronic sign outside the Modoc United Methodist Church switching between listing service times and stating: “We Support Union School Strong!”

“I don’t know what to do,” said Danielle Baker, who has a son going into sixth grade in the fall. She called the vote “alarming” and is struggling to figure out where her son can finish school. “I feel helpless. So I’m just trying to put on a brave front, I guess, and just see what happens.”
Republican state representative J.D. Prescott, who called for the closure, said the move was necessary because Union has “some of the lowest reading scores in the state.”
But the district believes the real reason is the millions it receives from the INDLS, which is run by the publicly-traded virtual learning company Stride Learning, formerly known as K12 Inc.
“It has nothing to do with the school performance,” said Union Superintendent Galen Mast. “It has nothing to do with school size. It has everything to do with a greater plan that’s behind it.”
Union attracted statewide and national notice when it partnered with K12 in 2017 to start the online school as a way to boost dwindling enrollment and avoid bankruptcy. Private companies can’t just open a school and take in tax dollars for students who attend. So they need either the state or a school district to approve them to operate, or a designated agency known as an authorizer if they want to operate a charter school.
Union’s arrangement allows Stride/K12 to run the for-profit digital school as part of the district. In return, it gives Union 5% of the virtual school’s revenue, a huge bonus for a tiny district, especially now that the online school has grown dramatically.
Union school board president Christina Ogden said a state senator told her INDLS must close because the state wants to create its own online school. She and Mast said Prescott also told them the district could avoid being closed if it gave up its money from the digital school.
“I think they had to take out the one (online school) that had the most students first, and then it’ll be easier to go ahead and go around and close all of the others,” Ogden said. “The state wants to control those funds.”
She said Prescott withdrew the offer as soon as he found support in the legislature to pass his amendment that will close Union schools.
Mast also believes the vote was about the virtual school money.“We’re not the smallest school. We don’t have the worst results, but we are tied to NDLS,” Mast added.

The future of the online school is unclear, since it’s not even mentioned in the law. Stride/K12 declined to directly answer multiple questions from The 74 about its options, with spokesperson Brooke Gabbert saying it was too early to speculate. “Our priority is to ensure that Indiana Digital Learning School remains an option for families across the state,” Gabbert wrote in an email.
The Indiana Small and Rural Schools Association also objected to the legislature’s decision, saying the state should let small districts decide their own fate, not order changes, especially without debate.
“We’re just trying to figure out what is the threshold,” said Christopher Lagoni, the association’s executive director. “What is it that says ‘This is the standard for closure?’ Or is it an individual, case by case basis?”
“Everybody’s kind of in the dark on that,” he added.
Prescott did not respond to written questions from The 74 about whether he asked Union to give up the online school. He repeated concerns about Union’s test scores, though the state not giving districts grades each year since the pandemic makes comparing districts complicated.
“This amendment is about starting a conversation on how to better serve these students and ensure they have access to a quality education,” he wrote.
Indiana Secretary of Education Katie Jenner said the state isn’t planning an online school right now, but said the state education department will review Indiana’s entire online learning system next year. That review will look at all parts of online schools, including how many virtual schools Indiana should have, their funding and who can create or oversee them
“Everything,” is how Jenner described the review.
“The question is, what guardrails or flexibilities do we need to have in place to make sure we’re getting the outcomes that we need for kids,” Jenner said.

That review won’t be an easy one because multiple districts, including one involving an influential Indiana family, all have an interest in having online school money in their budgets.
Union and the Clarksville school districts are the only districts with statewide e-schools. Many other Indiana school districts have created or are exploring online schools that serve local students to bring in more money or to keep them from departing to other online schools.
There’s also a much broader debate nationally within the school choice community about overseeing online schools as a way to earn money.
That has flared up mostly with online charter schools, whose relationship with their authorizers is similar to Union’s with INLDS. The National Association of Charter School Authorizers has criticized what it called “perverse incentives” of organizations that are supposed to make sure online schools are doing a good job but are also making more and more money if schools grow, even with poor results.
Oversight fees for online schools have since been a major controversy in several states, including California where officials near San Diego have been criminally charged for lax oversight, even when receiving fees that far exceeded what it cost to oversee the schools.
Though NACSA isn’t using such strident language today, it recommends that authorizers be paid only what it costs to oversee the schools, not a percentage of revenue. It also recommends that school districts should not authorize statewide virtual schools — a parallel to what Union and Clarksville are doing. Instead school districts should only oversee virtual schools serving students in their area.
Indiana state officials also have little confidence in small districts overseeing large online schools after two virtual charter schools overseen by the 1,000-student Daleville school district were found in 2017 to be defrauding the state with inflated enrollment numbers. State and federal investigators have estimated the schools improperly received between $44 and $154 million and have pursued separate cases, both criminal and to recover money.
Most recently, the superintendent of the two schools pleaded guilty early this month to a federal charge of conspiracy to commit wire fraud as part of the case. Efforts to recover money are still ongoing.

Scott Bess, a state school board member and founder of the Indiana Charter Innovation Center, said he believes online schools can work well, but local school boards aren’t prepared to oversee giant virtual schools run by companies like Stride worth $3.5 billion.
“I would never advocate for a local school district to partner with a virtual school operator to run a large virtual operation, because that’s not what that school district does,” said Bess. “The school districts are set up to be local, community driven.”
Applying that belief evenly, however, would put the state at odds with the Clarksville school district.
Clarksville also partners with Stride/K12 and the Indiana Gateway Digital School, is run by a family with political influence Union lacks. Clarksville’s superintendent Tina Bennett is the wife of Tony Bennett, the former state superintendent of Indiana and Florida. He was also an executive at Stride/K12 before retiring in March.
The Union School Corporation, which also includes a few other small towns, has long had a budget and enrollment problem. With few students and all separated by acres of crops, enrollment has always been low. And while it’s not quite a one-room schoolhouse it has one strip-mall style school building that houses district offices, its elementary school and combined junior/senior high school.
It has also almost shut down a few times.
The district has explored merging with other districts more than once, while the state has also debated ordering small districts to consolidate. Union’s future has been so uncertain, district officials and residents say, that parents have sometimes sent their children to other schools to avoid having to change schools later.
The partnership with K12, now Stride, changed that. The district added the online school as a district program, offering a few rooms in its offices as a base, in return for 5% of the e-school’s revenue.
The school isn’t a charter school, but the arrangement is similar to how online charter schools pay their authorizers, the non-profits that allow them to open as schools and then oversee them.
As the online school grew, the district’s budget improved and Mast, who just joined as superintendent a year ago, said the school uses the virtual school money to improve its facilities and special education classes.
Sarah McCord, the owner of the Modoc Diner down the street from the school campus, said she lives in a neighboring town but sends her two children to Union because it has small class sizes and helped her daughter with a learning disability improve rapidly.
“A lot of parents are choosing Union because of the attention that their children are getting without having to pay private school costs,” McCord said.
She believes Union is taking unfair criticism for test scores because parents are sending their children for personal attention and a chance to catch up. If they improve, but don’t score at grade level, McCord said, the district looks bad and is unfairly targeted.
“I think it’s an injustice,” she said.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Nevada must now brace itself for the big and brutal impacts of President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which he is expected to sign this holiday weekend.
The GOP-backed multitrillion-dollar domestic spending and tax cut package imposes steep cuts to Nevada’s biggest public safety nets, including Medicaid and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Democratic leaders, nonpartisan organizations, and even the Republican governor have expressed concern about the state’s ability to absorb the cuts.
The U.S. Senate and House largely passed the megabill on party lines. Democratic Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen and Reps. Susie Lee, Steven Horsford, and Dina Titus all voted against the bill and have actively spoken out against it. The Nevada congressional delegation’s sole Republican, Rep. Mark Amodei voted to pass the measure.
The latest economic projections for Nevada showed a dreary outlook, and state lawmakers have acknowledged they may not have the funds to fill gaps created by federal funding cuts. Many believe a special session to make cuts will be necessary.
Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager, in a statement Wednesday after the Senate narrowly passed the bill 51-50, called the bill a “brazen attack on the vital support systems our communities rely on.”
Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro, in a statement Thursday after the House passed the final version of the bill 218-214, said the GOP-backed megabill will devastate Nevada hospitals and “could cause lifesaving care to disappear across the state.”
“And at a time when Nevadans are still struggling with the basic cost of living, it will also increase the cost of energy by cutting investments in new energy infrastructure,” she said. “This bill is wrong, it will hurt Nevadans, and Republicans should be ashamed to have supported it.”
Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo in a statement posted on social media dismissed “beltway talking heads” bickering over the bill and celebrated one minor component of the bill, Trump’s “no tax on tips” and overtime promise, calling it “a huge win for hardworking Nevadans.”
He said his office “continues to assess” the bill but that “Nevadans should be excited about the potential impacts of tax cuts, investments in small businesses and American manufacturing, and efforts to help secure our border.”
Prior to a House vote in May on an earlier version of the bill, the Republican Governors Association announced 20 governors had signed onto a letter offering “strong support” for the bill. Lombardo was noticeably absent among the list of governors praising the bill in that letter.
Lombardo in February also expressed concern about Medicaid cuts, writing in a letter to congressional leaders that an “abrupt reduction in federal funding would not only disrupt care for those who rely on Medicaid, but would also destabilize public and private healthcare providers, leading to workforce reductions, service limitations, and financial strain on already overburdened health care facilities.”
Some of the provisions Lombardo warned about were implemented in the bill.
 Medicaid

Under the bill, Nevada stands to lose about $590 million annually in federal Medicaid funding for the next 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
Approximately 750,000 Nevadans, or about 20% of the total population, were covered by Medicaid in 2023. CBO estimates more than 114,500 Nevadans could lose coverage.
Medicaid expansion
The expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act in 2014 provided health coverage to thousands of Nevadans through additional federal funding, cutting the uninsured rate in half, from 22% in 2012 to 10% in 2024.
Under the bill, federal funding rates for these expansion enrollees will be cut from 90% to 60%, forcing Nevada to either come up with additional state funds or cut Medicaid in the state.
If Nevada maintains its current Medicaid expansion program despite cuts in federal funding, it will cost the state $2.92 billion over a seven-year period. If Nevada drops Medicaid expansion due to the added costs, an additional 132,000 Nevadans would lose health care coverage, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
Medicaid already accounts for a significant portion of state spending. In 2023, Nevada spent $5.6 billion to fund state Medicaid expenditures, or approximately 30% of its entire budget.
Hospitals, health care providers warn Medicaid cuts will be felt by people not on Medicaid

Provider tax
The bill will reduce a tax private hospitals pay that is known as a “provider tax.” The tax helps fund Medicaid and allows the state to access additional federal matching dollars.
Under the bill, Nevada stands to lose around $212 million in provider tax funding annually, according to Nevada Hospital Association President Pat Kelly.
In response to concerns about the impact reductions in the provider tax rate would have on rural hospitals, the bill provides the Rural Hospital Stabilization Fund with $50 billion from 2028 through 2032 to help with a transition.
Two rural hospitals in Nevada are vulnerable to closure once that funding ends: Battle Mountain General Hospital in Lander County and Humboldt General Hospital in Humboldt County.
 Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP)

Nevada could be required to cover millions in costs currently footed by the federal government under the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, better known as SNAP.
Until now, the federal government has paid for all benefits and half of the administrative costs for the nutrition program. Starting in 2028, states will be required to pay 75% of administrative costs, and potentially up to 15% of the program’s costs as a penalty for miscalculating payments.
Under those cuts, Nevada could lose between $70 million to $170 million in federal funding annually.
States with an error rate of less than 6% would not be penalized. Nevada’s error rate was 5.94% in fiscal year 2024, meaning if the state slips slightly, it could be on the hook for 15% of program costs.
Last week, the county’s 23 Democratic governors warned their states would not be able to fully fund SNAP if the federal government shifted costs to states.
Republican state leaders have largely been silent on the issue. But Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, recently vetoed a budget measure to fund the Summer EBT Program, which covers low-income children during summer break, citing the “significant uncertainty regarding federal matching rates for this and other similar programs.”
The GOP-backed megabill also raises the work requirement by ten years, to age 64, and ends the exemption for adults with dependent children. Under the bill, parents with children older than 14 are subject to the work requirement.
Some lawfully present immigrants, including asylees and refugees, will also be stripped from eligibility under the bill. 
All together, as many as 265,000 Nevadans are at risk of losing some or all of their SNAP benefits under the bill, according to D.C.-based think tank the Urban Institute.
 No tax on tips

‘Big Beautiful Bill’ mostly benefits Nevada’s wealthiest

The bill also incorporates Trump’s “no tax on tips” promise, which he first made during a campaign rally in June 2024 in Las Vegas. The bill allows tipped workers, like bartenders, to deduct the amount of their tips from their taxable income, up to $25,000.
The provision expires after 2028.
Politicians from both sides of the aisle quickly got the populist idea of “no tax on tips.” That group included Sen. Jacky Rosen, who sponsored a standalone bill with Republican Sen. Ted Cruz to exempt tipped wages, and Rep. Steven Horsford, who proposed an amendment to make the “no tax on tips” deduction permanent rather.
The Tax Policy Center estimates that 60% of households with tipped workers – about 2% of all households nationwide – would benefit from the tax cut. They also estimate those benefits would be modest: about $1,800 a year, or $35 a week.
 Gambling losses

In addition to broader objections to the bill, U.S. Reps. Dina Titus and Steven Horsford both publicly criticized a minor provision in the bill that limits declarable losses for gamblers.
“Republicans quietly snuck a provision into their big ugly bill that hits Nevada’s gaming industry hard,” Horsford posted on social media. “Break even at the casino? You still owe the IRS. It is a direct hit to our economy and the workers who power it.”
Horsford on Thursday vowed to introduce legislation “to stop this before it hurts NV jobs.”
 Environment

The bill eliminates the Residential Clean Energy Credit, which is currently set at 30% of the cost of a new rooftop solar system and installation. The credits were slated to fall to 26% in 2033. Instead, the credit will expire on Dec. 31, 2025.
Clean energy advocates fear the solar rooftop industry will suffer as a result. 
According to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Nevadans claimed more than $137 million in credits for investments in residential electricity generation on their 2024 tax returns.
Nevada will also see less revenue from oil and gas companies leasing and developing public lands in the state after the bill rolled back several reforms passed under the Inflation Reduction Act.
Half of all revenue from royalty rates goes to the state where federal land is being leased for oil and gas drilling, helping fund state programs. Under the bill, those rates were reduced from nearly 17% to about 13%, costing Nevada additional revenue that could be invested back into the state.
Nevada Wildlife Federation Executive Director Russell Kuhlman in a statement called the drafters of those provisions “tone deaf.”
“As Nevada’s habitat and wildlife continues to decline across our state, the current administration seems willing to bend over backwards to help industry profit from our public lands before they prioritize providing clean air, water and access for all public land users,” he added.
 Immigration

How the megabill allows Trump to expand mass deportations, curb immigrant benefits

The bill allocates $175 billion to immigration enforcement over several years, in alignment with Trump’s campaign pledge to carry out mass deportations. For perspective, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement 2024 budget was $9.6 billion, according to the American Immigration Council.
The increased funding includes $45 billion to construct detention centers, $59 billion to Customs and Border Protection, nearly $6.2 billion for border technology and surveillance, and $450 million to aid state and local cooperation with immigration enforcement.
The Nevada Immigrant Coalition in a statement prior to the final passage noted the bill makes “ICE the highest-funded federal law enforcement agency in the history of the United States, even bigger than the FBI and with a larger budget for detention than the entire Federal Bureau of Prisons.”
Their statement continued, “Funding to feed hungry children and seniors is being cut, while increased for the separation of working families. This budget is not just numbers on a page, it’s a roadmap for cruelty.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2221730619-1024x675.jpg,,,2025-07-04 07:06:14.411317

Getty ImagesOn this day 249 years ago –  July 4, 1776 – the 2nd Continental Congress approved the final draft of the Declaration of Independence , as a burgeoning nation sought to establish itself free from tyrannical one-man rule. 
And while most of the delegates didn’t actually sign the Declaration until Aug. 2, 1776, we celebrate the Fourth of July as the birth of our nation largely because that was the date that begins the document. 
Whatever the date, its essential truth remains worthy of reminding ourselves about today, namely the absolute (“inalienable”) right of any people to self-governance, and further, that the government they choose must derive its power from the consent of the governed. 
What many of us now take for granted was a radical notion in 1776, and frankly, remains so today.
So take a few moments today to read the text of that document and perhaps rekindle an appreciation for the fragility of the freedoms we enjoy.
——————-
In Congress, July 4, 1776
The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.–That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, –That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.–Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.

He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.
He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.
He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.
He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.
He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.
He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.
He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.
He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.
He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.
He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.
He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.
He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.
He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:
For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:
For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:
For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:
For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:
For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:
For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:
For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:
For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:
For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.
He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.
He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.
He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.
He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.
He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.

In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.
Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.
We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do.

“Overpriced apartment complexes” such as the proposed project can be particularly detrimental when there is a real need for affordable housing, said Kitty Cameron at the June 27 City Council meeting.

Neighbors who have long opposed a proposed housing project adjacent to the 110-acre Wheeler Nature Park in South Burlington are now appealing to the city’s elected board.
After their latest arguments opposing a 32-unit mixed housing project were dismissed by the Vermont Supreme Court last month, more than 290 residents have signed a petition calling on the City Council to buy back the 7-acre parcel or encourage landowner JAM Golf, LLC, to donate it back to the city.
The council has not discussed the project since the parcel at the intersection of Dorset Street and Park Road was created as part of a settlement with JAM Golf in 2015, according to James Marc Leas, an appellant and neighbor who has fought against development there.

“But now things have really changed in South Burlington because there wasn’t even a glimmer of thought that we would fill up CityCenter. … It was just a dirt road then,” he said, arguing the project would be better situated farther away from the nature park that has the “last remaining views of the Green Mountains from anywhere along Dorset Street in South Burlington.”
The project aims to build a mix of duplexes, single-story carriage homes and two-story single-family homes with roadway and utility access on the undeveloped 6.9-acre parcel, Benjamin Avery, president of construction and development at BlackRock Construction LLC, said at the time. 
BlackRock Construction won development review board approval to build on the land in 2021 and cleared the state’s Act 250 permit in 2022, but the state permit was soon appealed by a group of 125 neighbors and the Neighbors Committee to Stop Neighborhood Blasting. 
It has been tied up in environmental court since, with more than 26 competing motions entered and ruled upon by the court. Last month, the Vermont Supreme Court ruled in favor of the developer.

The petition filed by residents last week claims the proposed development will destroy the wide trail, obscure the last remaining views of the hills, endanger park wildlife, and, most notably, lead to disruptive drilling and blasting of the rock ledge.
“JAM Golf is a private company and should not be allowed to develop on preserved Nature Park Land for such destructive private purposes. It is morally wrong for it to do so, and it sets a dangerous precedent for all developers who see green spaces as potential sources of private income that can be taken from the public,” the petition stated.
The developer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The city acquired the 110-acre nature park in 1992. It consists of mixed forest, grasslands, shrublands, wetlands, about 2 miles of walking trails, a tree nursery and a 14-acre Wheeler Homestead area that includes community garden plots for rent. City planning documents have referred to it as “the green lungs of the City Center.”

The Wheeler parcel at 550 Park Road was created in 2017 as part of a settlement agreement between the city and James McDonald, who still owns the property through a limited liability corporation called JAM Golf. It is one of several developments approved in the original master plan for the Vermont National Country Club and golf course over 434 acres.
“Overpriced apartment complexes,” such as the proposed, can be particularly detrimental where there is a real need for affordable housing, said Kitty Cameron, one of a handful of residents who shared her views at the June 27 City Council meeting.
She said the impact would be devastating to the beauty and wildlife of the adjoining park that she and her partner visit daily. She is also concerned about how construction runoff could affect the fragile ecosystem there.
“There’s just so much to treasure in that space,” she said, urging the council to take a pause and really assess the long-term impact of the project.
Jeanne Zagursky, who presented the petition, said residents want to avoid creating a precedent of cutting up and developing portions of a nature park that’s supposed to be preserved in perpetuity.
The council accepted the petition last week and is considering an executive session July 7 “for the purposes of discussing the negotiation or securing of real estate purchase or lease options, and specifically the JAM Golf parcel,” according to the posted agenda.
With approvals in place for 550 Park Road, the property owner is now free to seek a zoning permit for site work, such as building the road and then building the homes, according to Paul Connor, director of planning and zoning for the city.
“We’ve not received any of those yet, so I don’t have a timeline,” he said. “But they could come whenever they’re ready.”
As City Center grows so does the need for this parkland to be preserved, said Leas, who likened the spot to New York City’s Central Park.
“Hundreds of residents think it’s worth a try,” he wrote in an email.

A lawsuit was filed against a Brattleboro police detective alleging he filed the wrong date of birth in a warrant, leading to the arrest and imprisonment of an innocent pregnant woman.

A federal lawsuit filed on Sunday alleges that a mistake in a warrant caused the unconstitutional arrest of a pregnant Vermont woman who shared the same name as the suspect in a case involving a death from heroin overdose.
Court documents allege that on July 13, 2022, Alicia Kelley, the plaintiff in the case, was arrested at her home in front of her children and parents by Orleans County Sheriff Jennifer Harlow and a deputy, based on a warrant incorrectly filed by the defendant, Brattleboro Det. Lt. Greg Eaton.
Kelley “became distraught, panicked, and was brought to tears,” according to the lawsuit filed by her attorney, Brian Marsicovetere, in the U.S. District Court of Vermont on June 30. “Her parents and children were home and observed the arrest,” becoming “very upset.” 
Kelley was then held overnight in Northern State Correctional Facility in Newport, Vermont on a $25,000 bond. The Orleans County Sheriff’s department then “posted a statement containing the details of the arrest on social media, which was viewed by members of (Kelley’s) community,” according to the lawsuit.The circumstances leading to Kelley’s arrest began over four years earlier. 
On June 8, 2018, Brianna Radcliffe, 21, overdosed on heroin in the bathroom of a Dunkin’ Donuts in Brattleboro, dying a few days later in the hospital. 
Following Radcliffe’s death, Detective Greg Eaton began investigating the circumstances of her overdose. With the manager of the Dunkin’, Eaton reviewed the surveillance tapes of the heroin deal that would end Radcliffe’s life. According to court filing, the manager recognized the dealer in the footage as a former employee of his: Alicia Kelley.
On May 20, 2019, almost a year after Radcliffe’s death, Eaton applied for a warrant, charging Kelley with selling narcotics that resulted in death. 
But according to the lawsuit, Eaton allegedly identified the wrong Kelley in the warrant.
Court documents reveal that while the women share the same full name — Alicia Kelley — the two were born about half a year apart in 1988. The date of birth of the plaintiff is in the fall while the date of birth of the former Dunkin’ employee who allegedly sold the heroin is in the spring. 
When the Vermont Superior Court issued the warrant, plaintiff Kelley’s birth date was written on it, despite never having met Brianna Radcliffe, according to the complaint. 
In the complaint, her lawyer, Marsicovetere, alleges Eaton had access to information that would have clearly differentiated the women.
“No attempt was made to compare physical attributes based on Vermont DMV or other available state databases. The Defendant did not take any steps to confirm he correctly identified Alicia M. Kelley in the arrest warrant application,” court documents read.
Eaton, who is being represented by McNeil, Leddy & Sheahan, P.C. of Burlington, declined to comment on the allegations in the lawsuit.
At her arraignment, plaintiff Kelley pleaded not guilty. The judge reduced her bail to $10,000, which her parents paid with the help of a bondsman, according to the complaint. 
According to court documents, after the State of Vermont learned that the warrant contained the wrong birth date, the state “filed a motion in the Vermont Superior Court to vacate all of Plaintiff’s bail conditions,” and amended the warrant to contain the birth date for the Kelley who is actually suspected of plying Radcliffe with the fatal heroin dose. 
Plaintiff Kelley’s case against Eaton accuses him of unlawful seizure under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. She is seeking compensatory and punitive damages, as well as attorney’s fees.

RUTLAND — On Friday afternoon, a woman in a red sedan waved and honked her horn as she pulled up to a stoplight in front of city hall, exciting a woman who held a sign reading “Honk 4 Kim.” The people gathered there were supporters of Kim Peters — and they were still making noise three months after the mayor put the longtime director of the city’s rec department on paid leave. 
Alaura McClallen, organizer of the group, recognized the driver as a fellow parent. She, like McClallen, sent her kids to a summer camp run by the recreation department. When the light turned green, other drivers sounded their horns, some pumping their fists out the window. 
It was the second demonstration of the week for the small group, and the most recent event in a long saga of controversy over the ousting of Kim Peters. 
After Rutland Mayor Mike Doenges’s reelection, he announced that he would not reappoint Peters as the city’s recreation superintendent this year, prompting a public outcry and confusion that has lasted for months.
In private, Doenges explained his decision to the city’s Board of Aldermen with claims that Peters didn’t do proper background checks of recreation department volunteers and employees, according to public records obtained by VTDigger. But Doenges hasn’t been forthcoming about that reason publicly. 
His statements to residents broadly cite his lack of trust in Peters, leaving many skeptical that he has a legitimate reason for forcing her out of the position. Now she remains on paid leave until the role is filled. 
With public disapproval simmering since March, the city’s Board of Aldermen recently sidestepped Doenges and voted to reappoint Peters on June 16. But soon after the city attorney said the vote was invalid — and officials are not on the same page about what happens next.

Background Checks
Back in January, the Rutland Herald published a story that revealed two volunteers for the rec department have criminal records. In the article, Peters said she conducts background checks on all employees and volunteers in the department, but admitted she was unaware of one criminal charge before being informed by the newspaper. 
Doenges sent a letter to Peters on March 18 stating she was “placed on administrative leave effective immediately,” according to public records obtained by VTDigger. She would be barred from city buildings and unable to discuss her leave, but would remain on the city’s payroll until the position was permanently filled, records show.
Members of the Board of Aldermen were notified of her leave that day but not offered any explanation, according to city emails obtained by VTDigger. Many board members said they were struck by the decision and caught off guard. Shortly after, Doenges appointed April Cioffi as acting superintendent of the city’s recreation department. 
“This has been a very difficult time for Kim Peters,” said Larry Cupoli, a member of the Board of Aldermen and part of the search committee to fill Peters’ role. “Frankly, she’s probably the best thing that’s ever happened to the city,” he added.
Peters declined to comment. 
Doenges also declined to comment on his interactions with Peters. He said city attorney Megan LaChance advised him not to speak publicly about personnel matters. 
“There was a trust relationship that was broken between myself and the superintendent,” Doenges said in an interview. 
But in a March executive session, a meeting closed to the public, Doenges explained his reasoning to board members. He wrote a speech for that meeting in which, public records show, he alleged Peters lied about the department’s practice of running background checks. Doenges read the speech to board members, he said. 
“I was directly and intentionally deceived,” wrote Doenges in bold, with “deceived” underlined. 
In that written speech, Doenges said that after reading the Rutland Herald article in January, he dug into the city’s records and found out Peters hadn’t been doing proper background checks. Doenges claims Peters lied both to the newspaper and to him a number of times, then tried to cover it up afterward. 
“That’s not following procedure — that’s scrambling to fix the appearance of one,” Doenges wrote. 
“Imagine your child is coached by someone who seems perfectly fine. But we, as a city, skipped a critical step; and didn’t run a proper background check. // That coach hurts your child. And then you find out it could have been prevented,” he wrote later on. 
The city is an institution that must keep children safe — and without background checks, children are at risk, Doenges said. In his speech, Doenges cited the oversight lapses of the Boy Scouts and the Catholic Church, both institutions notorious for sexual abuse claims. 
VTDigger asked Doenges why he drew connections between those institutions and Rutland City. “It’s not based on anything,” Doenges said. The city is a trusted organization and officials have to “do our part at all times to make sure that we are taking care of the citizens that are in our care,” he said. 
In his written speech, Doenges said he refuses to be someone who looks the other way when child safety is neglected. “I imagined the worst-case scenarios — because that’s what the job requires,” Doenges wrote in his speech.
‘It still did not make any sense’ 
Even after Doenges’ explanation, many city officials said they couldn’t get behind his decision. 
“Some of us — most of us — didn’t buy it,” said Sharon Davis, who also sits on the Board of Aldermen, in a recent interview. “It still did not make any sense knowing Kim and the reputation she had.” 
On April 8, Peters reached out to Doenges and formally asked to be reappointed to her position, public records show. Then, on April 11, Peters emailed the city attorney to ask if she could communicate with city officials and recreation department employees — LaChance, the attorney, sent her a cease-and-desist letter, records show. 
That same day, Doenges published an op-ed in the Rutland Herald, stating that he didn’t reappoint Peters because he lacked trust in her. The op-ed never mentioned a specific concern related to background checks. 
McClallen, who organized the recent city hall demonstrations, thinks the whole dispute between Doenges and Peters feels personal. “It makes me sad,” she said.
“I never ever mistrusted her,” even after hearing Doenges’ concerns about background checks, McClallen said.
If McClallen had known Doenges wasn’t going to reappoint Peters, she said, she wouldn’t have voted for him. Dozens of other people have emailed city officials in the last few months urging them to reappoint Peters, according to public records obtained by VTDigger. 
In emails, some residents complain Doenges wasn’t more transparent with residents. Doenges thinks people are upset because they don’t have all the information about the situation, and advice from legal counsel has stopped him from sharing more, he said. 
A contested vote
Near the end of a June 16 Board of Aldermen meeting, member Paul Clifford made a motion to reappoint Kim Peters as recreation superintendent. He cited a section of the city charter that allows the board to make an appointment if the mayor doesn’t within 90 days. 
The council unanimously voted to suspend the rules to allow the motion, since it wasn’t on the agenda. After taking a short recess to review voting rules and talk to LaChance, the city’s attorney, the board members voted 7-3 in favor of reappointing Peters. Board President David Allaire was the last member to vote, casting his in favor of Peters’ reappointment. 
Doenges said that after the vote he called Peters and offered her the position. Then on June 18 LaChance sent board members a memo outlining a number of missteps in the voting procedure. 
Two of those missteps made the vote invalid, LaChance wrote. 
As board president, Allaire should’ve made the motion for reappointment and “since the nomination was not properly made, the vote is invalid,” LaChance wrote. The president also should not have voted, and “the vote was invalid because President Allaire could not vote on the motion,” she wrote. 
After receiving the memo from LaChance, Doenges called Peters and revoked the job offer, he said. 
Now some board members think the vote still stands. 
“The mayor can accept the fact that Kim Peters has been reappointed by seven members of the Board of Aldermen and move on,” said Davis, who voted to reappoint Peters. Otherwise, the mayor will have to take legal action, she said. 
Doenges said he was unsure what taking legal action might look like. “I’m proceeding as if the vote was invalid because that’s what my legal counsel has told us,” he said. 
Others have accepted LaChance’s legal interpretation and plan on working with Doenges to move forward. It would be possible for the Board of Aldermen to vote on the matter again, but some members think that move is unlikely.
The search committee to find a new superintendent is still active and ongoing, Doenges said. Clifford told VTDigger he decided to step down from the committee given all the fallout. 
Some have gotten sick of the controversy. “It’s not good for Rutland,” said Michael Talbott, a member of the Board of Aldermen who voted against Peters’ reappointment. 
City emails obtained by VTDigger show employees scrambling within the recreation department to fill Peters’ shoes, struggling with logistics and to find needed resources without contacting Kim. 
McClallen said that while she doesn’t like to be political, she thinks the majority of the town still supports Peters. 
The recreation department “needs a leader,” said McClallen that Friday in June in front of City Hall. 
“The only person equipped is Kim,” she said.

“I carry my child self around with me all the time,” Peterson said at talk at Montpelier's Kellogg-Hubbard Library in March. “A lot of people don’t remember how intensely they felt as children.”

This story by Tom Mckone was first published in The Bridge on June 18.
Katherine Paterson is sitting in her Montpelier living room, doing what she does best — telling stories. Unlike the fiction she writes for children and young people, she recalls a true story about a furious woman who confronted her at a meeting. 
“These books are not for children,” the woman said. “They’re too intense.”
But intensity and her refusal to write down to children are two qualities that have made Paterson a great writer. She has published more than 40 books, and she’s won even more awards than that, including two National Book Awards and two Newberry Medals. The Library of Congress named her a living legend, and she is one of only six Americans who have won the Hans Christian Andersen Award, the highest international recognition given to an author or illustrator of children’s books.
In awarding Paterson the Children’s Literature Legacy Award, and in citing “Bridge to Terabithia” in particular, the American Library Association said, “Paterson’s unflinching yet redemptive treatment of tragedy and loss helped pave the way for ever more realistic writing for young people.”
“I received a letter from a teacher who enclosed the book report of ‘the bad boy’ in her class, who had read ‘The Great Gilly Hopkins,’” Paterson says. “He said, ‘This book is a miracle.’ Miss Paterson knows exactly how children feel.”
“I carry my child self around with me all the time,” she says. “A lot of people don’t remember how intensely they felt as children.”

Asked about her favorite Paterson book, Jane Knight, children’s book buyer at Bear Pond Books, selected the same book that the challenging student wrote about.
“Gilly was the first character in whom I could recognize myself — both my inner and outer selves,” Knight said, “someone who could be mean and crabby and full of great sorrow and longing, and also someone who could grow and change. Gilly gave me the agency and permission to be a whole human, warts and all.”
“The Day of the Pelican” and “Bread and Roses, Too,” are past Vermont Humanities Vermont Reads selections, and “Lyddie” and “Jacob Have I Loved” are perpetual favorites. However, the most popular remains, hands-down, “Bridge to Terabithia,” Paterson’s 1977 novel about two best friends, the imaginary world they create, and the tragedy one of them has to deal with.
The book has been translated into more than 25 languages, and the publishers have lost track of how many copies have been sold; Paterson says it’s “in the millions.” A 50th anniversary special edition is scheduled to come out in 2027.
During a talk at the Kellogg-Hubbard Library in March, Paterson shared how the death of her son’s friend, who was killed by lightning, sparked the story.
“I was supposed to explain to my kid why his best friend had died,” she said. “I couldn’t explain it to myself — how such a terrible tragedy could happen to this bright, funny child. But I know a story has to make sense. I began to write this story to try to make sense out of something that made no sense to me.”

From China to Japan, and eventually to Vermont
Paterson’s parents — George Raymond Womeldorf and Mary Elizabeth (Goetchius) Womeldorf — were missionaries in China, and that’s where she was born, in 1932. Living in China for most of her first 8 ½ years and growing up bilingual, she was reading in English by the time she was four. She went to two seminaries and did missionary work in Japan. 
During a stretch back in the United States, she met her future husband, John Paterson, a minister. Years later he would take a position at a Barre church, and in 1986 they would become Vermonters. After his death in 2013, Paterson moved from the large house they had needed while raising their four children into a smaller place in Montpelier.
Paterson’s Christian faith has always been important to her and to her writing.
“If you’re a person of faith, it’s going to come out in your books somehow or other,” she says during our conversation in her living room. “You don’t put it in. It’s who you are that comes out on the page.”
For many years, “Bridge to Terabithia” was one of the most-often banned books. Those challenging the book objected to Paterson’s treatment of death, religion, and fantasy. Some said the portrayal of some religious families was disrespectful and that the use of the word, “lord,” outside of prayer was sacrilegious. She was accused of promoting secular humanism and atheism.
“People who banned my books were all my Christian brothers and sisters,” she says. “The problem is that they think what I should be doing is writing propaganda, and not a story. Stories are open-ended and there for the reader to interpret if there’s a lesson.”
She says banning her books is no longer a priority, since she is “straight and white,” and book banners now focus on people of color and the LGBTQ+ community.

Life experiences inspire stories
During our interview, she shares many stories, like how seeing a black-and-white photograph on the wall at the Old Labor Hall in Barre led to “Bread and Roses, Too,” the story of the 1912 Bread and Roses strike in Lawrence, Massachusetts, during which children were sent out of harm’s way to temporarily live with foster families in Barre.
She says that “Jacob Have I Loved,” which she wrote at a very difficult time in her life, is the book she is most proud of. She wrote it while her mother was dying, her husband was busy with a new job, and their four children were unhappy about a family move. They lived in a small house, so her writing space was an enclosed front porch which was “freezing in winter and boiling in summer.”
While she is grateful for the “richness” of having had loving parents, when she was growing up, she experienced “what it feels like to not have enough money to do the things many people around me were doing.”
Never speechless
At the beginning of Paterson’s memoir, “Stories of My Life,” her fellow writer and longtime friend Nancy Price Graff (who is also a regular columnist for The Bridge) wrote an introduction in which she tells how for many years she and Paterson had weekly lunches at the Wayside on the Barre-Montpelier Road.
“Over the course of our friendship,” she writes, “I have seen Katherine whoop with laughter and I have seen her cry. I have seen her playful, sad, wistful, tired, thoughtful, and most often hopeful and happy, which seems to be her natural disposition. But I have never seen her speechless. Every week there are more stories.”
During Paterson’s talk at the library, she said, “Writers now are much more in touch with children’s feelings, and much more appreciative of the intelligence of children.” What she didn’t mention is that worldwide, she is credited as one of the writers who made that happen.

In Congress, July 4, 1776
The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.
He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.
He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.
He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.
He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.
He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.
He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.
He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.
He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.
He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.
He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.
He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.
He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.
He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:
For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:
For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:
For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:
For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:
For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:
For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences
For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:
For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:
For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.
He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.
He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.
He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.
He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.
He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.
In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.
Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.
We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.

About 30 years ago the industry-spawned strategy of “collaboration” entered the policy arena to influence and neuter the “conservation movement” that was dedicated to protecting the rapidly disappearing old growth forests, native species, wild landscapes, and pristine, trout-filled rivers. 
The logging industry had already lost the so-called “timber wars,” having cut themselves out of a sustainable future.  Likewise, the environmental abuses by extractive industries had left Montana with an inordinate number of clearcuts, Superfund sites (including the largest in the nation), abandoned industrial facilities and mines leaking toxins such as cyanide, that required treatment in perpetuity. 
Industry strategists are anything but dumb.  They knew they were losing public support due to their track record of environmental destruction. So they came up with “collaboration,” where extractive industries would find “consensus” with conservationists — virtually guaranteeing they’d get at least half of what they wanted, if not more.  In Montana, that strategy was first implemented by Gov. Marc Racicot’s hand-picked “Consensus Council.”
Formerly, conservation groups had lauded their “grassroots” nature, since members were their primary source of funding.  But that changed as these groups began to receive millions of dollars from foundations that were more inclined to fund collaborators than hard-fighting conservation advocates.
As vast sums of foundation funding flowed into Montana, formerly small organizations like the Montana Wilderness Association bought multi-million dollar buildings and, rather ironically, as their staff size and “assets” exploded, their actual conservation victories dwindled.
They were joined by The Nature Conservancy, The Wilderness Society, Greater Yellowstone Coalition, Trout Unlimited, Sierra Club, Mountain Mamas, Backcountry Hunters and Anglers, and many others that adopted a “go along to get along” attitude with extractive industries, government land and water management agencies, and special interests as they collaborated to cut the dwindling conservation baby in half again and again and again while hiding behind the charade of supporting “access.”  
They refused to criticize Sen. Jon Tester for tossing science aside to set the horrific precedent of Congressionally delisting wolves from the Endangered Species Act protections using a rider on a defense spending bill.  Why?  Because he was running for re-election. 
As electoral politics crept in to influence dubious policy changes they supported expanding categorical exclusions from bedrock environmental laws that require government agencies to consider the consequences of their proposed actions — and significantly, to provide the public with the right to review, comment and object to those proposals.
They supported vast “landscape scale” deforestation proposals under highly ambiguous “emergency” declarations.  They lauded the “Good Neighbor Policy,” which allows state governments to determine the management of federal lands.  That resulted in Montana’s Gov. Steve Bullock, perhaps seeking votes for his Senate campaign, to declare a stunning five million acres of national forests needed emergency logging, thinning and burning.
But now, those appeasement chickens are coming home to roost. 
Last week, it was the repeal of the Roadless Rule that protected roadless lands.  This week, the Department of Agriculture issued new regulations that eliminate public notice before using vastly expanded categorical exclusions, eliminate public comments on environmental assessments and Forest Plan revisions while dumping the requirement to publish draft Environmental Impact Statements for public review and allowing the Forest Service to choose which regulations it wants to use for on-going projects.
As the disastrous policies of the national and state administrations escalate, the collaborators are now trapped in a losing web of their own weaving.  After all, they still have to maintain those expensive buildings and pay those bloated staffs.  To do so they continue to suckle greedily at the foundations’ collaboration teats — all while facetiously claiming they’re “fighting” for conservation of our last wild lands and waters.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Helena-logging-pic.jpg,,,2025-07-04 07:06:14.411317

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma City leaders said they’re gearing up for and are excited about the expected economic boost to their businesses that the 2028 Olympics will bring to the region.
While Los Angeles was selected to host the 2028 Olympic games, their organizing committee tapped Oklahoma City to host seven medal events, including kayaking, canoe slalom and women’s softball.
Softball will be played at Devon Park, a state-of-the art complex featuring four fields in northeast Oklahoma City. The watersports will be held at Riversport Rapids in downtown Oklahoma City, an area that can manufacture its own rapids and currently serves as a U.S. Olympic and Paralympic training site.
Business leaders across the area expect the Olympic events will bring tourists from across the globe to the city, which will be a boon for their economic fortunes.
“I think there is a great possibility for the increase of business during the games with athletes and fans coming to OKC, we will definitely monitor the trends and prepare for an increase in business during this time, especially for our locations closer to downtown OKC,” said Randy Newberry, a general manager with A Good Egg Dining Group. Good Egg oversees restaurants such as Red PrimeSteak, Mexican Radio and Tucker’s Onion Burgers.
Keith Paul, A Good Egg Dining Group’s chief executive officer, said the games will be a chance to showcase not only the Olympic venues, but also the diversity of the area’s food culture.
“I think the games coming to OKC will be a great chance for our city and state to showcase to the world that we not only have world class facilities to host these events but we also have a great city with great people,” Paul said.
Michael Byrnes is leading the Greater Oklahoma City Chamber’s efforts to stage the events the city has been chosen to host.
“With the Los Angeles ’28 Olympic Games on the horizon, we expect Oklahoma City to welcome a significant number of visitors, which will create a positive economic impact for our community,” he said. “We anticipate a significant impact within the hospitality sector.”
He said the events will have “a long-lasting impact on our reputation for hosting world-class sports events and show people from across the globe how we invest in our community.”
Lincoln Park Golf Course neighbors Devon Park. While golf may not be a part of the events, officials expect their two courses could serve as an activity during downtime between games.
“We will try to be very open and welcoming to out of town guests,” said Aaron Kristopeit, the course’s golf director. “I guess make sure everything is done with our best foot forward, and the best curb appeal considering we are facing Devon Park.”

Blake Jackson, a guide and co-owner of Casper’s Ugly Bug Fly Shop, ties a carp-slaying pattern.
The post The art of the fly: Angler relishes the meditation and creation of tying appeared first on WyoFile .","Fish love bugs and small aquatic critters. 
Anglers like Blake Jackson love to trick them.
It’s not just the exhilarating strike and tugs, or landing the big one. It’s not just being away, on the water, stalking the seam. There’s another side of the equation.
Back home, or at work — the Ugly Bug Fly Shop and Crazy Rainbow Fly Fishing in downtown Casper — is a time to conspire. To be creative.
Jackson sits at a desk with a small vise and considers which bugs are hatching on the nearby North Platte. Midges in the morning. Pale morning duns until about 2 p.m., yellow sallies in the afternoon, caddis in the evenings. “It’s like a clock on the dial,” he says.
But Jackson doesn’t have North Platte trout on his mind today. He’s hankering to wrestle with a carp. The reservoirs south of town are full of ’em: hulking, prehistoric-looking things with large scales and a protruded mouth sprouting fleshy whiskers. Some regard carp as a “trash fish,” Jackson laments. “But when you’re catch-and-release fishing anyway, to catch a 20-pound fish on a fly rod is a riot. It’s pretty addictive.”
Carp love this hodge-podge version of a crawdad, according to angler Blake Jackson. (Dustin Bleizeffer/WyoFile)
He clamps a stout, size-8 hook in the vise and wraps the shank with dark thread. Next, he attaches black bead-chain eyes at the top to ensure the fly rides with the hook pointed up.
It’s the beginning of a hodge-podge sort of crawdad pattern. A custom creation Jackson has been perfecting. It shares the characteristics of a damselfly and dragonfly larva. “It looks enough like a lot of different food items, and they just eat it.”
He hasn’t picked a name for it yet.
He clips a tuft of black marabou, attaches it with a few wraps and trims it to just the right length. Jackson works with precision, cinching the materials with a half-hitch knot, grooming the marabou just so. It’s a meditation. Depending on the type of fly he’s tying, his mind wanders to the place he’ll fish it. He’s standing in his flat-bottom boat, slowly drifting a favorite pocket on Pathfinder Reservoir. The surface is still, and it’s hot. Carp love the heat, he says.

Typically, the tying ritual includes country music in the background. Sometimes it’s a “stupid” podcast — some random comedian talking, “something I don’t have to follow closely.”
Rubbery legs are added next, then he wraps a peacock collar behind the head, keeping it thin “so it’s wispy with some movement.” He makes a few final knots, a few final clips. He admires his no-name creation.
Tomorrow, it hits the water.

(Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Delegates to the Second Continental Congress, meeting in Philadelphia on the Fourth of July in 1776, issued a remarkable document, proclaiming the 13 colonies in America to be free from British control. Fifty-six delegates signed a Declaration of Independence, famously stating: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness.”
Friction with Great Britain had been festering and growing for several years leading up to the split. A decade before the Declaration was signed, Benjamin Franklin had warned the Brits against using their troops to quell unrest on colonial streets. The warning apparently went in one ear of King George III and out the other, because his troops fired into a protesting crowd in Boston on March 5, 1770, killing 5 colonials. That, plus “a long train of abuses and usurpations” resulted in the repudiation of royal control.
In addition to decrying the “establishment of an absolute Tyranny” over the colonies, the Declaration specified 27 grievances against the King’s arbitrary and dictatorial rule. They included his: obstruction of laws for naturalizing foreigners, obstructing the “Administration of Justice,” making “Judges dependent on his Will alone,” cutting off colonial trade with the world, exciting domestic insurrections, “imposing Taxes on us without our Consent,” and making the military superior to the “Civil Power.”
After winning our war for independence, the former colonies adopted a Constitution and Bill of Rights to prevent the dictatorial rule they had suffered under the king. First and foremost, all government power was to be based on the consent of the people. That power would be divided among three branches, with checks and balances to prevent an accumulation of power. Congress would write the laws, the president would carry them out and the Supreme Court would act as an even-handed umpire. We were to have “a government of laws, not of men,” as Founding Father John Adams put it.
Some of the substantial powers granted to Congress were specifically intended to limit the arbitrary actions identified in the 27 grievances of the Declaration. Congress, not the president, would have the power to control the nation’s purse strings, to set taxes and tariffs, to regulate foreign and domestic commerce, to organize a militia and set rules for utilizing it, to provide for our national defense, to declare war, and to enact a wide variety of laws “necessary and proper” for the “general Welfare of the United States.”
The Constitution was drafted in Philadelphia at the Constitutional Convention of 1787. As the ink on the document was drying, a woman asked Ben Franklin, “What have we got, a republic or a monarchy?” He replied, “A republic, if you can keep it.” Franklin was obviously not putting the onus on the lady, Mrs. Powel, to keep the republic. The “you” he referred to was all of us.
Franklin knew that future generations would lose this exceptional form of government if they did not work hard to keep it. It would take the same kind of unity, sacrifice and commitment that drove the Declaration signers to make the break with Great Britain. We can’t just sit on our hands and simply take advantage of our nation’s many blessings. Every citizen is obligated to contribute to the preservation of our democratic republic. 
As it is, many of us do not understand our history or what motivated our ancestors to sacrifice so much to provide us with this remarkable form of citizen-directed government. Even our current president misunderstands the purpose of the Declaration, believing it to be a “declaration of unity and love and respect,” rather than an indictment of kingly despotism. Too many members of Congress do not comprehend the tremendous power and responsibility they possess to provide for the common good of all Americans. Either that, or they simply refuse to fulfill their constitutional obligation to faithfully serve the public. Too many Americans fail to keep informed on public affairs. Too few citizens vote. Few serve this great nation.
All of us should take a cue from those who signed the Declaration of Independence and pledge to do more to serve and improve our country. We can start this Fourth of July by reflecting on what each of us might do to make this a more caring and communal society and how we might enlist others, including those with whom we have political disagreements, in achieving that goal. That would renew the spirit of that first Independence Day in 1776.

In Congress, July 4, 1776
The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.–That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, –That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.–Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.
He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.
He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.
He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.
He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.
He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.

The date of the”4th” has become synonymous with the holiday, with millions of Americans often wishing each other a “Happy 4th!”But if we’re going to be 100% accurate, we should probably start wishing each other a Happy 2nd. After all, July 2nd is the true date of American independence—the moment the colonies formally broke from British rule.
On July 2, 1776, the Continental Congress took a momentous step by voting in favor of the resolution declaring the thirteen American colonies free and independent states. The vote passed without opposition, making it the legal and political moment the colonies severed ties with Britain.
John Adams, a leading advocate for independence, recognized the significance of this day. In a letter to his wife Abigail dated July 3, 1776, he wrote: “The Second Day of July 1776, will be the most memorable Epocha, in the History of America. I am apt to believe that it will be celebrated, by succeeding Generations, as the great anniversary Festival.”
Adams envisioned future celebrations filled with “Pomp and Parade… from one End of this Continent to the other.”
Although the vote for independence happened on July 2, the Continental Congress took two more days to finalize the wording of the Declaration of Independence, primarily penned by Thomas Jefferson. The official document was adopted on July 4, and that date was printed on the first copies that were distributed to the public and newspapers.
Over time, the Fourth of July became etched in public memory as the date of independence, largely because it was the day Americans first saw the finished document. It became symbolic, representing the ideals and aspirations laid out in Jefferson’s powerful prose.
So history shows us that July 2 was the action; July 4 was the announcement.
Understanding this distinction helps us appreciate the courage it took to make that vote. It wasn’t just eloquent words that birthed a nation—it was a political leap into the unknown.
While July 4 will always remain a cherished holiday, there’s growing interest in restoring July 2 to its rightful place in history. Some historians, educators, and civic leaders advocate observing July 2 as a complementary moment of reflection — one that honors the bold decision that made the Declaration possible.
In doing so, we don’t replace the Fourth — we enrich it.
The fireworks of July 4 celebrate the ideals of liberty and equality. But July 2 was when independence truly began — when courage triumphed over fear, and a group of revolutionaries voted to create a new nation. Perhaps it’s time we gave July 2 the recognition it deserves: as the true Independence Day.

((Photo courtesy of the National Archives)July 4 has, since the inception of the United States, been synonymous with the nation’s best ideals — freedom to worship as we please, freedom of the press, freedom to criticize our government — and the notion that the U.S. is a haven for people around the world seeking such freedom. The date is a symbol of the knitting together of disparate states into one cohesive unit, the day on which a group of men came together to sign the Declaration of Independence to free colonists from the tyranny of an overreaching government.
And the greatest battle of the Civil War — the three-day bloodbath at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania — concluded on July 3, one day before what many Americans consider the most sacrosanct of national holidays. The battle was a turning point in a crisis that rent the U.S. for four years and, as President Abraham Lincoln said at the dedication of a cemetery in Gettysburg, tested “whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure.”
The U.S. again finds itself being tested. Crackdowns on immigrants who come to our country to find a better life make a lie of the nation’s promises.
And so today, we publish the text of the Declaration of Independence in full as a reminder of the nation’s foundational ideals. 
In Congress, July 4, 1776
The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.–That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, –That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.–Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.
He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.
He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.
He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.
He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.
He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.
He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.
He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.
He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.
He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.
He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.
He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.
He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.
He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:
For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:
For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:
For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:
For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:
For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:
For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences
For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:
For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:
For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.
He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.
He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.
He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.
He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.
He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.
In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.
Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.
We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)Thomas Paine in “Common Sense,” which helped persuade colonists to fight for independence from the British crown, faulted King George III for qualities that are all too familiar to Americans today.
The king had been “an inveterate enemy to liberty, and discovered such a thirst for arbitrary power,” Paine wrote, adding that the king was willing to accept no laws “but such as suit his purpose.”
Within half a year of the pamphlet’s publication, Americans declared, on July 4, 1776, their independence.
Half a year into his second term, President Donald Trump has adopted a king-like style of rule. His administration regularly deprives people of their liberty with little or no cause, and it repeatedly shows disdain for laws it doesn’t like. Trump’s policies are aggressively anti-American, more aligned by far with George III’s tyranny than with any of the country’s previous administrations.
On this Fourth of July, Constitution-abiding Americans might despair over the meaning of the holiday under these circumstances. What’s to celebrate when the president is as unaccountable as a monarch and the national government holds unalienable rights in contempt?
But the idea of the country persists even as the state of the country pains. The soul of the holiday isn’t the occupant of the White House or the manner of his rule or the innumerable ways America in practice failed to live up to its promise, never more so than in its earliest days and the decades that followed. Rather it’s the timeless ideals of equality and liberty that propelled the founding and inspired people around the world. And as they stood up in recent months for the values on which July 4 is a time to reflect, Coloradans have proved themselves worthy of the holiday and exemplars of its spirit.
They have plenty to celebrate.

On the day Trump was first inaugurated in 2017, more than 100,000 people in Denver protested against his presidency during the Women’s March, a worldwide demonstration for “human rights and equality,” and such acts of resistance to fascist encroachment have only expanded in Colorado since Trump’s second inauguration.
Coloradans have turned out in the streets time and again, at scale, to protest administration abuses. Enormous crowds appeared in Denver and elsewhere in the state on President’s Day, twice in April, in early June, and again in June as part of the nationwide No Kings movement, which saw thousands of protesters march even in Republican-leaning Mesa County.
Protesters who decry the lawless mass deportation activities of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have held a weekly vigil at the ICE detention center in Aurora, where the administration has detained, among many others, Denver immigration rights activist Jeanette Vizguerra.
When in March U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York appeared in Greeley and Denver as part of their “Fighting Oligarchy” tour, they drew capacity crowds. The turnout in Denver was estimated at 34,000 people.
“In the hundreds of rallies that I have done, we have never, ever had a rally as large as this,” Sanders told Coloradans. “And Denver, your presence here today is not just significant for Colorado. You are sending a profound message all over the world. The whole world is watching, and they want to know if the people of America are going to stand up to Trumpism, oligarchy and authoritarianism.”
That message, that the fight against authoritarianism matters beyond state or national borders and can stir the political will of liberty-seeking people anywhere they live, is central to the idea of America. The American cause of the 1770s inspired French revolutionaries only a decade later and has been a model for anti-autocracy mobilization ever since. 
“The sun never shined on a cause of greater worth,” Paine wrote in 1776. “‘Tis not the concern of a day, a year, or an age; posterity are virtually involved in the contest, and will be more or less affected, even to the end of time, by the proceedings now.”
The Fourth of July is an occasion for Coloradans to observe that they are still involved in the contest, still affected, as Paine foresaw, and that the worth of the cause could not be greater.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Every item held by the Historical Society of North Dakota for display at the state Heritage Center has a story, including hundreds of flags that historians and conservators go to great lengths to protect.
“You can get a huge sense of pride from flags and they symbolize what you believe, but also symbolize what organizations you are a part of,” said Lori Nohner, research historian for the State Historical Society of North Dakota. “You can learn a lot from the histories of flags.”
Nohner said the Historical Society has about 340 flags in the collection, which includes about 150 military flags and pennants from different service units with North Dakota ties. 
Sen. Dick Dever, R-Bismarck, commander of the Bismarck-area AMVETS, said the beginning of the Pledge of Allegiance is to the flag, but also to the republic “for which it stands.”
“It’s not just a piece of cloth. It represents our whole country,” Dever said. “I didn’t serve in battle so I have indicated that I have served on the shoulders of heroes. And the guys that did serve, that flag is everything to them, as it is to me because of them.”
One flag in the museum’s collection is a replica 15-star American flag that would have been similar to one flown between 1795 and 1818, Nohner said. The 15-star field represented the original 13 colonies and the newly added states to the union, Vermont and Kentucky. 
A similar flag would have been flown over a newly completed Fort Mandan for the first time on Christmas Day in 1804 and was the same type of flag that inspired Francis Scott Key to write the, “The Star Spangled Banner,” during the War of 1812 in what would become the national anthem of the United States.

Nohner said her favorite flag in the collection belonged to Sara Sand of Grand Forks who served as a nurse at Base Hospital 60 in the Meuse-Argonne sector of France during World War I. Sand left a note with the 48-star, cotton flag that said the flag was hung in her company barracks at Camp Jackson in South Carolina and her barracks in France.
“You can see her uniform up on exhibit in the Inspiration Gallery,” she said. Sand served during the war with a Bismarck-area doctor, Dr. E.P. Quain, who founded the Quain and Ramstad Clinic in 1902, Nohner said. The Bismarck clinic was considered one of the oldest medical clinics in the United States and would eventually become Sanford Medical Center.
In the 1930s, Joe Wolf of Linton wanted to make a statement about low crop prices during the Great Depression and crafted a hand-painted flag made out of 5,340 kernels of wheat. Wolf wrote a description of his crafting process on the reverse side of the flag in which he said the flag took more than 80 hours to finish.
Another flag in the Historical Society’s collection is an unofficial flag, Nohner said. The 39-star flag is known as “the flag that never flew,” and was created prior to 1889, the year North Dakota and South Dakota became states.

“Flag manufacturers believed that the Dakotas were going to come into the union as one state and they didn’t,” she said. “So it was never an official flag, but they made enough of them that they still exist today.”
The Historical Society also has a small flag from 1919 in its collection that is designed to be waved by hand with written text on the flag saying “signing of big bills.”

“The big bills they are talking about is when they created the Bank of North Dakota, the North Dakota Mill and Elevator and the state Industrial Commission,” Nohner said. “All of those Nonpartisan League institutions are still active in our state today and are now very unique to North Dakota.”
Nohner said the museum recently acquired a North Dakota state flag that was taken to space by North Dakota astronaut James Buchli in 1985.
“In our records we have a field that says, ‘Where did he use it?’ and it says, ‘Outer space,’” she said. “He gifted it to the historical society when he was inducted into the Roughrider Hall of Fame.”

Another famed flag in the museum’s collection is the decommissioning flag from the USS Gurke, a Navy destroyer in service from 1945 to 1976 that was named after a World War II medal of honor recipient and Neche-native Henry Gurke.
“They gifted the decommissioning flag to his mom and his mom gifted it to us,” Nohner said.
Another service flag in the museum’s collection was originally given to families of service members who were fighting in World War I and World War II. Nohner said families would hang these pennants in their windows with a blue star indicating someone in their family was fighting in the conflict. Those blue stars were made into gold stars, if the service member died during the war.
Nohner said the gold star pennant in their collection belonged to Mable Guy who lost her son James Guy after he died in a prisoner of war camp during World War II. Mable Guy also had a pennant with three blue stars on it to represent her three sons who fought during the war, one of her sons was former North Dakota Gov. William Guy.
Flags will be featured prominently in Independence Day parades and celebrations across North Dakota. 
Dever said the proper way to honor a passing flag is a hand salute for military veterans or placing a hand over the heart to honor the first flag in a procession. 
“I think flags start as just a physical object, but they never end that way,” Nohner said. “They always become a personal identity symbol. They are more than what they look like, they are what they mean to you.”




Tips for preserving flags
Lori Nohner said the State Historical Society of North Dakota does not restore flags at the Heritage Center, but they do preserve them to the best of their ability. 
“Our intended purpose is to keep it in good condition for hundreds and hundreds of years,” Nohner said.
She offered some guidelines for anyone wanting to preserve flags 
Climate control: Do not leave items in the sun, or nail them to a wall. Do not put the items in an attic, or a humid basement. 
“If it’s a comfortable temperature for you, it’s going to be a comfortable temperature for your historic treasures,” she said.
She also advised against vacuum-sealing. “I think you are asking for trouble when you create, kind of, a micro climate so you never know if humidity is going to get in there, and it’s going to get wet and moldy,” Nohner said. 
Folding vs. flat:  Folding flags in a ceremonial triangle can be a good way to store the flags, but with more fragile materials, such as silk, covering them with paper to keep them out of the light and laying them out flat are the best ways to care for those items.
Rolling a flag tightly around a pole is not advised, but, if rolling is necessary, Nohner suggests wrapping the flag loosely around a wider than normal tube to limit the stress on the fabric.

Article Summary

Illinois’ fiscal year 2026 budget reduced funding for programs serving homeless people by more than $14 million from the previous year.
JB Pritzker’s “Home Illinois” initiative aimed at reaching “functional zero” homelessness saw a $26.6 million cut.
That program was launched in 2022 and had previously been on a steady upward funding trend.
Advocates worry the reductions and potential federal cuts will exacerbate homelessness in Illinois, which increased 116% in 2024, according to state data.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.


The number of homeless people in Illinois is rising, but the state’s spending on homeless prevention and other housing programs is headed in the other direction.

Facing a tight budget year with constrained spending and limited natural revenue growth, the $55.1 billion fiscal year 2026 budget that took effect July 1 reduces total funding for housing programs by more than $14 million, including Pritzker’s signature initiative designed to eliminate homelessness in Illinois.

“Last year homelessness increased 116% in the state of Illinois,” Doug Kenshol, co-founder of the Illinois Shelter Alliance, told Capitol News Illinois. “To be in the midst of this crisis and then have the state cut funding was beyond disappointing.”

Discretionary spending rose by less than 1% in the FY26 budget, according to the governor’s office, despite total spending increasing by $2 billion. That minimal spending growth led lawmakers to reduce several programs.

“Is it enough? No, it isn’t … we know that homelessness is an existential crisis, and the state of Illinois takes this seriously,” Sen. Adriane Johnson, D-Buffalo Grove, who serves on a state homeless prevention task force, told Capitol News Illinois. “We have a really bold vision for ending homelessness and we’re going to continue down that path.”

Spending reductions

Pritzker first established a task force by executive order in 2021 that would create a plan for “Home Illinois” to reduce homelessness in the state to “functional zero” — where homelessness is temporary and people without housing can quickly obtain housing resources. The executive order did not set a date for the state to reach functional zero, and funding for the Home Illinois is declining by $26.6 million in FY26.

Pritzker’s administration had previously targeted housing programs for substantial increases in recent years. The FY26 budget appropriated $263.7 million for Home Illinois, down from $290.3 million in FY25. That was a $90 million increase from FY24, when the program received $200.3 million in its first year after Pritzker signed legislation in 2023 codifying the task force and Home Illinois program.

Among the decreased spending in Home Illinois is a $25 million reduction to the Court-Based Rental Assistance Program that provides financial aid to people facing evictions. Other programs saw steady or increased funding, including shelters, which rose to fund Chicago’s One System Initiative that integrates migrants into the city’s typical shelter system.

Spending on housing programs is also down overall, according to the advocacy group Housing Action Illinois. While some housing programs saw increases that offset reductions to Home Illinois, total spending on housing programs is down by $14.6 million in the FY26 budget, to $354 million. Pritzker’s proposed budget had called for a $7.6 million decrease.

“FY26 is largely a maintenance year for the state budget,” an Illinois Department of Human Services spokesperson said in a statement. “We remain as committed as ever to advancing strategies that prevent and end homelessness across Illinois.”

Johnson said the spending reduction is “temporary” and the state is still working toward long-term goals that would require more funding.

“The state is trying to do the best it can with limited resources,” Housing Action Illinois Policy Director Bob Palmer said in an interview.

Some of the avenues lawmakers used to fund programs also divert funding away from one area in favor of another, Palmer said. For example, the Affordable Housing Trust Fund is supposed to provide funding for new permanent rental housing, but money in the fund is also being used to increase funding for emergency or transitional housing.

“We were in a way glad to see that increase but also feeling conflicted because it’s taking money from another important housing resource,” Palmer said. “We had been advocating for that increase to come from general revenue funds.”

Funding for the emergency and transitional housing program increased by $7 million, a small win for advocates, but nowhere near the $40 million increase sought by the Illinois Shelter Alliance. The group wanted lawmakers to increase funding by $100 million overall for housing programs.

Palmer also worried proposed federal cuts to rental assistance programs will put additional strain on the state’s budget.

Homelessness continues to grow 

The spending reductions come as homelessness in Illinois continues to rise despite the new program.

The latest data on homelessness in Illinois from an October report by a Department of Human Services task force shows the state had 25,787 unhoused people on the night of the annual “point in time” count in January 2024 — a 116% increase from 2023.

The increase is largely driven by migrants who have been sent to Illinois by other states such as Texas. Of those without housing in January 2024, 13,891 were new arrivals. However, non-migrant homelessness is still on the rise, increasing 22% in 2024.

Homelessness is also increasing throughout the state. It’s up 207% since 2020 in Chicago, while DuPage and St. Clair counties were the only places in Illinois to see a decline over that time.

“You can argue that we can always do better, but Illinois is on the right path,” Johnson said.

Despite homelessness increasing since Home Illinois was established, Kenshol said the program is making a difference.

“They’ve created some great programs and they’ve gotten funds distributed and a lot of housing and a lot of shelter has been created, but we have to sustain that effort and we need to keep making incremental increases because we’re not there yet,” he said.

Data backs that up, according to IDHS. The Court-Based Rental Assistance Program, which received a substantial cut this year, has helped 7,500 households. And more than 18,000 people were served by Home Illinois in the first half of FY25 — 10,000 more than IDHS’ prior homelessness prevention program helped in FY22.

The problem, according to advocates and IDHS, is rapidly growing housing costs that make finding permanent housing and affording rent more unreachable for more people. A report last month from the Illinois Economic Policy Institute found Illinois needs 142,000 more housing units to meet the current demand for homes.

Finding more resources

Data in the task force’s annual report that provides a road map for Home Illinois shows service providers still need substantial resources to make a dent in homelessness. The state has more than 23,000 beds and housing units for homeless people, but needs about 27,000 more.

The task force, which includes advocates, lawmakers and top leaders in state agencies, says the problem will continue to grow if these resources aren’t addressed.

“The longer it takes to meet these targets, the more resources will be needed to reach functional zero as homelessness is a dynamic systems problem, or, in other words, annual unmet need for shelter and housing can be expected to increase each year that the need is unmet,” the report said.

Palmer agreed.

“If we’re taking the plan to prevent and end homelessness in Illinois seriously, we need to be providing the increased resources to eliminate that shortage … otherwise we’re just managing homelessness at its current level,” he said.

Palmer said lawmakers should be increasing funding for housing no matter what the state’s budget situation is because housing insecurity can be a root cause for other issues that cost the state more money, such as health problems.

Increasing funding for shelters alone also isn’t enough, said Kenshol, the Shelter Aliance co-founder. A lack of funding for affordable permanent housing leaves people stuck in the shelter system, which means growing rental assistance programs to help prevent people from being forced into shelters should be a budget priority, he said.

In a $55.1 billion budget, Kenshol argued the state should be able to find the money to increase funding each year for housing programs.

“As a society, as voters, as elected officials, we make different choices. We turn our backs on the people who are desperate and at risk of perishing and instead we invest in other things,” Kenshol said. “My values suggest that we should put caring for the least of these first.”

As a reminder of the nation’s foundational principles and ideals, we’re running the full text of the nation’s Declaration of Independence, which, 249 years ago on this day, helped chart a new course for the United States of America.
In Congress, July 4, 1776
The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.–That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, –That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.–Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.
He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.
He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.
He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.
He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.
He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.
He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.
He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.
He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.
He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.
He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.
He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.
He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.
He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:
For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:
For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:
For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:
For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:
For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:
For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences
For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:
For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:
For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.
He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.
He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.
He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.
He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.
He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.
In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.
Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.
We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.

You were born here. So was I. The rub is I was born to immigrants who were not yet legal residents.
That makes me a birthright citizen under the 14th Amendment. That also allegedly makes me an “anchor baby.” I’m referring to the assertion that immigrants have come to the U.S. and have  babies only so they can gain  legal residency later.
Real life is more complicated than that for millions of immigrants who come to the U.S. for a variety of reasons — whether they are fleeing violence in their home countries or simply seeking a better life, as generations in our nation of immigrants have done. 
Does the immigration status of my parents really matter? How long ago  did your immigrant ancestors first step foot here? How many generations does it take for citizenship to be “deserved?”
The Constitution’s 14th Amendment says unequivocally that I’m as deserving as the accident of your birth makes you. If you are born here, you’re a U.S. citizen. Me, too. That’s birthright citizenship.
On Jan. 20, newly inaugurated President Donald Trump issued an executive order ending automatic citizenship for babies born to parents who don’t have lawful status in the U.S.  
In a recent 6-3 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court did not address  the constitutionality of Trump’s order. Instead, it ruled that lower courts have no power to issue nationwide injunctions,  voiding  district courts’  rulings that Trump may not deport people who have been U.S. citizens all their lives.  
After the ruling, some groups began the slow process to challenge the law in a nationwide class action lawsuit. But until the Court decides otherwise, the fundamental question whether someone is considered a U.S. citizen will have different answers in different states. 
Meanwhile, raids on immigrant communities continue.
The Trump administration is clearly emboldened. The Supreme Court’s ruling allows the ban on birthright citizenship to take effect in those 28 states that didn’t challenge the president’s initial executive order. And the administration is counting on the high court to see it his way on the constitutional question eventually.
At this point, I lack the confidence to say it won’t.
I understand the argument that  children born to U.S. citizens are more deserving than I am. “But my ancestors emigrated here legally,” say more “deserving” citizens. Never mind that the barriers to coming to this country legally have moved up and down. Today, even people with demonstrable asylum claims are being shut out.
Back in the day, if you showed up to these shores, you simply got in. It wasn’t until 1924 that the U.S. started enforcing quotas for national origin. Aside from immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe (deemed then as too foreign, i.e. not white enough), these quotas favored other white immigrants. And it specifically targeted Asians for exclusion.
This preference for white immigrants continues. White immigrants from, say, Canada and Ireland, don’t seem to be affected by this attempted purge.
So let’s be honest. Many of your immigrant ancestors were legal simply by default.
Other people will argue that ICE is targeting immigrants  who have committed violent crimes. A couple of big problems: according to the libertarian CATO Institute, 65% of those taken by ICE have no criminal record and 93% have not committed a violent crime. 
As a group, immigrants are a safer group than U.S.-born citizens. They commit fewer crimes.
The issue is not criminality. It’s race. All across the country,  Latinos are being detained because of the color of their skin.
Some folks insist that the 14th Amendment dealt only with the children of slaves freed after the Civil War. 
Here’s what the amendment says: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof (my emphasis), are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.” 
Clearly, even those here without documents are subject to U.S. and state laws. That puts them under U.S. jurisdiction. The courts have confirmed birthright citizenship as early as the late 19th Century (United States v. Wong Kim Ark.).
Is military service an indication of deserving citizenship?
Immigrants and their children are populations the military covets for recruitment. About 5% of active-duty personnel are children of immigrants and 12%  of living veterans are immigrants or the children of immigrants.
Meanwhile, there is a shrinking pool of Americans able to serve, owing to their own criminality, fitness and, importantly, willingness.
So, maybe this ire for birthright citizens like me is about how much of a drain we are on government services and the economy.
But, bucking a trend for other Americans, the children of immigrants often surpass the economic success of their parents. That’s been true in my family and virtually everyone else with my background I’ve encountered.
So, who deserves to be a citizen?
I contend that a chief quality of those who  deserve citizenship is that they don’t take their citizenship for granted. They know their parents sacrificed much to make it happen. We are proud Americans. We belong here. And we deserve to stay.

The University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences Myeloma Center, part of the Winthrop P. Rockefeller Cancer Institute, is the only institution in the state that offers CAR T-cell therapy to patients with multiple myeloma. While the blood cancer is not currently curable, symptoms can be addressed and progression can be slowed through various treatments.
CAR T-cell therapy is a weekslong process that involves harvesting T-cells, a type of white blood cell, from multiple myeloma patients’ blood and sending them to a lab where they are trained to attack cancer cells, according to Dr. Samer Al Hadidi, an associate professor at UAMS’ College of Medicine.
Once this process is complete, patients receive an infusion of the newly trained cells after being given a low dose of chemotherapy to make room for the cells, Al Hadidi said. 
A study presented in June at the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting, showed prolonged periods of remission for patients who received a specific CAR T-cell therapy called CARVYKTI®. 
Of the 97 “heavily pretreated” patients that received this therapy, about a third remained alive and progression free for five or more years without further treatment. Patients in the study historically were expected to be progression free for less than six months and live for about a year, on average, according to a press release. 
  Dr. Samer Al Hadidi (Courtesy of UAMS)
Al Hadidi said “the beauty” of this therapy is it works for hard-to-treat patients and has the potential to be used for long-term disease control. The possibility of using this treatment on patients in earlier stages of the disease and achieving the same or better results is “what gets most people excited about it,” he said. 
“We continue to offer it to patients. I think it’s a really promising therapy. We’re really happy that we have this product here in Arkansas,” Al-Hadidi said.
Multiple myeloma can cause various symptoms like bone fractures, anemia, fatigue and kidney failure, some of which are shared with other diseases, Al-Hadidi said. Typically, multiple myeloma presents in people in their late 60s and is more common among men and African Americans, he said. 
Seventy-one-year-old Donna Kidder doesn’t fall into any of those categories and was surprised by her diagnosis in 2012. Kidder said learning she had multiple myeloma was “a fluke” that resulted from a bone density test she requested to assess the efficacy of a drug she was taking to treat her osteoporosis. The test revealed more bone loss than could be explained, she said. 
“I was running 10 miles a week and drinking green smoothies for breakfast,” Kidder said. “I’m like, ‘this isn’t fair. I’m in good health.’ But it turns out that good health helped me deal with all the treatments I’ve had in the last 13 years.”
Kidder, who lives in North Carolina, came to UAMS for therapy at the recommendation of a neighbor, whose friend had previously received treatment for multiple myeloma in Little Rock. 
“I’m very appreciative of the care that I got at UAMS because I’m not sure I would be talking to you today if I didn’t get that initial care,” she said. 


Let us know what you think...


 

CAR T-cell therapy wasn’t an option at the time, so Kidder initially received a stem cell transplant. Throughout her multiple myeloma journey, she’s received two stem cell transplants and two CAR T-cell therapy treatments. 
Kidder received her CAR T-cell treatments closer to home at Duke University Health System. The therapy from the study presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting has been the most effective for Kidder, who said she’s been in remission since December 2023. 
Patients like Kidder often have to undergo maintenance treatment in between therapies, some of which have difficult side effects, like nausea. Kidder said she’s interested in learning about new treatments, but will consider first the impact on her quality of life before committing to any of them.

Reflecting back on more than a dozen years of living with multiple myeloma, Kidder said treatment for the disease has changed so much, and she’s concerned about cuts to federal funding for medical research generally, “not so much for myself because I get to be 71.” 
After her initial diagnosis, Kidder was told she only had three to five years to live. Her goal was to live long enough to see her grandson graduate from high school. 
Her grandson has finished his first year in college.
Citing a friend in her 30s who’s been diagnosed with multiple myeloma, Kidder said the disease is hitting younger people and “research is so important.”
The president’s budget request includes cutting the National Institutes of Health’s budget by $18 billion, or 40%, a proposal that has drawn bipartisan pushback from lawmakers who are concerned the cuts would delay or halt the development of treatments and cures for diseases like cancer. 
“I’m very concerned about cuts to research…I also feel a responsibility that the nation has paid a lot to keep me alive, it’s been expensive, and so I feel it’s my obligation to live fully,” Kidder said.  
Part of that full life includes sharing her experiences with multiple myeloma, especially with newly diagnosed patients. 
“I remembered meeting people who had been alive for 20 years with myeloma and I was fascinated to hear about their experience,” she said. “So now, 13 years, I’m that person. I’m that person that gives them hope.”

As a refugee, I bought this flag not because America is perfect, but because of its promise.
The first time I saw the American flag, I was 9 years old. My family and I were at the Pakistan–Afghanistan border, preparing to return to Afghanistan after years of fleeing the Taliban and living in exile. 
We waited to be vaccinated and processed for return, and the American flag was attached to the back of a U.S. Army vehicle. My uncle, pointing at the flag, said, “Look, now we will be safe.” At that moment, the American flag felt like a promise. 
Since then, the flag’s meaning has shifted, but I refuse to let hate define it.

Years later, I was granted a student visa and arrived in the United States as an international student. In the airport, I stood again in front of the American flag, where it waved its 13 red and white stripes and 50 stars. It was a profound moment when I felt welcomed. I knew then, deep in my heart, that I was safe and my life was full of possibilities. 
As I experienced America and life in it, that sense of safety changed. Slowly, I began to fear the flag that once gave me hope.
I saw the American flag in the hands of people shouting vulgar things about immigrants. I saw it on t-shirts worn by those who looked at me with hate. I started to believe that when an American flag was hanging on someone’s porch or painted on their truck, it meant I wasn’t welcome. The flag that once symbolized safety and freedom slowly started to feel like a warning.
But, a few days ago, I found myself revisiting the most joyful moments of my life in this country: arriving in the U.S. for the first time, the day I became a U.S. citizen, my siblings making it to America safely, and my mother stepping off a plane onto American soil. 
In every photo from those moments, we are smiling — some of us crying — with the American flag waving in the background. Despite everything, that flag was always there, not just in fear, but in celebration of survival and homecoming.
This Independence Day, I bought an American flag.
I do not believe this country is perfect, but I believe we belong in it. I know we are part of America’s flawed, painful, and beautiful story. I bought the flag because we, too, arrived here with teary eyes and hopeful hearts. Like that little girl at the border all those years ago, I still choose to believe in the promise of safety, dignity and a better life.
But belief alone is not enough. We must act.
When you turn on the news or scroll through social media, the stories are grim. The Trump administration continues to sow fear and division. In states like Maine, where refugees are revitalizing communities, federal policies are stripping refugee resettlement while programs have been indefinitely paused. Funding cuts have gutted resettlement and legal support systems. Fundamental rights, such as asylum and due process, are under constant attack. Families are being separated. People from entire countries are once again banned from entering America. Refugee and immigrant rights organizations are being systematically targeted. 
Last year, 625 refugees found safety in Maine, bringing their resilience, vibrancy, and skills to a state facing an aging population and labor shortages. Maine’s essential refugee agencies are now grappling with how to preserve basic services after federal funding cuts gutted their support systems. These actions are a cowardly way to treat people who have crossed continents and oceans, left everything behind, and risked it all to come home.
For many of us, America was not our first choice. However, it is our last hope. And still, we love this country not because it’s easy, but because we’ve invested our futures in its promises and potential. Refugees know that we are not just part of America—we help make it whole.
As we step into a new chapter of American history, the flag belongs to us all. The flag, and the country for which it stands, belongs to those who believe in something better, kinder, and in the promise of liberty and justice for all. It belongs to everyone who dares to hope, who fights for compassion, and who still—despite everything—believes in its promise. This flag is our flag.

(Photo: Chuck Estes, Tennessee Citizens for Wilderness Planning)As East Tennesseans and tourists alike enjoy summer fun on the Obed Wild and Scenic River, enthusiasts are growing its amount of federally protected land.
Part of the U.S. National Park Service, the Obed Wild and Scenic River in Cumberland and Morgan Counties on Tennessee’s Cumberland Plateau offers swimming, hiking, picnicking, kayaking, fishing and climbing at the federally protected Obed Wild and Scenic River lands. It currently includes about 45 miles along streams like the Obed and Emory Rivers. 
Residents of Oak Ridge, a little less than an hour’s drive away, created Tennessee Citizens for Wilderness Planning (TCWP) and lobbied to create the federally protected area in 1976. Now, the same group, through fundraising and land swaps with anonymous private individuals, has gained 30 acres on which it plans to build a trail connected to the federal land. 
The new trail loop will let visitors hike through a forest and into a gorge and they can follow Ramsey Creek to a small waterfall.
TCWP’s Chuck Estes said the property is not open to the public yet. The organization plans to finish building the trail first before giving the area to the National Park Service. Estes said TCWP still has some paperwork to do before the transfer is final.
“It will provide a high-quality experience to hikers walking the small gorge, protect a mature forest, and ensure continued excellent water quality in Ramsey Creek,” Estes said, adding that moisture in the canyon supports supports salamanders, including hellbenders, and other amphibians along with other distinctive plants and animals.
“Surveying the property may find other interesting animal and plant species and some may be species of concern that will be protected through purchase of the property,” he said.

In Congress, July 4, 1776
The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.–That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, –That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.–Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.
He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.
He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.
He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.
He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.
He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.
He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.
He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.
He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.
He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.
He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.
He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.
He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.
He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:
For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:
For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:
For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:
For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:
For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:
For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences
For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:
For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:
For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.
He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.
He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.
He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.
He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.
He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.
In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.
Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.
We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/declaration-of-independence-copy-1024x636.jpeg,,,2025-07-04 06:03:13.902007

A study published Wednesday in the medical journal JAMA Network Open found that emergency room clinicians were much less likely to refer Black opioid overdose patients for outpatient treatment compared with white patients.
The researchers looked at the medical records of 1,683 opioid overdose patients from emergency rooms in nine states: California, Colorado, Georgia, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Oregon and Pennsylvania.
About 5.7% of Black patients received referrals for outpatient treatment, compared with 9.6% of white patients, according to the researchers, who received a federal grant from the National Institute on Drug Abuse to conduct the analysis.
While the nation saw a decrease in opioid overdose deaths in white people between 2021 and 2022, overdose death rates increased for American Indian, Alaska Native, Asian, Black and Hispanic people. Patients visiting ERs for opioid overdoses are more likely to die from an overdose after the visit, the authors wrote, underscoring the importance of gaining “an improved understanding of disparities in [emergency department] treatment and referral.”
In total, roughly 18% of the patients received a referral for outpatient treatment, 43% received a naloxone kit or prescription, and 8.4% received a prescription for buprenorphine, the first-line medication for treating opioid use disorder.
The researchers used records from 10 hospital sites participating in a national consortium collecting data on overdoses from fentanyl and its related drugs. The patient records were from September 2020 to November 2023.
Another study in JAMA Network Open, released Thursday, found similar disparities: Black and Hispanic patients were significantly less likely than white patients to receive buprenorphine. Black patients had a 17% chance, and Hispanic patients a 16% chance, to be prescribed the therapy, compared with a 20% chance for white patients.
The authors of that study, from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, looked at data from 176,000 records of opioid-related events between 2017 and 2022 across all 50 states.

(Photo by Walter Bibikow/Getty Images)President Donald Trump’s proposed fiscal year 2026 discretionary budget is called a “skinny budget” because it’s short on line-by-line details.

But historic preservation efforts in the U.S. did get a mention — and they might as well be skinned to the bone.
Trump has proposed to slash funding for the federal Historic Preservation Fund to only $11 million, which is $158 million less than the fund’s previous reauthorization in 2024. The presidential discretionary budget, however, always heads to Congress for appropriation. And Congress always makes changes.
That said, the Trump administration hasn’t even released the $188 million that Congress appropriated for the fund for the 2025 fiscal year, essentially impounding the funding stream that Congress created in 1976 for historic preservation activities across the nation.
I’m a scholar of historic preservation who’s worked to secure historic designations for buildings and entire neighborhoods. I’ve worked on projects that range from making distressed neighborhoods in St. Louis eligible for historic tax credits to surveying Cold War-era hangars and buildings on seven U.S. Air Force bases.
I’ve seen the ways in which the Historic Preservation Fund helps local communities maintain and rehabilitate their rich architectural history, sparing it from deterioration, the wrecking ball or the pressures of the private market.
A rare, deficit-neutral funding model
Most Americans probably don’t realize that the task of historic preservation largely falls to individual states and Native American tribes.
The National Historic Preservation Act that President Lyndon B. Johnson signed into law in 1966 requires states and tribes to handle everything from identifying potential historic sites to reviewing the impact of interstate highway projects on archaeological sites and historic buildings. States and tribes are also responsible for reviewing nominations of sites in the National Register of Historic Places, the nation’s official list of properties deemed worthy of preservation.
However, many states and tribes didn’t have the capacity to adequately tackle the mandates of the 1966 act. So the Historic Preservation Fund was formed a decade later to alleviate these costs by funneling federal resources into these efforts.
The fund is actually the product of a conservative, limited-government approach.
Created during Gerald Ford’s administration, it has a revenue-neutral model, meaning that no tax dollars pay for the program. Instead, it’s funded by private lease royalties from the Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas reserves.
Most of these reserves are located in federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico and off the coast of Alaska. Private companies that receive a permit to extract from them must agree to a lease with the federal government. Royalties from their oil and gas sales accrue in federally controlled accounts under the terms of these leases. The Office of Natural Resources Revenue then directs 1.5% of the total royalties to the Historic Preservation Fund.
Congress must continually reauthorize the amount of funding reserved for the Historic Preservation Fund, or it goes unfunded.

Despite bipartisan support, the fund has been threatened in the past. President Ronald Reagan attempted to do exactly what Trump is doing now by making no request for funding at all in his 1983 budget. Yet the fund has nonetheless been reauthorized six times since its inception, with terms ranging from five to 10 years.
The program is a crucial source of funding, particularly in small towns and rural America, where privately raised cultural heritage funds are harder to come by. It provides grants for the preservation of buildings and geographical areas that hold historical, cultural or spiritual significance in underrepresented communities. And it’s even involved in projects tied to the nation’s 250th birthday in 2026, such as the rehabilitation of the home in New Jersey where George Washington was stationed during the winter of 1778-79 and the restoration of Rhode Island’s Old State House.
Filling financial gaps
I’ve witnessed the fund’s impact firsthand in small communities across the nation.
Edwardsville, Illinois, a suburb of St. Louis, is home to the Leclaire Historic District. In the 1970s, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. The national designation recognized the historic significance of the district, protecting it against any adverse impacts from federal infrastructure funding. It also made tax credits available to the town. Edwardsville then designated LeClaire a local historic district so that it could legally protect the indelible architectural features of its homes, from original decorative details to the layouts of front porches.
Despite the designation, however, there was no clear inventory of the hundreds of houses in the district. A few paid staffers and a volunteer citizen commission not only had to review proposed renovations and demolitions, but they also had to figure out which buildings even contributed to LeClaire’s significance and which ones did not – and thus did not need to be tied up in red tape.

  The Allen House is one of approximately 415 single-family homes in the Leclaire neighborhood in Edwardsville, Ill. Friends of Leclaire
Edwardsville was able to secure a grant through the Illinois State Historic Preservation Office thanks to a funding match enabled by money disbursed to Illinois via the Historic Preservation Fund.
In 2013, my team created an updated inventory of the historic district, making it easier for the local commission to determine which houses should be reviewed carefully and which ones don’t need to be reviewed at all.
Oil money better than no money
The historic preservation field, not surprisingly, has come out strongly against Trump’s proposal to defund the Historic Preservation Fund.
Nonetheless, there have been debates within the field over the fund’s dependence on the fossil fuel industry, which was the trade-off that preservationists made decades ago when they crafted the funding model.
In the 1970s, amid the national energy crisis, conservation of existing buildings was seen as a worthy ecological goal, since demolition and new construction required fossil fuels. To preservationists, diverting federal carbon royalties seemed like a power play.
But with the effects of climate change becoming impossible to ignore, some preservationists are starting to more openly critique both the ethics and the wisdom of tapping into a pool of money created through the profits of the oil and gas industry. I’ve recently wondered myself if continued depletion of fossil fuels means that preservationists won’t be able to count on the Historic Preservation Fund as a long-term source of funding.
That said, you’d be hard-pressed to find a preservationist who thinks that destroying the Historic Preservation Fund would be a good first step in shaping a more visionary policy.
For now, Trump’s administration has only sown chaos in the field of historic preservation. Already, Ohio has laid off one-third of the staffers in its State Historic Preservation Office due to the impoundment of federal funds. More state preservation offices may follow suit. The National Council of State Historic Preservation Officers predicts that states soon could be unable to perform their federally mandated duties.
Unfortunately, many people advocating for places important to their towns and neighborhoods may end up learning the hard way just what the Historic Preservation Fund does.

(Photo by Jim Peaco/Yellowstone National Park)BOZEMAN, Mont. — With many national parks facing huge backlogs of deferred maintenance — Yellowstone National Park alone is estimated to have more than $1 billion — the federal government is proposing a new fee on foreign visitors to address some of the shortfall.
The idea, which has long been championed by a Bozeman nonprofit, is part of preliminary 2026 budget documents for the Department of the Interior that simultaneously includes vast budget cuts for various departments, including the National Park Service.
The National Park Service budget shows a request for just $2.1 billion, cutting roughly a third of the agency’s 2025 budget.
But among the streamlining efforts listed in the budget documents, the federal government is proposing to establish a new fee for foreign visitors to some NPS sites, estimated to generate upwards of $90 million “to keep national parks beautiful.”
“An international surcharge is a compelling point because you can raise prices for that cohort, who by definition are spending a lot of money to travel to our country to see these ‘bucket-list’ destinations,” said Tate Watkins, a research fellow at the Property and Environment Research Center. “If you think of the overall trip budget, the gate fee is a small portion of that. It isn’t likely to deter a huge number of people.”
Last year was the busiest on record for the NPS, with more than 331 million visitors spending time at the 433 NPS units, including historic sites, battlefields and monuments, in addition to the 63 national parks.
The increased traffic at the nation’s crown jewels have added to a deferred maintenance backlog of nearly $23 billion to maintain roads, buildings, utility systems and other facilities across the park system.
One method to address that backlog at individual park sites is to consider changing the fee structure charged for visitors at the entrance gates.
Only 106 of the 433 sites managed by the NPS charge entrance fees, ranging from $10 per person to $35 per vehicle, with annual pass options available. There is no differentiation between U.S. residents and foreign visitors.
Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said during a House Committee on Natural Resources hearing earlier this month that the Park Service is “way undercharging” international visitors.
“We’ve done a study on what gets charged if you’re going to go see the gorillas in Rwanda or go to the Galapagos Islands … there could be a billion-dollar revenue opportunity, without discouraging visitors,” Burgum said. “That revenue, if it could be redirected back towards deferred maintenance, staffing, a number of things we could do, that would be fantastic.”
The Galapagos Islands cost $200 for foreign tourists, while Ecuadorian adults pay $30.

Watkins said PERC, a Bozeman-based a “free market environmentalism” nonprofit think-tank, has advocated for changes to the NPS fee structure for years.
“There’s a lot of common models where we do this kind of thing anyway,” he said.
Watkins pointed to states that charge different resident and nonresident fees for hunting and fishing licenses and similar structures for accessing state parks.
In Montana, residents pay a $9 fee with their annual vehicle registration, which covers access to all state parks for the year. Nonresidents, however, are charged an $8 daily entrance fee with a vehicle ($4 to walk or bike in) or $50 for an annual pass. Camping at a state park costs $12 more per night for nonresidents.
The same model could easily be applied nationally.
“The status quo is not one of sustainable and proper management of these sites,” Watkins told the Daily Montanan. “The current model just doesn’t keep up with it.”
In a report released in 2023, Watkins looked at potential revenue streams from charging international visitors additional fees.
Using NPS data showing baseline entry fee revenue of $349 million, PERC calculated a $16, $25 and $40 surcharge for foreign visitors, with an estimate that the surcharge would correspond with a roughly 3% decrease in visitation.
The smallest surcharge would generate an additional $211 million annually, while the highest would bring in $528 million — more than doubling the current revenue.
The current system is relatively blunt — there are lots of margins you can refine in a logical way,” Watkins said. “That’s where I think you can see big changes happen.”
 Doubling Yellowstone’s fee revenue

A new report, authored by University of Wyoming economist Steve Newbold and published by PERC last week, focused on that nation’s oldest national park, Yellowstone, which saw 4.7 million visitors last year, roughly 15% of which came from other countries.

The park’s entry fee is $35 per vehicle, per week, with 80% of fee revenues retained at the park to be spent on visitor experience improvements. Park Service data shows entry fees generated roughly $14.2 million annually for the park in recent years.
The report looked at six different fee structure scenarios and compared the elasticity of demand — how much impact a higher fee will have on visitation — with the increased revenue.
Scenarios included charging all visitors an additional $5 to enter the park; exempting locals but charging all other visitors an extra $10; and various levels of international fees.
Charging foreign visitors a $20 surcharge is estimated to decrease visitation by 13,000, but generate an additional $11.9 million — an 84% increase from 2024 gate revenue.
Bumping the international fee to $100 per person would rake in $55.2 million, with a roughly 57,000 decrease in visitors.
Adding just a $5 per person fee to all visitors to Yellowstone would more than double the revenue from entrance fees.
“In some places you’re hard pressed to find a cup of coffee for five dollars,” Watkins said.
And while that doesn’t make up for the park’s $1.5 billion maintenance backlog — the most of any national park according to the report — it would help, Watkins said.
“I think you could probably ask the superintendent, and he’d say if we can get closer to the maintenance backlog with fee revenue, that would be great,” he said.
Watkins said that PERC is excited that the federal government is considering different models of fees for national parks, and that it might take some time to get it right.
“You’re probably not going to get something that works perfectly the first time,” he said.
But the whole point is the status quo is not sustainable, Watkins said, and the agencies in charge need to think about what they can do to put the future of the park system in a better position.

“A well-funded park that can maintain its trails, protect its wildlife, and conserve its natural wonders will continue drawing visitors for generations—securing the economic lifeline that sustains surrounding communities,” the report states. “The choice is between short-term thinking and long-term prosperity for both the park and the region.”

It’s why we’re celebrating America’s Independence Day and not paying homage to a king or queen. Or living under a tyrant’s thumb — yet.
The document has some faults, declaring for instance that “all men are created equal” even though at the time it was written, women, enslaved people and Indigenous people weren’t considered equal to white men of means. The document contains some racial slurs, but its preamble continues to echo down the centuries to inspire millions, including those who weren’t born in the United States.
The United States as we know it didn’t even exist in 1776, but this Declaration of Independence ignited the spark that resulted in the first nation on earth to be brought into existence by an idea not based on ethnic or religious identity. And that idea has grown to encompass all people and engendered more to aspire to equity for everyone.
The Declaration itself is mostly a long list of grievances leaders of the 13 British colonies had against King George III that formed the stated rationale of separating the colonies from the king’s rule. History shows that another reason for fomenting resolution involved who would colonize the Native lands west of the colonies.
All-in-all, not really that noble a rationale for starting a war.
But those stirring words that begin the Declaration embraced a noble ideal for founding a new nation. Despite the document’s flaws, and the flaws and mistakes that dog our collective history down through today, it serves to remind us of our common heritage and why we are Americans.
So, here it is, a transcription from the National Archives:
 
Note: The following text is a transcription of the Stone Engraving of the parchment Declaration of Independence (the document on display in the Rotunda at the National Archives Museum.) The spelling and punctuation reflects the original.
In Congress, July 4, 1776
The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit ofHappiness. —That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their justpowers from the consent of the governed, —That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. —Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.
He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.
He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unlesss uspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.
He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.
He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.
He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.
He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.
He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing theLaws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.
He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.
He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.
He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.
He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.
He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.
He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:
For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:
For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:
For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:
For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:
For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:
For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:
For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein anArbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:
For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:
For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.
He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.
He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.
He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.
He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.
He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.
In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.
Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.
We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolvedf rom all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.

(Tim Lambert/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)As America approaches the midway point of this decade, we can agree that it has been one heck of a year. 
Following the news and social media, we see ongoing and emerging challenges in the international arena. Domestically, we continue to struggle with this great experiment called democracy for our society and its culture, which defines the daily experience of Americans.
This weekend, we will celebrate July 4, 1776, as Independence Day to mark our declaration of intention to separate from a government that tread on our unalienable rights of “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.”
That historic document was signed by delegates of the Pennsylvania Provincial Conference, officially the Provincial Conference of Committees of the Province of Pennsylvania, which made up the Provincial Congress. During a week in June, its delegates met in Carpenters’ Hall in Philadelphia, then with the Second Continental Congress, to support the national Declaration of Independence. 
What American colonists sought then was freedom from an oppressive system and subsequently demonstrated they were willing to fight and die for such freedom.
In the closing minutes of his January 1941 State of the Union Address and in the wake of  the U.S. entering the Second World War, President Franklin D. Roosevelt spoke of four freedoms as values of democratic societies. In preceding years, totalitarian and fascist regimes of Germany, Japan, and Italy continually demonstrated disregard for such values. In his exhortation, FDR built the case for U.S. intervention for the sake of others — that is, the security of allied governments and their people:
“In the future days, which we seek to make secure, we look forward to a world founded upon four essential human freedoms.
The first is freedom of speech and expression — everywhere in the world.
The second is freedom of every person to worship God in his own way — everywhere in the world.
The third is freedom from want, which, translated into world terms, means economic understanding which will secure to every nation a healthy peacetime life for its inhabitants — everywhere in the world.
The fourth is freedom from fear, which, translated into world terms, means a world-wide reduction of armaments to such a point and in such a thorough fashion that no nation will be in a position to commit an act of physical aggression against any neighbor — anywhere in the world.”
The themes of FDR’s “The Four Freedoms” speech are expanded upon by essays from renowned American writers. The essay that spoke to me most in the current context of our American struggles was penned in March 1943 by Pennsylvania-born [Lehigh Valley] Pulitzer Price recipient, Stephen Vincent Benét. In “Freedom from Fear,” he offered:
“What do we mean when we say, ‘freedom from fear?’ It isn’t just a formula or a set of words. It’s a look in the eyes and a feeling in the heart and a thing to be won against odds. It goes to the roots of life — to a man and a woman and their children and the home they can make and keep…
“Since our nation began, men and women have come here for just that freedom — freedom from the fear that lies at the heart of every unjust law, of every tyrannical exercise of power by one man over another man….
“We do not mean freedom from responsibility — freedom from struggle and toil, from hardship and danger. We do not intend to breed a race wrapped in cotton wool, too delicate to stand rough weather. In any world of man that we can imagine, fear and the conquest of fear must play a part.
“But we have the chance, if we have the brains and the courage, to destroy the worst fears that harry man today — the fear of starving to death, the fear of being a slave, the fear of being stamped into the dust because he is one kind of man and not another, the fear of unprovoked attack and ghastly death for himself and for his children because of the greed and power of willful and evil men and deluded nations.”
  An American Flag hangs in the window of a house in Normandy, France. (Tim Lambert/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)
More than eight decades later, the case for fear still exists in 2025 as Americans face global and regional conflicts, the potential collapse of international economies, and social, as well as political challenges to its democratic institutions. We cannot be afraid to address injustice within our nation.
Benét also pointed back to the Declaration of Independence when “…we, as a nation, asserted that all men were created equal, that all men were entitled to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Those were large assertions, but we have tried to live up to them. We have not always succeeded; we have often failed. But our will and desire as a nation have been to live up to them.”
One might wonder how delegates of the 1776 Pennsylvania Provincial Conference would view today’s status of the four freedoms across our state and the nation. In the months ahead and for the remainder of this decade, it is my hope that we resolve and pursue freedom from fear for others in our American society and, in doing so, for ourselves.

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)Congress on Thursday afternoon passed the sweeping spending package dubbed the “one big beautiful bill,” marking a major legislative win for President Donald Trump — but clean energy advocates say it could derail future renewable projects.
The House approved the measure after the Senate significantly revised the original proposal. For a moment, the renewable energy industry was stunned by provisions that included a proposed tax on solar and wind power, along with an accelerated phase out of Biden-era tax credits.
Although the final version of the bill dropped the proposed tax, it also eliminated the electric vehicle tax credit established under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. It further shortened the window for renewable energy projects to qualify for solar and wind credits. Under the new rules, eligible projects must begin construction within a year of the bill’s passage and be placed in service by the end of 2027. 
“I was proud to vote for the Inflation Reduction Act to help position Virginia as a leader in clean energy technology, putting us on a path toward 20,000 new jobs and lower energy costs,” Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said in a statement. 
“…Why would President Trump and congressional Republicans undo such historic and effective legislation, and go even further to hurt clean energy by imposing new requirements many wind and solar projects won’t be able to meet?”
The tighter deadlines have raised alarms for projects still in the approval pipeline across several states. Appalachian Voices, an environmental advocacy group, said the bill could jeopardize local and community-led initiatives. 
“If you start that project and you have an unexpected delay, but you’re still relying on the credits to get through the end of financing, then you’re just put in a really bad position,” said Kevin Zedack, government affairs specialist for Appalachian Voices. “Especially if you have that project currently moving, and already understand that it’s not going to be placed in service by the deadlines that were imposed. Then you’re just maybe a community organization or a church just left holding the bag.”
Zedack said the tax credits don’t just benefit large scale solar and wind farms for utilities, emphasizing that there have been a number of small community solar projects that were boosted by the credit. 
For example, Lee County Public Schools implemented 1.4 megawatt panels across seven schools, along with job training programs. Appalachian Voices reports the school district saved over $3 million over the lifetime of the project. 
Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., stated he is deeply disappointed by the roll backs of renewable energy incentives in the bill, especially after Virginia has made significant strides under the Virginia Clean Economy Act.
The fossil fuel industry, however, came out ahead in the bill. In the final Senate version, metallurgical mines are eligible for a 2.5% tax credit for production. While Virginia has steadily reduced coal production in recent years, there are still more than 100 active mines, mostly in the southwestern part of the state.
“A lot of most of the metallurgical coal that is produced in the United States comes from Appalachia, and most of that product is exported to other countries like India and China to produce cheaper steel,” Zedack said.
The bill passed the house with a margin of 218-214 with all Democrats and two Republicans voting against the measure. The measure now heads to the president’s desk for his signature — ahead of the July 4 deadline imposed by Trump.

About 35 million years ago, Hampton Roads was underwater, with the coastline dozens of miles west toward Richmond.
Dinosaurs were long gone, but the ocean teemed with marine creatures such as ancient whales, sharks and sea stars.
That is until one unfortunate day, when life across what’s now southeastern Virginia was obliterated within seconds.
A bolide – an extraterrestrial object such as an asteroid or comet – hurtled out of space and landed in the lower part of the Chesapeake Bay.
“There was a kill zone that would have been several hundred miles out in every direction,” said Rich Whittecar, a geologist and emeritus professor at Old Dominion University.
The volcanic-like lateral blast from the impact ripped through faster than the speed of sound, with exponentially more explosive power than atomic bombs detonated by humans, Whittecar said.
Plants and animals would be “totally shredded” by all the material – and simultaneously incinerated by the intense heat.
“Not a good day,” Whittecar said.
Geologists first pieced together the story of the Chesapeake Bay impact crater in the 1990s. It’s the largest known bolide strike in the U.S. and among the largest in the world.
But new research is the first to document the far-reaching impacts of the collision. Scientists say they uncovered a site 240 miles away in the Sandhills of North Carolina showing traces of a massive tsunami caused by the Virginia asteroid.
And the discovery all started by chance.
 A mystery buried underground

Almost a decade ago, retired consulting geologist Bob Ganis was investigating some fossils in Moore County, N.C. when he got a call from a local property owner nearby.

A pipeline was set to be constructed through the edge of her property called Paint Hill Farm, and she wondered if Ganis might like to come investigate the temporary trench as part of his research.
Ganis accepted the offer and it became “one of the most strange days of my life,” he said.
He took a look at the rock layers exposed about 10 feet deep and was “totally baffled.” What he saw didn’t align with his geological understanding of the region.
“I had no idea what it was, and no reports of this kind of geology were available to understand what it was,” he said.
Thus began a yearslong quest to get to the bottom of the mystery trapped in sediment. The first piece of the puzzle was determining the age of the rock layers in question.
Ganis said he found fossilized shark teeth nearby and worked with peers who helped date them to the late Eocene era, which lasted from about 56 to 34 million years ago.
Next Ganis connected with Ralph Willoughby with the South Carolina Geological Survey, and described the mysterious sediment layers. They methodically went through the rock beds to try and explain each within the geological context of the region.
“When we get to the top, this explanation of all this rubble at the top, we’re still scratching our heads,” Ganis said. “‘What is this stuff?’”
One day, looking at photos from the trench site, “a light bulb goes off,” he said. “It struck us (that) this is a tsunami deposit.”
There was no geological history to explain why such a deposit would be there, except for one: the meteoroid strike up in Virginia on that fateful day 35 million years ago.
 Solving the mystery 





A Map Shows The Outline Of The Chesapeake Bay Impact Crater (Photo courtesy U.S. Geological Survey)




The asteroid, moving at about 44,000 miles per hour, was about 2 to 3 miles wide and blasted an enormous crater into the continental shelf of modern day Virginia, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.
Much of the crater is still underwater in the bay, which is why it took until recent decades for scientists to discover. The circular outline of the impact in Hampton Roads includes the bottom half of the Eastern Shore, northern edge of Norfolk and eastern outskirts of the Peninsula and Middle Peninsula.
Like any object that lands in water, the asteroid caused a big splash – a giant tsunami likely thousands of feet high, “the kind of tsunami that the world rarely sees,” Ganis said.
It likely washed over the Blue Ridge Mountains and swept across the Southeast – maybe even over the Atlantic Ocean to lap at the shores of Africa and Europe, he said.
Scientists described such a wide-reaching tsunami when they first investigated the Chesapeake Bay impact crater but no one had found actual remains of it.
Ganis’ team homed in on the tsunami as a likely explanation for the Paint Hill rock formation, but needed more evidence to prove it.
The bottom layer featured charcoal, natural glass and other rock fragments; materials you would expect to fly out of the impact, Ganis said. It also had the hallmarks of a “tremendously hot blast.” Another layer contained ash from the explosion.

Whittecar, the ODU geologist, came in to help figure out the top layer, a sandy conglomeration including petrified wood and what looked like a substance called plinthite. The team needed an expert to confirm.
“I went down (to) look at this stuff and basically said, ‘Yep, that’s plinthite,’” Whittecar said.
The material is an iron-rich, clumpy reddish clay common in tropical regions. Researchers believe the Virginia tsunami swept up this material from the seabed and ended up at Paint Hill.

The presence of iridium in the sediment helped nail down the team’s tsunami theory. It is an extremely rare metal on Earth but common in asteroids.
The researchers published their collaborative findings in the peer-reviewed journal Southeastern Geology last month.
Paint Hill’s owner recently sold the 300-acre property to the nonprofit Nature Conservancy, which plans to turn it over to the state park system to expand the Weymouth Woods Sandhills Nature Preserve.
The tsunami deposits will be preserved and may become a “highlight of the park” through related exhibits and educational activities, Ganis said.
Whittecar said geologists are interested in this type of work largely out of curiosity and advancing knowledge for future generations.
“From the practical hazard prevention side of things,” he said, “of course it does give a little weight to the notion that if we can stop one of these (asteroids) from hitting, it is worth getting out there and nudging that thing out of the way.”

(Photo by Jerry Glaser/Customs and Border Protection)State, federal and local officials who fought for years to bring the new FBI headquarters to Prince George’s County said Tuesday the fight is not over, after the surprise Trump administration announcement that the agency will stay downtown.
The FBI will move into existing space at the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center, just a few blocks down Pennsylvania Avenue from the current dilapidated headquarters in the aging J. Edgar Hoover Building, according to a statement from the FBI and the General Services Administration.
“Moving to the Ronald Reagan Building is the most cost effective and resource efficient way to carry out our mission to protect the American people and uphold the Constitution,” FBI Director Kash Patel said in the statement.
The move reverses a 2023 GSA decision that identified a site near the Greenbelt Metro for the new headquarters, following years of study and of competition between Maryland and Virginia jurisdictions to land the site.
Gov. Wes Moore (D), Prince Georges’ County Executive Aisha Braveboy (D) and almost all of the state’s congressional delegation — calling themselves Team Maryland — insisted Tuesday that Greenbelt is still the better site.

“Simply moving down the street would ignore the real threats the Bureau faces and further jeopardize the safety of those protecting our communities. That’s why we will be fighting back against this proposal with every tool we have,” the Team Maryland statement said.
The agency has been seeking new headquarters for years to replace the J. Edgar Hoover Building, a brutalist facility that is cramped, has leaks and pieces of concrete occasionally falling onto the street below.
In November 2023, the GSA picked Greenbelt over another site in Prince George’s County, Landover, and over a site in Springfield, Virginia.
Virginia representatives charged that the selection of Maryland was flawed after a federal inspector general’s report released in February found fault with the process. But the report never stated there was a problem with the Greenbelt site itself.
Whatever reservations they may have had about the Greenbelt site, however, was put aside by Virginia’s senators for criticism of the Reagan Building proposal, which Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine said “isn’t a plan, it’s a punt.” The two Democrats said the choice of a new site was typical of the Trump administration’s haphazard approach to the federal workforce.
“For years, Democratic and Republican administrations alike have agreed on the need for a secure, purpose-built headquarters that actually meets the FBI’s mission needs,” said a joint statement from Kaine and Warner, “This announcement brushes aside years of careful planning, ignores the recommendations of security and mission experts, and raises serious concerns about how this decision was made.”
President Donald Trump has never been a fan of moving the FBI out of the District. He tried to cancel it in his first term and in March of this year, less that two months after returning to office, he said he would not let the agency move “three hours away in Maryland, a liberal state.” He quickly said the state’s political leanings had no bearing on his decision, but never corrected the fact that Greenbelt is about 16 miles by car from the current headquarters.
Patel has talked in recent months about relocating headquarters staff to other parts of the country, but Tuesday’s announcement seems to have put that talk on hold.
GSA Public Buildings Service Commissioner Michael Peters said in a statement that move to the Reagan building avoids more than $300 million in deferred maintenance cost the current FBI headquarters.
“We are proud to partner with Director Patel to drive efficiency and improve the quality of space for a productive workforce in service to national security and taxpayers,” Peters said.
According to its website, the Reagan Building is home to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Until recently, it was also home to the U.S. Agency on International Developement, before that agency was gutted by the Trump administration and closed as an independent agency effective Tuesday, presumably freeing up space in the building.
But the building also has 22 event spaces to host weddings and events. Plans are scheduled for two events Wednesday, and a concert series on a plaza starts Monday and continues through September.
Del. Nicole Williams (D-Prince George’s), whose legislative district includes the Greenbelt site, called Tuesday’s decision “very interesting.”
“That [Ronald Reagan] building is a very open building. I’ve gone there for private events and conferences,” Williams, who chairs the county’s delegation in the House of Delegate, said in an interview.
“I still maintain that the Greenbelt site is the better location for the relocation of the FBI. It’s disappointing to hear the administration trying to undermine what was already done through the official GSA process,” she said.
“Congress has already appropriated funds for the purpose of the construction of the new FBI headquarters in Maryland. Now the administration’s attempting to redirect those funds really undermines congressional intent,” Williams said, echoing arguments of Team Maryland.
Williams and her two Democratic District 22 colleagues – Dels. Anne Healey and Ashanti Martinez – sponsored legislation that went into effect Tuesday directing the governor to include $200 million in the state budget “for site redevelopment and to improve transportation infrastructure for the Federal Bureau of Investigation headquarters relocation project.”

This year’s holiday seems especially important to lift up at a time in which President Trump continues to trash guardrail after guardrail in an unprecedented bid to exercise autocratic one-person rule.
One leader who should be especially attuned to this situation and the need for strong action to curb Trump’s ambitions is North Carolina U.S. Senator Thom Tillis.
Earlier this week, Tillis took the honorable path of voting against Trump’s disastrous mega-bill and then announcing he will not seek reelection next year. And this presents him with a unique opportunity for independence from the Trump machine in the 18 months he has left in office.
The bottom line: With both houses of Congress divided by razor-thin margins, Senator Tillis’s declaration of independence gives him the chance to be the most important and impactful politician for good from North Carolina in decades. One prays he rises to the challenge.

Vice President J.D. Vance and Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, applaud behind. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)A provision in the new state operating budget that would eliminate Ohio’s Medicaid expansion group may not see the light of day, based on the federal budget just passed by Congress.
But even with the expansion group surviving budget talks, impacts to Medicaid in Ohio are still on the horizon from the budget reconciliation bill, according to analysts and advocates.
The state operating budget was passed at the end of June and signed by Gov. Mike DeWine on June 30. The budget included a provision that DeWine himself had written into his executive budget proposal, and which survived a Senate and House vote, along with joint conference committee debate in the Statehouse.
That provision would eliminate the state’s Medicaid expansion group, also called Group VIII, if the federal medical assistance percentage (or FMAP) for that group, which is the contribution Congress gives to the state to help with Medicaid, drops below 90%. If the FMAP drops even 1% on the group, the expansion would be dropped from the Medicaid rolls in Ohio.
But it seems the expansion group is safe for now, as congressional plans to lower the FMAP on expansion groups are specific to states who spend their own money to cover immigrants lacking “qualified status” under Medicaid. Immigrants without legal status are already ineligible for federally funded Medicaid.
“Despite early conversations and, kind of, conjecture, I think that advocates did a pretty solid job to make it clear that any changes to the FMAP would be devastating,” said Natasha Murphy, health policy director for the Center for American Progress.
Medicaid expansion came to the states as part of the Affordable Care Act, which expanded program eligibility to 138% of the federal poverty level, an expansion that was bolstered by a Supreme Court decision. The expansion came to Ohio under Republican Governor John Kasich.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThe Ohio Department of Medicaid did not respond to a request for comment from the Capital Journal, but as budget discussions were ongoing in Ohio, Maureen Corcoran, director of the ODM, told the Senate Finance Committee that the “magnitude of Medicaid’s fiscal impact is not lost on the department,” and that at that point, no changes had been made at the federal level “that impact the Medicaid program, its funding or requisite services.”
But the language impacted by federal government funding changes would “protect the state from undue financial impacts.”
“This ‘trigger language’ ensures that Ohio can reduce, discontinue, pause or suspend any program if it is impacted by changes to federal funding,” Corcoran said in her April testimony.
Spending on health care services makes up 97.6% of the department’s budget, according to Corcoran, spending that is driven by rate increases that were adopted in the last state budget, the size of the department’s caseload and eligibility.
Anti-poverty advocates fought hard against the state budget provision, and have been watching the congressional budget debates closely, concerned for the more than 770,000 Ohioans who would be at risk if the expansion was taken away.
An analysis of the state budget by the Legislative Service Commission said that if the FMAP is set below 90% in either fiscal year 2026 or 2027, the state Medicaid department would be required to establish a “phased transition plan” to help individuals who are no longer eligible for Medicaid by “redirecting them to private insurance subsidies or charity care programs that provide medical assistance.”
One measure that was removed by the Ohio Senate before the final draft was approved would have established an “assessment” for hospitals and federally qualified health centers “to offset the cost of uncompensated care that may result from providing medical care to former members of Group VIII.”
  Cuts still coming to Medicaid 
Despite the fact that the expansion group may be safe, other elements of the congressional budget bill cut Medicaid funding in the state. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the reconciliation bill would reduce spending for Medicaid nationwide by more than $1 trillion, and nearly 12 million people would lose their health insurance by 2034.
“These cuts have triggered deep concern among leaders across the country about how (and if) hospitals, health care providers and state budgets can absorb such massive losses in revenue,” according to think tank Policy Matters Ohio.
There was one change made to expansion coverage, a provision that eliminates an incentive built into the American Rescue Act to encourage new states to adopt Medicaid expansion. But overall, Medicaid cuts would come mainly from adding work requirements to eligibility for the program and more restrictions on taxes states can levy against medical providers to fund Medicaid programs.
The provision to change taxes to medical providers was revised to comply with procedural rules. Now allowed into the federal budget bill, the measure would lower the hospital taxes expansion states can levy to 3.5%, rather than the previous 6%, starting in 2028.
Advocates are concerned about the impact Medicaid changes could have on hospitals, particularly already struggling rural hospitals.
Prior to the work requirements measure in the budget reconciliation bill, Ohio submitted a request to include a “pre-enrollment requirement” for the Medicaid expansion group specifically, at the direction of the legislature in its previous state budget. In order to implement new regulations, the state must ask for a waiver of a section of the Social Security Act. The waivers allow states to try “demonstrations,” or pilot projects, related to federally-support programs like Medicaid.
“The Medicaid program was created as part of a much larger legislative and social agenda and was a part of a war on poverty,” the Ohio Department of Medicaid wrote in their waiver application. “Central to this demonstration is the premise that this covered group is the quintessential safety net for those who need it while improving their situation and reaching independence.”
The state agency said the pre-enrollment requirement would “limit pathways to qualifying for this covered group.”
Under the state’s plan, Ohioans applying to be covered under the expansion group would have fall under at least one of the state-established criteria. Those qualified to enroll in the expansion must be at least 55; be employed; be enrolled in school or an occupational training program; participate in an alcohol or drug addiction treatment program; or have “intensive physical health care needs or serious mental illness,” according to the application.
While current federal law bars Medicaid eligibility on a work requirement, waivers like the one Ohio requested were approved for 13 states during the last Trump administration, according to KFF.
The budget reconciliation bill would flip current law and require at least 80 hours per month of work or certain other activities for individuals ages 19 to 64 applying for Medicaid coverage, including those in the expansion groups. Parents with children ages 13 and younger are exempt.
The U.S. House passed the budget on Thursday afternoon, sending it to President Donald Trump, who is expected to sign it.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The average cost for a 10-person Fourth of July will cost $70.92, which is 30 cents less than last summer but the second highest cookout cost since 2013, when the American Farm Bureau Federation began its annual survey on the topic.
Beef, canned goods, and hand-picked crops have the highest price increases from last year, due likely to low domestic cattle inventory, aluminum tariffs, and the cost of labor.
The American Farm Bureau survey assumes a gathering of 10 people who will consume: cheeseburgers, chicken breasts, pork chops, potato chips, canned pork and beans, fresh strawberries, homemade potato salad, fresh-squeezed lemonade, chocolate chip cookies and ice cream.
Canned of pork and beans had the steepest increase, 8.2% or 20 cents, from last year. The bureau said labor costs along the supply chain and steep tariffs on aluminum are likely to blame.
Homemade lemonade will also cost 20 cents more per pitcher this year, and strawberries 8 cents more per pound, due to a continued trend of high labor costs in the specialty crop sector.
The cost of ground beef increased to $13.33 for two pounds, which is nearly 60 cents more than the $12.77 cost in 2024. While normally a crowd favorite, it will cost families nearly $20 to make 10 cheeseburgers this weekend, according to the survey prices.

U.S. cattle herd size has been declining since 2019, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported the 2025 herd size was 8% lower than 2019 herd. The amount of beef imported to the U.S. has also gone up in that time.
Pork chops, on the other hand, had the largest decrease in price from last year. Three pounds of pork chops this weekend should run consumers about $14.13, which is nearly 9% less than the cut cost last year. The survey concludes this is due to high domestic pork supplies.
The cost of chicken breasts declined slightly from last year’s cookout prices but the cost of eggs increased, which made potato salad about 20 cents more expensive this year. Poultry have been affected by the ongoing highly pathogenic avian influenza, which has caused fluctuating prices as the supply chains are affected.
Since January, the U.S. has imported about 10 times the amount of shell eggs it imported in the same period in 2024 as part of the administration’s plan to combat the bird flu. Wholesale egg prices have declined by more than 60% since January, but the American Farm Bureau report shows the cost for consumers for just four eggs is up 54% from last summer.
The bureau survey also breaks prices down by region and found cookouts on the East Coast are the cheapest this year at $63.79, followed by the south who can feed a party of 10 for $68.93. Gatherings in the West average at $73.50 and Midwestern gatherings come in as the second most expensive at $69.87.
 Farmers not pocketing fair share, advocates say

Consumer increases don’t necessarily mean higher prices for farmers, however. On average, farmers and ranchers receive about $0.16 per consumer dollar spent on food, according to the latest “Farmer’s Share” report from National Farmers Union.
Rob Larew, the organization’s president said it’s important to highlight the “growing imbalance” in the food system.
“Family farmers and ranchers are working harder than ever, yet taking home less, while corporate monopolies in processing, distribution, and retail rake in record profits,” Larew said. “Farmers deserve a fair share of the food dollar, and consumers deserve a food system that works for everyone, not just a handful of powerful corporations.”
According to the report, a rancher takes home $2.08 on a one pound package of ground beef sold for $5.99. A lettuce farmer gets an even lower cut, receiving about 8.2% of the consumer dollar.
Consumers also feel like their dollars don’t stretch as far. According to the latest food and farm index from Iowa Farm Bureau, price is the number one factor for Iowa shoppers as they fill their grocery carts, even as more consumers say they want to buy locally raised products.
Christopher Pudenz, an Iowa Farm Bureau economist, said price changes in Iowa-grown commodities “mostly reflect” supply and demand cycles.
“The Fourth of July is, of course, a celebration of our freedom but also a celebration of the American spirit, one embodied by our nation’s farmers,” Pudenz said in a press release. “Despite challenges like rising costs and weather impacts, Iowa farmers continue to do what they’ve always done — work hard, adapt, and provide for American families.”

President Donald Trump’s proposed fiscal year 2026 discretionary budget is called a “skinny budget” because it’s short on line-by-line details.

But historic preservation efforts in the U.S. did get a mention – and they might as well be skinned to the bone.
Trump has proposed to slash funding for the federal Historic Preservation Fund to only $11 million, which is $158 million less than the fund’s previous reauthorization in 2024. The presidential discretionary budget, however, always heads to Congress for appropriation. And Congress always makes changes.
That said, the Trump administration hasn’t even released the $188 million that Congress appropriated for the fund for the 2025 fiscal year, essentially impounding the funding stream that Congress created in 1976 for historic preservation activities across the nation.
I’m a scholar of historic preservation who’s worked to secure historic designations for buildings and entire neighborhoods. I’ve worked on projects that range from making distressed neighborhoods in St. Louis eligible for historic tax credits to surveying Cold War-era hangars and buildings on seven U.S. Air Force bases.
I’ve seen the ways in which the Historic Preservation Fund helps local communities maintain and rehabilitate their rich architectural history, sparing it from deterioration, the wrecking ball or the pressures of the private market.
 A rare, deficit-neutral funding model

Most Americans probably don’t realize that the task of historic preservation largely falls to individual states and Native American tribes.
The National Historic Preservation Act that President Lyndon B. Johnson signed into law in 1966 requires states and tribes to handle everything from identifying potential historic sites to reviewing the impact of interstate highway projects on archaeological sites and historic buildings. States and tribes are also responsible for reviewing nominations of sites in the National Register of Historic Places, the nation’s official list of properties deemed worthy of preservation.
However, many states and tribes didn’t have the capacity to adequately tackle the mandates of the 1966 act. So the Historic Preservation Fund was formed a decade later to alleviate these costs by funneling federal resources into these efforts.
The fund is actually the product of a conservative, limited-government approach.
Created during Gerald Ford’s administration, it has a revenue-neutral model, meaning that no tax dollars pay for the program. Instead, it’s funded by private lease royalties from the Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas reserves.
Most of these reserves are located in federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico and off the coast of Alaska. Private companies that receive a permit to extract from them must agree to a lease with the federal government. Royalties from their oil and gas sales accrue in federally controlled accounts under the terms of these leases. The Office of Natural Resources Revenue then directs 1.5% of the total royalties to the Historic Preservation Fund.
Congress must continually reauthorize the amount of funding reserved for the Historic Preservation Fund, or it goes unfunded.

Despite bipartisan support, the fund has been threatened in the past. President Ronald Reagan attempted to do exactly what Trump is doing now by making no request for funding at all in his 1983 budget. Yet the fund has nonetheless been reauthorized six times since its inception, with terms ranging from five to 10 years.
The program is a crucial source of funding, particularly in small towns and rural America, where privately raised cultural heritage funds are harder to come by. It provides grants for the preservation of buildings and geographical areas that hold historical, cultural or spiritual significance in underrepresented communities. And it’s even involved in projects tied to the nation’s 250th birthday in 2026, such as the rehabilitation of the home in New Jersey where George Washington was stationed during the winter of 1778-79 and the restoration of Rhode Island’s Old State House.
 Filling financial gaps

I’ve witnessed the fund’s impact firsthand in small communities across the nation.
Edwardsville, Illinois, a suburb of St. Louis, is home to the Leclaire Historic District. In the 1970s, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. The national designation recognized the historic significance of the district, protecting it against any adverse impacts from federal infrastructure funding. It also made tax credits available to the town. Edwardsville then designated LeClaire a local historic district so that it could legally protect the indelible architectural features of its homes, from original decorative details to the layouts of front porches.
Despite the designation, however, there was no clear inventory of the hundreds of houses in the district. A few paid staffers and a volunteer citizen commission not only had to review proposed renovations and demolitions, but they also had to figure out which buildings even contributed to LeClaire’s significance and which ones did not – and thus did not need to be tied up in red tape.

  The Allen House is one of approximately 415 single-family homes in the Leclaire neighborhood in Edwardsville, Ill. Friends of Leclaire
Edwardsville was able to secure a grant through the Illinois State Historic Preservation Office thanks to a funding match enabled by money disbursed to Illinois via the Historic Preservation Fund.
In 2013, my team created an updated inventory of the historic district, making it easier for the local commission to determine which houses should be reviewed carefully and which ones don’t need to be reviewed at all.
 Oil money better than no money

The historic preservation field, not surprisingly, has come out strongly against Trump’s proposal to defund the Historic Preservation Fund.
Nonetheless, there have been debates within the field over the fund’s dependence on the fossil fuel industry, which was the trade-off that preservationists made decades ago when they crafted the funding model.
In the 1970s, amid the national energy crisis, conservation of existing buildings was seen as a worthy ecological goal, since demolition and new construction required fossil fuels. To preservationists, diverting federal carbon royalties seemed like a power play.
But with the effects of climate change becoming impossible to ignore, some preservationists are starting to more openly critique both the ethics and the wisdom of tapping into a pool of money created through the profits of the oil and gas industry. I’ve recently wondered myself if continued depletion of fossil fuels means that preservationists won’t be able to count on the Historic Preservation Fund as a long-term source of funding.
That said, you’d be hard-pressed to find a preservationist who thinks that destroying the Historic Preservation Fund would be a good first step in shaping a more visionary policy.
For now, Trump’s administration has only sown chaos in the field of historic preservation. Already, Ohio has laid off one-third of the staffers in its State Historic Preservation Office due to the impoundment of federal funds. More state preservation offices may follow suit. The National Council of State Historic Preservation Officers predicts that states soon could be unable to perform their federally mandated duties.
Unfortunately, many people advocating for places important to their towns and neighborhoods may end up learning the hard way just what the Historic Preservation Fund does.

The Declaration explained why the Thirteen Colonies at war with the Kingdom of Great Britain regarded themselves as thirteen independent sovereign states no longer under British rule. With the Declaration these new states took a collective first step toward forming the United States of America. The declaration was signed by representatives from New Hampshire, Massachusetts Bay, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia.In Congress, July 4, 1776
The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America 
When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.–That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, –That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.–Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.
He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.
He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.
He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.
He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.
He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.
He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.
He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.
He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.
He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.
He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.
He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.
He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.
He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:
For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:
For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:
For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:
For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:
For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:
For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences
For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:
For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:
For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.
He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.
He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.
He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.
He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.
He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.
In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.
Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.
We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.

(Eric Thomas for Kansas Reflector)If you drive up to a fireworks tent in eastern Kansas this week, the caricatured face of Eddie Shay might welcome you on a banner. 
“EDDIE’S FIREWORKS,” the sign will read. “LIGHTING WICKS SINCE ‘76.”
“I was lighting wicks way before that,” Shay says.
However, it was 49 years ago when he started selling fireworks, launching a family business that now uses his smiling face — hair escaping from a ball cap — as the logo. On the crown of the ball cap? A lit firecracker.
His children put his face on T-shirts, hats, banners and stickers without him knowing once they became part of the fireworks business.
One T-shirt places Shay on Mount Rushmore, between Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln. Honest Abe, Thomas Jefferson and Shay all sport red, tinted sunglasses.
“That was a little embarrassing there for a while,” Shay said. “In fact, I’m wearing a hat with my face on it now.”
This column was not supposed to be about Eddie Shay. I was almost done writing a column about the fireworks code in La Cygne — the municipal code that audaciously allows you to light your fireworks from 6 a.m. to midnight for nine days surrounding the Fourth of July.
However, that really is all that you need to know about that story.
Shay’s tale is the one you need to hear. It was definitely the one I needed to hear as we celebrate America’s 249th birthday.
I called Shay because he owns a fireworks store in La Cygne. I thought he might have a quick comment about how the city allows so many days of fireworks.
I caught him at his house on a landline (“I don’t even carry a phone anymore.”). Two days before the holiday, he had stopped there to pick some tomatoes and zucchini from the garden.
Instead of a brief quote, I learned about Eddie’s love of fireworks — an emotional, generational love for a side business that he started while working as a rough-in carpenter. Our talk was interrupted a few times as he paused to dry his tears and grab a drink of water.
“I’m almost 78,” Shay said. “And here I’m crying like a baby.”
I asked how much longer he would work the grinding hours at summer fireworks stands.
“I don’t even know why I’m doing this,” Shay said, holding back tears. “I’m sorry.”
He took a long pause to compose himself before saying that he will probably let one of his children take over his part of the business.
He paused again, the tears welling. He continued, describing the families who visit the store without enough money to buy their kids the fireworks they want.
“There’s nothing like it. When there’s a family that’s kind of struggling in life, and when it comes to money and buying fireworks … I don’t know why I’m doing this,” Shay said, wiping away tears.
He continued: “Anyway, to hand that little person something they were really eyeballing a lot, and just give it to them. To me, that’s kind of Fourth of July. Yeah. The smile. The smile. And I don’t even know why that is emotional for me. I don’t know. But anyway, that’s the truth.”
  Eddie Shay’s face has become the logo for fireworks stands owned by him and his family. Next year will be the 50th anniversary of his first fireworks stand in 1976. (Eric Thomas/Kansas Reflector)
That feeling probably finds inspiration in Shay’s childhood. He told me how he was the fourth of 13 kids in his family, growing up in a two-bedroom house in the country. He remembers his dad making only $250 each month working for the county.
“The reason I get kind of emotional — I’ll get a grip on pretty soon — but I loved fireworks as a kid,” Shay said. “And we didn’t have any, hardly any at all. My parents would definitely wait till the Fourth so we wouldn’t shoot them off.”
Whether owned by himself or by relatives, locations for Eddie’s Fireworks have been outside Edgerton, in La Cygne, Gardner, Wellsville, Paola, Osawatomie and Spring Hill, plus other cities over the years, Shay said.
“I wanted my kids to have that neat, good, great feeling of shooting fireworks,” Shay said. “And so that I wouldn’t have to buy fireworks, I got involved in fireworks.”
He remembers his kids shooting off fireworks from his first stand and on their 20-acre farm in Linn County, far from livestock and other families.
“My kids, when they were little, they shot fireworks year round,” Shay said. “I’m talking little stuff — not the big stuff you’re hearing nowadays.”
His family seems astrologically drawn to the Fourth of July: His brother and sister were born on July 5, while his dad’s birthday was July 1. On Wednesday when we talked, he had just called his son to wish him a happy 49th birthday: July 2.
“My wife was running our first firework stand. Wow. How about that?” Shay said.
Selling fireworks has taught the next two generations lessons that are important to Shay. As we talked, his wife, daughter and two granddaughters were working at the stand.
“Oh my gosh,” he said. “My kids learned how to count money back. It’s not like you go into a store today and people give you money. They actually learned how to count money back to everybody.
“You go into places of business. It’s just kind of cold sometimes. In a business like this, you’ve got to be friendly. It just shines. People respect that. I just feel like if you treat people good … if you have a friendly smile and you’re treating people well and talking to them … I think you’re going to prevail.”
Shay remembers the amount he spent on his entire inventory of fireworks during that first year. That total is less than one of the deluxe fireworks that he sells this year.
“I’m still amazed,” Shay said. “It seems like every year things just keep getting better and prettier.”
To find new products each year, Shay visits trade shows and writes up a “cheat sheet” of products he wants to order.
“We got a lot of new stuff this year,” Shay said. “The different effects that I haven’t even seen before! That’s amazing.”
Even so, he still sells his favorite elaborate fireworks from years ago, ones named “Magic Show” and “Outrageous.”
“I’m old school, you know, and I don’t want things to change,” Shay said. “I’ve been through a lot since ‘76, I’ll be honest with you.”
He recalled summers during the 1980s, when the Kansas grass was so dry that you would start a fire just by throwing a smoke ball in the grass. He lost money one year.
“I was able to still pay the workers, but the fireworks sales were pretty nil that year,” he said. “And I swore after that, if there was ever another year that dry, I would never sell fireworks.”
He recounted how in some cities, there were squabbles over the cost of permits or the cost of renting land. Those politics drove him to sell fireworks elsewhere.
A year from today, Shay will celebrate two milestones: the 50-year anniversary of his business and America’s 250th birthday.
How much longer will Shay work in fireworks?
“I really don’t know at this point,” Shay said. “I really don’t know.”

Right around the Fourth of July, Americans pay renewed attention to the country’s crucial founding document, the Declaration of Independence. Whether Republican or Democrat or independent, some will say – with reverence – that adherence to the values expressed in the declaration is what makes them American.
President Barack Obama, in his second inaugural address, gave voice to this very conviction.
“What binds this nation together,” he stated, “is not the colors of our skin or the tenets of our faith or the origins of our names.” What truly makes Americans American, he resolved, “is our allegiance to an idea, articulated in a declaration made more than two centuries ago.”
The declaration still stands today as a manifesto. There are its lofty, “self-evident” principles, of course: that “all men are created equal” and that they are “endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights” such as “Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.”
But I’m a historian of the early republic, and I wish to remind you that the declaration doesn’t just go all pie in the sky. And it’s more than an academic paper waxing on and on about the fashionable philosophical doctrines of the 18th century – freedom and equality – or the coolest philosopher ever, John Locke.
The declaration provides a realistic depiction of a wounded society, one shivering with fears and teetering on the brink of disaster.
 Repeated injuries and usurpations

On June 11, 1776, the Continental Congress asked five of its members to prepare a text that would notify the British king and his Parliament of America’s firm intention to get a divorce.
The drafting committee comprised Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania, John Adams of Massachusetts, Roger Sherman of Connecticut, Robert R. Livingston of New York, and a man who had a stellar reputation as a gifted writer, Thomas Jefferson of Virginia.
Jefferson didn’t waste time. He locked himself up in a rented room near the State House in Philadelphia, and within a couple of days he was ready to submit a draft to his four teammates for revision.
The committee was smitten by the clarity and effectiveness of the document. Other than suggesting a few corrections, Jefferson’s colleagues were elated by the text.
The Continental Congress promptly received the document, discussed it, made a handful of alterations, and in the late morning of July 4, 1776, adopted it.
Late that night, Philadelphia printer John Dunlap was given the historic task of issuing the first copies of the final Declaration of Independence.
In retrospect, all of this may sound like a tale of fearless heroes eager to break the chains of oppression and single-handedly affirm their boundless love of freedom.
However, when Thomas Jefferson took the pen in his hand, he didn’t think of himself as a hero. Rather, looking ahead at the immediate future and the drama that would inexorably unfold, he felt overwhelmed. A war, pitting brethren against brethren, the Colonists against their mother country, had already started.
The situation was tense and painful, because 18th-century Americans didn’t quite see themselves as Americans. They trusted they were active members of a powerful, expanding British Empire.
What had begun as yet another crisis over Parliament’s right to tax its overseas possessions had quickly transformed into a turning point over whether the Colonies should become independent.
As a consequence, readers of the declaration cannot escape the impression that this document carries a sense of reluctance, betrayal, fear and even sadness.
We Colonists thought we were free, the logic of the declaration goes, but now we are waking up to the dismal realization that the king and the Parliament treat us like their personal slaves.
Jefferson’s words appear to longingly express how wonderful it would be for “one people” not to be put in the condition to “dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another.” How desirable it would have been if a way to renew “the ties of our common kindred” could be found.
Unfortunately, what Jefferson calls “repeated injuries and usurpations” have created enemies out of a common ancestry, thus stifling the “voice of justice and of consanguinity.”
How not to grieve at these “injuries”? The king is guilty for “abolishing our most valuable Laws”; he has “excited domestic insurrections amongst us”; he has sent “Officers to harass our people”; he has obstructed “the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners”; and he has “made Judges dependent on his Will alone.”
Americans didn’t seek a revolution, the declaration concludes, but Colonists must accept “the necessity” of a separation: “Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government.”
 ‘Forget our former love for them’

Americans today may believe that the Declaration of Independence belongs to them – which it does. The declaration is an American document.
But to an even larger extent, it belongs to Thomas Jefferson. It’s a Jeffersonian document.
One of the most consequential American philosophers, the author of the declaration poured into the text his theories of society and of human nature.
For him, human beings should not live as isolated atoms in constant competition against each other. Jefferson was a communitarian, which means that he believed that the very happiness voiced in the declaration could occur only when individuals regard themselves as functional parts of a larger whole made of other human beings.
The declaration was built upon the tenet that, as Jefferson would explain many years later, “Nature hath implanted in our breasts a love of others, a sense of duty to them, a moral instinct in short, which prompts us irresistibly to feel and to succour their distresses.”
As a moral philosopher, Jefferson wasn’t perfect, obviously – and his views on race and slavery prove that. But the declaration puts forth the argument that the British king and the Parliament are also to blame for having transformed a united people, a people who used to love each other, into a mass of foreigners suspicious of each other.
In Jefferson’s account, this king has carried out the supreme betrayal – like tyrannical powers often do. He has stabbed the Americans as well as the British. He has split them into antagonistic parties. And we Americans, as Jefferson wrote in a telling passage of the declaration that didn’t survive revisions, “must endeavor to forget our former love for them.”
The American nation was born of the traumatic experience of an amputation. It’s a residual half of a former whole that one way or another managed to learn to become a whole again.
But after 250 years, America appears once more a people who seem to have lost what binds them together. Those “political bands which have connected them with another” are being tested; “the ties of … common kindred” are frayed.
Such words describe a time, centuries ago, of great uncertainty, fear and sadness. It seems America has arrived yet again at such a time.

(Photo by Shalina Chatlani/Stateline)LAKE PROVIDENCE, La. — East Carroll Parish sits in the northeastern corner of Louisiana, along the winding Mississippi River. Its seat, Lake Providence, was a thriving agricultural center of the Delta. Now, the town is a shell of its former self. Charred and dilapidated buildings dot the small city center. There are a few gas stations, a handful of restaurants — and little to no industry.
Mayor Bobby Amacker, 79, says at one point “you couldn’t even walk down the street” in Lake Providence’s main business district because “there were so many people.”
“It’s gone down tremendously in the last 50 years,” said Amacker, a Democrat. “The town, it looks like it’s drying up. And it’s almost unstoppable, as far as I can tell.”
Now, East Carroll residents stand to lose even more. Like many people in Louisiana, they received a lifeline when the state expanded Medicaid to more low-income adults in 2016. Expansion drove Louisiana’s uninsured rate to the lowest in the Deep South, at 8% in 2023 for working-age adults, according to state data, despite it having the highest poverty rate in the U.S. that year.

This week, the U.S. Senate approved President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful” tax and spending bill. It includes more than $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, the joint state-federal health insurance program for poor families and individuals, to help pay for tax cuts that mostly benefit the rich. The legislation would cause 11.8 million more Americans to become uninsured by 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
The bill includes new work rules for Medicaid recipients and would require them to verify their eligibility more frequently. It also would limit a financing strategy that states have used to boost Medicaid payments to hospitals.
Republicans say enrollees are taking advantage of the Medicaid program and getting benefits when they shouldn’t be. They say the program costs too much and states are not paying their fair share.
The Delta region, which includes communities in both Louisiana and Mississippi, would suffer under such large cuts. But in Louisiana — where almost half of the state depended on Medicaid in 2023, the Louisiana Department of Health reported — the cuts could be ruinous. Louisiana could lose up to $35 billion in federal Medicaid support over the next decade, according to KFF, a health policy research group. Mississippi, which never expanded Medicaid, could still lose up to $5 billion.
Residents are watching with apprehension, fear and, sometimes, anger, wondering how Congress could be so blind to how much they are struggling.
“If they take that away from us and everyone that really needs it, that’s going to be bad,” said Sherila Ervin, who lives 20 minutes up the road from Lake Providence in Oak Grove and has Medicaid coverage.

  Dilapidated buildings dot downtown Lake Providence, La. (Photo by Shalina Chatlani/Stateline)Medicaid work requirements and other health care provisions in the bill ignore the reality of living in poorer rural communities, where people struggle to find the jobs, transportation and internet access required to meet the rules, according to interviews with people and providers in the Delta region.
Even though Louisiana and Mississippi have taken very different approaches to Medicaid — one expanded eligibility under the 2010 Affordable Care Act and the other didn’t — both rely heavily on the program to sustain access to medical care for all their residents.
On a hot summer day in June, Ervin walks into the bare-bones 99-cent store in downtown Lake Providence. As she looks over some clothing, she says she’s heard about the potential Medicaid cuts. But she hadn’t heard about the work requirements, and is shocked they’re even on the table.
“I don’t like that. I don’t think they should put a stipulation on that,” Ervin says, exasperated that she would have to report her work hours. It’s hard enough as it is, she says, to thrive in this community.
In the Deep South, health care fights echo civil rights battles

Ervin, 58, has been working at Oak Grove High School in the cafeteria, serving hot plates to children for two decades. She says it’s one of the good, steady jobs available in this area, but her income is only around $1,500 per month.
Ervin’s job offers health benefits, but she can’t afford the premiums on her salary. She relies on Medicaid for care, including medications for her high blood pressure.
In East Carroll Parish, around 46.5% of people live below the poverty level, meaning the area is overwhelmingly poor, at over four times the national poverty rate, with a median income of $28,321. For Black households, the figure is a mere $16,690.
Expansion was a lifeline for people such as Ervin. Louisiana offers Medicaid to people who earn below 138% of the federal poverty line — currently about $22,000 a year for an individual.
“Sometimes you can work, but then when you work, you still can’t pay to get help,” Ervin said.
It’s a similar economic situation an hour away across the river. Poverty is about three times the national rate in Washington County, Mississippi, where residents in the city of Greenville lament the consequences of not being able to avoid destructive medical debt, which can keep them stuck in a cycle of gig work and of living paycheck to paycheck.
Greenville, the county seat, is among the fastest-shrinking cities in the U.S. It’s still one of the larger rural cities in Mississippi, with coffee shops, restaurants, hotels, a regional hospital and several big-box stores. But the downtown has just a few small businesses and a bank, and residents say jobs are hard to find.
Greenville resident April McNair, 45, remembers giving birth 17 years ago, long before Mississippi extended postpartum Medicaid to a full year. She had Medicaid coverage during pregnancy, but was kicked off shortly after giving birth, despite having post-delivery complications.

  April McNair, 45, is a resident of Greenville, Miss. (Photo by Shalina Chatlani/Stateline)The result was a trip to the emergency room and a $2,500 bill she couldn’t cover. Right after giving birth, McNair looked for work. She said potential employers often told her that she was overqualified because she had a master’s degree.
“I had to kind of figure out how to make my ends meet,” McNair said. “I ended up with a significant bill, all because I did not have Medicaid.”
McNair feels like Mississippi leaders are making a mistake by continuing to reject full Medicaid expansion.
“That’s a selfish move. To me, they’re selfish,” McNair said, adding that now she’s worried for neighbors in Louisiana who may lose the lifeline she wishes she had.
“God forbid, hypothetically speaking, what if one of them meets their demise because of this bill that [Congress] passed?”
 Hard to thrive

Mississippi experienced its first taste of equalized access to medicine in the late 1960s.
Delta Health Center, the first federally funded health center in the nation, opened during the peak of the Civil Rights Movement in the all-Black town of Mound Bayou, about an hour north of Greenville. The center vowed to care for anyone regardless of race or ability to pay in a region plagued with poverty, poor health and discrimination — and continues to do so to this day.
It was a significant opportunity for generations of African Americans who had gone without health care, in a place where people had no access to clean drinking water, running sewage systems or even food, said Robin Boyles, chief program planning and development officer at Delta Health Center.
But it wasn’t easy for the clinic to mobilize support, even though it was clearly needed. Before its opening, it faced pushback from politicians and even doctors. In a 1966 clipping from a local newspaper, the white-owned Bolivar Commercial, the editorial board railed against the new clinic, saying it would “lead further to socialized medicine.”


The situation is certainly better in Mississippi and Louisiana than it was in the 1960s, but critics say the Medicaid cuts could reverse hard-fought progress.
People who live in the Delta are fiercely proud of their communities, but conditions there make it hard to thrive.
Black residents, who are the overwhelming majority, have had a particularly hard time. After the Civil War, many were relegated to sharecropping of cotton and corn for subsistence. Meanwhile, an elite white class of plantation owners and investors amassed enormous amounts of wealth.
A 2001 report from the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights described the area as one with “limited economic resources; inadequate employment opportunities; insufficient decent, affordable housing; and poor quality public schools.”
“We have a lot of patients that are one health issue away from either being out of a job or being bankrupt because of a trip to the emergency room,” said Dr. Brent Smith, a physician at a primary care clinic at Delta Health System in Greenville.
Even some of the most vulnerable people, such as new moms in Mississippi, still struggle to get basic care, in part because the state has left billions of dollars in federal funding for Medicaid expansion on the table, said Dr. Lakeisha Richardson, an OB-GYN at Delta Health System.
“There are a lot of maternal [care] deserts in Mississippi where women have to travel 60 miles or more just to get prenatal care and just to get to the closest hospital for delivery,” Richardson said. “And I don’t see that getting any better in Mississippi and in rural areas.”
Richardson says nearly all her patients are working moms, many of whom would really benefit from having Medicaid expansion.
“America doesn’t realize that there are people out here struggling for no reason of their own,” she said.
That’s why Medicaid expansion in Louisiana in 2016, much like the community health center movement in Mississippi, was a bright spot in the rural South, said Smith.
“Louisiana expanded Medicaid, a surprising move in the South to see any state expand,” Smith said. “They saw it for what it was, which was a very real opportunity to assist this specific group of patients.”

(Photo by Shalina Chatlani/Stateline)In Mississippi, 20 rural hospitals are at immediate risk of closure, according to a recent report, more than double the number at risk in Louisiana. In many cases, Medicaid is the largest and most reliable payer for rural hospitals. While Louisiana’s overall uninsured rate plummeted to 8.3% by 2023, in Mississippi it was 10.5%.
“Unlike a lot of our Southern peers, we have not had the same level of closures of facilities,” said Courtney Foster, senior policy adviser for Medicaid, with the nonprofit Invest in Louisiana.
“Medicaid was like a real lifeline for people in transition. Oftentimes it was people who had lost their jobs and were just looking to get back on their feet.”
Now, the new work and reporting requirements could put that progress at risk.

In East Carroll Parish, finding a job — let alone a good-paying one with health benefits — is difficult, says Rosie Brown, executive director at the East Carroll Community Action Agency, a nonprofit that helps low-income people with their rent and utility bills. Many of the jobs available in town pay minimum wage, just $7.25 an hour.
Brown loves living in Lake Providence; this is where her family is. She doesn’t want to move but wishes the government would invest more in her community — not take away benefits that help people who are hanging on by a thread.
“We have one bank. We have one supermarket,” she said. “Transportation isn’t easy either.”
Local infrastructure is so limited, she’s even heard of some people charging residents $20 for a ride to Walmart. Some people have to hitch a ride an hour away to go to work, she said.
“There’s nowhere to go,” Brown said.
Dominique Jones works at the local library, where she helps roughly 75 to 85 people per month apply for programs such as Medicaid and food assistance. Many of the residents she helps don’t have access to the internet or even a computer, a real barrier for people who’d be required to report their working hours to state Medicaid officials.
“This town right here is made up of a lot of old people that need Medicaid and Medicare. And without it, they wouldn’t have any kind of health care at all,” Mayor Amacker said.

Nevada Qualls, 25, sits across from Amacker’s office. She earns just $12 an hour as a cashier at city hall. The low pay means she qualifies for Medicaid expansion coverage, which is good because she can’t afford the premiums for private insurance.
“I feel like there should be a higher threshold for people that can get Medicaid, because they’re still struggling,” she said.
At the 99-cent store, school district worker Ervin wonders whether state and federal leaders understand what it’s like to live in her community, urging them to visit and see for themselves.
“They want to do stuff for the rich people that’s already rich,” she said. “What are they doing? It’s almost like there’s no common sense with them.”
 ‘The tremble factors’

While leaders in the U.S. Senate were working into the night this past weekend debating Trump’s tax and spending bill, Greenville resident Jennifer Morris was praying for the pain to stay away.
Morris, 44, has hemicrania continua, a headache disorder that causes constant pain on one side of her head. There’s no underlying trigger and no cure. Her doctors help her keep the pain to a minimum with regular treatments that include dozens of injections into her head.
“It doesn’t take the pain away,” she said during a late-night gathering in Greenville’s Greater Mount Olivet Missionary Baptist Church in June. “It does reduce the pain so that I’m able to function. But it’s rough.”

  Jennifer Morris, 44, a Greenville, Miss., resident, poses for a photo at Greater Mount Olivet Missionary Baptist Church. (Photo by Shalina Chatlani/Stateline)Morris is worried about the looming Medicaid cuts. She qualifies for Mississippi Medicaid because her condition counts as a disability, and she depends on the coverage to afford her medications.
Morris’ Medicaid may be safer than that of her Delta neighbors in Lake Providence, as some of the most dramatic Medicaid changes being considered — such as work requirements — target Medicaid expansion states only.
But Mississippi could be hurt by a provision in the Senate bill that would target a strategy states have used to boost the Medicaid dollars they get from the federal government.
Mississippi could see a major hit to its Medicaid funds, which “would be a tremendous decrease in revenue for the state,” harming “services and access to care,” says Mitchell Adcock, executive director at the Center for Mississippi Health Policy.
“It would be just the opposite of expansion. It would be a contraction for the Medicaid program in the state,” he said.
Leonard Favorite, a pastor who was attending the same event at Mount Olivet Church, as Morris, says he grew up on a plantation in Louisiana and worked his way out of poverty by joining the Air Force. This type of journey is hard, he said, when you’re already starting from so far behind. He thinks the “big, beautiful bill” will create more roadblocks for poor people.
Glaucoma-related vision loss is often preventable, but many can’t afford treatment

“You have people who are already living below the poverty line and they will certainly be submerged into poverty at unspeakable levels,” said Favorite, 70.“ That seems to be the trend of this administration from the point of view of looking from the outside.
“Poor people are beginning to feel the tremble factors of an administration that caters toward the rich.”
National researchers estimate that up to 132,000 Louisianans who gained health insurance under expansion could lose it under work rules.
But national reports that rely on census data likely underestimate the potential Medicaid losses. For example, while 2023 census data show 47% of East Carroll Parish was on Medicaid, state health data reviewed by Stateline and Public Health Watch suggests the number is more like 64%. Similarly statewide, census data showed about a third of Louisianans were on Medicaid. State data shows that percentage is closer to 46.5%.
Experts such as Joan Alker at the Georgetown Center for Children and Families say the undercounts nationally are a well-known issue among researchers, but it’s difficult to correct because the quality of state reporting can be so uneven.
State Medicaid funding is also at risk. For years, both Mississippi and Louisiana have relied on revenue generated through a financing tool — known as a provider tax — to draw down more federal dollars and boost Medicaid reimbursements to providers. But congressional Republicans hope to limit states’ ability to collect those taxes.
Depending on how Congress restricts provider taxes, Mississippi could lose hundreds of millions in federal Medicaid funding, crucial in a state with such a high uninsured rate, said Richard Roberson, president and CEO of the Mississippi Hospital Association.
“It’s unavoidable that when you’re taking that much money out of the system, that there’s not going to be some repercussions felt even in non-Medicaid expansion states like Mississippi,” Roberson said.
Last week, the Louisiana Hospital Association signed a statement calling the package of Medicaid cuts before Congress “historic in their devastation.”
From her small, sunny office in East Carroll Parish, nurse Jennifer Newton can’t understand the attacks on Medicaid.
Newton, who grew up one parish over in West Carroll, is executive director of the Family Medical Clinic, a community health center in Lake Providence and one of the few health providers in town. She says 50% of the clinic’s patients have Medicaid insurance.

Newton has worked in health care in the area for decades and watched as Medicaid expansion made it possible for more patients to access and afford health care they desperately needed, including preventive services. “It’s absolutely helped,” she said. “Absolutely.”
In 2015, the year before Louisiana expanded Medicaid, the uninsured rate among working-age adults in East Carroll Parish was nearly 35%. By 2021, that number was 12.7%.
“Why are we going back?” Newton asked. “We’ve made so much progress.”
Republican supporters of work requirements, including Louisiana representative and U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, argue they will encourage people to find jobs and ensure Medicaid goes to people who need it most. But according to KFF, a majority of Louisiana adults with Medicaid — 69% — already work.
Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that is working with Republicans to formulate Medicaid cuts, is not concerned about eligible people losing coverage, as has happened under previous work requirement efforts. He says the bill has built in exceptions for certain people and requirements “can be met by not just work,” so “concerns seem pretty overstated.”
Medicaid recipients also can meet the requirement by volunteering or attending school for 80 hours per month.
“It’s hard for me to understand that there are areas in the country where there’s not jobs. There’s always work to be done,” Blase told Stateline. Blase said he believes Medicaid is “the government conditioning welfare for able-bodied working-age adults.”
Republicans target a tax that keeps state Medicaid programs running

But advocates and experts predict East Carroll, where internet access is notoriously bad, would experience results similar to when Arkansas instituted Medicaid work requirements in 2018: People disenrolled because of lack of awareness and confusion over the policy, as well as paperwork errors — not because they weren’t working enough.
“Unless the beneficiary can navigate that red tape, they’re going to lose coverage and become uninsured,” said Benjamin Sommers, a health economist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
Data shows Arkansas’ experiment did not increase employment, Sommers said, and instead led to more people reporting medical debt and delaying care because of cost.
 ‘Take a step back’

People in the Delta — where the legacy of government neglect and discrimination are all around — want politicians to visit their towns and see the barriers people face trying to improve their lives and stay healthy.
“People spent their lives uninsured,” said Amy Hale, a nurse practitioner at East Carroll Medical clinic. “Medicaid expansion allowed them to get in here and be treated.”
Lake Providence residents are scared they may find themselves in a similar situation as McNair and other people across the river in Greenville: working, uninsured, and too poor to access health care.
Recent estimates show up to 317,000 Louisianans could lose Medicaid health insurance under Trump’s tax bill. Nearly 33,000 in Mississippi.
“People are actually trying,” McNair said. “I really wish [lawmakers] would look at it from a different lens. What if it was their kid? Or they didn’t have the salaries they have now and your baby is ill. … Like really take a step back and think about what it is that you’re doing.”

Becky Cover/ Georgia Department of Natural ResourcesWhile the well-known story that Benjamin Franklin wanted the wild turkey to be the national bird may be exaggerated, it is true that the founding father praised the wild gobbler’s virtues in a tongue-in-cheek letter to his daughter.
“For in Truth the Turkey is in Comparison a much more respectable Bird, and withal a true original Native of America. Eagles have been found in all Countries, but the Turkey was peculiar to ours,” Franklin wrote in 1784.

This Independence Day, Georgia Department of Natural Resources’s Bob Sargent says Americans should be grateful we wound up with the eagle on our greenbacks, on our politicians’ podiums and on soldiers’ patches.
“With all due respect to Ben Franklin, the wild turkey is a spectacular bird, but I don’t think there’s much that’s more majestic than the sight of a bald eagle soaring over a lake,” said Sargent, who is a program manager with the department. “So I think that it’s very much an appropriate symbol. The fierceness, the wildness, the size, the beauty of the bird, it’s rareness.”
“And America is a country that’s resilient,” he added. “We’ve come a long way since the 1700s when we were fighting for our independence. And the bald eagle likewise has come a long way since the days that it was an endangered species.”
Sargent is one of the few people who regularly see eagles from above – part of his job is to get out in a helicopter and take a census of eagle nests across Georgia.
“It’s just kind of an awe-inspiring experience to see Georgia from the perspective of 400 to 600 feet, because we cover so much of it, and to see a small piece of the private lives of these birds is just, it’s a gift, it’s a wonderful experience,” he said.
This year’s survey focused on the coast and the southern part of the state and found the birds nesting at average on the coast to just below average levels in the southern part of the state. Of 176 active nests, 127 were successful, fledging an estimated 190 eaglets.
Accounting for areas not monitored this year, Sargent said the numbers suggest Georgia has maintained over 200 nest territories a year for the past decade.
Sargent said a decline of successful nesting in southern Georgia over last year may be a result of storm damage from last year’s major hurricanes or a delayed impact from avian influenza, which hit eagles on the coast hard in 2022.
But he said the dip should not detract from the eagle’s huge success over the past five decades.
“The overall trend is very encouraging – 25 years ago, we only recorded 55 nest territories in the whole state and in the decade that was the 1970s there was only one successful nest recorded the entire 10 years,” he said. “So we’ve come a long way. Bald eagles in Georgia are still rare. It’s still listed as a threatened species under state law, but it’s going in the right direction. Since 2015, we know that we’ve had at least 200 nest territories in the state per year, so that’s very encouraging news.”
The state agency cites a 1972 federal ban on the pesticide DDT, which significantly weakens eagles’ eggshells, as a major factor in the birds’ recovery, along with the enactment of the federal Clean Water and Clean Air acts, protection through the Endangered Species Act, increased public awareness, restoration of local populations through release programs and forest regrowth.

Eagle earmarks
But Sargent said he is cautious about whether the federal budget cuts could inadvertently harm efforts to help eagles recover.
Funding for conservation programs for non-game species like bald eagles comes from something called the State Wildlife Grants Program, which is an annual congressional allocation.
“I sometimes have people say to me, ‘Your funding should be fine because it’s coming from hunting licenses,’ but that’s actually not true,” Sargent said. “We’re concerned about the future of the State Wildlife Grants Program. We’re monitoring that. Right now, it’s unclear what’s going to happen to that grants program.”
Georgia Wildlife Federation President Mike Worley said his group and others are lobbying members of Congress to keep that funding coming to states.
“It’s not a lot of money across the whole nation. It has been around something like $72 million. Georgia’s been getting about $1.6 million over the last few years for doing our work. And it’s really critical for the work that goes on here, whether it’s work on gopher tortoises or the bald eagle population that we’ve seen tremendous success and tremendous recovery with.”
While charismatic critters like eagles may get a lot of attention, plenty of lesser known plants and animals also need help, Worley said.
“It will be working on some darters in some of the streams in Georgia, some mussels that live in North Georgia streams – Georgia is one of the most biologically diverse states in the country, and we’ve got well in excess of 1,000 species that when we look across the state are in some degree of pretty significant concern,” he said. “And so the state wildlife action plan which identifies all of those and puts together a methodology for protecting them is really critical, and those state and tribal wildlife grants are the funding mechanism for that effort to recover the species.”

Brown/Maryland Matters).Maryland distributed more than $23 million at the end of June to help the families of more than a half-million low-income children afford food this summer while school is out.
The payments, $40 per kid per month, mark the kickoff of the second summer of the state’s Sun Bucks program, a newer federal grocery benefit that provides food assistance to families  struggling with food insecurity, helping them replace school meals that students in low-income families often rely on.
The program is expected to help about 579,000 children this summer.
“What Sun Bucks does is it puts groceries on the tables for families when our students are out of school during summer break,” Human Services Secretary Rafael López said in a recent interview. “We want to make sure that every kid, every child throughout the state of Maryland taps those resources for June, July and August.”
Lopez is excited to oversee the second year of Maryland Sun Bucks and continue last year’s efforts, when more than 600,000 Maryland kids received $120 over the course of the summer to help afford groceries, totaling to $72 million in benefits issued.
Hanging over his excitement, however, was the looming budget reconciliation bill that won final congressional approval Thursday. Among many cuts in the nearly 900-page bill is a $230 billion reduction in food assistance programs over 10 years.

For now, López said, Sun Bucks is funded for this summer, meaning that families in the program can count on getting Sun Bucks assistance for groceries through the end of August.
“Maryland Sun Bucks” is the kid-friendly name for the state’s Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer Program, which offers families $40 per month per child to spend on groceries when school is out. The U.S. Department of Agriculture launched Sun Bucks last year, and Maryland was one of dozens of states that volunteered to administer the program.
This year, Maryland is one of 37 states participating in Sun Bucks, along with Washington, D.C., several U.S. territories and tribes in Oklahoma.
Thousands of kids in low-income families lose access to free meals from their schools when students are released for summer break. Families often struggle to afford food to replace those meals during the summer months, leading to a phenomenon known as “summer hunger.”
“We know that a lot of kids receive the bulk of their meals during the school year,” said LaMonika Jones, interim president for Maryland Hunger Solutions. “Sun Bucks … are guaranteed ways that we can make sure that kids who reside in food-insecure households — that they’re able to receive that nutrition that they are not receiving in the same way that they would during the school year with school meals.”
Future of Sun Bucks threatened
Over 90% of families who qualify for Sun Bucks are enrolled automatically because they already qualify for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) or similar benefits. That makes the recently passed budget bill major concern for advocates and state officials.
Sun Bucks is not directly mentioned in the budget reconciliation bill. But advocates say increased eligibility requirements for SNAP, as well as reduced funding, will have ripple effects on programs like Sun Bucks.
“When you look at some of the provisions within the budget bill, knowing that SNAP is used to determine eligibility for Sun Bucks … we’re putting at risk these children that reside in SNAP households,” Jones said.
“For students that are automatically certified for Sun Bucks, we’re using their SNAP household data,” she said. “If those households are no longer eligible for SNAP, then that means we have a large number of students … that we now have to send through additional hoops and hurdles in order to feed their families during summer, when we know hunger is most challenging.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The budget reconciliation bill, which President Donald Trump is scheduled to sign into law Friday afternoon, will also make running SNAP more costly for the state, which could further jeopardize funding for food assistance programs as the state tries to offset higher administration costs.
The Maryland Department of Human Services estimates that the bill would require $412.5 million more in state funds to operate SNAP at current levels. The so-called One Big Beautiful Bill calls on the state to contribute up to 15% of SNAP funds, and 75% in administrative costs. Currently, administrative costs are shared 50/50 between the state and federal governments, and thefeds cover all of the funding for the benefit itself.
“What we’re looking at is having to balance the ability to administer these benefits and then take the cost of that – which unfortunately means that states will have to make a really hard decision,” Jones said, noting that some states like Texas already plan to end their Sun Bucks programs due to the increased costs of administering SNAP.
López says state officials are still “trying to get our head around these impacts.”
“They are massive. They will be felt across the state,” he said. That said, he noted that most of the cuts will not be felt until next year or later.
“It will take a little bit of time for those cuts to be experienced. But at the end of the day, they are still cuts to benefits for Marylanders,” López said. “This year, Sun Bucks are paid for. This year, SNAP benefits are paid for.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_4578-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-04 02:59:54.794771

Jackson and county police said Zheng Hui Xie, 30, of Flushing, New York, and Jianwei Wang, 27, of Monterey Park, California, impersonated Federal Trade Commission officials in order to convince the resident, who was not named, that there had been fraudulent activity on her Apple ID and that several accounts were compromised.
The resident received a text message on April 28 about a large purchase made on her account, and called a number provided. The person who answered claimed to be with a fraud department, and transferred the woman to an individual who claimed to be an FTC agent.
On two separate occasions, the resident was asked to withdraw money from her bank in order to secure her money. She handed the money over to the fake agents who came to her home.
When the resident received another phone call May 15 from an unknown number, and was told to withdraw $24,000, she contacted police. On May 23, investigators with the Prince George’s County Police Department’s Financial Crimes Unit arrested Xie and Wang.

	Both men are charged with two counts of theft, one count of theft scheme and one count of conspiracy to commit theft. Police said the men could face additional charges, along with others who may have helped them defraud other residents in financial schemes that may have netted a combined $700,000.
Although senior citizens are mostly preyed upon in similar schemes, Jackson said scammers also target those who are “very responsible.”
“If somebody texts you and says, ‘If you don’t pay this money immediately, then your license is going to be suspended,’ most of us that are responsible don’t want our license suspended,” she said. “Our message to our residents and others is to make sure that you just don’t respond.”

(Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)The Maryland General Assembly spent countless hours on energy reform this session, and emerged with a package of bills aimed at lowering customer costs.
But bills are still rising — and not only because of summer heatwaves — and a group of Baltimore policymakers and advocates called for more to be done Thursday.
The group, led by Baltimore City Council President Zeke Cohen, gathered outside Baltimore Gas & Electric headquarters and pressed the Maryland Public Service Commission to bring an end to multiyear rate cases, which let utilities apply for several years of rate increases at a time. The plans have “delivered record profits to Exelon shareholders at the expense of hard-working Baltimoreans,” Cohen said, referencing BGE’s parent company.
Del. Elizabeth Embry (D-Baltimore City) said the Next Generation Energy Act, passed this year, gave regulators the tools to address multiyear rate plans and excessive natural gas infrastructure replacements, which she called major contributors to higher bills. The act lets the PSC approve multiyear rate plans only if the utility “demonstrates the customer benefits of the investment.”
“We are now here asking for those tools to be implemented and for the spirit of that legislation to be respected,” Embry said.
A BGE spokesperson pushed back against the notion that multiyear plans were harming customers.
“All of the work we do, we do to benefit customers — full stop,” said BGE’s Nick Alexopulos.
If a utility receives approval on a multiyear rate plan, the new law does not let allow them to file for reconciliation after the fact, which would let them recover additional costs from ratepayers.
The PSC, for its part, is still evaluating the law, which only took effect June 1, and determining how to alter its procedures on multiyear ratemaking, Commission Chairman Fred Hoover said.

“Does it make sense to continue this? Does it make sense to continue it, but change it in some way? Or does it just not work?” Hoover said in an interview Thursday.
Before making a decision, the commission is likely to ask all affected parties — including utilities and the Office of People’s Counsel, which represents ratepayers — how they believe the language from the law should be applied, Hoover said.
Alexopulos, argued that Maryland is “not an outlier” among U.S. states because it allows multiyear rate cases, but said the process is fairly new to Maryland.
BGE filed its first multiyear plan in 2020, Alexopulos said. The process allows BGE to consult the PSC, and all other stakeholders, before it incurs costs — and ask for higher rates. Before that, BGE went to the PSC to ask for higher rates after incurring the costs, Alexopulos said.
“So, the multiyear plan the process itself adds transparency that didn’t exist before. And you know what the rates are going to be three years into the future,” he said.
In addition to ending multiyear plans, the group also called on BGE to cancel its 2026 rate distribution increase.
“We’re looking at folks who are deciding between groceries, rent or gas and electricity,” Cohen said. “And so, it is not a sustainable situation.”
Alexopulos argues that those increases fund “critical” upgrades to the system, which promote safe and reliable service. And Hoover said Thursday that the commission can’t intervene to reject that increase.
“We can’t go back and sort of adjust the rates in a retroactive manner,” Hoover said. “What we can do is say: ‘Well, in the future, you have to make this adjustment in what you’re charging.’”
Cohen attempted to deliver a bag of postcards Thursday that he said were from Baltimore ratepayers calling for BGE to end multiyear rate plans amid high bills. But a BGE employee who met him at the door declined the bag, citing security protocols. Alexopulous criticized Cohen for rejecting a meeting with BGE’s new CEO, Tamla Olivier.
“He declined, and instead decided to have a performative press conference about this issue rather than engaging in real conversation,” Alexopulos said of Cohen.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Cohen said he declined the meeting because he felt it would not be productive unless BGE produced a plan for ratepayer relief.
“I don’t do meetings for meetings’ sake,” he said. “I want to see action from this company.”
At the PSC, just a few blocks from BGE’s downtown Baltimore building, Cohen received a warmer reception. Hoover accepted the bag, and highlighted the commission’s previous orders focused on lowering costs to ratepayers.
In late May, the commission ordered BGE to spread out an upcoming rate increase, caused in part by a historically costly electricity auction at PJM, which runs the electric grid for Maryland and about a dozen other states. The commission’s decision will lessen the impact higher prices this summer — when bills will increase due to high temperatures — and push it into the fall.
The PSC is also in charge of determining how utilities will dole out $200 million in state-funded customer rebates beginning later this summer. In June, Exelon announced $19 million in additional relief for low- and middle-income households, with $15 million going to BGE customers.
Most recently, the PSC changed the rules on extensions of the natural gas system, ordering that customers who request extensions must pay the cost themselves. That way, the rest of the customer base isn’t paying for extensions of a system that could eventually be phased out amid concerns about fossil fuel use and climate change.
It was a concern long voiced by consumer advocates. Hoover said it came down to a basic principle of rate-making.
“The economic principles say that the people that cause the cost are the ones that should bear it. And so that’s what we’ve applied in this situation,” he said.
Hoover said that won’t be the only order issued amid the commissions’ “Future of Gas” proceeding. More could be coming in the weeks ahead, he added.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/HEADSHOT-136-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-04 00:59:55.966978

Walsh,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/04/our-nations-descent-into-social-darwinism/,"As I contemplate the passage of this bill, I am convinced that it is an alarming display of Social Darwinism -- that only “the fittest”  will survive.","J.D. Vance broke a tie in the U.S. Senate to pass a bill that will support the wealthy and bring devastation to the lives of many Americans.  We know that the bill, now passed in the House and headed to President Trump for signing, will result in more than $3 trillion added to our national debt, an irresponsible consequence in itself. 
It will also result in over 17,000 individuals losing their health care, including many low-income and disabled persons, and many more losing benefits that will have a deleterious impact on their lives.  SNAP programs will be cut, affecting low income families and increasing food insecurity across the country.
Planned Parenthood, which generally provides the only preventative healthcare services in rural areas, as well an estimated 300 rural hospitals, and an unknown number of nursing homes throughout the nation, may be forced to close with the drastic reduction in Medicaid funding.  Veterans benefits have also taken extraordinary losses which will impact vets across our country, many of whom are already at risk with physical and mental health issues, addiction, and the risk of suicide. 
I’m not sure if I am more enraged by this heinous act which deprives individuals and families of the support they need, and which is a blatant betrayal of moral American values, or by the sordid measures which provide tax breaks to billionaires to enrich their wealth, and to support their greed and lust for power on the backs of middle and working class families.
As I contemplate the passage of this bill, I am more convinced than ever that it is an alarming display of Social Darwinism.  Yes, only those with personal resources, “the fittest” in our society, will survive these draconian measures, which raises another question of why legislators would approve such legislation.  The term is typically used to justify social inequities and competition according to common definition, which suggests that “the most successful in society are inherently superior, and others less successful, are naturally less fit.”  It is frightening to consider that this ideology has made its way into our democracy, indeed, into the halls of our government.
Prior to the vote in the Senate, the data clearly extrapolated the dire consequences of this bill on the American people. It is now reasonable to predict that millions will be denied social services and health care, mental health and addictions services, preventative care and treatment, palliative and elder care services, and disturbingly, that many will die. Yet, members of the U.S. Senate, knowing the consequences of their vote, voted to pass a bill that denies benefits to their constituents, rather than to betray loyalty to the president and risk retribution. In truth, they abandoned their constituents to preserve their political power.
We have seen the degradation of democracy in recent years, as well as a decline in moral values, and there are now unmistakable signs and patterns indicative of authoritarian rule.
We are witnessing a clear diversion from American values, that we are no longer a country committed to caring for the less fortunate.  There is no longer “the golden door,” the lamp to light the way, for “your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free…”  America, wake up to what we have become.  Will you sit on your hands, complicit with all that is wrong, or will you take action now to restore kindness and morality to a country that has lost its way?

[…]","Gov. Mike Dunleavy discusses proposed education legislation at a news conference on Jan. 31, 2025. (Photo by Corinne Smith/Alaska Beacon)In a meeting with Republican members of the Alaska House of Representatives on Wednesday, Gov. Mike Dunleavy had what he called an “unorthodox” request. 
He asked that the 19 members of the House’s Republican minority caucus stay away from the first five days of a special legislative session he called for Aug. 2 in Juneau.
Under the Alaska Constitution, the Legislature must vote to override or sustain a governor’s vetoes in the first regular or special session following the vetoes. If those Republicans are absent, it increases the odds that his vetoes will be sustained. 
An absence is as good as a “no” vote when it comes to getting the 45 votes needed to override a veto of line items in a budget bill or the 40 votes needed to override a veto of a policy bill.
In May, lawmakers voted 46-14 to override Dunleavy’s veto of a policy bill that permanently increases the state’s public-school funding formula. Eight of the 19 House minority members voted for the override.
Now, they’re being asked whether to override the governor’s decision to only partially fund that formula.
The governor’s opponents will have a difficult task. Some lawmakers, including Sen. Forrest Dunbar, D-Anchorage, are expected to be unavailable for the special session. Dunbar has been deployed with the National Guard in Poland.
Others may have family commitments that are obstacles to attending. If minority-caucus legislators heed the governor’s request and avoid the special session, they will be largely immune to last-minute lobbying by their colleagues or members of the public.
“If you want the veto override to fail, when we’re talking about less than $50 million here on a multibillion-dollar budget, I guess you pull out every stop, and this is a stop that I’ve not seen pulled out by any governor,” said Speaker of the House Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham and a supporter of the override.
Reporters were not invited to the meeting between the governor and the House minority, but Jeff Turner, the governor’s communications director, confirmed the details, first reported by KTUU-TV.
“Governor Dunleavy asked house minority members to not show up for the first five days of session because like any governor, he does not want his vetoes overturned,” he said by email.
Dunleavy has designated education policy and the creation of a Department of Agriculture as the subjects of the special session. Turner said the governor planned to introduce an education bill for lawmakers to consider during the session.
“Arriving on the sixth day also means legislators begin the session with a clean slate for conversations on public education reform policies. The Governor is also willing to reinstate the $200 BSA increase, if he and lawmakers can reach an agreement on the education bill he will introduce next month,” Turner said.
House Minority Leader Mia Costello, R-Anchorage, did not return a call seeking comment, but other members of the minority spoke freely about the governor’s request.
“I will use the governor’s exact word: Unorthodox. It was definitely an unorthodox request that took me by surprise,” said Rep. Justin Ruffridge, R-Soldotna.
While the governor’s official special session proclamation lists education and a proposed Alaska Department of Agriculture on its agenda, “he was very clear that a big portion of the strategy for him was, he did not want to be overridden on anything: bills, budget, all of it.”
Ruffridge voted in favor of the prior override and indicated that he’s willing to vote the same way in a special session.
“I’ve taken the approach sort of since day one, that if I vote yes on something, that my yes means something, I know that probably doesn’t always align with the political winds that might blow, but I think that’s something that my constituents at least respect,” he said.
Ruffridge said he absolutely intends to show up at the special session.
“If a special session is called, I think all representatives and senators have an obligation to attempt to be there, if at all possible,” Ruffridge said. “I think that’s part of what we signed up for when we signed up to do the job. And I mean, if you’re not going to show up, I think essentially, you’re just afraid of taking hard votes at that point.”
Rep. Jamie Allard, R-Eagle River, has a different perspective.
“I think that’s fine,” she said of the governor’s request. “It costs a lot of money. It’s $300 per diem per day. You have to pay for flights and hotels. I think it’s a good idea. Those who do want to continue to override, they could go ahead and go down there, and those of us who don’t, it’s an automatic no vote for us when we don’t go there to vote.”
“My job is to make sure we save as much money as possible,” she said. “And again, if we’re not in Juneau, it’s an automatic no vote. If you show up in Juneau, then I believe those individuals are going to be voting yes or wasting taxpayer dime.”
Jeremy Bynum, the Republican representative from Ketchikan, said he intends to show up in Juneau on Aug. 2, even though it means missing Ketchikan’s largest annual celebration, the blueberry festival.
He’s interested in attending the special session because he hopes that legislators will take up education policy, even though he doubts that will happen. 
The multipartisan House majority caucus controls the legislative agenda, and it isn’t clear that there is sufficient common ground between the majority and the governor to enable progress.
Rep. DeLena Johnson, R-Palmer, said she’s still considering her options and is undecided about whether to travel to Juneau.
Before the House minority’s meeting with the governor, Rep. Kevin McCabe, R-Big Lake, said he doesn’t see the governor’s call for a special session as significantly different from legislative committees’ attempts to advance or derail legislation by using legislative procedures or schedules. He pointed to the way that the Senate Finance Committee has used take-it-or-leave-it tactics with regard to the state budget.
Rep. Elexie Moore of Wasilla said she’s likely to attend in order to vote against an override and to sustain the governor’s veto.
Earlier this year, she was absent from the Capitol on a day that unexpectedly brought a key vote on the Permanent Fund dividend. 
She was dragged on social media for three weeks afterward, she said by phone. 
People expect their legislators to be in the Capitol, she said, and most people aren’t able to follow the maneuvering that might explain an absence.
“I think that’s the perspective of somebody who doesn’t understand what it means not to go,” Allard said when told about Moore’s thinking. “(Not attending the session) means that you’re a no vote. But if she wants to go and spend, you know, $5,000 to $10,000 in taxpayer money, that’s fine. I understand she was dragged on social media, but those were some bad decisions that were made — not necessarily by her — but on information about what she was doing. But I would recommend that she stay with the caucus and don’t go down there.”
“I think it’s a good idea,” said Rep. Mike Prax, R-North Pole, about the governor’s request. 
Prax supports the governor’s position and said he believes the special session is a good idea, because it settles the school funding issue early. Without a special session, lawmakers would have to wait until January to decide whether to override or sustain the governor’s decisions.
The Fairbanks North Star Borough school board voted in June to finalize a budget that expects lawmakers to override the governor.
If an override fails, Prax said, it’s better that it fails early, so the district can change its budget before school begins.
While members of the House and Senate majority caucuses have indicated that they intend to take up only the veto overrides during the special session, Prax said he hopes lawmakers will stay and consider education policy.
While lawmakers have convened an education task force to discuss future changes, he doubts the effectiveness of that group, given the Legislature’s failure to adopt the recommendations of a prior fiscal policy working group. The task force deadline to make recommendations is January 2027, after the next election.
“I am not at all optimistic that there’s even any intention, frankly, of the task force coming up with something,” he said.
Edgmon, the House speaker, said that his recommendation “to any legislator, is to show up to Juneau, get their work done and make the tough vote whether they are a yea or a nay.”
Legislative rules allow any lawmaker to issue a “call on the House” that compels legislators to attend. Edgmon said that might be deemed dilatory and out of order in this case.
In the end, will absences even matter? Lawmakers who stay away are likely to be those most likely to support the governor.
“That could be the case for sure,” Edgmon said, “and it’ll be the voters in their districts that will judge whether or not they’re doing the right thing.”

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)President Donald Trump’s administration has blocked the release of an estimated $6.2 billion in congressionally approved education funding through U.S. Department of Education grant programs, including what one group estimated to be $46.4 million appropriated for Alaska schools. 
The Alaska Department of Education and Early Development confirmed Thursday that the federal department notified states that grants would not be dispersed July 1 as expected, including:   

​​Migrant Education — to improve educational opportunities for migratory children to help them succeed in the regular school program;
Supporting Effective Instruction — to increase student achievement, and improve the quality and effectiveness of instructors;
Language Instruction for English Learners — to help ensure that English learners, including immigrant children and youth, attain English proficiency and develop high levels of academic achievement in English;
Student Support and Academic Enrichment — to provide all students with access to a well-rounded education, improve school conditions for student learning, and improve use of technology; and
21st Century Community Learning Centers — to provide competitive grants to organizations that are working in partnership within their community and schools to provide expanded learning and enrichment opportunities for children and their families outside of regular school hours.

DEED did not respond to an interview request, or more details on how much was currently frozen from each program, by Thursday afternoon. 
According to federal budget data compiled by the Learning Policy Institute, a nonpartisan education research nonprofit, Alaska is facing an estimated $46.4 million in grants withheld by the department, or 15% of total federal funds for K-12 education. 
That includes $21.3 million for migrant education, $10.8 million for supporting effective instruction, $1.1 million for English language learning, $6.6 million for student support and academic enrichment, and $6.5 million for 21st Century community learning center programs, according to the LPI data analysis.  
The Trump administration has left states and territories to face severe budget shortfalls and potential disruptions to summer school and enrichment programs.
Bryan Zadalis, a public information officer with DEED, said by email on Thursday that the U.S. Department of Education has indicated the delay is part of a broader review process by the Trump administration. 
“While no timeline has been provided for when funds will be available, the Department has emphasized its intent to ensure decisions are aligned with federal priorities and statutory responsibilities,” he said. 
“At this time, we are not able to provide specific guidance on how this delay may impact district-level planning or program operations,” Zadalis said. “However, DEED is actively monitoring the situation and will be prepared to take advantage of any flexibility or waiver opportunities that may be offered.”
Anchorage Democrat Sen. Löki Tobin, who chairs the Senate Education Committee, condemned the move by the Trump administration. 
“It is absolutely abhorrent and disgusting to me, the continued insidious, quiet and now very loud attack on the fundamental right for every child to be able to access a quality education,” she said in a phone interview Thursday.
Tobin said that the move to block the dispersal of federal funding hits Alaska schools, including her district of Anchorage, especially hard. DEED is considering a rule change to limit local contributions to schools, saying that it’s necessary to comply with a federal disparity test. That issue could cost school districts millions of dollars.
“Add on to that now this impoundment of federal dollars for migrant ed, and special education services, and English language learning programs, and 21st Century school learning programs. Anchorage is again looking at another $15 million loss,” Tobin said. 
Officials with the Anchorage School District — which educates nearly 43,000 students — sent a letter to staff shared with the Beacon saying they are assessing the delay and impact to the district, and in the meantime “a hiring freeze is in effect for positions funded (in part or in whole) by these programs until our financial outlook becomes clearer.” 
In addition, Tobin pointed to Alaska school districts grappling with severe budget deficits following Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s veto of a portion of per student funding earlier this month. This week he announced a special session in August pushing up a promised veto override vote by the Alaska State Legislature.  
Tobin said the changes amounted to “undermining a core, foundational pillar of the American economy and the American ethos. That every child has a right to learn to read. Every child has a right to become a thriving community member. Every child has a right to prosperity. This is denying opportunity to an entire generation, and they should be ashamed.”

Medicaid expansion was a lifeline for the town. Now, she said, President Donald Trump’s tax and spending bill could snatch it away. (Photo by Shalina Chatlani/Stateline)LAKE PROVIDENCE, La. — East Carroll Parish sits in the northeastern corner of Louisiana, along the winding Mississippi River. Its seat, Lake Providence, was a thriving agricultural center of the Delta. Now, the town is a shell of its former self. Charred and dilapidated buildings dot the small city center. There are a few gas stations, a handful of restaurants — and little to no industry.
Mayor Bobby Amacker, 79, says at one point “you couldn’t even walk down the street” in Lake Providence’s main business district because “there were so many people.”
“It’s gone down tremendously in the last 50 years,” said Amacker, a Democrat. “The town, it looks like it’s drying up. And it’s almost unstoppable, as far as I can tell.”
Now, East Carroll residents stand to lose even more. Like many people in Louisiana, they received a lifeline when the state expanded Medicaid to more low-income adults in 2016. Expansion drove Louisiana’s uninsured rate to the lowest in the Deep South, at 8% in 2023 for working-age adults, according to state data, despite it having the highest poverty rate in the U.S. that year.

This week, the U.S. Senate approved President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful” tax and spending bill. It includes more than $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, the joint state-federal health insurance program for poor families and individuals, to help pay for tax cuts that mostly benefit the rich. The legislation would cause 11.8 million more Americans to become uninsured by 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
The bill includes new work rules for Medicaid recipients and would require them to verify their eligibility more frequently. It also would limit a financing strategy that states have used to boost Medicaid payments to hospitals.
Republicans say enrollees are taking advantage of the Medicaid program and getting benefits when they shouldn’t be. They say the program costs too much and states are not paying their fair share.
The Delta region, which includes communities in both Louisiana and Mississippi, would suffer under such large cuts. But in Louisiana — where almost half of the state depended on Medicaid in 2023, the Louisiana Department of Health reported — the cuts could be ruinous. Louisiana could lose up to $35 billion in federal Medicaid support over the next decade, according to KFF, a health policy research group. Mississippi, which never expanded Medicaid, could still lose up to $5 billion.
Residents are watching with apprehension, fear and, sometimes, anger, wondering how Congress could be so blind to how much they are struggling.
“If they take that away from us and everyone that really needs it, that’s going to be bad,” said Sherila Ervin, who lives 20 minutes up the road from Lake Providence in Oak Grove and has Medicaid coverage.

Medicaid work requirements and other health care provisions in the bill ignore the reality of living in poorer rural communities, where people struggle to find the jobs, transportation and internet access required to meet the rules, according to interviews with people and providers in the Delta region.
Even though Louisiana and Mississippi have taken very different approaches to Medicaid — one expanded eligibility under the 2010 Affordable Care Act and the other didn’t — both rely heavily on the program to sustain access to medical care for all their residents.
On a hot summer day in June, Ervin walks into the bare-bones 99-cent store in downtown Lake Providence. As she looks over some clothing, she says she’s heard about the potential Medicaid cuts. But she hadn’t heard about the work requirements, and is shocked they’re even on the table.
“I don’t like that. I don’t think they should put a stipulation on that,” Ervin says, exasperated that she would have to report her work hours. It’s hard enough as it is, she says, to thrive in this community.
Ervin, 58, has been working at Oak Grove High School in the cafeteria, serving hot plates to children for two decades. She says it’s one of the good, steady jobs available in this area, but her income is only around $1,500 per month.
Ervin’s job offers health benefits, but she can’t afford the premiums on her salary. She relies on Medicaid for care, including medications for her high blood pressure.
In East Carroll Parish, around 46.5% of people live below the poverty level, meaning the area is overwhelmingly poor, at over four times the national poverty rate, with a median income of $28,321. For Black households, the figure is a mere $16,690.
Expansion was a lifeline for people such as Ervin. Louisiana offers Medicaid to people who earn below 138% of the federal poverty line — currently about $22,000 a year for an individual.
“Sometimes you can work, but then when you work, you still can’t pay to get help,” Ervin said.
It’s a similar economic situation an hour away across the river. Poverty is about three times the national rate in Washington County, Mississippi, where residents in the city of Greenville lament the consequences of not being able to avoid destructive medical debt, which can keep them stuck in a cycle of gig work and of living paycheck to paycheck.
Greenville, the county seat, is among the fastest-shrinking cities in the U.S. It’s still one of the larger rural cities in Mississippi, with coffee shops, restaurants, hotels, a regional hospital and several big-box stores. But the downtown has just a few small businesses and a bank, and residents say jobs are hard to find.
Greenville resident April McNair, 45, remembers giving birth 17 years ago, long before Mississippi extended postpartum Medicaid to a full year. She had Medicaid coverage during pregnancy, but was kicked off shortly after giving birth, despite having post-delivery complications.

The result was a trip to the emergency room and a $2,500 bill she couldn’t cover. Right after giving birth, McNair looked for work. She said potential employers often told her that she was overqualified because she had a master’s degree.
“I had to kind of figure out how to make my ends meet,” McNair said. “I ended up with a significant bill, all because I did not have Medicaid.”
McNair feels like Mississippi leaders are making a mistake by continuing to reject full Medicaid expansion.
“That’s a selfish move. To me, they’re selfish,” McNair said, adding that now she’s worried for neighbors in Louisiana who may lose the lifeline she wishes she had.
“God forbid, hypothetically speaking, what if one of them meets their demise because of this bill that [Congress] passed?”
 Hard to thrive

Mississippi experienced its first taste of equalized access to medicine in the late 1960s.
Delta Health Center, the first federally funded health center in the nation, opened during the peak of the Civil Rights Movement in the all-Black town of Mound Bayou, about an hour north of Greenville. The center vowed to care for anyone regardless of race or ability to pay in a region plagued with poverty, poor health and discrimination — and continues to do so to this day.
It was a significant opportunity for generations of African Americans who had gone without health care, in a place where people had no access to clean drinking water, running sewage systems or even food, said Robin Boyles, chief program planning and development officer at Delta Health Center.
But it wasn’t easy for the clinic to mobilize support, even though it was clearly needed. Before its opening, it faced pushback from politicians and even doctors. In a 1966 clipping from a local newspaper, the white-owned Bolivar Commercial, the editorial board railed against the new clinic, saying it would “lead further to socialized medicine.”
The situation is certainly better in Mississippi and Louisiana than it was in the 1960s, but critics say the Medicaid cuts could reverse hard-fought progress.
People who live in the Delta are fiercely proud of their communities, but conditions there make it hard to thrive.

Black residents, who are the overwhelming majority, have had a particularly hard time. After the Civil War, many were relegated to sharecropping of cotton and corn for subsistence. Meanwhile, an elite white class of plantation owners and investors amassed enormous amounts of wealth.
A 2001 report from the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights described the area as one with “limited economic resources; inadequate employment opportunities; insufficient decent, affordable housing; and poor quality public schools.”
“We have a lot of patients that are one health issue away from either being out of a job or being bankrupt because of a trip to the emergency room,” said Dr. Brent Smith, a physician at a primary care clinic at Delta Health System in Greenville.
Even some of the most vulnerable people, such as new moms in Mississippi, still struggle to get basic care, in part because the state has left billions of dollars in federal funding for Medicaid expansion on the table, said Dr. Lakeisha Richardson, an OB-GYN at Delta Health System.
“There are a lot of maternal [care] deserts in Mississippi where women have to travel 60 miles or more just to get prenatal care and just to get to the closest hospital for delivery,” Richardson said. “And I don’t see that getting any better in Mississippi and in rural areas.”
Richardson says nearly all her patients are working moms, many of whom would really benefit from having Medicaid expansion.
“America doesn’t realize that there are people out here struggling for no reason of their own,” she said.
That’s why Medicaid expansion in Louisiana in 2016, much like the community health center movement in Mississippi, was a bright spot in the rural South, said Smith.
“Louisiana expanded Medicaid, a surprising move in the South to see any state expand,” Smith said. “They saw it for what it was, which was a very real opportunity to assist this specific group of patients.”

In Mississippi, 20 rural hospitals are at immediate risk of closure, according to a recent report, more than double the number at risk in Louisiana. In many cases, Medicaid is the largest and most reliable payer for rural hospitals. While Louisiana’s overall uninsured rate plummeted to 8.3% by 2023, in Mississippi it was 10.5%.
“Unlike a lot of our Southern peers, we have not had the same level of closures of facilities,” said Courtney Foster, senior policy adviser for Medicaid, with the nonprofit Invest in Louisiana.
“Medicaid was like a real lifeline for people in transition. Oftentimes it was people who had lost their jobs and were just looking to get back on their feet.”
Now, the new work and reporting requirements could put that progress at risk.
In East Carroll Parish, finding a job — let alone a good-paying one with health benefits — is difficult, says Rosie Brown, executive director at the East Carroll Community Action Agency, a nonprofit that helps low-income people with their rent and utility bills. Many of the jobs available in town pay minimum wage, just $7.25 an hour.










America doesn't realize that there are people out here struggling for no reason of their own.


– Dr. Lakeisha Richardson, OB-GYN at Delta Health System


Brown loves living in Lake Providence; this is where her family is. She doesn’t want to move but wishes the government would invest more in her community — not take away benefits that help people who are hanging on by a thread.
“We have one bank. We have one supermarket,” she said. “Transportation isn’t easy either.”
Local infrastructure is so limited, she’s even heard of some people charging residents $20 for a ride to Walmart. Some people have to hitch a ride an hour away to go to work, she said.
“There’s nowhere to go,” Brown said.
Dominique Jones works at the local library, where she helps roughly 75 to 85 people per month apply for programs such as Medicaid and food assistance. Many of the residents she helps don’t have access to the internet or even a computer, a real barrier for people who’d be required to report their working hours to state Medicaid officials.
“This town right here is made up of a lot of old people that need Medicaid and Medicare. And without it, they wouldn’t have any kind of health care at all,” Mayor Amacker said.

Even a job in local government in Lake Providence doesn’t offer affordable health insurance.
Nevada Qualls, 25, sits across from Amacker’s office. She earns just $12 an hour as a cashier at city hall. The low pay means she qualifies for Medicaid expansion coverage, which is good because she can’t afford the premiums for private insurance.
“I feel like there should be a higher threshold for people that can get Medicaid, because they’re still struggling,” she said.
At the 99-cent store, school district worker Ervin wonders whether state and federal leaders understand what it’s like to live in her community, urging them to visit and see for themselves.
“They want to do stuff for the rich people that’s already rich,” she said. “What are they doing? It’s almost like there’s no common sense with them.”
 ‘The tremble factors’

While leaders in the U.S. Senate were working into the night this past weekend debating Trump’s tax and spending bill, Greenville resident Jennifer Morris was praying for the pain to stay away.
Morris, 44, has hemicrania continua, a headache disorder that causes constant pain on one side of her head. There’s no underlying trigger and no cure. Her doctors help her keep the pain to a minimum with regular treatments that include dozens of injections into her head.

“It doesn’t take the pain away,” she said during a late-night gathering in Greenville’s Greater Mount Olivet Missionary Baptist Church in June. “It does reduce the pain so that I’m able to function. But it’s rough.”
Morris is worried about the looming Medicaid cuts. She qualifies for Mississippi Medicaid because her condition counts as a disability, and she depends on the coverage to afford her medications.
Morris’ Medicaid may be safer than that of her Delta neighbors in Lake Providence, as some of the most dramatic Medicaid changes being considered — such as work requirements — target Medicaid expansion states only.
But Mississippi could be hurt by a provision in the Senate bill that would target a strategy states have used to boost the Medicaid dollars they get from the federal government.
Mississippi could see a major hit to its Medicaid funds, which “would be a tremendous decrease in revenue for the state,” harming “services and access to care,” says Mitchell Adcock, executive director at the Center for Mississippi Health Policy.
“It would be just the opposite of expansion. It would be a contraction for the Medicaid program in the state,” he said.
Leonard Favorite, a pastor who was attending the same event at Mount Olivet Church, as Morris, says he grew up on a plantation in Louisiana and worked his way out of poverty by joining the Air Force. This type of journey is hard, he said, when you’re already starting from so far behind. He thinks the “big, beautiful bill” will create more roadblocks for poor people.
“You have people who are already living below the poverty line and they will certainly be submerged into poverty at unspeakable levels,” said Favorite, 70.“ That seems to be the trend of this administration from the point of view of looking from the outside.
“Poor people are beginning to feel the tremble factors of an administration that caters toward the rich.”
National researchers estimate that up to 132,000 Louisianans who gained health insurance under expansion could lose it under work rules.
But national reports that rely on census data likely underestimate the potential Medicaid losses. For example, while 2023 census data show 47% of East Carroll Parish was on Medicaid, state health data reviewed by Stateline and Public Health Watch suggests the number is more like 64%. Similarly statewide, census data showed about a third of Louisianans were on Medicaid. State data shows that percentage is closer to 46.5%.
Experts such as Joan Alker at the Georgetown Center for Children and Families say the undercounts nationally are a well-known issue among researchers, but it’s difficult to correct because the quality of state reporting can be so uneven.
State Medicaid funding is also at risk. For years, both Mississippi and Louisiana have relied on revenue generated through a financing tool — known as a provider tax — to draw down more federal dollars and boost Medicaid reimbursements to providers. But congressional Republicans hope to limit states’ ability to collect those taxes.
Depending on how Congress restricts provider taxes, Mississippi could lose hundreds of millions in federal Medicaid funding, crucial in a state with such a high uninsured rate, said Richard Roberson, president and CEO of the Mississippi Hospital Association.
“It’s unavoidable that when you’re taking that much money out of the system, that there’s not going to be some repercussions felt even in non-Medicaid expansion states like Mississippi,” Roberson said.
Last week, the Louisiana Hospital Association signed a statement calling the package of Medicaid cuts before Congress “historic in their devastation.”
From her small, sunny office in East Carroll Parish, nurse Jennifer Newton can’t understand the attacks on Medicaid.
Newton, who grew up one parish over in West Carroll, is executive director of the Family Medical Clinic, a community health center in Lake Providence and one of the few health providers in town. She says 50% of the clinic’s patients have Medicaid insurance.

Newton has worked in health care in the area for decades and watched as Medicaid expansion made it possible for more patients to access and afford health care they desperately needed, including preventive services. “It’s absolutely helped,” she said. “Absolutely.”
In 2015, the year before Louisiana expanded Medicaid, the uninsured rate among working-age adults in East Carroll Parish was nearly 35%. By 2021, that number was 12.7%.
“Why are we going back?” Newton asked. “We’ve made so much progress.”
Republican supporters of work requirements, including Louisiana representative and U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, argue they will encourage people to find jobs and ensure Medicaid goes to people who need it most. But according to KFF, a majority of Louisiana adults with Medicaid — 69% — already work.
Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that is working with Republicans to formulate Medicaid cuts, is not concerned about eligible people losing coverage, as has happened under previous work requirement efforts. He says the bill has built in exceptions for certain people and requirements “can be met by not just work,” so “concerns seem pretty overstated.”
Medicaid recipients also can meet the requirement by volunteering or attending school for 80 hours per month.
“It’s hard for me to understand that there are areas in the country where there’s not jobs. There’s always work to be done,” Blase told Stateline. Blase said he believes Medicaid is “the government conditioning welfare for able-bodied working-age adults.”
But advocates and experts predict East Carroll, where internet access is notoriously bad, would experience results similar to when Arkansas instituted Medicaid work requirements in 2018: People disenrolled because of lack of awareness and confusion over the policy, as well as paperwork errors — not because they weren’t working enough.
“Unless the beneficiary can navigate that red tape, they’re going to lose coverage and become uninsured,” said Benjamin Sommers, a health economist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
Data shows Arkansas’ experiment did not increase employment, Sommers said, and instead led to more people reporting medical debt and delaying care because of cost.
 ‘Take a step back’

People in the Delta — where the legacy of government neglect and discrimination are all around — want politicians to visit their towns and see the barriers people face trying to improve their lives and stay healthy.
“People spent their lives uninsured,” said Amy Hale, a nurse practitioner at East Carroll Medical clinic. “Medicaid expansion allowed them to get in here and be treated.”
Lake Providence residents are scared they may find themselves in a similar situation as McNair and other people across the river in Greenville: working, uninsured, and too poor to access health care.
Recent estimates show up to 317,000 Louisianans could lose Medicaid health insurance under Trump’s tax bill. Nearly 33,000 in Mississippi.
“People are actually trying,” McNair said. “I really wish [lawmakers] would look at it from a different lens. What if it was their kid? Or they didn’t have the salaries they have now and your baby is ill. … Like really take a step back and think about what it is that you’re doing.”

On Thursday afternoon, Circuit Judge Jerri Zhang, for the third time, issued an order to enforce the abortion rights amendment approved by voters in November. In her previous orders, one in December and one in February,  Zhang pointed to the voter-approved constitutional amendment in issuing a temporary injunction blocking abortion restrictions enacted over numerous years by state lawmakers.
State lawmakers have passed a ballot measure asking voters  to repeal the abortion rights amendment in 2026, a move being challenged in Cole County Circuit Court.
Surgical abortions resumed after the February decision but ended in May when the Missouri Supreme Court struck down Zhang’s orders on technical legal grounds. 
In a joint statement, the ACLU of Missouri and Planned Parenthood affiliates said the Kansas City clinic will resume abortion services on Monday. The statement said the ruling was incomplete because it did not enjoin enforcement of a state law requiring complication plans for abortion patients. 
“Abortion is legal again in Missouri because voters demanded it and we fought for it,” said Emily Wales, president and CEO, Comprehensive Health of Planned Parenthood Great Plains. 
Zhang found that the total ban on abortions that took effect in 2022 clearly conflicted with the rights secured by the abortion amendment, which received 52% of the vote in November.
She also blocked enforcement of a law requiring two appointments 72 hours apart to obtain abortion services and that women be required to take state-produced material on fetal development.
The order blocks enforcement of laws requiring special abortion facility licensing and that doctors performing abortions have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. 
“The regulations require physicians to perform certain exams and tests that are unnecessary when the physicians themselves are authorized and enabled to make the determination on what is and is not necessary for their individual patients,” Zhang wrote. “Additionally, miscarriage management can be provided on an outpatient basis without a special facility license.”
Zhang’s order keeps in place rules that only doctors can provide abortion services and that the woman seeking an abortion have an in-person appointment. The appointment can, however, be by telemedicine, Zhang ruled as she blocked a separate rule.
Overall, Zhang’s ruling means the rights secured by the abortion amendment can be exercised. 
“As plaintiffs argue, they and their patients are suffering serious harm, whereas defendants only stand to lose the ability temporarily to enforce some laws that are likely to be held unconstitutional and which further no valid compelling state interest,” Zhang wrote.
In a statement, Attorney General Andrew Bailey’s office said in a statement that he would immediately appeal the decision.
“We respectfully but firmly disagree with the Court’s decision to once again block the enforcement of Missouri’s duly enacted health and safety regulations,” the statement read. “These requirements were designed to ensure that women receive care in sanitary conditions from qualified professionals, with emergency safeguards in place.”
While services will resume in Kansas City on Monday, other clinics will open up appointment books quickly.
“This decision is a step forward toward fully realizing Missourians’ right to reproductive freedom,” Margot Riphagen, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Rivers, said in the release, “and the staff at our Central West End health center in St. Louis will work as quickly as possible to resume scheduling abortion appointments.”

“The ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ is deeply concerning. I don't think it's beautiful,” said Mike Del Trecco, president and CEO of the state’s hospital association.

The sweeping Republican tax and spending bill that cleared the U.S. House Thursday could cause about 45,000 people in Vermont to lose health insurance in the coming years, state officials say. The bill is now heading to President Donald Trump for a sign-off.
In order to pay for key parts of Trump’s domestic agenda included in the legislation, called the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” GOP budget-writers are counting on proposed cuts to Medicaid, the shared federal and state program that funds insurance for people with low incomes.
Meanwhile, the bill has sparked concern among hospital leaders in Vermont over a provision that would limit how much state governments can tax health care providers such as hospitals to, ultimately, access more federal Medicaid funding. Vermont, like most other states, relies on these taxes to fund expanded benefits for Medicaid recipients, which is a practice that helps support providers, too.
“The ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ is deeply concerning. I don’t think it’s beautiful, and I think it’s super harmful to Vermont,” said Mike Del Trecco, the president and CEO of the Vermont Association of Hospitals and Health Systems, in an interview earlier this week. 
President Donald Trump and his GOP allies in Congress have said the legislation would target waste, fraud and abuse in Medicaid funding and have pointed to how the cuts would pay for policies such as breaks on taxes for tips and overtime pay. However, critics point to a Congressional Budget Office analysis showing the bill would boost the incomes of the country’s wealthiest households while costing the country’s poorest households more. 
The legislation would result in about 12 million people across the country losing their health care coverage over the next decade across Medicaid and the commercial insurance marketplace, according to the Congressional Budget Office, which is a nonpartisan agency that scores the fiscal impacts of federal legislation.  
One key provision in the bill would impose new requirements that certain people on Medicaid demonstrate that they are working in order to receive coverage. States will also be required to determine a participant’s eligibility for Medicaid every six months rather than every year, as they do now.
The fact that more people will have to fill out additional paperwork will lead some to fall off of coverage, according to Ashley Berliner, director of Medicaid policy for the state Agency of Human Services.
Berliner, in an interview, estimated that about 30,000 Vermonters will lose coverage because of that greater administrative burden. That makes up roughly half of the adults in Vermont who currently receive health insurance coverage under the expansion of Medicaid provided by the Affordable Care Act. That act, commonly called Obamacare, has significantly increased the number of people able to access health insurance.  
Federal spending for those 30,000 people would equate to $205 million annually that would, as a result of the bill, no longer be coming into the state, Berliner said. 
Meanwhile, she said, Vermont health officials believe an additional 15,000 people who purchase coverage on the commercial marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act will also lose coverage, at least in part because signing up for it will become more difficult. The budget bill doesn’t allow people to automatically reenroll in their current health care plan and shrinks the sign-up period for coverage by a month. 
Historically, only about half of people respond to the agency when it requests additional information to verify people’s eligibility to be enrolled in Medicaid, Berliner said. 
“When you ask people for additional information, they don’t fill it out and they fall off — the burden becomes too high and coverage is lost,” she said, adding that the picture is similar across the country, and GOP leaders are relying on the dropoff to help facilitate their proposed cuts.
Officials are also concerned about the impacts of a measure in the bill that would whittle down a long-standing mechanism states use to raise additional funds for Medicaid services by taxing health care providers. The rate of Vermont’s so-called provider tax, which is the name for that mechanism, would be reduced by 2.5% between 2028 and 2032. Vermont’s rate is currently set at the highest level allowed under existing law.
Cumulatively, over the period ending in 2032, Vermont is set to lose around $211 million from this change, counting both a loss of state dollars and additional federal Medicaid funding those dollars would allow the state to bring in, according to Berliner.
Hospitals will also feel pain from lost funding under these reductions, Del Trecco said.
Berliner added that she’s concerned by a measure in the bill that would ban state Medicaid payments for at least one year to health care nonprofits that offer abortions. This would include, notably, Planned Parenthood, which has clinics throughout Vermont.
One additional fallout, she said, could be shifting the costs of the reproductive healthcare those nonprofits provide in Vermont onto other providers. 
All three members of Vermont’s congressional delegation have criticized the impacts of the budget bill and voted against it. 
Last week, before the Senate approved a version of the bill, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., released a report that his office said showed the bill would increase the number of uninsured people in every state in the country. In some states, the rate of uninsured people would nearly double.
The legislation would “devastate rural hospitals, community health centers and nursing homes throughout our country and cause a massive spike in uninsured rates in red states and blue states alike,” Sanders said in a press release last week. 
Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., speaking on the Senate floor earlier this week, derided the potential impacts the bill would have on states with all political leanings.
“I want to repeat here: this is the bipartisan infliction of pain. This is real. This is real. And is the tax cut — largely directed to the very wealthy people — is it worth inflicting that kind of pain on so many, when the tax cut benefits so few?” he said. 
Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt., voted against the bill Thursday when it was up for final approval. 
“This Republican budget is far and away the cruelest piece of legislation I’ve seen in my career,” she said in a statement Thursday afternoon. “It’s an utter moral failure.”

Thompson Federal Courthouse in Nashville on June 13 before his arraignment on federal charges. (File photo by John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)NASHVILLE — A federal judge presiding over the criminal charges against Kilmar Abrego Garcia in Tennessee has ordered lawyers to refrain from making public statements about the case.
Thursday’s order by U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw came at the request of Abrego Garcia’s attorneys, who argued that government officials had “launched a public disparagement campaign against” their client that violated standard court rules and could prejudice his chance at a fair trial.
The defense attorneys cited a string of statements by members of the Trump administration that variously labelled Abrego Garcia a “gangbanger,” “monster,” “illegal predator,” “illegal alien terrorist,” “wife beater” and “barbarian.”
“From the moment Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia challenged his illegal rendition to El Salvador in March 2025, the government has repeatedly maligned him in public statements,” the attorneys wrote.
“Mr. Abrego is entitled to a fair trial,” they wrote. “But he is nearly certain to be denied that right if the government, left to its own devices, stays its current course.”
Crenshaw’s one-sentence order, issued in response, said, “All counsel are expected to comply with the local rules of this court.”
Court rules prohibit making public statements that “have a substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing an adjudicative proceeding in the matter.”
Abrego Garcia was beaten and tortured in Salvadoran prison, new court filings reveal

The rule applies to attorneys and “the government agencies or offices … and employees of such … government agencies or offices, with which the lawyer is associated.”
Abrego Garcia was living in Maryland when he was mistakenly dispatched to a Salvadoran prison as part of a larger Trump administration illegal immigration crackdown.
Court documents filed Wednesday in a separate immigration case in Maryland alleged Abrego Garcia endured “severe beatings, severe sleep deprivation, inadequate nutrition, and psychological torture” while there.
He was later brought to Nashville to face two human smuggling charges. Prosecutors allege Abrego Garcia participated in a scheme to transport migrants who illegally entered the United States to points around the country.
Abrego Garcia, who has no past criminal history in the United States, has entered not guilty pleas to the charges.
The former federal prosecutor who conceded Abrego Garcia had wrongly been sent to the notorious CECOT prison in El Salvador was later fired. He has subsequently filed a whistleblower complaint that alleges his termination was, in part, related to his public admission of the government’s administrative error in the high-profile case.
Abrego Garcia is due back in a Nashville courtroom July 16 for a hearing that could determine if he is released from federal custody pending trial.
Both prosecutors and defense attorneys concede Abrego Garcia will almost certainly be taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) should he be released from the custody of the U.S. Marshals, who maintain control over federal pretrial detainees.
Abrego Garcia, 29, entered the United States illegally from El Salvador as a teenager, but in 2019 an immigration judge issued an order preventing U.S. officials from deporting him to his home country, where Abrego Garcia said he feared gang violence.
A federal magistrate in Nashville initially granted Abrego Garcia’s release last week.
But defense attorneys, citing conflicting statements by the Trump administration about whether Abrego Garcia could be removed from the United States before trial, have asked he temporarily remain jailed in Nashville.

The nearly 1,000-page legislation extends tax cuts, slashes safety net spending, funds immigration enforcement and rewrites the federal approach on health care, economic development and climate policy. It contains much of President Trump’s domestic agenda.

House Republicans
U.S. Rep. Michael Baumgartner
This bill isn’t a silver bullet. But it’s a bold, serious step toward getting our economy back on track and restoring real accountability. It’s a win for every American who wants safer streets, stronger communities, and a government that finally puts them first.

U.S. Rep. Dan Newhouse
We made a commitment to reduce government spending, keep taxes low for hard working Americans, and make reforms to federal assistance programs to ensure their long-term sustainability. This is by no means a perfect bill, but it delivers on our commitment. This was a hard, thoroughly considered vote that I believe will benefit the people of my district.

This bill has become so big and bloated that my colleagues have lost the plot. Everyday families will come out in the negative, while Wall Street reaps the real benefits. It’s one of the largest explosions of our deficit ever from a single bill. It was designed to shirk responsibility, with many of these harmful provisions only going into effect after the midterm elections.

The Big Bad Betrayal Bill is the largest ever transfer of wealth from poor and working people to the richest, and every single district and state—red, blue, and purple—will feel the effects. This is a cruel, horrific betrayal that will leave Americans poorer and sicker. Thanks to Trump, Republicans, and this bill, people will die.

U.S. Rep. Adam Smith
This bill is one of the most reckless and cruel legislative efforts I’ve seen in my career. These cuts aren’t about balancing the budget — this bill actually increases the debt and deficit by trillions. These cuts are about handing more power and more money to the wealthiest Americans while punishing working people. It’s cynical, it’s dangerous, and it’s wrong.

U.S. Rep. Suzan DelBene
Republicans made one fundamental promise to Americans – they would lower costs. This big, ugly bill is the ultimate betrayal of that promise. It will make America more expensive by taking away health coverage, increasing hunger, and raising energy bills for millions of households. At every opportunity to show courage and stand up for their constituents, they always fall in line behind Donald Trump.

As a pediatrician, I have seen firsthand how access to Medicaid can protect and even save the lives of children. The passage of this Republican bill means that essential healthcare will be ripped away from hundreds of thousands of people in Washington State who rely on Apple Health.

President Trump and House Republicans continue to lie to the American people. They promised to lower costs on ‘day one.’ Instead, they have championed the greatest scam in American history.

U.S. Rep. Rick Larsen 
Let’s make no mistake. The big, ugly bill is not about deficit reduction. It’s not about cutting spending. It’s about cutting spending in order to pay for tax cuts for the richest Americans and largest corporations. I’ll be fighting to rebuild the social safety net that it is destroying. (Comments made on Facebook prior to voting)
The Senators
U.S. Sen. Patty Murray
Republicans chose to ignore every warning about how terrible this bill really is and force it through, over the objections of Democrats and even members of their own party, for no other reason than because Trump said so. In the end, the American people will have their voices heard and will show Republicans exactly how they feel about this monstrous bill at the ballot box.

With the House green lighting President Trump’s goal of taking away health care access and food security for millions, many Americans are going to suffer, and many working families will see their costs go up.

(Cassandra Glaspie, LSU/Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium)
Imagine you love cherry cheesecake, and you’re happy to find out that your local bakery makes the delicious, decadent dessert every Saturday. But they only make a certain amount per week; after that, there’s no more. 
Your neighbors also love cherry cheesecake. So, in order to get more for yourself from the limited supply, you pay them not to order a cake on Saturday, giving their share to you instead.
Balancing the amount of cheesecake consumption using this kind of trade works in a similar way to water quality trading, which looks to reduce pollution in the environment— in theory. It gets a lot more complicated than cheesecake.   
“One entity removes certain pollutants from the environment, and then a company that discharges that pollutant could buy those credits to offset their pollution,” said Matt Rota, senior policy director for environmental group Healthy Gulf. 
The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) hopes to improve water quality throughout the state with a new water quality trading program, using a market-based strategy to encourage less nitrogen and phosphorus pollution in waterways. 
It’s a type of plan that environmentalists, scientists and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) says can be a useful tool. But whether the program is fully set up for success isn’t yet certain.
 
Nutrient pollution
Nitrogen and phosphorus are nutrients often found in things like fertilizer for agriculture or a product of wastewater treatment. Farmers, wastewater treatment companies and other types of facilities produce nitrogen and phosphorus as a byproduct; that byproduct often gets washed or dumped into nearby waterways.
Too much nitrogen and phosphorus in the water can cause  toxic algae blooms, areas of low oxygen also known as dead-zone and acidification of coastal estuaries and wetlands, among other problems 
The dead zone in the upper Gulf of Mexico, now renamed the Gulf of America by the Trump administration, is the “poster child” for the issue, said Rota. The area of low oxygen that appears every summer in the Gulf from nutrient pollution in the Mississippi River covers an area usually about the size of Delaware. 
“It’s a really important issue, the zone of hypoxia,” said John Sabo, professor at Tulane’s Department of River-Coastal Science and Engineering, and director of the Tulane ByWater Institute. Low oxygen in the water can kill fish, shrimp and other sea life, affecting Louisiana’s seafood industry and the ecology of the Gulf. 
Previous efforts to reduce it haven’t made much progress. Vast amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus wash into the Mississippi River from further North in the Mississippi River Basin. All of that runs down to Louisiana, making it hard to control that much pollution within a single state. 
The Hypoxia Task Force, a group of federal agencies, states and tribes throughout the Basin, represents one of the larger groups trying to address the dead zone by forecasting and mapping the annual size of the zone. It also works with farmers to adopt new strategies to reduce the amount of nutrient runoff from agricultural fields and works with universities and businesses to advance technology to contain nutrient runoff. 
The goal of the Task Force is to reduce the dead zone’s size by 20 percent of what it was in 2015 by this year, and no larger than about 1,900 square miles by 2035. Forecasts for this year predict the zone to be about 4,800 square miles. 
Problems with fully funding the annual cruise to gather data on the true size of the zone could also make it harder to tell whether reduction strategies are working. 
 
Problems in the program
The idea behind  LDEQ’s market strategy is that Louisiana can use financial incentives to reduce nutrient pollution and help alleviate problems like the dead zone.
“The goal is to reduce pollutants across the state,” said Rachel Mathews, LDEQ environmental scientist manager and the program lead for the water quality trading initiative. 
 But environmental advocates noted some gaps that could hinder the program’s success. 
Louisiana doesn’t currently have numeric limits for nutrient pollution in waterways. Having a specific, measurable number is important for keeping a market working correctly, according to Rota and Sabo. 
Certain individual permits from “point source” polluters, or places like wastewater treatment plants and manufacturing facilities, might have a measurable maximum they are allowed to dump, but Louisiana has no broad, standard requirement for these facilities to limit nutrient pollution. 
Other sources of pollution, called “nonpoint source” pollution, like that from farming fertilizer runoff, do not have any requirement to limit nutrient pollution in Louisiana. 
“If their permits aren’t requiring them to ramp down their nitrogen or phosphorus discharge, there’s no market,” said Rota.“Louisiana hasn’t put together a good regulatory regime to ensure that these credits would need to be purchased.”
It’s like the local bakery making cheesecake all week in unlimited amounts; there’s no incentive to pay your neighbor not to get a cake if you can eat as much as you want. 
Louisiana started the process of developing numeric maximums for the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus allowed in bodies of water in 2003, mutually agreeing with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to finish a draft of nutrient criteria for all waterways except the Mississippi and Atchafalaya rivers by 2013. Rota said that goal still hasn’t been met.
“Louisiana has theoretically been working on those for 20 years. And, you know, we have seen very little progress,” said Rota. 
Mathews said Louisiana does follow a “general narrative criteria,” or more qualitative descriptions like good, bad, moderate or severe, for maintaining the amount of nutrient pollution in the state’s waters.
“It’s a good start, the narrative approach, but it should be evolved towards quantitative and measurement,” said Sabo. 
LDEQ also does a water quality assessment every two years to see if bodies of water are “supporting” or “not supporting” the narrative requirements. Mathews said that can help LDEQ decide if certain, more heavily polluted areas need to be a higher priority for cleanup. 
“It was just the most efficient tool that we had available at the time,” said Mathews.
But relying on numbers is central to making a program like this successful. A report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office looking at water quality trading programs found that without limits on the amount of nutrients allowed into waterways, there’s no demand for point source polluters to buy credits.
Getting nonpoint source polluters involved was another issue the report cited, because it’s so difficult to tell how much nutrient pollution they actually produce, creating “uncertainties about the value of credits.”
 
Can it be fixed?  
Even with the problems in Louisiana’s program, environmental advocates and scientists alike agree that trying a market strategy to control nutrient pollution isn’t a baseless idea. 
“I love working with the market rather than against it,” said Cassie Glaspie, assistant professor in Louisiana State University’s Department of Oceanography & Coastal Sciences.   
Still, she said there’s a need for regulation to play a role. 
“I usually get excited about these types of things, but I also know from experience that regulation has to be part of the talk,” she said. “Having some sort of nutrient pollution credit, I think, would be an important tool to help that, but it’s not going to solve the issue on its own.” 
Sabo said that expanding from a program solely in Louisiana to one encompassing more states in the Mississippi River Basin could be a good way to start making actual, substantial impacts in reducing problems like the dead zone. 
“Starting at home makes a lot of sense, because you can’t incentivize market participation between Iowa and Louisiana very easily, but if you have your own market set up, that’s a good pilot for something larger,” said Sabo.
While Mathews didn’t expand on specific plans for future expansion into the Basin, she emphasised the importance of Louisiana trying new and varied ways to tackle the overwhelming problem of nutrient pollution. 
“Who knows where we’re gonna go from here? We just have to get one thing done before we can move to anything else,” said Mathews.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/dead-zone-research-cruise-noaa-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-07-03 20:06:13.079394

Republican to oppose Trump’s budget bill,Ian Karbal,,,,,https://penncapital-star.com/economy/brian-fitzpatrick-only-pa-republican-to-oppose-trumps-budget-bill/,"Fitzpatrick voted in favor of an earlier version of the bill that passed the House, but opposed the amended version that returned from the Senate.","U.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, a Republican whose district includes all of Bucks County and part of Montgomery County, talks to reporters in 2023. (Jennifer Shutt/ States Newsroom)After weeks of debate, Republicans in Congress managed to pass a massive spending bill containing many of President Donald Trump’s domestic policy priorities.
Broadly, the bill includes a slew of tax cuts and increases to defense and immigration enforcement spending, which is partially paid for with cuts to safety net programs like Medicaid and food assistance. Still, the bill is projected to add more than $3 trillion to the country’s debt during the next decade.
Debate over the bill threatened to split the Republican caucus, with deficit-wary hardliners decrying its price tag and others warning of the impacts of cutting social services like Medicaid and food assistance. Ultimately, the final version of the bill passed mostly along party lines, with three Republican senators and two Republican House members joining every Democrat in opposing the final legislation.
The only Pennsylvania Republican to oppose the bill was Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-01), a moderate representing the Philadelphia suburbs.
Fitzpatrick voted in favor of an earlier version of the bill that passed the House, but opposed the amended version that returned from the Senate. It included even steeper cuts to Medicaid than had already been proposed. 
“I voted to strengthen Medicaid protections, to permanently extend middle-class tax cuts, for enhanced small business tax relief and for historic investments in our border security and our military,” Fitzpatrick said in a statement after the Thursday afternoon vote. “However, it was the Senate’s amendments to Medicaid, in addition to several other Senate provisions, that altered the analysis for our PA-1 community.” 
The bill’s Republican defenders see it differently.
“This bill delivers on the promise I made to the people of Northeastern Pennsylvania by providing the largest working-class tax cuts in American history, eliminating taxes on tips and overtime and securing the southern border,” said Rob Bresnahan (R-08), who represents Northeast Pennsylvania. “We also protect and strengthen Medicaid by cracking down on the fraud, waste and abuse that is driving the program toward collapse. This ensures Medicaid is there for seniors, people with disabilities, and vulnerable families, not for those who can work but refuse to do so.”
According to an analysis of census data by KFF, a nonprofit focused on health policy research, 92% of Medicaid recipients under 65 are either working, attending school, or not working due to caregiving, illness or disability. 
Nearly 12 million Americans could lose health insurance when the bill’s provisions take full effect, according to estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. 
The Pennsylvania Department of Human Services estimated a previous version of the bill could have resulted in 310,000 Pennsylvanians losing Medicaid coverage, and another 270,000 losing access to government-backed Affordable Care Act plans because of the expiration of enhanced premium tax credits. The version of the bill that passed Thursday made even steeper cuts.
Primarily, Medicaid cuts are accomplished by implementing strict work requirements and reporting mandates. Medicaid recipients will have to prove they’re working or volunteering at least 80 hours a month if they are not children, elderly, disabled, seriously ill, in recovery or caretakers of children under 14. They will also have to certify their eligibility at least twice a year or risk losing benefits.
Previous efforts to implement similar work requirements in Georgia and Arkansas resulted in tens of thousands of people who should have qualified for the program becoming uninsured.
The bill also sets new limits on how much states can tax health care providers like hospitals to help pay for their Medicaid programs, reducing the top rate from 6% to 3.5% by 2032.
The Department of Human Services says the move could cost them $2.7 billion in tax revenue and federal matching funds when the change takes full effect.
The bill also cuts the federal share of SNAP funding in some cases, shifting some of the burden of paying for the food assistance program to states for the first time. Alaska and Hawaii aside, states with error rates above 6% — meaning the frequency that they underpay or overpay recipients — will have to fund between 5% and 15% of the program themselves. 
Pennsylvania’s error rate was 10.76% in 2024, slightly below the national rate of 10.93%
Gov. Josh Shapiro has said repeatedly in recent weeks that Pennsylvania does not have the money to make up for lost federal funds for safety net programs. 
“Shame on these members of Congress  who spent the last few months saying, ‘Oh, I’ll never cut Medicaid,’” Shapiro told WILK radio Thursday morning. “This is just crazy that they’re voting to knock poor people off of this assistance. Why? Because they wanted to give a huge tax cut to people at the highest income level.”
The cuts led to concerns about the financial impact on rural hospitals that rely on Medicaid dollars to stay afloat. To offset that, the Senate inserted a provision creating a $50 billion fund for them.
The biggest expenses in the bill are tax cuts. It extends the first Trump administration’s 2017 tax cuts that were set to expire; it makes good on Trump’s campaign promises to eliminate taxes on tips and overtime pay; it extends the child tax credit from $2,000 to $2,200; and it raises the SALT tax deduction cap, which allows people to deduct a portion of local taxes paid from their federal filings, from $10,000 to $40,000.
There are also new tax cuts for businesses that will allow them to write off additional expenses. However, many tax cuts for green energy projects passed under the Biden administration will be eliminated.
The bill includes $350 billion in new spending for national security and immigration enforcement, including $46 billion for a U.S.-Mexico border wall, $45 billion for migrant detention facilities and $30 billion for Immigrations and Customs Enforcement.
Another $25 billion will go towards developing a country-wide missile defense system Trump has referred to as the “Golden Dome,” named after Israel’s “Iron Dome” that was built with U.S. assistance.
The CBO estimated the version of the bill that passed the House primarily benefited the wealthiest Americans, while costing the poorest.
Factoring in cuts to safety net programs, the poorest 10% of households are expected to lose around $1,600 per year, while middle income households will gain between $500 and $1,000 and households in the top 10% of income levels will gain about $12,000 annually.
Despite his ultimate opposition, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has already hammered Fitzpatrick for voting on the initial version of the bill. Then, it passed the House on a 215-214 vote, where a single flip could have held it up. 
 “Now, Fitzpatrick is trying to cover his tracks because he knows that his vote to advance massive cuts to Medicaid in order to fund tax cuts for billionaires will end his career, ” Eli Cousin, a DCCC spokesperson said in a statement.
While Fitzpatrick has held onto his seat since 2018, his district voted for Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Rep-Brian-Fitzpatrick-1024x981.jpg,,,2025-07-03 20:06:13.079394

What would John Adams, John Hancock, Benjamin Franklin, and Thomas Jefferson say to the relentless attacks on our democracy from an administration that is focused on tearing down the pillars of our country?
The post The Founders would say fight for democracy appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","DURING THESE TUMULTUOUS times when our democracy is being turned upside down by an administration showing the worst side of what government can do, I picture our nation’s Founders and what they would make of today’s America.  
What would John Adams, John Hancock, Benjamin Franklin, and Thomas Jefferson say to the relentless attacks on our democracy from an administration that is focused on tearing down the pillars of our country? 
As we prepare backyard barbecues in time for our Fourth of July celebrations, we need to remind ourselves the “why” of this national holiday.
Commemorating the birthday of the United States and the adoption of the Declaration of Independence, this cornerstone of our democracy declared,  in no uncertain terms, separation from Great Britain.  
The document was signed by 56 delegates of the Second Continental Congress,  including five from Massachusetts: John Hancock, famously the signature on it, John Adams, who was instrumental in drafting it, Samuel Adams, a key figure in the American Revolution, Robert Treat Paine, a prominent lawyer and politician, and Elbridge Gerry, a merchant and diplomat. These Founding Fathers would be appalled at recent infractions of “certain unalienable rights” on display for the world to see. 
The infractions continue to come at us at a furious pace in a relentless display of callousness from the White House. The public humiliation of elected officials; the suppression of free speech; the overreach of the government using executive orders to trample civil rights and human rights; the demonization of the media; the obsessive focus on Harvard University and foreign students across the country; the attacks on immigrants; the attacks on anything related to diversity, equity and inclusion; the marginalization of the Black community;  the targeting of LGBTQ individuals, especially the trans community; rolling back health care programs for vulnerable populations; and dismantling US humanitarian aid to countries across the globe who are facing humanitarian crises. The list goes on and on.  
Every day there are new attacks on our basic rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution. Unfortunately, the chaos brought on by the Trump administration is becoming a daily occurrence, the norm. We wake up each day and wonder, are we still living in the United States of America? 
President Trump’s grip on the Republican Party, and their control of both chambers in Congress, has made it difficult to effect any change to what the Trump administration is doing. Many Republicans may privately disagree with Trump campaign promises that benefit the select few and remove protections from those Americans who need it most, but vote for bills that contain these policies out of fear of political retaliation.  
They’ve stood idly by while the Trump administration cancels vital, congressionally mandated programs, yielding their constitutional “power of the purse.” And those Republicans who choose to stand up and call foul – those who participate in true policy discourse – are forced to retire from Congress.  
Recently, there was a very disturbing altercation involving a US senator, Alex Padilla from California, who was handcuffed and thrown to the ground in a foreboding fashion because he appeared at a press conference held by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in Los Angeles. She was there to tell the media how the Trump administration was going to “liberate” the city from the Democratic mayor and governor.   
Padilla was exercising his First Amendment right to free speech. He is a US senator elected by his constituents in California, a son of Mexican immigrants who graduated from MIT with a degree in mechanical engineering.  
Padilla recently wrote an  essay in The New York Times denouncing the Trump administration’s tactics to suppress opinions and speech of anyone with whom they don’t agree. 
He also cited the recent removal and arrest of New York City mayoral candidate Brad Lander, the city’s comptroller, who was trying to protect a migrant worker from federal agents. “Today it’s immigrants on the receiving end of Donald Trump’s outrage machine,” Padilla wrote. “Tomorrow it could be anyone.”   
The Declaration of Independence references despotism in citing the colonists’ fight with the British Crown. 
It feels like we are experiencing despotism under the current administration — the exercise of absolute power, especially in a cruel and abusive way. Padilla says what’s happening in Los Angeles is a warning shot but also a wake-up call – that “true liberation doesn’t come through military occupation; it comes from democratic participation.” 
What would Adams, Hancock, Franklin, and Jefferson say? Keep up the fight,  because there are no kings in the United States. 
Thomas P. O’Neill, III is CEO of O’Neill and Associates, a Boston-based government relations and public affairs firm. He is a former Massachusetts lieutenant governor.

But some cost-cutting measures, like Medicaid changes, will take a couple of years.","President Donald J. Trump’s sweeping bill that is set to become law on Friday will have wide-ranging implications in Connecticut and across the country on everything from taxes to health care to nutrition assistance.
Many of the tax breaks and provisions will go into effect pretty quickly or in the near future. But some of the cost-cutting measures to pay for the bill will take a couple of years before they kick in, like the most significant changes to Medicaid.
Parts of the bill will be permanent, including the 2017 tax cuts passed during the first Trump administration that were set to expire at the end of this year. That includes lower income tax rates as well as the lower corporate tax rate. But some relief will only last for a few years, like deductions on overtime pay and tips on federal income taxes.
Many of the provisions line up around upcoming elections. Some of more generous tax relief, which could give Republicans a boost in their reelection efforts, won’t expire until after the 2026 midterm elections when control of Congress is up for grabs.
And the reforms to Medicaid and nutrition assistance that could lead to cuts — that Democrats, who all voted against the bill, have warned about — won’t apply until late in Trump’s term and close to the 2028 presidential election.
What taxpayers will see in the near term and when provisions will expire
A number of new or modified tax deductions and credits will go into effect this year, though many are set to expire after a few years. That relief will go toward families, children, tipped workers and seniors, though lower earners will not benefit as much.
The bill modestly and permanently raises the maximum amount of the child tax credit from $2,000 to $2,200 per child under the age of 17 and requires at least one parent to have a Social Security number. Those with lower incomes will not benefit as much because they make too little and the tax credit is not fully refundable.
Changes to state and local tax deductions, known as SALT, will be especially beneficial for higher cost-of-living states like Connecticut. In 2022, state taxpayers had the highest average SALT deduction, around $9,100, just under the current $10,000 cap, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. That year, 11% of Connecticut’s returns claimed SALT, one of the highest rates in the U.S.
The 2017 tax bill placed a cap on SALT deductions at $10,000. The new legislation raises it to $40,000 and would get phased out for those who make over $500,000, starting in the 2025 calendar year. The cap would increase by 1% each year starting in 2025 through 2029. It would then go back down to the current threshold in 2030.
Workers will be able to deduct overtime pay or tips from their federal income tax, though there are limitations to the amount of the deductions and which workers qualify. The deductions related to tips are capped at $25,000 a year, while workers can deduct up to $12,500 on overtime pay. That relief phases out for those who earn over $150,000 a year or $300,000 if filing jointly.
And taxpayers can deduct up to $10,000 of interest on their auto loans if the car is new and assembled in the U.S. All three of those tax deductions would take effect in 2025 and last through 2028.
Seniors who are 65 and older with low to middle incomes will be able to make an additional $6,000 deduction that will start in the 2025 tax year and run through 2028. The full deduction will apply to those who individually earn under $75,000 a year or $150,000 for couples. It starts to phase out above those income thresholds and cuts off at $175,000 or $250,000 if filing jointly.
The bill will automatically create new savings accounts for newborns born between Jan. 1, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2028. The federal government will contribute a one-time infusion of $1,000 and then allow parents to contribute $5,000 a year up until age 18 that can be invested in the stock market. The secretary of the Treasury will automatically open an account if a parent doesn’t establish one.
On energy, the bill will wind down some of the clean energy tax incentives that were implemented during the Biden administration in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act soon, while others will take a few years.
Tax credits to make homes more energy efficient as well as electric vehicle rebates will go away by the end of the year.
While some of the Medicaid provisions will take a few years to set in, people will see more immediate effects related to the enrollment process for the Affordable Care Act and its subsidies. Starting next year, there will be requirements to verify an enrollee’s income and immigration status instead of automatic re-enrollment.
What will go into effect over the next few years
States like Connecticut will need to implement big changes to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps, in the coming years. Some states could be eligible for delays in implementation.
One of the biggest implications of the bill will be on states’ finances as they take on more of the costs associated with these safety net programs. That could have a domino effect on how states fund and structure the programs and lead to reductions in benefits or changes to eligibility standards. 
Both programs will institute new work requirements for certain beneficiaries in order to be eligible, while states will take on new costs that were once covered by the federal government.
To qualify for Medicaid as an adult under 65, a recipient will need to work or participate in training, education or community service at least 80 hours a month. That criteria will also apply to parents or guardians who have children 14 and older.
Exemptions will apply to certain groups including parents, guardians or caretakers of children 13 and under or who are disabled, veterans with disabilities, those who are “medically frail” or have serious medical conditions and those who are pregnant. Recipients will now need to prove they are eligible twice a year, instead of once.
This would go into effect on Dec. 31, 2026 at the earliest, though states can apply for a waiver to give them until the end of 2028 to comply with the new requirements.
Almost 950,000 people are enrolled in Connecticut’s Medicaid program known as HUSKY, according to DSS. About 73% of Connecticut adults on Medicaid were working either part-time or full-time, according to a KFF analysis of the 2023 American Community Survey.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which analyzes and scores federal legislation, estimated that about 138,000 people could lose Medicaid coverage in Connecticut, with the higher end of enrollment loss up to 172,000.
From 2028 to 2032, it also lowers Medicaid provider taxes, which enables states to increase the amount of Medicaid funding they receive from the federal government. This change will apply to states that expanded Medicaid, which Connecticut did after the enactment of the Affordable Care Act.
Nearly all states use such taxes to increase what they get for Medicaid. Connecticut has levied a provider tax that collects hundreds of millions annually from hospitals then redistributes those funds, plus more, back to the industry. Those return payments technically count as public health care spending and help Connecticut qualify for federal Medicaid grants.
States depend heavily on the federal government to help pay for Medicaid. The state’s Office of Policy and Management projected Connecticut would spend a total of $11.6 billion on Medicaid in fiscal year 2025. The federal government contributed about 59% of that funding, which is about $6.9 billion.

Connecticut Department of Social Services Commissioner Andrea Barton Reeves said she fears people will decide it’s too cumbersome to comply with the requirements and be forced to find coverage that’s higher cost or lower quality. DSS oversees HUSKY and SNAP.
“We believe they’re just going to be so frustrated and so ground down by the process that’s already quite complicated in its current form,” Barton Reeves said in an interview with The Connecticut Mirror on Thursday. “Their health will suffer and we’ll see really bad effects as a result.”
Stricter work requirements will also apply to some SNAP recipients, with similar exemptions to the ones in the Medicaid provision. About 69% of Connecticut households on SNAP already have at least one 18- to 55-year-old member working, according to DSS.
Now, more older Americans will need to work or train at least 80 hours a month to receive SNAP. The bill raises the age limit for able-bodied adults without dependents from 54 to 64. And it also applies to able-bodied adults who have children 14 and older. The bill lowered the age of a dependent, which is currently under age 18.
States may also need to pick up some of the costs associated with SNAP benefits for the first time in the nutrition program’s history. The federal government has always paid 100% of the benefits and equally shared the administrative costs with states.
Starting in fiscal year 2028, states will need to keep their payment error rate below 6% in order for the feds to keep paying for all costs associated with SNAP benefits. Those error rates take into account overpayments and underpayments.
But if it’s higher, states will have to take on anywhere from 5% up to 15%. And they will also need to pay more of the administrative fees starting in fiscal year 2027.
Connecticut’s payment error rate was about 10% in 2024. Based off of that number, the state would hit the top of the threshold and pay 15% of SNAP benefits. But that number will change since Connecticut’s share will be determined by the payment error rate from either fiscal year 2025 or 2026 — and the state can choose between the two. States may be able to delay implementation for another year or two.
In Connecticut, more than 400,000 people got SNAP benefits in 2025, according to the DSS. More than half of the recipients in the state are in families with children. That same year, Connecticut received a total of $894 million in SNAP benefits. The average benefit for each household member per month was about $190.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Waiting for President Donald Trump to deliver his remarks at the Iowa State Fairgrounds, Iowa Republicans celebrated the passage of the “big, beautiful bill” through Congress Thursday.
The event on the fairgrounds Midway was the launch of a yearlong celebration leading up to America’s 250th anniversary through the organization America250, which also planned the Washington, D.C. military parade in June.
Speaking to reporters, Iowa GOP chair Jeff Kaufmann said “aside from politics, this is a big deal that he’s starting in Iowa” for the year of events, saying he was hopeful the event and others planned throughout the country will lead to people coming together for patriotic celebrations.
“This is a really big deal for Iowa,” Kaufmann said. “… I know it’s very political, I know it’s going to be very combative, you know, today, in terms of when we talk policy – I get that. God bless America. But there’s got to be moments during this next year when we can take a time out for just a bit.”
While the gathering was officially linked to the country’s anniversary, much of the discussion at the event was centered around the passage of the tax and spending budget reconciliation bill that passed the U.S. House and was sent to Trump’s desk earlier Thursday.
Kaufmann thanked Trump and Iowa’s all-Republican federal delegation for voting in support of the measure, saying the measure was “not only … beautiful, it’s the right thing to do.”
The bill, which passed the House in a 218-214 vote is the controversial measure that would implement Medicaid work requirements, shift more funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program from the federal government to states, and extend the 2017 tax cuts approved during Trump’s first term. It also provides more than $170 billion in funding for the federal government to carry out mass deportations and raises the national debt limit by $5 trillion.
 Trump said he plans to sign the bill into law Friday, July 4, while military planes fly overhead.
“We’ll be signing with those beautiful planes flying right over our heads,” he told reporters before getting on Air Force One to head to Des Moines Thursday.
Lori Coltrain, a Des Moines resident who came with her granddaughter to the event, said she wanted to “hear the truth” from Trump about the bill and other policies advanced by his administration.
“I just hate all the negativity about it,” Coltrain said. “People should just celebrate that he’s actually gotten it through.”
Though many attendees spent several hours Thursday afternoon with temperatures above 90 degrees, spirits were high among many who were excited to hear from the president following the successful passage of one of Republicans’ major policy proposals.
Keith Reicks of Ridgeway said he was excited to hear from the president and Iowa Republican leaders about bringing the bill to the finish line. He said he was not concerned about the protests and public opposition from Democrats and others about the legislation – and said he trusts Trump to sort out any unexpected issues that could be caused by the measure.
“I think if something turns up, Trump will straighten it out,” Reicks said. “It seems like he always does. And I believe in the man. When I was younger, I didn’t think too much of Donald Trump, because I always thought he was a pusher, but now I’m glad he’s pushing.”
He also said he does not believe the discontent with the bill and some Trump policies will result in major Democratic gains during the 2026 election, saying Democrats are more focused on “complaining” about Republicans and Trump than putting forward their own ideas.
He said Iowans and most Americans still support Trump and believe he is doing a good job in the White House.
“I think he’s doing a good job,” Reicks said. “I’d vote for him again if he was running, but I don’t think he’s going to.”
Though the crowd of Trump supporters spoke largely in favor of the bill and the Republican trifecta’s work since the 2024 general election, other Iowans have rallied against GOP leaders’ actions. Protests were planned outside the State Fairgrounds for Thursday, the latest in weeks of actions calling for Iowa’s delegation to oppose the budget reconciliation bill.
Kaufmann called for Republicans to stand strong in support for the measure despite widespread opposition.
“Listen to this very carefully, folks: Do not cede an inch when you’re talking to your neighbors and friends,” Kaufmann said. “And it says this – if you work and if you’re legal, you’re not going to get kicked off Medicaid, that’s a lie. It’s a lie for desperate people.”
All four of Iowa’s U.S. House members – Reps. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, Ashley Hinson, Zach Nunn and Randy Feenstra – voted in support of the bill. They, alongside  Secretary of Interior Doug Burgum, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, flew with Trump to Iowa on Air Force One following the House vote. 
Trump hinted in a Truth Social post Tuesday he planned to talk about “some of the GREAT things he had already done on trade, especially as it relates to Farmers.” 
Earlier this year, Trump announced plans to set a baseline 10% tariffs on international imports, while he set a 90-day pause shortly after the announcement; they are set to go into effect on July 9. 
In Iowa, many farmers, local businesses owners and agricultural producers have expressed concern that they will be unable to absorb the added costs of the tariffs leading to disruptions for their business and higher costs to consumers. A study by Farmers for Free Trade found tariff costs for Iowa importers increased by 304%, roughly $68 million, from April 2024 to April 2025 and are set to increase going forward. 
Trump said he plans to begin sending letters to countries Friday dictating tariff rates.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-03 22:36:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Officials say viral video is pushing ‘inaccurate’ claims about hydrilla spraying in CT,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/03/diquat-hydrilla-ct-river/,CT officials and advocates say the negative social media posts are misleading and harmful to a project that has taken years of planning.,"In their efforts to combat the spread of a highly-invasive weed along the Connecticut River, scientists, conservation groups and public officials say they’ve had to confront a new problem that grows with even more alarming speed: online misinformation.
Their concern stems from a viral campaign that sprang up this week in opposition to an ongoing project by the Army Corps of Engineers to use chemical herbicides to halt the spread of hydrilla, an invasive plant that has taken over wide swaths of the river since it was first identified in the state in 2016.
In posts on social media and opinion pieces, critics have accused government officials of planning to “poison” rivers in Connecticut with the chemical diquat dibromide. Others have raised suspicions about the timing of project itself, which is scheduled to begin again after the July 4 holiday. 
While officials acknowledge the use of diquat, they say it is being done in compliance with state and federal regulations following lengthy studies along the Connecticut River itself.
“We appreciate the strong interest in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ efforts to combat the spread of this invasive and highly transmissible strain of Hydrilla,” Keith Hannon, the project manager for the Army Corps’ New England District, said in a statement Thursday. 
“The threat of this strain to the Connecticut River’s natural ecology are real, and include degradation of river habitat and water quality, and harm to native plants and animals,” he added. “Additionally, the strain could affect the local economy through the loss of waterway navigability and fishing, lowering of property values, and increase in flood risk.”
Much of the attention to the project in recent days appears to have come from a series of social media posts made by Chris Webby, a Connecticut-based rapper who boasts more than 128,000 followers on X. In one video posted last weekend, Webby referred to the officials behind the project as “scumbags” and “filthy crooks.” The video was later shared by another account with more than 1 million followers.
An online petition circulated later by Webby has gathered 14,868 signatures as of Thursday.
When contacted Thursday about his posts, Webby said that he was “not an expert” on hydrilla or herbicides, and that he had done much of his research using ChatGPT after coming across social media posts by a man claiming to show the effects of diquat spraying on a lake in Texas.
That research led Webby to discover that diquat is banned in the European Union, and that it can have toxic effects on other aquatic plants and wildlife besides hydrilla.
“My question is, ‘Why diquat? Why the hold up after the fourth [of July]?'” Webby said in an interview Thursday. “Why now? Why all these places? We have questions. I’m not the only one.”
But public officials and local advocates who have worked for years with the Army Corps to combat the spread of hydrilla say that answers to each of those questions, and others, are available to anyone who has taken the time to ask them.
“It’s unfortunate that this really serious problem had to come to light through misinformation and conspiracy theories,” said Alicea Charamut, the executive director of the Rivers Alliance of Connecticut, a non-profit conservation group. 
Responding to Webby’s questions about why officials don’t look at using other, mechanical means to combat hydrilla, Charamut said they did consider using a device known as a “benthic mat” that prevents the plant from growing up from the river bottom. That proved impractical, she said, because of the speed at which hydrilla grows and the fact that the mats would also smother other, native plants.
“You’d have to cover the entire river in mats. It just doesn’t work,” she said.
Jeremiah Foley, a research scientist at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station’s (CAES) Department of Environmental Science and Forestry, said the timing of the project is dictated by the life cycle of hydrilla. Infestations of the plant typically reach their peak in late summer, when they create dense mats that can crowd out native species, clog boat propellers and even block access to parts of the river.
The purpose of the project, he said, is to disrupt the plants before they reach their peak and begin spreading small sprouts, known as turions, that form into new plants the following year.
Allies of the project also bristled at Webby’s assertions that the use of diquat is being carried out in “secret” without public input. The reality, they say, is the Army Corps spent years studying the use of herbicides and holding public meetings to devise the best methods of fighting hydrilla without harming the broader ecosystem.
“Some of the stuff I read was that it was quietly passed, nobody knew, or they’re trying to get money for their programs … I mean, that’s really not based in reality,” said Bill Lucey, the Long Island Soundkeeper at the environmental non-profit Save the Sound.
In 2023, Foley began working with the Army Corps to conduct experiments using dyes to study the flow of water in areas where they planned to use herbicides. By watching where the dyes went, he said, researchers gained a better understanding of where to apply the smallest amounts of herbicides necessary to attack the hydrilla.
“A lot of people have the misconception, when you put a chemical in the water, it is just flowing out of the system everywhere, and that is absolutely not the case,” Foley said. 
Based on the results of those studies, the Corps decided last year to move forward with a plan to begin applying herbicides, including diquat, in five areas along the river. Before doing so, officials held three public meetings in towns along the river to present the plans, and Foley said he and other researchers conducted a inventory of all the aquatic vegetation within the selected sites so they would be able to go back later and see what was left.
“What we find is that many of those native plants that we recorded not only were still there, but [were] increasing in abundance,” Foley said. “At the same time, those invasives that we were targeting, principally hydrilla, are knocked out of the system.”
Foley’s experiments using dyes drew notice from national outlets such as the New York Times, which published an article on those efforts nearly two years ago. The actual treatments using herbicides were carried out in a series of demonstrations last summer that were open to the public, according to notices published last year by the Army Corps.
Last month, the Army Corps published another notice of its plans to expand the project to a dozen additional sites this summer along the Connecticut River, its tributaries, and one lake and a pond. The Corps also opened a public comment period on its plans, which remains open through July 13.
Foley said much of the work this summer at the new sites will likely be limited to conducting dye tracing experiments before crews can even attempt to apply herbicides.
Hannon, in an email Thursday, said the Army Corps does not yet have the state permits necessary to conduct its proposed herbicide applications this summer, and will publish an updated schedule of its plans once those applications are in place. An official with the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection said in a statement that the agency has been “in touch” with the Army Corps regarding their plans to ensure that officials comply with all applicable state laws and regulations.
Christine Palm, a former state lawmaker from Chester who championed many environmental causes — including the establishment of CAES’ aquatic invasive species program — was among those who spoke out against Webby’s viral claims this week. 
“He does not have credibility in the scientific world or in the environmental advocacy world,” Palm said. “He has wreaked havoc on years of thoughtful, careful, expert work.”
In response to those criticisms, Webby said he had reached out to officials at the Army Corps and DEEP and never heard back. He added that suspicions about the project have been validated by the feedback he’s received from others online.
“I’m not saying this is not being done for a reason. I’m saying I don’t like the sound of it,” Webby said. “It sounds like a lot of other people don’t like the sound of it.”
Charamut, with the Rivers Alliance, said she understands the public’s fear over the use of herbicides, which her group has fought to limit in the past. But the aggressive nature of hydrilla — which has spread as far north as Massachussetts — has left officials with no other viable alternatives, she said.
One positive that has resulted from the sudden attention to the project, she said, is an increase in calls to the Rivers Alliance from people asking about hydrilla and methods to combat it. 
“People should be asking questions. This process was set up to give people that opportunity,” Charamut said. “But get your answers from trusted sources… not a rapper on the internet.”

If approved by a judge, the payment would resolve a lawsuit in which the estate of the late Kenneth Johnson alleged racism, negligence and medical malpractice led to his death at the Newport prison.

The estate of a Black man who died in a Vermont prison more than five years ago has agreed to accept $1.5 million to resolve a lawsuit brought against the state’s former medical provider alleging that racism, medical malpractice and negligence led to the man’s death.
Details of the proposed resolution were included in recent court filings in the case in U.S. District Court in Burlington arising from the December 2019 death of 60-year-old Kenneth Johnson at the Northern State Correctional Facility in Newport.
A court filing by attorneys in the case, titled a “Stipulated Order of Judgment,” still needs the approval of Judge Christina Reiss, who has presided over the case. 
The filing seeking the order of judgment to resolve the claims differs from a straight out settlement. 
“It’s a judgment, and that’s an important distinction,” said James Valente, an attorney representing Johnson’s estate. 
Confidentiality provisions are often part of settlements resolving litigation between private parties. A judgment, on the other hand, is a matter of public record.
“Our client had reservations about a settlement that would include a confidentiality provision,” Valente said Thursday. Olynthea Johnson, Kenneth Johnson’s sister, is the administrator of his estate. 
Shap Smith, an attorney for Centurion Health, the state’s contracted medical provider for prisons at the time of Johnson’s death, declined to comment Thursday. 
The lawsuit filed in December 2021 alleged that Johnson died in the prison infirmary after workers for Virginia-based Centurion Health failed to diagnose and treat a tumor that led to Johnson’s death by asphyxiation.

The wrongful death and medical malpractice lawsuit also alleged Centurion Health discriminated against Johnson, a Black man, due to his race. 
According to the suit, Johnson endured “extreme pain and suffering” and “extreme psychological distress” in the hours before he died. The suit accuses guards and medical staff of ignoring his pleas for medical help.
Initial reports from the Vermont Department of Corrections at the time said  it appeared Johnson died from natural causes. A person who was incarcerated with Johnson told Seven Days a week after Johnson’s death that he had been having difficulty breathing and begging for medical care before he died. 
Later, investigations, including the one by the Vermont Defender’s General’s Office, blasted the corrections department and Centurion medical staff over the care provided to Johnson. 
A court filing by Centurion’s attorneys stated that the health care provider has made an offer of $1.5 million to the estate. “This offer of judgment includes all amounts that might be recovered by the estate for any damages, costs, attorneys’ fees, and pre-judgment interest,” the filing said. 
The offer of judgment, the filing added, was “not to be construed as an admission of liability by any defendants, or any official, employee or agent of Centurion of Vermont.”
In a separate court filing this week, the estate accepted the offer. As of Thursday afternoon, the judge had yet to sign off on the proposed order of judgment, according to court filings.
Valente, speaking Thursday afternoon, said he believed that the judge would sign off on the order. If the judge does so, the lawsuit would be resolved. 
Johnson’s estate had previously reached a settlement with the Vermont Department of Corrections, which had also been named as a defendant in the lawsuit, for $150,000, according to Valente and a corrections department spokesperson.  
That $150,000 payment is in addition to the $1.5 million the estate would receive from Centurion.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)NASHVILLE — A federal judge presiding over the Tennessee criminal charges against Kilmar Abrego Garcia has ordered lawyers to refrain from making public statements about the case.
Thursday’s order by US District Judge Waverly Crenshaw came at the request of Abrego’s attorneys, who argued that government officials had “launched a public disparagement campaign against” their client that could prejudice his chance at a fair trial and violated standard court rules.
The defense attorneys cited a string of statements by members of the Trump administration that variously labelled Abrego a “gangbanger,” “monster,” “Illegal predator,” “Illegal alien terrorist,” “wife beater” and “barbarian.”
“From the moment Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia challenged his illegal rendition to El Salvador in March 2025, the government has repeatedly maligned him in public statements,” the attorneys wrote.
Abrego Garcia was beaten and tortured in Salvadoran prison, new court filings reveal

“Mr. Abrego is entitled to a fair trial,” they wrote. “But he is nearly certain to be denied that right if the government, left to its own devices, stays its current course.”
Crenshaw’s one-sentence order, issued in response, said: “All counsel are expected to comply with the local rules of this court.”
Court rules prohibit making public statements that “have a substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing an adjudicative proceeding in the matter.” The rule applies to attorneys and “the government agencies or offices . . . and employees of such . . . government agencies or offices, with which the lawyer is associated.”
Abrego was living in Maryland when he was mistakenly dispatched to a Salvadoran prison as part of a larger Trump administration illegal immigration crackdown. 
Court documents filed Wednesday in a separate immigration case in Maryland alleged Abrego endured “severe beatings, severe sleep deprivation, inadequate nutrition, and psychological torture” while there.
He was later brought to Nashville to face two human smuggling charges. Prosecutors allege Abrego participated in a scheme to transport migrants who illegally entered the United States to points around the country. 
In a reversal, judge keeps Kilmar Abrego in jail over deportation concerns

The former federal prosecutor who conceded Abrego had wrongly been sent to the notorious CECOT prison in El Salvador was later fired and has subsequently filed a whistleblower complaint that alleges his termination was, in part, related to his public admission of the government’s administrative error in the high-profile case.
Abrego, who has no past criminal history in the United States, has entered not guilty pleas to the charges. 
Abrego is due back in a Nashville courtroom July 16 for a hearing that could determine if he is released from federal custody. 
Both prosecutors and defense attorneys concede Abrego will almost certainly be taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) should he be released from the custody of the U.S. Marshalls, who maintain control over federal pretrial detainees.
Abrego, 29, entered the United States illegally from El Salvador as a teenager, but in 2019 an immigration judge issued an order preventing U.S. officials from deporting him to his home country, where Abrego said he feared gang violence.
A federal magistrate in Nashville initially granted Abrego’s release last week. 
But defense attorneys, citing conflicting statements by the Trump administration about whether Abrego could be removed from the United States before trial, have asked he temporarily remain jailed in Nashville.

This story, by Report for America corps member Carly Berlin, was produced through a partnership between VTDigger and Vermont Public.
The city of Burlington decided on Thursday to “indefinitely pause” a sanctioned parking area for people experiencing homelessness before the initiative had even begun.
The “Safe Overnight Parking pilot project” at Perkins Pier along the city’s waterfront was slated to begin on Friday, July 4. City officials announced its creation on Tuesday, as a response to a round of evictions from the state’s motel voucher program that has primarily impacted families with children and individuals with severe medical needs.

But on Thursday afternoon, city officials decided to halt the project, in response to “substantial community feedback, and out of concern for the safety of program participants based on threatening comments made by members of the public on various online platforms,” according to a city press release.
Joe Magee, deputy chief of staff for Burlington Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak, said city officials received a significant number of concerned messages from “residents, and businesses, and folks who have boats docked” near the Maple Street lot. 
Social media posts expressing hostile sentiments about the project also led city officials to worry about the safety of unhoused people staying there, Magee said. The police department planned to do additional patrols of the area, Magee said, but the parking lot would not have had a “stationary overnight security presence.”
The city had received two inquiries from people who had wanted to park overnight in the lot, which was supposed to have space for twelve vehicles, Magee said. Officials had not yet approved any registrations for it.
Between June 23 and July 1, state officials anticipated 140 adults and 61 children would lose access to the motel voucher program in the Burlington area. The current wave of evictions from the program is in large part the result of an executive order expiring that had protected families with children and people with acute medical needs, like those who are homebound or receiving cancer treatment. 
Burlington officials estimate that hundreds of people are already sleeping outdoors or in vehicles in the city, with tents tucked along the waterfront bike path an increasingly common sight.
“The city does not have the resources or staff to be able to … address the shortage of shelter alone,” Magee said. “We really need state partnership to come up with more tangible solutions.”

Of those, 137,000 face obstacles from more stringent work requirements in the bill, and the other 33,000 are refugees and asylees who would also no longer be eligible for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP.
Washington would also be on the hook for about $88 million in added administrative costs annually, according to estimates the governor’s office sent out Thursday. And unless Washington reduces its already-low payment error rate, it could have to shoulder upward of $100 million a year in new costs the feds previously paid.
States that can’t pick up those added costs could be forced to severely downsize or shut down their SNAP programs entirely. While the federal government funds the benefits, states run the program. The two levels of government share administrative expenses.
“It’s a very real possibility that states will just choose not to participate in SNAP at all,” said Claire Lane, director of the Seattle-based Anti-Hunger and Nutrition Coalition.
Democrats decried the legislation for shredding the social safety net while locking in tax cuts for wealthy Americans. The proposed cuts to food stamps would be the biggest since the program’s launch.
The SNAP changes would reduce federal spending on the program nationwide by an estimated $230 billion over 10 years. This is one of the key ways that Republicans offset revenue losses from lower taxes.
“This bill takes food from our most vulnerable Washingtonians to give tax breaks to the ultra-wealthy,” Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson said in a statement Thursday.
The White House recently said “the mission of the program has failed,” while the GOP overhaul “promotes work, responsibility, and restores SNAP to serve the truly needy.”
Currently, SNAP requires able-bodied adults between the ages of 18 and 54 without dependents to work at least 20 hours per week to access food stamps. The megabill the U.S. House passed Thursday would up that to age 64 and add work requirements for parents whose children are at least 14 years old. Previously exempt veterans, former foster youth and people experiencing homelessness would also need to work.
In March, the most recent month for which data is available, over 908,000 Washingtonians received a total of $168 million in SNAP benefits. That’s more than 10% of the state’s residents. Nationwide, the country’s largest anti-hunger initiative serves upward of 42 million people.
The 137,000 who could lose benefits unless they meet the new work requirements make up 15% of the state’s SNAP participants. These requirements could take effect this year.
Others on the program would see their benefits reduced by an average of $56 per month, according to the state Department of Social and Health Services that runs Washington’s SNAP program.
The agency estimates the lost economic activity from SNAP will cost grocery stores, farmers markets and other Washington retailers at least $360 million annually.
The legislation Republicans call the “big, beautiful bill” also carries major financial implications for the state. 
The biggest chunk comes from errors in payments states make to recipients. Based on how often they overpay or underpay, states would have to shoulder more of the cost of funding benefits. Those that keep their error rates below 6% can avoid paying anything. 
Last week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture released error rates for each state in fiscal year 2024. Washington’s was 6.06%. The vast majority of that is overpayments. 
The national average is around 11%.
At the eleventh hour, Senate Republicans carved out exemptions for states with the worst error rates to help win the key vote of Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska. Her state has by far the highest error rate, at nearly 25%.
For Washington, this issue could mean more than $100 million in new state expenses. This won’t start until 2028 federal fiscal year, so the state can still improve its error rate.
The megabill also shifts more administrative costs to the states from a 50-50 split to the feds paying just 25%. 
The reconciliation bill’s passage and looming financial threat for states come as Washington raises taxes and cuts costs to fill a huge budget shortfall.
“This massive payment shift to states is happening at the same time that we’re losing state workers, and as the economy slows for everyone,” Lane said. “Every state’s budget is going to be pressed.”
Trump is set to sign the legislation carrying his domestic agenda Friday. Washington’s congressional delegation voted along party lines, with all Democrats opposed and Reps. Michael Baumgartner, R-Spokane, and Dan Newhouse, R-Sunnyside, supporting the bill.
Their central and eastern Washington districts have the most households that receive SNAP benefits, as of 2023, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
Newhouse’s office identified the changes to the SNAP program as provisions that the congressman “worked to secure” and said they would save taxpayers money by “rooting out waste, and instituting long-overdue accountability incentives to control costs.” His office also described the state cost-sharing revisions as “modest.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/food-stamps-SNAP-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-03 19:03:56.653925

The Fourth of July and Pioneer Day drone shows will double the size Salt Lakers saw last year, city officials announced this week.

“So 150 is pretty typical for a drone show. And this year, for the first time, we’ll be doing 300 drones, which will allow us the ability to have bigger, better, more intricate, more detailed images up in the sky with the drones,” said Jana Cunningham, communications manager for the Salt Lake City Department of Public Lands.
For Saturday, the day after Independence Day, the city is planning a big event in Jordan Park starting at 8 p.m. with live music and food trucks. The drone show, scheduled to last about 20 minutes, will begin at 10 p.m. 
The Saturday lights display is set to feature iconic monuments from across the country, Cunningham said, “such as the Space Needle, the Golden Gate Bridge and Statue of Liberty, the Lincoln Memorial, things like that.”
The city’s Pioneer Day drone show will cap off a full day of celebrations on July 24 at Liberty Park. That event is also set to start at 8 p.m., but the drone display is scheduled for 10 p.m.

To celebrate the most Utah-centric holiday, the city is planning a show that reflects the state’s idiosyncratic culture.
“Spectators can enjoy graphics and images such as national parks,” Cunningham said. “We’re going to do soda shops, because nothing screams Utah more than a dirty soda.” 
Cookie wars, city and state flags, and other Utah landmarks are also expected to make appearances in the drones’ choreographies. 
The city has been hosting drone shows since 2023 in line with its sustainability goals, and attendees have embraced the new tradition, Cunningham said. 
She also said it’s a safer alternative to fireworks.
“We have a great risk of fire,” Cunningham said. “(Fireworks) also create quite a bit of pollution in the air and debris in the air. And really, we switched to drones because it guarantees more of a safe and environmentally friendly celebration.”
Private firework discharges are still allowed in the city. But, there are restricted areas to help prevent accidental fires.

(Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)The U.S. Department of Education’s decision this week to hold back $6.8 billion in federal K-12 funds next year has triggered alarm among state education officials, school leaders and advocacy groups nationwide over how the lack of funds will affect their after-school, enrichment and language-learning services.
The Trump administration’s decision to freeze the funding has put states in “triage mode” as they scramble to decide what programs may be cut without that funding, said Mary Kusler, senior director for the Center for Advocacy at the National Education Association. The money was approved by Congress to support education for English language learners, migrants, low-income children and adults learning to read, among others.
As of July 1, school systems are unable to draw down funding, jeopardizing summer programs, hiring and early-year planning for the 2025–26 school year.
The funding freeze affects several core programs: Title II-A (educator training and recruitment), Title III-A (English learner support), Title IV-A (student enrichment and after-school), as well as migrant education and adult education and literacy grants. Trump has proposed eliminating all those programs in his proposed budget for next fiscal year, but that proposal hasn’t gone through Congress.
State superintendents sent out missives to school districts early this week and now are scrambling to make choices.
“This is not about political philosophy, this is about reliability and consistency,” Alabama state Superintendent Eric Mackey said to Politico this week. “None of us were worrying about this.”
The administration says it is reviewing the programs.
“The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities,” the U.S. Department of Education wrote to states in its announcement Monday.
Trump administration tells states it’s freezing $6.8 billion for K-12 school programs

Historically, the department releases allocations by July 1 to ensure schools can budget and plan effectively for the coming school year. Withholding the money could result in canceled programs, hiring freezes and the loss of essential support for English learners, migrant children and other high-need populations, education and state officials told Stateline.
“America’s public school leaders run district budgets that are dependent on a complex partnership between federal, state, and local funding,” said David R. Schuler, executive director of the School Superintendents Association in a statement. “For decades, school districts have relied on timely confirmation of their federal allocations ahead of the July 1 start of the fiscal year — ensuring stability, allowing for responsible planning, and supporting uninterrupted educational services for students.”
The states facing the largest withheld amounts include California ($810.7 million), Texas ($660.9 million), and New York ($411.7 million), according to data from the NEA and the Learning Policy Institute, an education think tank.
The Missouri state budget that took effect Tuesday includes more than $79 million in federal funds the state anticipated receiving from the frozen programs. The largest portion is $28.9 million dedicated to improving teacher effectiveness, closely followed by $24.9 million for science, technology, engineering and math, or STEM, education programs and career counseling and mentorship in those fields.
For 17 states and territories, the freeze affects over 15% of their total federal K-12 allocations, according to the Learning Policy Institute. For smaller jurisdictions such as the District of Columbia and Vermont, the disruption hits even harder: More than 20% of their federal K-12 budgets remain inaccessible.
Colorado Education Commissioner Susan Córdova urged school districts to begin contingency planning in case funds are not released before the federal fiscal year ends on Sept. 30. California State Superintendent Tony Thurmond hinted at possible legal action, which has become a trend as states fight the second Trump administration’s funding revocations or delays.
“California will continue to pursue all available legal remedies to the Trump Administration’s unlawful withholding of federal funds appropriated by Congress,” Thurmond said in a statement.
The NEA and the NAACP have filed for a preliminary injunction, calling the administration’s delay an illegal “impoundment” — a violation of the federal Impoundment Control Act, which bars the executive branch from withholding appropriated funds without congressional approval.
Education advocates warn the recent decision by the Trump administration to withhold funding reflects a broader pattern of federal disengagement from public education.
Community nonprofits said the withholding could devastate their programming too. The Boys and Girls Clubs of America could have to close more than 900 centers — bringing the loss of 5,900 jobs and affecting more than 220,000 children, said President and CEO Jim Clark in a statement.
The 1974 Impoundment Control Act lets the president propose canceling funds approved by Congress. Lawmakers have 45 days to approve the request; if they don’t, it’s denied. Meanwhile, agencies can be directed not to spend the funds during that time.
A White House statement shared with States Newsroom this week said “initial findings have shown that many of these grant programs have been grossly misused to subsidize a radical leftwing agenda.”
“Kids, educators, and working families are the ones losing,” said Kusler, of the NEA. “We need governors and communities to step up — now.”

Republican Thomas Massie and Democrat Morgan McGarvey opposed the measure but not for the same reasons.
Republican U.S. Rep. Hal Rogers, whose Appalachian district is one of the country’s most dependent on Medicaid, issued a statement claiming the One Big Beautiful Bill Act “strengthens Medicaid and SNAP benefits.”
An independent analysis of the bill’s effects on rural health care found that Kentucky will suffer the biggest hit of any state — a decline of $10 billion in Medicaid payments to rural providers over 10 years as 130,000 rural Kentuckians are expected to lose their Medicaid coverage. The analysis is by KFF, a nonpartisan health research organization.
‘They’ll get over it,’ McConnell reportedly assures GOP colleagues about Medicaid cuts

The Kentucky Hospital Association has warned the legislation would eliminate 33,000 jobs as Medicaid underfunding forces hospitals to reduce services or even close.
The bill also trims future funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, in which 575,000 Kentuckians participate, and shifts to states part of the costs.
In his statement, Rogers hinted that the measure headed for Trump’s desk is not the final word. “Ultimately, this is not the end of our reconciliation work, and as a cardinal member of the House Appropriations Committee, I will continue working to improve funding options for our rural hospitals and clinics.”
Rogers, of Somerset, also said, “While the House-version of the bill would have been far better for rural healthcare, the Senate added a $50 billion safety net for rural healthcare providers, carving out funding specifically for rural states like Kentucky, and delaying implementation of new provider tax rates to 2028.”

The House version, shepherded out of committee by House Energy and Commerce Committee Chair Brett Guthrie, a Republican from Bowling Green, protected supplemental Medicaid payments that narrow the revenue gap between Medicaid and private insurance by pumping billions of dollars into Kentucky hospitals that treat a large share of low-income patients. The supplemental payments are funded by a tax on health care providers.
The Senate version, which the House largely adopted, would effectively eliminate the supplemental support that Kentucky hospitals say is critical to their viability, Kentucky Hospital Association President and CEO Nancy Galvagni told the Lantern. 
In the Senate, where Vice President JD Vance cast the tie-breaking vote, Rand Paul of Kentucky was one of three Republicans who voted against the bill, objecting to its deficit-raising effects. Sen. Mitch McConnell voted for it.
The legislation makes tax cuts, including no taxes on tips, effective immediately while the cuts to benefits won’t go into effect until after next year’s mid-term elections.
Guthrie hailed passage of the bill, calling it a “a victory for millions of Americans, providing a historic tax cut, securing Medicaid, and ensuring American energy dominance.”
  U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)
But his fellow Republican, Massie of Vanceburg, pointed to the bill’s effects on federal deficits and debt and the economy. The bill will add $3.4 trillion to deficits during the next decade compared to current law, according to the Congressional Budget Office. 
“Although there were some conservative wins in the budget reconciliation bill (OBBBA), I voted No on final passage because it will significantly increase U.S. budget deficits in the near term, negatively impacting all Americans through sustained inflation and high interest rates,” Massie posted on X.
Republican U.S. Rep. Andy Barr, of Lexington, who’s seeking the GOP nomination for U.S. Senate next year, issued a statement saying, “This is the latest and greatest chapter of the Trump economic comeback — and the theme is promises made, promises kept.”
Barr echoed a familiar GOP talking point: “We achieved all of these goals while protecting and strengthening Medicaid for Kentuckians who truly need it — not ineligible recipients or illegal immigrants.”
Rogers, likewise, said: “The bill protects the longevity of Medicaid benefits for our most vulnerable population by slashing waste, fraud and abuse of the program. With 4.8 million able-bodied adults receiving Medicaid, who choose not to work, the bill enforces a 20-hour weekly work requirement for those individuals who do not have small kids. Without question, we are adding integrity and strength to Medicaid and SNAP assistance for those who need it most in the years ahead.”
Rogers said the bill “reinvests in coal country, by expanding a tax credit that some coal mines will now be eligible for, including Eastern Kentucky.”

Democrat Morgan McGarvey of Louisville slammed the GOP budget bill’s priorities calling it “a slap in the face to Kentucky and all of rural America. It will kick millions of Americans off their health insurance, take food away from Kentucky families, kids, and seniors, and add trillions to the national debt. All so that Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos pay even less in taxes. It is cruel and indefensible.
“I don’t want to hear any Republican who voted for this say they care about rural America or our national debt ever again,” McGarvey said.
Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear, who has been an outspoken critic of the measure, repeated his warnings that the changes will be “devastating” for Kentucky.
In an interview on MSNBC, Beshear said 200,000 Kentuckians stand to lose health care and states cannot possibly make up for the federal government’s retreat from funding social safety net programs.
“No state has the budget to fix what the federal government, that Donald Trump and the Republicans are about to break. No state can make up for hundreds of billions of dollars of Medicaid payments flowing through our economy. If you just look at the economy at large, health care is one of the fastest growing segments out there. And this is the Republicans just taking a hatchet to it. We’re going to see job losses across America.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2194945302-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-03 19:03:56.653925

 The Senate version cuts nearly $1 trillion from Medicaid over 10 years

The Senate version of the budget and tax cut bill is expected to cut federal spending on Medicaid by around $1 trillion and increase the number of uninsured Americans by 11.8 million over the next 10 years, according to a preliminary estimate from the Congressional Budget Office.
US House passes massive tax break and spending cut bill, sending it to Trump

Erin Riley, outreach and engagement coordinator with the advocacy group Idaho Voices for Children, said the estimates in health care reductions are “conservative,” and many of the losses of coverage would be due to increased paperwork under new requirements in the bill. 
“In general, we might see people losing their Medicaid coverage because of eligibility, … but it’s a lot of paperwork,” Riley said. “It’s death by 1,000 cuts. So folks that would probably be eligible for traditional Medicaid, they might get caught up in that cycle of not being able to report that they are eligible. There’s just a lot of red tape.” 
Under the bill, able-bodied adults would be required to work or conduct “work-related activities” at least 80 hours a week and prove eligibility and compliance every six months. There would be exceptions for parents of children under the age of 14. 
Idaho is also pursuing its own work requirement through House Bill 345 for those who are insured through Medicaid expansion — a program approved by voters in 2018 to extend Medicaid eligibility to those who earned too much to qualify for traditional coverage but not enough to qualify for the premium tax credit to get health care coverage through the state marketplace. 
The state’s changes to Medicaid will need to be approved by federal authorities before going into effect.
 Sen. Crapo says bill protects Medicaid coverage for those it was intended for 

The broad-reaching bill extends tax cuts approved in 2017, during the first Trump administration, that mostly benefit wealthy people, critics and some experts say. The bill, among many provisions, also enhances funding for the military and immigration enforcement, ends renewable energy programs approved by the Biden administration, and reduces funding for some public assistance programs, such as Medicaid and food assistance through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP.

Crapo, who serves as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said that the bill would protect benefits “for whom Medicaid was intended,” including pregnant women, children, seniors and those with disabilities; Crapo didn’t include in his remarks low-income residents, who were eligible after states were able to expand Medicaid following the passage of the Affordable Care Act. 
He argued that programs that enroll healthy Americans and undocumented residents have been driving up the program’s costs. 
“This rate of expansion is unsustainable and puts the future of the program at risk,” Crapo said on the floor. 
U.S. Sen. Jim Risch’s office said in a press release that one of the achievements of the bill he supported was it preserved “Medicaid for vulnerable Americans by enacting common-sense reforms that prioritize resources for those who need care.”

Rep. Mike Simpson’s office could not be immediately reached for comment on the Medicaid portion of the budget bill, but said in an emailed statement the bill “is the America-First policy agenda that Idahoans and Americans nationwide voted for in November.” 
U.S. Rep. Russ Fulcher’s office also could not be immediately reached for comment. He said in a press release that he voted Thursday to “deliver what effectively will result in the single largest tax cut in American history for the American People, and to bolster border and military resources to keep our communities safe.”
In a statement, Idaho Democratic Party Chair Lauren Necochea sharply criticized the votes of Idaho’s congressmen.
“Idaho Democrats believe hard work should mean a roof over your head, food on the table, healthcare you can count on, and a fair shot for your kids. Mike Simpson and Russ Fulcher just voted to rip that away,” she said. “They backed a Republican budget that pushes the American Dream further out of reach for working people, while catering to billionaires with penthouses and private jets.”

The spending bill does not extend the enhanced premium tax credits, which were passed by Congress through the American Rescue Plan Act to reduce health care premiums through the marketplace established in the Affordable Care Act. The enhanced credits are slated to expire this year, and if Congress does not extend them, many people would see their premiums “skyrocket,” Riley said. 
On average, the tax credits have reduced premium payments by $705 a year, according to the health care policy organization KFF. 
Increases could be more significant for some groups. 
An estimate by Idaho Voices for Children shows an Idaho couple in their 60s, making $82,000 a year, would see their annual premiums rise from $6,970 to over $22,222. 
“With that high premium cost, we’re going to see people drop off because they’re just not going to be able to afford coverage,” Riley said.

(Provided/Gullah Traveling Theater)When George Washington goes to heaven in the Gullah Traveling Theater’s telling of the American Revolution, Saint Peter stops him at the pearly gates.
The country’s first president and commander-in-chief of the Continental Army must first reckon with his ownership of slaves and their lives before he can pass, Saint Peter tells him.
Though obviously a fictional scenario, the Virginia planter’s will indicates he did struggle internally with the juxtaposition of securing freedom for a country while enslaving people, according to historians. Signed six months before his death in 1799, it ordered enslaved workers at Mount Vernon freed when his wife, Martha Washington, died, though fewer than half actually were.
In the play, the general does make it into heaven.
Through Washington and other famous Revolutionary figures looking back at their lives, the nonprofit theater company tells the often-overlooked story of enslaved people in South Carolina during the Revolution, said director Anita Singleton Prather.


How to see the show
An excerpt of the show will play at 4 p.m. July 9 at Christ Lutheran Church in Hilton Head Island. Tickets are free.
Da’Gullah American Revolution Experience will play at 2 p.m. July 19 at May River Theater in Bluffton. Advance tickets for adults are $45. Youth ages 7 to 17 are $15. Children age 0 to 6 are free. All tickets include a rice tasting. The show will be part of a mini festival taking pace from noon to 6 p.m. at the theater.


“They say behind every great man is a great woman, but I knew behind every great Revolutionary hero was probably some Black folks,” Prather said.
SC250, which is tasked with celebrating the 250th anniversary of the country’s founding, asked the Beaufort-based theater troupe’s director last year if she would be interested in putting on a show about the Gullah Geechee experience during the Revolutionary War.
Prather jumped at the chance to tell the story, she said.
“A lot of our history has not been included in your normal textbooks or archives,” Prather said.
Research was Prather’s first step.
She, like many people, knew much of the history that has been compiled of enslaved people during the Civil War, but the Revolution remained a dark spot in that history. That wasn’t for lack of trying. Not nearly as much has been written about slaves during that era, she said.
Prather knew that many people were enslaved in Barbados and brought to Charleston, so she visited the country in the Caribbean Sea in January. There, she got a better sense of the slave trade during that time.
She read accounts of the people enslaved to well-known figures during the war in South Carolina, including “Swamp Fox” Francis Marion and “Fighting Gamecock” Thomas Sumter.
Because the play is fictional, Prather used historical accounts as the bones of the stories and filled in the gaps with her own writing, she said.
The play, called Da’Gullah American Revolution Experience, heavily features music, which was another challenge.
Scott Gibbs, the company’s music and art director, wanted to include traditional Gullah Geechee songs from the era, knowing some from the Civil War had survived the years, but he couldn’t find much. So, he rearranged other spirituals to fit the scenes, he said.
“I’ve learned that sometimes (music) lightens the telling of the story,” Gibbs said. “You still have to tell the story. You still have to tell the truth, but it’s how you tell the story and how you tell the truth.”
While the story grapples with an ugly part of history, the point is not to take away from the major contributions and sacrifices the heroes of the Revolutionary War made in founding the country.
Principles of the Declaration of Independence they signed, such as liberty, freedom and the pursuit of happiness, were generally good, Prather said.
Founding Mothers’ Day recognizes SC women’s contributions to The Revolution

The Founding Fathers should have recognized that those principles should have applied to all people in the country, including those who were enslaved, she said. To do that, the play humanizes the people denied the right to freedom for which the heroes of the Revolution fought, she said.
At a time when references to slavery at places such as national parks are being removed, Prather wanted audiences to grapple with the difficult parts of the past, she said.
“If you leave out the Gullah Geechee, then South Carolina history is not complete,” Prather said. “If you leave out South Carolina history, American history is not complete. Without American history, world history is not complete.”
“We have to tell the stories, and history is not good or bad,” Prather continued. “It’s just what happened.”
Those contradictions were what made Prather decide to frame the story through characters looking back on their lives at heaven’s gates as opposed to using a more traditional linear narrative, she said.
A person like Washington, seen as a symbol of freedom during the Revolution, can face the people he enslaved as he never would have in life, she said.
In this version of the afterlife, enslaved people confront the people who owned them. During one act of the play, the characters read fictionalized letters to their masters, saying everything Prather imagined they might have said if given the chance.
For instance, Oscar Marion — who was enslaved by the general who’s the namesake of a South Carolina city, county and public university — is able to ask Francis Marion how he could enslave him despite them reportedly being friends as children and fighting side by side during the war.
“‘You don’t think I deserve the same freedom I fought for you to have?’” Prather said Oscar Marion asks. “‘You don’t think I deserve the same thing?’”
The play, which showed an abridged preview in May, is only able to tell the story of a handful of enslaved people. Prather wants people to take away a broader curiosity of their role in the war.
“There are so many untold stories that need to be told,” Prather said. “We won’t get to tell them all, but hopefully we’ll give people enough of a taste that they will go and do some of their own research.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-03-at-4.27.05-PM.png,,,2025-07-03 18:07:35.127822

Jim Pillen on Thursday announced an interim director for the Nebraska Department of Economic Development: Maureen Larsen, who currently serves as the governor’s general counsel.
Larsen, who earned her law degree from the University of Nebraska College of Law, also serves as Pillen’s deputy director of policy research. The policy division serves as the governor’s personal lobbying arm.
She is to transition from her current role July 21, replacing K.C. Belitz, whose resignation was announced suddenly last month after serving two years on the job. Belitz’s final day as DED director is July 18.
Larsen earned her bachelor’s degree from the University of Vermont. 
The DED director has been a rather high-profile position, overseeing grants and funding for economic development ventures and attending related ribbon-cuttings for projects across the state.

Larsen’s general counsel and policy research position has been more behind the scenes. She was quoted in a 2023 Flatwater Free Press story about an apparent unprecedented move by the Pillen administration to shield the governor’s communications.
Larsen, in a response to the news outlet’s request for email, said certain communication of the governor was “protected by executive privilege” or “deliberative process privilege,” the FFP reported. 
Several former and current officials and advocates told the FFP they couldn’t recall any other Nebraska governors invoking that privilege to deny access to records.
Pillen’s media statement thanked Belitz for his service. It did not indicate when a permanent DED director might be named.

The ACLU of Missouri filed a lawsuit Wednesday in Cole County with two objectives: Keep the proposal designated as Amendment 3 off of […],"The Cole County Courthouse in Jefferson City (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent)A fight over wording for a proposal to reverse the abortion rights amendment Missouri voters added to the state Constitution in November will look very much like a similar fight in 2023.
The ACLU of Missouri filed a lawsuit Wednesday in Cole County with two objectives: Keep the proposal designated as Amendment 3 off of the November 2026 ballot or, failing that, completely reword the ballot language crafted by lawmakers. The job of defending the proposal and the way it is written will fall to Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, who is the lead defendant.
In 2023, the ACLU of Missouri also challenged ballot language, written by then-Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft, but with the intent of getting a citizen initiative on the ballot.
“It certainly feels a lot like deja vu to go back into Cole County and argue again over a misleading and inaccurate ballot summary statement from a Missouri politician,” ACLU attorney Tori Schafer said in an interview with The Independent.
One of the main proponents of the legislative measure, Sam Lee of Campaign Life Missouri, said the lawsuit was expected. He said he doesn’t think the measure will be thrown off the ballot and said the ballot language is defensible and should stand.
“You get a dozen lawyers in a room, and they’ll write it 12 different ways,” Lee said. “And as long as it’s fair and impartial, there are a variety of ways of doing it.”
When the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, it triggered a Missouri law banning abortions in almost all instances. That led to an initiative campaign, which resulted in a 52% majority approving a constitutional amendment that made abortion legal up until the point of fetal viability.
But except for a short period, abortions have remained unavailable because the question of which of Missouri’s abortion regulations remain in force is tied up in court. Prior to the total ban, for example, Missouri required a 72-hour waiting period between an initial appointment and an abortion, that a woman seeking an abortion be given a lengthy document about fetal development and that all abortions take place in specially licensed ambulatory surgical centers.
The lawsuit over those issues is being heard in Jackson County Circuit Court, where Judge Jerri Zhang could issue a decision at any time on a request for an injunction against the laws.
The proposal passed by lawmakers would repeal the voter-approved initiative in its entirety and replace it with language that would allow the ban to be reinstated. It would carve out limited exceptions, allowing abortions in cases of rape, incest, fetal anomaly or medical emergencies during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.
The proposal would also ban gender transition surgeries or medications for people under 18, and require all lawsuits that raise questions about state laws on reproductive health care be filed in Cole County.
The ballot language written by lawmakers, and being challenged in the lawsuit, would state:
“Shall the Missouri Constitution be amended to:

Guarantee access to care for medical emergencies, ectopic pregnancies, and miscarriages;
Ensure women’s safety during abortions;
Ensure parental consent for minors;
Allow abortions for medical emergencies, fetal anomalies, rape, and incest;
Require physicians to provide medically accurate information; and
Protect children from gender transition?”

In the lawsuit, the ACLU is arguing that the ballot language is unfair and misleading.
The “summary statement uses language which is intentionally argumentative and likely to create prejudice for the measure,” the petition states.
The most glaring omission is that it does not mention what it is replacing, the lawsuit states. 
“Among other things, the summary statement fails to advise voters that it will repeal a measure they just adopted in the last election cycle,” attorneys wrote.
The language should at least inform voters that there will be no protected right to obtain an abortion, Schafer said.
“The courts back in 2023 made sure we had a fair and accurate ballot summary statement and fair ballot language,” she said. “We know that they’ll do the same this year.”
The gender-affirming treatments language and the provision directing venue of reproductive health care cases to Cole County are impermissible, the lawsuit states. They violate the Constitution’s requirement that constitutional amendments address only one subject.
“We know that the reason that Missouri politicians put that piece about Cole County in there is because they don’t like the fact that we’ve been successful on the (legal challenges to restrictive laws) in Jackson County,” Schafer said. “It was a very politically motivated reason that they put that in.”
Lee said he thinks all the subjects relate to reproductive health care and will survive that part of the challenge.
“It’s a weak argument, because even supporters of what passed in November last year link reproductive health care with transgender care,” he said.
The return to court over ballot language on abortion rights is the latest round of a seemingly endless contest. 
Abortion rights supporters will never give up, Schafer said.
“I feel like what we’re asking for is a very simple thing, which is just get politicians out of health care and let people make their own health care decisions,” she said. “And so that is our stance on that.”
If the legislative measure makes it to the ballot and passes, Lee said, he expects a new initiative to reverse it. Lee has been an anti-abortion activist for decades, including many years as an influential lobbyist.
Asked when he expects the debate to end, Lee said:
“Not in my lifetime. I’m not saying that because of me personally. I’m just saying I don’t expect it to be settled anytime soon.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-07-03 21:41:32+00:00,Mississippi Today,Medicaid cuts could be devastating for the Delta and the rest of rural America,"Shalina Chatlani, Stateline and Kim Krisberg, Stateline",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/07/03/medicaid-cuts-mississippi-lousiana/,"""There's nowhere to go"": An inside look at how already struggling communities in Mississippi and Louisiana could be affected by the Medicaid cuts in the new federal tax and spending bill.","Note: This story first published in Stateline, which is part of States Newsroom, the nation’s largest state-focused nonprofit news organization.
LAKE PROVIDENCE, La. — East Carroll Parish sits in the northeastern corner of Louisiana, along the winding Mississippi River. Its seat, Lake Providence, was a thriving agricultural center of the Delta. Now, the town is a shell of its former self. Charred and dilapidated buildings dot the small city center. There are a few gas stations, a handful of restaurants — and little to no industry.
Mayor Bobby Amacker, 79, says at one point “you couldn’t even walk down the street” in Lake Providence’s main business district because “there were so many people.”
“It’s gone down tremendously in the last 50 years,” said Amacker, a Democrat. “The town, it looks like it’s drying up. And it’s almost unstoppable, as far as I can tell.”
Now, East Carroll residents stand to lose even more. Like many people in Louisiana, they received a lifeline when the state expanded Medicaid to more low-income adults in 2016. Expansion drove Louisiana’s uninsured rate to the lowest in the Deep South, at 8% in 2023 for working-age adults, according to state data, despite it having the highest poverty rate in the U.S. that year.
This week, both chambers of Congress approved President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful” tax and spending bill. It includes more than $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, the joint state-federal health insurance program for poor families and individuals, to help pay for tax cuts that mostly benefit the rich. The legislation would cause 11.8 million more Americans to become uninsured by 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
The bill includes new work rules for Medicaid recipients and would require them to verify their eligibility more frequently. It also would limit a financing strategy that states have used to boost Medicaid payments to hospitals.
Republicans say enrollees are taking advantage of the Medicaid program and getting benefits when they shouldn’t be. They say the program costs too much and states are not paying their fair share.
The Delta region, which includes communities in both Louisiana and Mississippi, would suffer under such large cuts. But in Louisiana — where almost half of the state depended on Medicaid in 2023, the Louisiana Department of Health reported — the cuts could be ruinous. Louisiana could lose up to $35 billion in federal Medicaid support over the next decade, according to KFF, a health policy research group. Mississippi, which never expanded Medicaid, could still lose up to $5 billion.
Residents are watching with apprehension, fear and, sometimes, anger, wondering how Congress could be so blind to how much they are struggling.
“If they take that away from us and everyone that really needs it, that’s going to be bad,” said Sherila Ervin, who lives 20 minutes up the road from Lake Providence in Oak Grove and has Medicaid coverage.
Medicaid work requirements and other health care provisions in the bill ignore the reality of living in poorer rural communities, where people struggle to find the jobs, transportation and internet access required to meet the rules, according to interviews with people and providers in the Delta region.
Even though Louisiana and Mississippi have taken very different approaches to Medicaid — one expanded eligibility under the 2010 Affordable Care Act and the other didn’t — both rely heavily on the program to sustain access to medical care for all their residents.
On a hot summer day in June, Ervin walks into the bare-bones 99-cent store in downtown Lake Providence. As she looks over some clothing, she says she’s heard about the potential Medicaid cuts. But she hadn’t heard about the work requirements, and is shocked they’re even on the table.
“I don’t like that. I don’t think they should put a stipulation on that,” Ervin says, exasperated that she would have to report her work hours. It’s hard enough as it is, she says, to thrive in this community.

Ervin, 58, has been working at Oak Grove High School in the cafeteria, serving hot plates to children for two decades. She says it’s one of the good, steady jobs available in this area, but her income is only around $1,500 per month.
Ervin’s job offers health benefits, but she can’t afford the premiums on her salary. She relies on Medicaid for care, including medications for her high blood pressure.
In East Carroll Parish, around 46.5% of people live below the poverty level, meaning the area is overwhelmingly poor, at over four times the national poverty rate, with a median income of $28,321. For Black households, the figure is a mere $16,690.
Expansion was a lifeline for people such as Ervin. Louisiana offers Medicaid to people who earn below 138% of the federal poverty line — currently about $22,000 a year for an individual.
“Sometimes you can work, but then when you work, you still can’t pay to get help,” Ervin said.
It’s a similar economic situation an hour away across the river. Poverty is about three times the national rate in Washington County, Mississippi, where residents in the city of Greenville lament the consequences of not being able to avoid destructive medical debt, which can keep them stuck in a cycle of gig work and of living paycheck to paycheck.
Greenville, the county seat, is among the fastest-shrinking cities in the U.S. It’s still one of the larger rural cities in Mississippi, with coffee shops, restaurants, hotels, a regional hospital and several big-box stores. But the downtown has just a few small businesses and a bank, and residents say jobs are hard to find.
Greenville resident April McNair, 45, remembers giving birth 17 years ago, long before Mississippi extended postpartum Medicaid to a full year. She had Medicaid coverage during pregnancy, but was kicked off shortly after giving birth, despite having post-delivery complications.

The result was a trip to the emergency room and a $2,500 bill she couldn’t cover. Right after giving birth, McNair looked for work. She said potential employers often told her that she was overqualified because she had a master’s degree.
“I had to kind of figure out how to make my ends meet,” McNair said. “I ended up with a significant bill, all because I did not have Medicaid.”
McNair feels like Mississippi leaders are making a mistake by continuing to reject full Medicaid expansion.
“That’s a selfish move. To me, they’re selfish,” McNair said, adding that now she’s worried for neighbors in Louisiana who may lose the lifeline she wishes she had.
“God forbid, hypothetically speaking, what if one of them meets their demise because of this bill that [Congress] passed?”
Hard to thrive
Mississippi experienced its first taste of equalized access to medicine in the late 1960s.
Delta Health Center, the first federally funded health center in the nation, opened during the peak of the Civil Rights Movement in the all-Black town of Mound Bayou, about an hour north of Greenville. The center vowed to care for anyone regardless of race or ability to pay in a region plagued with poverty, poor health and discrimination — and continues to do so to this day.
It was a significant opportunity for generations of African Americans who had gone without health care, in a place where people had no access to clean drinking water, running sewage systems or even food, said Robin Boyles, chief program planning and development officer at Delta Health Center.
But it wasn’t easy for the clinic to mobilize support, even though it was clearly needed. Before its opening, it faced pushback from politicians and even doctors. In a 1966 clipping from a local newspaper, the white-owned Bolivar Commercial, the editorial board railed against the new clinic, saying it would “lead further to socialized medicine.”
The situation is certainly better in Mississippi and Louisiana than it was in the 1960s, but critics say the Medicaid cuts could reverse hard-fought progress.
People who live in the Delta are fiercely proud of their communities, but conditions there make it hard to thrive.
Black residents, who are the overwhelming majority, have had a particularly hard time. After the Civil War, many were relegated to sharecropping of cotton and corn for subsistence. Meanwhile, an elite white class of plantation owners and investors amassed enormous amounts of wealth.
A 2001 report from the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights described the area as one with “limited economic resources; inadequate employment opportunities; insufficient decent, affordable housing; and poor quality public schools.”
“We have a lot of patients that are one health issue away from either being out of a job or being bankrupt because of a trip to the emergency room,” said Dr. Brent Smith, a physician at a primary care clinic at Delta Health System in Greenville.
Even some of the most vulnerable people, such as new moms in Mississippi, still struggle to get basic care, in part because the state has left billions of dollars in federal funding for Medicaid expansion on the table, said Dr. Lakeisha Richardson, an OB-GYN at Delta Health System.
“There are a lot of maternal [care] deserts in Mississippi where women have to travel 60 miles or more just to get prenatal care and just to get to the closest hospital for delivery,” Richardson said. “And I don’t see that getting any better in Mississippi and in rural areas.”
Richardson says nearly all her patients are working moms, many of whom would really benefit from having Medicaid expansion.
“America doesn’t realize that there are people out here struggling for no reason of their own,” she said.
That’s why Medicaid expansion in Louisiana in 2016, much like the community health center movement in Mississippi, was a bright spot in the rural South, said Smith.
“Louisiana expanded Medicaid, a surprising move in the South to see any state expand,” Smith said. “They saw it for what it was, which was a very real opportunity to assist this specific group of patients.”

In Mississippi, 20 rural hospitals are at immediate risk of closure, according to a recent report, more than double the number at risk in Louisiana. In many cases, Medicaid is the largest and most reliable payer for rural hospitals. While Louisiana’s overall uninsured rate plummeted to 8.3% by 2023, in Mississippi it was 10.5%.
“Unlike a lot of our Southern peers, we have not had the same level of closures of facilities,” said Courtney Foster, senior policy adviser for Medicaid, with the nonprofit Invest in Louisiana.
“Medicaid was like a real lifeline for people in transition. Oftentimes it was people who had lost their jobs and were just looking to get back on their feet.”
Now, the new work and reporting requirements could put that progress at risk.
In East Carroll Parish, finding a job — let alone a good-paying one with health benefits — is difficult, says Rosie Brown, executive director at the East Carroll Community Action Agency, a nonprofit that helps low-income people with their rent and utility bills. Many of the jobs available in town pay minimum wage, just $7.25 an hour.
Brown loves living in Lake Providence; this is where her family is. She doesn’t want to move but wishes the government would invest more in her community — not take away benefits that help people who are hanging on by a thread.
“We have one bank. We have one supermarket,” she said. “Transportation isn’t easy either.”
Local infrastructure is so limited, she’s even heard of some people charging residents $20 for a ride to Walmart. Some people have to hitch a ride an hour away to go to work, she said.
“There’s nowhere to go,” Brown said.
Dominique Jones works at the local library, where she helps roughly 75 to 85 people per month apply for programs such as Medicaid and food assistance. Many of the residents she helps don’t have access to the internet or even a computer, a real barrier for people who’d be required to report their working hours to state Medicaid officials.
“This town right here is made up of a lot of old people that need Medicaid and Medicare. And without it, they wouldn’t have any kind of health care at all,” Mayor Amacker said.
Even a job in local government in Lake Providence doesn’t offer affordable health insurance.
Nevada Qualls, 25, sits across from Amacker’s office. She earns just $12 an hour as a cashier at city hall. The low pay means she qualifies for Medicaid expansion coverage, which is good because she can’t afford the premiums for private insurance.
“I feel like there should be a higher threshold for people that can get Medicaid, because they’re still struggling,” she said.
At the 99-cent store, school district worker Ervin wonders whether state and federal leaders understand what it’s like to live in her community, urging them to visit and see for themselves.
“They want to do stuff for the rich people that’s already rich,” she said. “What are they doing? It’s almost like there’s no common sense with them.”
‘The tremble factors’
While leaders in the U.S. Senate were working into the night this past weekend debating Trump’s tax and spending bill, Greenville resident Jennifer Morris was praying for the pain to stay away.
Morris, 44, has hemicrania continua, a headache disorder that causes constant pain on one side of her head. There’s no underlying trigger and no cure. Her doctors help her keep the pain to a minimum with regular treatments that include dozens of injections into her head.
“It doesn’t take the pain away,” she said during a late-night gathering in Greenville’s Greater Mount Olivet Missionary Baptist Church in June. “It does reduce the pain so that I’m able to function. But it’s rough.”
Morris is worried about the looming Medicaid cuts. She qualifies for Mississippi Medicaid because her condition counts as a disability, and she depends on the coverage to afford her medications.
Morris’ Medicaid may be safer than that of her Delta neighbors in Lake Providence, as some of the most dramatic Medicaid changes being considered — such as work requirements — target Medicaid expansion states only.
But Mississippi could be hurt by a provision in the Senate bill that would target a strategy states have used to boost the Medicaid dollars they get from the federal government.
Mississippi could see a major hit to its Medicaid funds, which “would be a tremendous decrease in revenue for the state,” harming “services and access to care,” says Mitchell Adcock, executive director at the Center for Mississippi Health Policy.
“It would be just the opposite of expansion. It would be a contraction for the Medicaid program in the state,” he said.
Leonard Favorite, a pastor who was attending the same event at Mount Olivet Church, as Morris, says he grew up on a plantation in Louisiana and worked his way out of poverty by joining the Air Force. This type of journey is hard, he said, when you’re already starting from so far behind. He thinks the “big, beautiful bill” will create more roadblocks for poor people.

“You have people who are already living below the poverty line and they will certainly be submerged into poverty at unspeakable levels,” said Favorite, 70.“ That seems to be the trend of this administration from the point of view of looking from the outside.
“Poor people are beginning to feel the tremble factors of an administration that caters toward the rich.”
National researchers estimate that up to 132,000 Louisianans who gained health insurance under expansion could lose it under work rules.
But national reports that rely on census data likely underestimate the potential Medicaid losses. For example, while 2023 census data show 47% of East Carroll Parish was on Medicaid, state health data reviewed by Stateline and Public Health Watch suggests the number is more like 64%. Similarly statewide, census data showed about a third of Louisianans were on Medicaid. State data shows that percentage is closer to 46.5%.
Experts such as Joan Alker at the Georgetown Center for Children and Families say the undercounts nationally are a well-known issue among researchers, but it’s difficult to correct because the quality of state reporting can be so uneven.
State Medicaid funding is also at risk. For years, both Mississippi and Louisiana have relied on revenue generated through a financing tool — known as a provider tax — to draw down more federal dollars and boost Medicaid reimbursements to providers. But congressional Republicans hope to limit states’ ability to collect those taxes.
Depending on how Congress restricts provider taxes, Mississippi could lose hundreds of millions in federal Medicaid funding, crucial in a state with such a high uninsured rate, said Richard Roberson, president and CEO of the Mississippi Hospital Association.
“It’s unavoidable that when you’re taking that much money out of the system, that there’s not going to be some repercussions felt even in non-Medicaid expansion states like Mississippi,” Roberson said.
Last week, the Louisiana Hospital Association signed a statement calling the package of Medicaid cuts before Congress “historic in their devastation.”

“The airport, at a minimum, has a responsibility to let the public know what’s happening inside these walls, and on the tarmac,” Julie Macuga of Burlington said at the city’s airport commision meeting Wednesday.

A loose group of advocates is urging the panel that oversees operations at Patrick Leahy Burlington International Airport to issue a statement describing — and, some said, condemning — how federal immigration agents have repeatedly used Vermont’s largest air hub to transport people detained in the state and possibly facing deportation to other parts of the country.
Speaking at the Burlington Airport Commission’s monthly meeting Wednesday evening, two advocates also presented data they said showed federal immigration agents are flying far more people out of the airport, which is run by the City of Burlington, than is widely known.
Leif Taranta of Burlington and Brian Clifford of Essex said their findings, which they’ve compiled into a public chart online, suggest at least 450 people detained by federal law enforcement in immigration cases have been transferred through the Burlington airport since the start of January. That includes transfers by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.
VTDigger has not independently verified Taranta and Clifford’s work, though a representative from the Vermont Asylum Assistance Project, which is one of the state’s few networks offering pro bono legal aid to non-U.S. citizens, endorsed the advocates’ effort at Wednesday’s meeting.
“The airport, at a minimum, has a responsibility to let the public know what’s happening inside these walls, and on the tarmac,” Julie Macuga of Burlington, another advocate who spoke at the meeting, told the airport commissioners.
The panel did not develop a statement at its meeting, though the body’s chair, Tim George, said in an interview afterward that he and the other commissioners would continue to discuss the request, including what, specifically, his counterparts would be willing to say.
“I think we’ll have some conversations about that and see how we want to proceed,” he said.

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger
Wednesday’s meeting comes as Vermont officials’ interactions with immigration authorities have drawn increased scrutiny following the high-profile arrests of Columbia University student and Palestinian rights activist Mohsen Mahdawi and Tufts University student Rümeysa Öztürk. Both students were in the country legally but have been targeted by President Donald Trump’s administration for deportation. Mahdawi is a Vermont resident, while Öztürk’s detention was challenged in federal court in Vermont.
Federal officials have shuffled detainees from other states into and out of Vermont, and used commercial flights out of the airport, which is in South Burlington, to facilitate deportations, VTDigger has reported. Those jailed in Vermont’s prisons include people with established lives in the state, like farmworkers. Vermont’s prisons have also held people from other New England states, including Kseniia Petrova, a Russian scientist working at Harvard University.
Öztürk was shuttled from Massachusetts, where she was arrested, to an ICE field office in St. Albans before being flown out of the Burlington airport early the following morning to Louisiana. She spent weeks in detention there before a judge in Vermont ordered her release. Meanwhile, agents attempted to fly Mahdawi out of the airport to Louisiana, as well, after he was arrested while attending a U.S. citizenship interview in Colchester, the student’s lawyers have said.
That a public body as minor as the airport commission — which is only advisory by design and consists of residents from Burlington, South Burlington and Winooski — was facing questions about the actions of federal immigration agents is evidence of just how focused public scrutiny of immigration enforcement in the state has become.

One commissioner, Helen Riehle, a former longtime state legislator from South Burlington, called the use of the airport for transporting ICE detainees “abhorrent.” 
Still, it’s not clear there is much — if anything — the commission, or the staff who run the day-to-day operations at the airport, could do to impact how the federal government chooses to use the facility to transport detainees, said Nic Longo, the airport’s director. He said the airport administration generally is not privy to information about immigration operations there.
“We don’t know when these are happening,” he said, referring to when people are transferred through the airport by federal immigration agents. “We don’t get advised. We don’t get any communication.”
He added, too, that the airport could risk losing access to federal grants and other funding assurances by impeding or refusing to comply with immigration enforcement — a point U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy made publicly earlier this year. (That threat has since been temporarily blocked by a federal judge after a coalition of 20 states, including Vermont, sued to challenge its legality.)

There were several instances, Longo noted, in which ICE agents were parking their vehicles in areas where parking wasn’t allowed. The airport pushed back — in some cases, nearly towing the vehicles — and got the agents to park in spaces generally available to the public. The airport’s goal, he said, is to treat the agents as if they are any other law enforcement officials, or members of the public.
ICE did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday about its operations at the airport. 
Taranta, one of the activists, said the group collected data on those operations using U.S. Department of Justice press releases, the PACER system that tracks federal court cases, and a Vermont Department of Corrections website that provides access to a jail tracking system where people can find friends and family members in the state’s prisons. They also verified the data through news articles and direct observations at prisons and the Burlington airport, they said. 
The activists said the data they collected shows as many as 500 immigration detainees have likely been moved through Vermont between Jan. 1 and July 1. About 460 were highly likely to have been transferred through the Burlington airport, the citizen researchers believe, with many of them booked on early morning flights. 
“That’s a shocking number if true,” said Brett Stokes, an attorney at the Center for Justice Reform at the Vermont Law and Graduate School, in an interview Wednesday. Stokes said he would be inclined to trust it unless proven otherwise, but he doesn’t believe it’s a statistic the federal government is required to track.
Activists shared that they were concerned people are being moved through the state without access to legal representation. 
A major concern expressed by those who spoke at the commission meeting was that people flown out of the airport — who were often unshackled, in plain clothes and accompanied by U.S. Marshals — did not have an opportunity to meet with an attorney before facing deportation proceedings outside of the state. The early hours of transport, which the activists have said their findings repeatedly show, also make it difficult for attorneys to connect with clients, they said.
“It’s become clear to us that the airport plays a large role in the region’s ICE operations and most people don’t know about this, including the airport commissions,” Taranta said in an interview. “I hope they’ll take some actions against it.”

(Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)The number of Arkansas students participating in one of three summer nutrition programs offered in the state has already eclipsed last year’s count, officials said Thursday at a food distribution event in Sherwood.
The newest program, Summer Electronic Benefits Transfer for Children, or Summer EBT, was created through the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 and modeled on a similar initiative created during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Each child enrolled in the Summer EBT program receives a debit card loaded with $120 for purchasing fresh meat, fruit and vegetables, dairy products, breads, snacks and non-alcoholic drinks. 
Arkansas, which has one of the nation’s worst rates of food insecurity, opted into the program last year even as many other Republican-led states did not — a trend that has continued in the second year of the program with 13 states choosing not to participate. Oklahoma has opted out of the program for the second straight year, but some tribal nations within the state are participating.
New report ranks Arkansas’ food insecurity rate worst in the U.S.

This year, 325,000 students have been enrolled into Arkansas’ Summer EBT program so far, said Mary Franklin, director of the Arkansas Department of Human Services’ (DHS) Division of County Operations. DHS spokesperson Gavin Lesnick said the program, which “makes a lot of sense” for Arkansas, served 293,000 students in 2024. 
The department is accepting applications until Aug. 25.
Of the 325,000 current participants, the vast majority were automatically enrolled in the program because they met certain criteria, such as Medicaid or Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) enrollment or receiving free or reduced meals at their school. Only 7,000 participants were not automatically enrolled this year, Lesnick said.
“A lot of those children just automatically don’t have to do anything,” Lesnick said, “but if you aren’t in one of those buckets, you have to fill out an application.”
The one exception, he said, is for those at schools that automatically give all students free or reduced lunch. Those students still have to apply to receive the Summer EBT benefit. Lesnick and Franklin both emphasized that people should apply for the program even if they are unsure if they qualify.
“We’re thrilled [the Summer EBT program] is going well,” Lesnick said.
Patty Barker, the campaign director for No Kid Hungry Arkansas, which is part of the Arkansas Hunger Relief Alliance, said the rollout of the Summer EBT program has gone much smoother in its second year. State officials highlighted how benefits for students who were enrolled in the program last year were loaded onto the cards they were given last summer instead of new ones. 
Barker said an enhanced focus on messaging, making sure parents and students knew about the program, and an earlier start date, have made the summer nutrition program more successful this year. The alliance worked with the state to get the word out, Barker said.
“The federal program was new last summer, and just the process, it didn’t get started until midsummer,” Barker said. “So this year we were ahead of the game and able to start announcing that the program was going to be offered in the spring before kids go home from school; getting schools on board to be able to make all the families aware. So that was a huge bonus.”
The Summer EBT program is administered by DHS with help from the state Department of Education. Education Secretary Jacob Oliva said in an interview that his department coordinates with DHS to help it determine which students should be automatically enrolled in the program.
“We work with [DHS] to help find students and families that qualify, work with school districts that are willing to support…the program. We have a Food and Nutrition Division that helps share the word, communicate, collaborate with a lot of people who may not know that they’re eligible for extra support through the summer,” Oliva said.
Oliva, Franklin and Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders all emphasized the importance of addressing child hunger before assisting with a drive-up meal distribution outside Cato Elementary Thursday morning. Sanders specifically touted what she described as bipartisan efforts to provide free breakfast to every student in Arkansas regardless of their means, which she named as one of her biggest legislative priorities for the 2025 session.
“It’s one of the biggest challenges we have in our state,” Sanders said of the state’s food insecurity issue, “but it’s something that we are not going to ignore and refuse to take on and tackle. I know that we can move Arkansas from being at the bottom of this list by utilizing programs like this.”
The state offers other nutrition programs to feed students during the summer months. The two other initiatives, both offered through the U.S. Department of Agriculture and administered by the state education department, are the Seamless Summer Option (SSO) and the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP). The meal distribution that Sanders and other officials participated in were part of the SFSP, which provides meals and snacks to students at approved sites such as schools. 
Franklin said that the programs were not either-or — students could participate in more than one at the same time.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_3868-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-03 18:07:35.127822

John Perkins.","Karah Spencer Perkins Potter died from the kind of pervasive gun violence her family has spent decades working to curb in Jackson.
At her funeral service Wednesday, family members, friends and others talked about the 23-year-old’s spirit, smile and servant’s heart — reminiscent of her grandfather, renowned civil rights and evangelical leader, the Rev. John Perkins, who advocated for development and racial reconciliation in west Jackson.  
While working at a summer camp run by her family’s nonprofit, the John and Vera Mae Perkins Foundation, Potter helped local kids, taking them for a haircut or out to eat. With her friends, she’d dream up ways to build back Jackson’s forgotten communities.
“She was right on the edge of everything opening up, and she was walking forward with flair,” Liz Perkins, Potter’s aunt, said during the service at New Horizon Church International. “She had a way of making people feel safe just by being with her.” 
But her family believes Potter’s desire to help and protect others may have led to her death in the early morning hours of June 22, 2025.
Potter and some friends had just come from a club when they stopped at a gas station on Northside Drive off I-55 at about 4:40 a.m. There, Potter’s friend and the friend’s boyfriend, Phillip Bullock, got into an argument, and Potter intervened.

An off-duty officer who witnessed the incident said he saw Potter and Bullock arguing with guns in their hands, and Potter fired her gun into the air, according to a redacted report from Capitol Police, the responding agency. The officer also saw Bullock shoot Potter, who fell to the ground, the report said.
After firing, Bullock drove away, and the off-duty officer shot at Bullock, according to the report. 
Officers did not find a weapon at the scene, according to the report. Capitol Police called Potter’s family soon after, and Perkins said they told her the gas station’s video showed Potter was tussling with Bullock when he grabbed her hand, pushed it down, pulled out his gun and shot her in the head. 
The officer also told Perkins that they were still looking for the gun Potter supposedly had. “If she shot the gun, where is the gun?” she asked.
But Bullock has not been charged with Potter’s killing. While the Capitol Police incident report listed his initial charge as aggravated assault, Bullock was charged with possession of a gun as a convicted felon, according to Hinds County Court records. A call to Bullock’s court-appointed public defender was not returned.
In 2017, he had pleaded guilty to aggravated assault against his sister-in-law in Holmes County as well as home invasion. The judge gave him seven years in prison.
Potter’s family is outraged.
“He got out Tuesday, the day after she was declared dead,” said Potter’s mother, Joanie. “He should be charged with murder.”
Perkins said Bullock, who lives just two doors down from the family in west Jackson, is now claiming self-defense, but her understanding is that Potter was trying to get her friend away from him. 
“We ain’t saying she was perfect,” Perkins said, “but Karah was a human being who didn’t need to be shot down like a dog.”
Potter’s parents say she was a charismatic young adult who was trying to figure out her future. After moving to Starkville to attend Mississippi State University, Potter decided not to enroll and moved back home to live with her parents while managing a soap store and studying for the real estate exam. 
“That was going to change her trajectory,” her mother said.
Potter had also recently started bartending at Babes, a local club. In the past month or so, Potter’s mother discovered a gun in her daughter’s drawer and questioned her, but Potter insisted she needed the gun for protection and that everyone at the club had one.
Her mother argued against it. “What about a man overpowering you and killing you with your gun?” her mother quoted herself as asking Potter.
At the service Wednesday, clergymen passed out tissues as gatherers watched videos of Potter laughing, blowing out birthday cake candles, playing with puppies and kittens, visiting Washington, D.C., and riding a horse.

When Potter’s father Ron Potter and his wife got the call from the Capitol Police, Ron said they feared that Potter had been in a car accident. The detective said no, Ron said, she was shot in the head. 
“I was faced with a critical question that I’ve wrestled with for years now,” he said. “That question takes on real flesh, and the question is, does the Christian faith have anything meaningful to say to the lived realities of injustice, terminal illness, sickness, death?” 
In search of answers, Ron said he was forced to take a look at what he called “signals of transcendence” that Potter possessed, or the ways in which God revealed himself through Potter, such as her appreciation for beauty, her desire to form relationships with others and her empathy. 
Those qualities were reflected in many of the other testimonies to Potter’s life. Several of her cousins spoke, and they all said she was like a sister to them. 
One cousin, Shelby Perkins, shared 23 memories for each year of Potter’s life: Her dimples, visiting Jamaica, dinner at the Mighty Crab, shucking peas in their grandma’s kitchen, riding home from the reservoir in the back of their uncle’s truck, holding each other tight as they walked up creaky stairs in their family home, and how the kids at the summer camp adored “Miss KK.” 
“I thank God for handpicking us to be cousins,” she said. 
Potter’s older sister Varah shared that the family adopted Potter, who was just 18 days old, because Varah wanted a little sister. Varah, who is seven years older, said the two did not always get along, though they’d grown closer in recent years. 
“We were like oil and water,” Varah said.

Then Varah read a poem inspired by the flowers that Potter loved. 
Potter’s hairstylist said she wanted to tell Potter’s mother that “she was a good soul and you raised her right.” Another friend said that the day Potter died, she had just left the doctor’s office and was planning to tell Potter that she was pregnant. 
“Now she knows, of course she knows, she’s everywhere now,” she said. 
To honor Potter, the Perkins family has set up the Sunshine Scholarship Fund at the Perkins Foundation to aid young people heading to college. Potter’s parents also say they also plan to work to dissuade young people from owning guns. 
Potter grew up in a family dedicated to community service. The Perkins Foundation, founded in 1983, focuses on “transforming lives, equipping leaders and restoring hope in communities.”
Catherine Cook, who went to high school with Potter at Saint Joseph Catholic School in Madison, said Potter wanted to follow in those footsteps, but the world can be a cruel place for people like Potter who have a big heart. 
“Still, she had a dream that life could be better,” she said. “We would drive around Jackson and point at a building and say this is the business that I want to put in this building or this is how I want to build up the community and I just, I would hate to see her dream never come true.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/03160124/IMG_4314.jpg,,,2025-07-03 18:07:35.127822

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)Utah Republican leaders celebrated the final passage of the “big, beautiful bill” on Thursday, one day before the self-imposed Fourth of July deadline to bring it to President Donald Trump’s desk for his signature.
All members of the Utah congressional delegation voted in favor of the massive tax and spending bill that supports theTrump administration’s priorities. The bill was ultimately only opposed by two Republicans in the House and three in the Senate.
US House passes massive tax break and spending cut bill, sending it to Trump

Shortly after the House vote, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox thanked the delegation for helping the bill get across the finish line in a social media post.
“Today’s passage of the budget bill is a win for Utah families: it delivers meaningful tax relief, invests in energy abundance,” Cox wrote. “And, thanks to bipartisan teamwork, preserves every state’s freedom to craft commonsense AI safeguards.”
The package passed in a tight 218-214 House vote after undergoing changes in the Senate earlier this week. 
The lengthy bill includes spending plans for border security, defense, energy production, health care and higher education. 
It has, however, been heavily criticized for slashing Medicaid spending, effectively leaving millions of Americans without health care coverage.
Utah Democrats were dismayed at what they describe as “devastating” consequences for Utahns who rely on Medicaid, while funding “fiscally irresponsible tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans.”
“(Utah’s) Medicaid budget totals $5.5 billion through a combination of federal and state funding. Under this bill, nearly $1 billion, or approximately 20% of that funding, will be slashed,” Utah House Democrats said in a statement. “The consequences are undeniable: sick, low-income, and at-risk Utahns will lose access to critical healthcare. Programs will be gutted. The quality and availability of services will decline. And rural hospitals, who cover more than just Medicaid patients, will close.”
Utah Democratic Party Chair Brian King called the package “a betrayal of working people” because of its health care and food assistance cuts, among other concerns.

“Utah’s entire Congressional delegation voted yes. Every single one of them chose political survival over public service, cowering to pressure from party leaders, special interests, and the president’s threats,” King said in a statement.
However, Utah Republican Rep. Mike Kennedy, who is also a family doctor, defended the Medicaid provisions included in the bill. He said that as a health care provider, he recognizes how essential the program is, but he argued the government needs to “right-size” it.
“If we don’t take a different trajectory, these programs will collapse under the economic failures of prior administrations,” Kennedy said on the House floor. 
Rooting out fraud, waste and abuse would help preserve Medicaid, Kennedy said in a social media post.
“The One Big Beautiful Bill proves we don’t have to choose. We can protect those in need and stop the waste,” he said.
RECA expansion 
Buried at the end of the bill’s many provisions is an expansion to the Radiation Compensation Exposure Act, or RECA, which compensates people sickened by nuclear weapons development and testing.
That was one of the wins Utah Republican Rep. Celeste Maloy celebrated Thursday.
“While no bill is perfect, the One Big, Beautiful Bill reflects the promises made and kept by President Trump and House Republicans,” Maloy said in a statement.
Called downwinders, people who got cancer or other diseases from above-ground nuclear tests were eligible for federal payments — but not everyone in Utah was covered, despite evidence showing nuclear fallout blanketed the state in the 1950s and 1960s.
All of Utah’s downwinders could be compensated under Senate’s ‘big, beautiful bill’

Now, under provisions included in the “big, beautiful bill,” anyone who lived in Utah and got sick from the tests will be eligible for compensation. The news was met with mixed reactions from advocates who generally opposed the “big beautiful bill,” but were happy to see RECA expanded.
“A bright spot in this otherwise terrible reconciliation bill is that it finally allows some of the people harmed by nuclear weapons testing and production to access a federal program from which they were unfairly excluded,” said Dr. Gretchen Goldman, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists. “That truly is a win for thousands of people across the country, including the people harmed by the first atomic bomb test in New Mexico.”
Mary Dickson, a Utah downwinder, said it was “bittersweet.” She’ll now be eligible for coverage, but told Utah News Dispatch she was disappointed that downwinders in Guam, Montana and parts of Nevada and Arizona were left out.
“Obviously I’m happy to see more downwinders covered. I’m very happy to see that. But I’m also heartsick to see that so many others that we’ve been fighting with in this battle for so long are left out,” she said. “It feels a bit like a hollow victory to me.” 
Environmental concerns
Environmental groups were quick to decry the bill’s passage on Thursday, criticizing the many provisions that phase out tax credits for renewable energy, require increased oil and gas lease sales, and cut royalties that oil producers were required to pay.
“If Republicans cared about clean air and water, wildlife, or a livable planet for current and future generations, this bill would be dead in the water. But their priorities are clear,” said Travis Hammill, Washington D.C. director for the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance.
He noted that Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee’s proposal to require the sale of millions of acres of public lands was stripped out of the bill earlier this month after it received “widespread, bipartisan backlash.” 
Mike Lee drops national forests from proposed public land sale, makes several other changes

“While we’re glad to see schemes to sell off public lands stripped from the Budget Bill, we are clear-eyed about the impacts of the rest of the bill: gutting tax credits for clean energy, attacking the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and creating new handouts to extractive industries – all of which will devastate wild public lands for decades to come,”  Hammill said.
Jennifer Rokala, executive director for the public land advocacy group the Center for Western Priorities, called the bill a “handout to billionaires at the expense of working people.”
“It gives a multi-billion dollar tax cut to the oil and gas industry, which is already raking in sky-high profits, and adds billions to the federal debt,” Rokala said. ““This bill cuts the public out of public land management, making oil and gas drilling the dominant use of public land and removing avenues for public participation from the leasing process. The vast majority of Westerners want to see public lands managed for clean air and water, as well as wildlife habitat conservation and increased recreation access. This bill does the opposite.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-03 21:12:37+00:00,CT Mirror,Hartford school board member to challenge Larson,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/03/john-larson-challenger-ruth-fortune/,"Ruth Fortune, a mayoral appointee on the Hartford Board of Education, will be the first Democrat to challenge Larson’s U.S. House seat.","Ruth Fortune, a 37-year-old mayoral appointee on the Hartford Board of Education who came to the U.S. from Haiti as a young undocumented immigrant, filed papers Wednesday declaring her intention to challenge U.S. Rep. John B. Larson for the Democratic nomination in 2026.
The first tentative steps by towards beginning a race — Fortune created a campaign committee with no public announcement or sign of private outreach to political players — might have gone unnoticed in other years, but Democrats are hypersensitive this cycle about potential intra-party challenges.
An immediate question Thursday from some Democrats, none of whom was willing to be quoted out of deference to Larson: Will the filing break the ice and prompt others to take a look at running against a long-serving incumbent who had a “complex partial seizure” during a speech in February and turns 77 this month?
Three of Connecticut’s five U.S. House members are 72 or older, age was a difficult and ultimately disqualifying issue for the octogenarian Joe Biden in 2024, and the Democratic Party is in the midst of an identity crisis after the loss of the White House to Donald J. Trump. 
Larson, a former state Senate leader first elected to Congress in 1998, is raising money for a run in 2026, when Democrats hope to recapture the closely divided House — a realistic goal that seems to be encouraging every member of the delegation to run at least once more.
In a telephone interview, Fortune offered no criticism of Larson and said her motive for running was not in reaction to anything the incumbent has said or done.
“My reasons for running are my reasons for running. I want to bring my voice, my lived experiences, my fierce advocacy, and really try to do as much as I can to support people as they try to aspire to whatever it is that their dream is and their goals are,” she said. “I thank Congressman Larson for his service.”
Fortune’s challenge to Larson came as a surprise to Mayor Arunan Arulampalam, who appointed her to the school board a year ago, and the city’s Democratic chair, Marc DiBella.
“Somebody texted me about it,” Arulampalam said. “I was surprised. It was the first I heard.”
DiBella said by text he did not know Fortune and offered no further comment.
The 1st Congressional District represented by Larson is overwhelmingly Democratic, meaning the only threat to Larson would come in a primary. Larson, who is from East Hartford, has not had a primary since 1998, when the seat was open. He said his plans to run again are unchanged.
“In a democracy, anyone who desires to run is free to do so. I fully intend to announce my candidacy after the municipal elections this year,” Larson said in a texted statement. “I remain proud of the achievements for the 27 towns I represent and work with, especially the people my office has been able to help and serve.”
Fortune has a compelling personal story, but no experience as a candidate for elective office.
Testifying in favor of financial aid for undocumented students before the General Assembly in 2016, when she was a law student in her mid-twenties and about to become a naturalized U.S. citizen, Fortune offered herself as an example of what educational opportunity can mean to a young immigrant.
“My family left Haiti in 2000. We came to the U.S. as tourists and became undocumented immigrants in search of a better future,” Fortune told lawmakers. “When we first arrived, eight of us, including my parents and brother, shared one bedroom in my aunt’s house. But the house had indoor plumbing, running water and even more importantly, access to the U.S. school system.”
They settled in Westbury, N.Y., on Long Island. She said she graduated from Baruch College, which was relatively affordable, and lived in a sublet that cost $350 a month.
Fortune said Thursday that the Obama administration gave Haitians temporary protective status after an earthquake devastated Haiti, multiplying the island’s many miseries.
“I think at that point, to be honest, I realize how much good government can do, how much it is really a force for good, if it is used in that fashion. And shortly after that, I sort of figured, I want to go to law school. I want to understand more how the law works, why it is it can do these things that it does,” she said.
Fortune said she arrived in the U.S. as a tourist with her family. She was 12 and spent her first decade trying to live inconspicuously as she obtained an education.
To lawmakers in 2016, she said, “I made it through college because I was able to pay in-state tuition rate and frankly because I lucked out by getting a good waitressing job during college that allowed me to pay my $4,000 annual in-state tuition out-of-pocket.”
Fortune is a graduate of the University of Connecticut School of Law and an associate at Wiggin & Dana, specializing as a trust and estate lawyer. She is married, the mother of three and lives in the West End of Hartford. In her testimony, she described volunteering for Barack Obama in Iowa in 2012.
“The best training I received as a campaign staffer was on how to effectively tell my story and how to ask for what I want,” she said.
Larson, who has made stabilizing Social Security a personal crusade, said after joining other Democrats in voting against Trump’s bill that extends tax cuts at the expend of social safety net program, his focus remains the same. 
“My focus has been and continues to be protecting and enhancing Social Security,” Larson said. “Right now, we are in a battle with the Trump administration and fighting back against their direct attempts to privatize and cut Social Security as they continue to slash the nations’s number-one nutrition program, SNAP, and kick 17 million people off their health insurance.”
His seizure in February came during a speech in the House, when he froze and lost the ability to speak. A day later, he attributed the episode to a heart valve replacement 15 years ago.
“Sometimes, people with this condition can later develop symptoms such as the momentary change in speech or movement that was apparent yesterday,” Larson said.

A month later, a video of Larson passionately complaining about Elon Musk refusing to answer congressional questions regarding how Social Security factored into the Trump administration’s plans for cutbacks went viral, winning notice and applause from Rachel Maddow on MSNBC.
“Where’s Elon Musk?” Larson thundered at a committee meeting. “I’m sure he’s a genius and is a very credible person because of the wealth he’s accumulated, but that does not put him above the law or the responsibility to come before this committee in this Congress. If he’s so great, if these plans and all the fraud and abuse that he found are so imminent, why isn’t he here explaining it? You know why? Because he’s out to privatize Social Security.”
Maddow approved.
“I’m happy to report that Congressman John Larson is definitely back and at full strength,” Maddow said. “He has been eating his proverbial Wheaties. He appears to be very hydrated, very energized, and, may I suggest, you get out of his way.”
Larson had a second, less dramatic episode in April, briefly pausing in mid-sentence at a Hartford press conference.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Fortune_Ruth_square-scaled.jpg-1024x1024.avif,,,2025-07-03 18:07:35.127822

(Robin Bravender/States Newsroom)Justice Department attorneys told a federal district judge Tuesday that the Trump administration will not impose proposed restrictions on birthright citizenship for a month — but that it reserves the right to “immediately” start planning for that day.
The two-page notice was filed in U.S.District Court in Greenbelt in response to District Judge Deborah Boardman’s demand a day earlier to know “if the government thinks that it can start removing children from the United States who are subject to the terms of the executive order,”
It is the latest twist in a months-long legal battle over an executive order signed by President Donald Trump on Jan. 21, his first day back in office, that sought to deny citizenship to anyone born in the U.S. unless at least one of their parents was a citizen or a permanent legal resident.
Historically, “birthright” citizenship has been granted to anyone born on U.S. soil, regardless of their parent’s status. But Trump claimed in his executive order that that was a misinterpretation of the law, which he claimed was never intended to apply to everyone.
Judge gives administration until Tuesday to put birthright citizenship plans in writing

The order was almost immediately challenged in court by groups that said birthright citizenship is a bedrock of U.S democracy, and that denying citizenship to a child born here could make the child stateless altogether. Judges in three different districts, including Boardman, agreed and issued nationwide injunctions to block the order.
The government appeal focused on whether the district court judges had the authority to impose a nationwide ban on the order. In a 6-3 ruling Friday, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed that the judges should not have extended the injunction beyond those people and groups that brought the suits.
But the high court’s ruling noted that a class-action suit could apply nationally. That’s why the plaintiffs in the Maryland case — CASA, the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project at 15 women who are pregnant or new mothers — were back in court Monday, seeking to get their suit certified as a class action suit for all undocumented parents and their babies.
The Supreme Court sent the cases back to the district court, but also set July 27 as the earliest date the administration can apply the executive order, to allow time for the cases to be reheard. On Monday, Boardman ordered Trump’s attorneys to clarify in writing the government’s view of what it can do under the executive order, and when.
Trump’s attorneys agreed in the filing that the earliest date the administration would apply the order is, in fact, July 27. But the the court’s ruling also provided for a 30-day ramp-up period, the notice said.
“The Court’s stay thus allows Defendants to immediately begin to ‘develop[] and issu[e] public guidance about the Executive’s plans to implement the Executive Order,’” the filing reads.
Boardman also gave Trump’s lawyers until July 7 to file a response to the plaintiffs’ motion to turn the case into a class action lawsuit.

Laura Kelly said Thursday that she and her husband of more than 40 years were granted a divorce.
She decided to speak publicly about the amicable end of her marriage because of inquiries about the status of her relationship with retired physician Ted Daughety.
Kelly, 75, said the pair remained on friendly terms before and after the divorce was finalized in October. They were married in 1983 and have two adult daughters.
“Throughout my time in public office, I’ve always guarded my family’s privacy. It’s been my policy to keep my personal life separate from my public one to the extent possible,” Kelly said.
She said it had “come to my attention that my marital status has become a topic of some speculation, so I will share that Ted and I divorced in October of 2024.”
“It was amicable and mutual, and we both continue to share in the lives of our family,” the governor said.
The Democratic governor’s brief statement was the first official confirmation of a split. The governor resides at the Topeka residence for Kansas governors known as Cedar Crest. Her family home in the Potwin neighborhood of central Topeka has been sold.
In a statement, Daughety said that “Laura and I made this decision together, based on what worked best for us and for our family.”
Kelly was elected to the Kansas Senate to represent a Topeka-area district in 2005 and remained in that job for nearly 15 years. She was elected governor in 2018 and reelected in 2022.
Daughety was a pulmonary and sleep disorder specialist who practiced medicine for decades in Kansas.
Divorce among sitting U.S. governors hasn’t been common, but Democrat John Carlin ended two marriages while serving as governor of Kansas.
Carlin took office in 1979 and received a divorce from Ramona Hawkinson in 1980. Carlin and his second wife, Karen Bigsby Hurley, were divorced in 1985 during his second term.
