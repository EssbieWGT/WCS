,DC,2025-09-08 18:56:16+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump administration asks Supreme Court to let it block $4B in foreign aid funding,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-administration-asks-supreme-court-let-it-block-4b-foreign-aid-funding,,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Monday asked the Supreme Court to overturn a lower court’s ruling and allow it to withhold $4 billion in foreign aid that was previously approved by Congress.The case is one of many lawsuits challenging the White House’s efforts to supersede Congress’ spending authority by canceling funding without lawmakers’ explicit approval.  This particular case became more complicated in late August when the Trump administration sent Congress a rescission request, asking lawmakers to cancel billions in foreign aid, including some of the funding subject to this lawsuit. This “pocket rescission,” as it’s sometimes called, came within 45 days of the end of the fiscal year. Under the Trump administration’s interpretation of the law, they believe that allows them to cancel the funding even if Congress refuses to go along with the proposal. The move is considered illegal by the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office and evoked ire from senior lawmakers, including Senate Appropriations Chairwoman Susan Collins, R-Maine.“Article I of the Constitution makes clear that Congress has the responsibility for the power of the purse,” Collins wrote in a statement. “Any effort to rescind appropriated funds without congressional approval is a clear violation of the law.”Administration sees executive branch ‘at war with itself’The appeal to the Supreme Court filed Monday urges the justices to let the legislative and executive branches figure out the spending dispute on their own and criticizes a federal district court for ordering the Trump administration to spend the money. “The injunction requires the Executive Branch to rush to obligate the same $4 billion that the President has just proposed rescinding between now and September 30, and thus puts the Executive Branch at war with itself,” wrote Solicitor General D. John Sauer. “Just as the President is pressing for rescission and explaining to Congress that obligating these funds would harm U.S. foreign policy interests, his subordinates are being forced to proceed to identify and even negotiate with potential recipients.”The pocket rescissions request at the center of this case is separate from the one Trump sent Congress in early June that asked members to eliminate funding for numerous foreign aid accounts and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Lawmakers approved that proposal in July after preserving full funding for the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR.Congress has yet to act on the second rescissions request as its leaders look for ways to fund the government ahead of an Oct. 1 shutdown deadline. Attorneys for the organizations that brought the lawsuit — the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition and Global Health Council — wrote in a brief to the Supreme Court submitted Monday that they opposed the Trump administration's request to overturn the lower court’s preliminary injunction. “USAID and the State Department have been under a duty to obligate these funds since at least March 2024, when Congress enacted the appropriations; they chose not to act sooner,” they wrote. “The government faces no cognizable harm from having to take steps to comply with the law for the short period while this Court considers its stay application.”",,,,2025-09-08 14:58:18.711770

Article Summary

President Donald Trump’s administration sought to block $11 billion in public health funding grants in a March executive order.
Illinois was among nearly a dozen Democrat-led states to file suit against the action.
Those states won an injunction against the administration’s action in May, which allowed them to keep much of the funding that was slated for cuts.
The injunction applied to only states that sued.
Illinois has been able to retain 19 of the 21 grants that were slated for termination.

This summary was written by the editors of Capitol News Illinois.

After the Trump administration slashed billions in state and local public health funding from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention earlier this year, the eventual impact on states split sharply along political lines.
Democratic-led states that sued to block the cuts – including Illinois – kept much of their funding, while Republican-led states lost the bulk of theirs, according to a new analysis from health research organization KFF.
The uneven fallout underscores how politics continues shaping health care in the United States. The nearly 700 CDC grants were worth about $11 billion and had been allocated by Congress during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Not just COVID-19 spending
Since then, state and local health departments had spent or planned to spend the money not just on COVID-related efforts, but also on prevention of other infectious diseases, support for mental health and substance use, shoring up aging public health infrastructure, and other needs.
The CDC grant terminations initially affected red and blue states about evenly, according to KFF. California, the District of Columbia, Illinois and Massachusetts — all led by Democrats — had among the largest numbers of terminated grants.




The Illinois Department of Public Health announced on March 26 that the federal government was pulling back over $400 million in grant funding that previously had been approved. That included $125 million that was earmarked to support laboratory operations in 97 local health departments as well as $324 million for future work to prevent and treat infectious diseases in Illinois.
Blue states sue
Illinois was one of nearly two dozen blue states and the District of Columbia that sued the Trump administration in April, asking the court to block the grant terminations. They argued the federal government lacked the authority to rescind funding it had already allocated.
The suit, filed in federal court in Rhode Island, argued that Congress appropriated those funds in various pandemic-related spending bills, and the administration’s decisions to terminate the grants violated the federal Administrative Procedures Act.
“Illinois and states across the nation rely on federal grants to provide state public health services that protect our children and residents from serious diseases or health crises,” Raoul said in a statement at the time. “The abrupt termination of this funding that impacts millions of American lives is both callous and unlawful.”

A federal judge sided with the blue states and blocked the cancellations  — but she limited her injunction to the jurisdictions that filed in the lawsuit. Nearly 80% of the grant cuts have now been restored in blue states, according to the KFF analysis, compared with less than 5% in red states.
According to the KFF analysis, 21 grants in Illinois were targeted for termination prior to the lawsuit, but just two have been terminated following the judge’s injunction.




Cuts hit red states hardest
Now four of the five states with the most canceled grants are led by Republicans: Georgia, Ohio, Oklahoma and Texas. California, which is dominated by Democrats, kept all of its grants that had been initially terminated.
In the West and Midwest, Democratic-led Colorado — which joined the lawsuit — had 10 of its 11 grant terminations reversed. Its Republican-led neighbors that did not sue, including Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Utah and Wyoming, lost all of their grants, according to the KFF analysis.

Bob Quinn stepped down as CEO of the South Carolina Research Authority in August. He continues to work for the organization in an advising role through next June.
The authority’s governing board has yet to name a new leader in the interim, according to spokeswoman Adrianne Grimes.
The legislature formed the authority, which acts like something of an angel investor to promising technology startups and university research projects in the state, in 1983. Legislators gave the organization $500,000 in state money and 1,400 acres of undeveloped land to get started.
Quinn has been at the helm of the organization since August 2016, a role in which he earned more than $326,000 annually according to the government non-profit’s latest tax filings. Quinn continues to receive the same salary in his advisory role, Grimes said.
The authority boosts technological developments and research in the state through grants and entrepreneurial coaching. It also introduces entrepreneurs and researchers to larger companies in the state in need of technical innovations, helping startups and college academics secure industry contracts.
The authority raised nearly $17 million in the 2024 budget year, mostly from private donations and revenue it earns from leasing space in its six incubators across the state. That revenue is then used to fund the organization’s grants and operations.
The organization, under Quinn’s leadership, gave out $5.2 million in grants to startup companies between July 2023 through the end of June 2024, according to the latest annual report. In turn, those companies fundraised an addition $303 million.
Over the past decade, the authority has given out just shy of $30 million in grants to college researchers.
More than 200 companies and 86 researchers are actively involved with the organization.
In an Aug. 15 letter to the board, Quinn said he planned to retire as CEO effective June 30, 2026. It is unclear why the executive board — made up of five of South Carolina’s public college presidents, two legislators, a chairman appointed by the governor and two other board chosen members — chose to transition Quinn to an advisory role in the meantime.
Quinn declined to comment when contacted by the SC Daily Gazette.
In the letter to the board, Quinn cited his wife’s retirement at the end of last year and said he had long been planning his own retirement for the end of the 2026 budget year.
“It is the honor of my professional lifetime to serve in this role,” Quinn wrote. “I am constantly inspired by our deeply dedicated employees and their strong commitment to fulfill our mission to fuel South Carolina’s innovation economy. Their collective accomplishments are a source of great pride, especially the recognition by other state leaders of the integrity and purpose this team has built together. I hope and pray we never lose sight of those objectives.”
Grimes said Quinn remains in an advisory role as the authority carries out its latest initiatives. What those initiatives include is unknown.
Grimes said the board discussed the initiatives during executive session at its June 20 meeting. An agenda for that meeting was not published on the authority’s website. The board cited contracts and legal discussions as the reason for closing that portion of the meeting to the public. The authority also did not post any notice of an August meeting.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DSC_0104-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-08 14:58:18.711770

Conservation groups are looking to overturn an August decision to strip federal protections from the chicken in a federal appeals court. (Courtesy of Patricia Zenone/USFWS)Conservation groups want a Texas court to overturn the recent gutting of federal protections for the lesser prairie chicken, a near-flightless bird living in the grasslands of Eastern New Mexico and four other states. 
In 2022, the Biden Administration offered the bird protection under the Endangered Species Act. Federal officials, through a public process, designated the smaller southern population in New Mexico and the Texas panhandle as “endangered,” and the northern population across Kansas, Oklahoma, northern Texas and Eastern Colorado as “threatened.”
In August, a Texas judge stripped federal protections for the chicken. Precipitating the August decision was the Trump Administration’s seismic about-face in May, with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said there was a “fundamental error” in the Biden Administration’s listing of the bird in 2022. The memo requested the judge side with opponents suing against the protections, which included the states of Texas, Kansas and Oklahoma, along with representatives from the ranching and petroleum industries. 
Conservationists: Ending lesser prairie chicken protections could set a troubling precedent

The Arizona-based nonprofit Center for Biological Diversity filed the appeal in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals Monday, asking a panel of judges to overturn the decision and allow conservation groups to enter the proceedings — arguments denied by the lower courts.
“The Trump Administration had no legal or scientific basis for its reversal,” Jason Rylander, the legal director for the group’s Climate Law Institute, told Source NM.
The chicken — known for its quirky courtship dances involving inflated cheek pouches and stomping — has been in and out of court for the past three decades as its numbers declined from the millions into about 26,000 (as of 2022) across the grasslands of New Mexico, Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas. 
Rylen said arguments could be presented by this fall, but that the population lost all federal protections, including ones that prohibited hunting or killing the chickens. While more chickens survive in the Colorado, Oklahoma and Kansas portion of its range, the species faces habitat losses from industry and climate change, threatening its long-term survival — especially in New Mexico. 
“The southern population of the lesser prairie chicken is now at severe risk of blinking out entirely,” he said. 
Rylander said the bigger picture is the upheaval of environmental protections by the federal government. 
“The Trump administration has taken an anti-science, scorched-earth approach to environmental conservation and public land protections, stripping Clean Air Act protections, denying climate change, and declaring endangered species persona non grata,” Rylander said. “I think that’s just a horrifying prospect for conservation in America.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/RSlesser-prairie-chicken-Patricia-Zenone-usfws-dg1.jpg,,,2025-09-08 14:58:18.711770

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Pawtucket-based Hasbro Inc. will abandon its century-old Rhode Island roots with a move to the Boston Seaport by the end of 2026, the company announced Monday.
The announcement cements the fate Rhode Island officials and business leaders have spent the last year trying to avoid by offering the iconic toymaker prime Providence real estate in the hopes of keeping its 1,000-person local workforce in Rhode Island. But the pull of Massachusetts, including state tax incentives, access to robust public transportation and partnerships with nearby academic institutions and businesses proved too strong.
“Boston’s thriving business community, deep academic partnerships and cultural vibrancy, together with our Seattle team’s leadership in technology, creativity, and innovation, give Hasbro an unparalleled foundation for growth,” Chris Cocks, Hasbro CEO, said in a statement. “Together, these offices will fuel the next chapter of Hasbro.”
The toy and gaming empire said it plans to move to a 16-story laboratory building in the Boston Seaport, by the end of 2026. The lease for a 265,000 square feet spanning seven floors at 400 Summer St. in Boston will replace its present headquarters, a circa-1900 manufacturing building on Newport Avenue in Pawtucket. Cocks has already signaled his discontent with the Pawtucket space, saying it was “showing its age” in an internal email dating back to Sept. 16, first reported by the Boston Business Journal. Publicly released emails show Massachusetts state officials began courting Hasbro as early as April 2024, offering various tax incentives in the hopes of luring the company.
Rhode Island leaders scrambled to put together a counteroffer, which included the opportunity for Hasbro to buy a prime piece of undeveloped land in the I-195 Redevelopment District for $1. But more sweeping tax incentives, similar to those pitched by Massachusetts officials, were never put on the table for the Rhode Island General Assembly to consider during its 2025 legislative session.
Pawtucket Mayor Don Grebien and city officials reportedly came up with their own proposal to keep Hasbro within the city, though details were never shared publicly. 
Gov. Dan McKee’s office did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment on Monday.
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi, who met with Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey on Sept. 4, also did not immediately return requests for comment on Monday.
At the start of the year, Hasbro’s projected profit losses from President Donald Trump’s tariffs appeared to keep a potential move at bay, with the company postponing its initial deadline for a decision. Second quarter earnings released on July 23 suggested the financial consequences of tariffs might not be as severe as initially feared, though Cocks did not address the potential relocation.
Healey touted Hasbro’s decision in a win for “Team Massachusetts” in a statement on Monday.
“We are thrilled that Hasbro has chosen Massachusetts as the home of its new headquarters, and we’re ready to support the hundreds of jobs they will create here,” Healey said. “We’re proud to welcome this iconic company to Team Massachusetts — where we are number one for education, health care and innovation. I’m grateful for the leadership of Chris Cocks and his team at Hasbro, and for the hard work of my economic development team that helped make this possible.”
Andrea Snyder, a spokesperson for Hasbro, declined to answer questions regarding details of the decision, including specific incentives Massachusetts has offered, and when the decision was made. Snyder instead referred back to the company’s press release on the news. 
The Boston Seaport office will house Hasbro’s corporate services, as well as its toy, board game and licensing arms. Its digital gaming business, which includes MAGIC: The Gathering, will remain at its present hub in Renton, Washington, which features 111,000 square feet and 500 employees.

Josh’s path—from rural Vermont to global relief work—was shaped by creativity, service, and the support of those who believed in him. Today, he leads WYKR and a local newspaper, driven by a belief in community, curiosity, and the power of being seen for one’s full potential.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  From rural roots to global impact: A Vermont medi[...]","Joshua Smith of Yankee Kingdom Media and his eldest daughter, Elizabeth, at a remote broadcast with WYKR. 
Over the past decade, the way people connect and build community has shifted in meaningful ways. 
As Joshua Smith watched these changes unfold, he noticed something important: while online platforms offered new opportunities, many people around him still craved real, local connection. Around the same time, the owner of WYKR, his hometown radio station, kept joking, “Josh, if you ever want to buy a radio station, let me know.” In 2023, Josh took him up on it.
Based in Wells River and serving parts of northern Vermont and New Hampshire, WYKR is the oldest country radio station in Vermont. True to its roots, Josh is revitalizing what radio was back in the ’70s and ’80s, featuring outdoor shows and programs, broadcasting the local basketball games, and keeping advertising affordable.
Josh is building something enduring. He took over The Bridge Weekly Showcase, a local paper, soon after buying WYKR. He formed Yankee Kingdom Media to sustain and grow both outlets. Local ownership, he notes, ensures the voices and stories of his community are heard. And it enhances the symbiotic relationship between local businesses. “Keeping local media local and independent? We can’t take it for granted,” he says. 
“I don’t know where I would have ended up.”
When Josh reflects on where he started—a disengaged student from rural Vermont—he’s clear about one thing: “I wouldn’t be here without VSAC believing in me.”
A self-professed theater kid at Blue Mountain Union High School, Josh wasn’t sure about college. His three brothers didn’t go, and although his parents wanted him to continue his education, he knew they couldn’t pay for it. Then, junior year, he began meeting monthly with a VSAC outreach counselor from VSAC’s GEAR UP college and career readiness program.
“My outreach counselor guided me through the entire process and took away any barriers I perceived. She also helped me remove the barriers of funding. She reinforced the fact that education is a right, not a privilege.”
Josh’s VSAC counselor helped him with his applications and financial aid paperwork, and coached him on what to expect in college. “VSAC looked at me and saw the full future version of me. Not my test scores, not my grades. Me,” he says.
Josh’s theater teacher had friends who taught at Webster University in Saint Louis, and they encouraged him to apply. So he did, along with a slate of other schools, all of which he was accepted to. Webster remained his first choice—and he ended up with a financial aid package that made it possible for him to go. 
From art school to international service
Josh originally dreamed of becoming a children’s book illustrator. Over the course of his college years, however, his perspective began to shift. He joined the Peace Corps after college, which changed everything, and high school French classes landed him a position in Niger. 
After being in Niger for two years, Josh renewed his option to stay for another two years. “I lived in a mud hut and pulled my own water from a well. And while there, I read all the books I was supposed to read in high school.” 
Josh’s Peace Corps experience ignited a passion for international service. He went on to earn a master’s in International Education from the School for International Training in Brattleboro and spent the next 12 years working with global humanitarian organizations, including Doctors Without Borders and Action Against Hunger. From Pakistan to the Philippines, Libya to Nigeria, Joshua managed the complex logistics of getting food and medical supplies to those in crisis.
“I repaired ambulances in Libya during the revolution and had a machine gun pointed in my face. Along with survival, the logistical challenges of getting food and medical supplies to places during a crisis were mine to solve.”
But even while doing this high-stakes work, he never forgot his roots—or the people who helped get him started. “The key to success is showing up and believing in yourself,” he said. “My self-confidence really came from working with VSAC. They made me feel comfortable with being uncomfortable. When you’re a teenager, there is no self-confidence. When you have someone who believes in your potential more than you do, especially when it’s an adult—that’s powerful.”
“I don’t believe in one career for the rest of your life. I’m on my third.”
After marrying his wife, Edith (whom he met while working in Niger), and moving back to Vermont, Joshua earned an MBA from Norwich University and dove into the nonprofit world. He led an organization supporting people with intellectual disabilities and sat on several local boards before the opportunity to purchase WYKR came about. 
Now 49, at the helm of Yankee Kingdom Media and living in Morrisville with his wife and three children, one of Josh’s greatest joys is hosting a podcast—Vermont Authors and Artists—bringing together his lifelong love of creativity, service, and conversation.
Through it all, he carries forward his commitment to continuous curiosity—something he learned in theater and through the arts and is now passing on to his children.
“I don’t believe in one career for the rest of your life,” he notes. “I’m on my third. Ten years ago, I wouldn’t have seen this career coming.”

A new effort will enable drivers to learn if they are available spaces before they get to a location. (Photo by Jerry Cornfield/Washington State Standard)Truck drivers traveling through Washington are getting new technological tools to help find open parking spots in rest areas and weigh stations on Interstate 5.
A new program starting this month will offer drivers different ways to learn if there’s any place to park in a location a few miles or a few hours before they reach it. The Truck Parking Information Management System will provide this data via a website, a mobile application or an in-cab system.
State transportation officials said providing real-time information should help reduce guesswork and assist truck drivers in planning their travel.
This is a big deal. Truckers face legal limits on how many hours they can drive in a day and are electronically monitored to ensure they comply. They often start searching for parking long before needing it. 
Washington has roughly 530 truck parking spaces at its safety rest areas. But demand often exceeds supply.  Seventy-five percent of Washington’s truck drivers report problems finding safe parking at least once every week, according to the state Department of Transportation. Solving the shortage has been a focus of conversations and study in recent years.
By the end of September, data collection technology will be operational at 11 weigh stations and rest areas between Blaine and Vancouver. The $2.3 million spent to install it came from the federal Freight Motor Carrier Safety Administration. Six more locations will come online in 2026 using funds from the Infrastructure for Rebuilding America program. Both are administered by the U.S. Department of Transportation.
Drivers will be able to learn what’s available 20 miles before reaching any of those 11 locations, and again at five miles before arriving.
In addition, a feature in the free mobile app will project the expected number of available truck parking spaces at a designated location up to four hours in advance. The state Department of Transportation enlisted the University of Washington Star Lab to create this first-of-its-kind source of predictive information. 
Two vendors, Drivewyze and ParkerTruck, are providing the date for drivers through in-cab displays in their trucks or mobile apps on their phones.
Expanding truck parking capacity is an ongoing topic among lawmakers and transportation officials. A 2024 report assessed the challenges and recommended a series of actions for the Legislature to consider taking in the next six years.
In 2023, the department released a strategy for modernizing the state’s rest areas. Creating truck-only rest areas was suggested as one way to ease the shortage of spots.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/0-9-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-08 14:58:18.711770

(Photo: Lynn Bonner/NC Newsline)Voters whose names or birth dates don’t match ID numbers in the state registration file won’t automatically have to use provisional ballots after all, under revised instructions the state Board of Elections approved Monday. 
The latest revisions to efforts to collect and validate government IDs come after Democrats on the state Board objected at its last meeting to the requirement that voters whose names or birth dates did not match identifiers in government databases would need to continually use provisional ballots until the mismatches were resolved. 
The state Board of Elections is trying to collect driver’s license numbers or partial Social Security numbers from voters who don’t have either of those identifiers connected to their names in the state voter registration database. 
In some cases, voters may not have supplied the numbers. In other cases, misspelled names, transposed numbers in dates of birth, or changed names created data mismatches. 
For example, if a woman registers before she’s married and again after she’s married with a different last name, her Social Security number won’t match to the new registration. 
Letters have gone out to voters who apparently did not supply one of the required numbers, asking them for the information. If they haven’t supplied it by the next time they vote, they’ll be asked to fill out a provisional ballot. The provisional voting application asks for one of those numbers. 
People who supplied numbers that couldn’t be validated will vote regular ballots if they show an acceptable ID. 
Under the plan, county election boards will review records for data errors. Beginning in January, letters will go out twice a year to voters whose ID numbers won’t validate, asking them for help figuring out why. 
The U.S. Department of Justice sued the state Board over the missing numbers. The state and the DOJ reached a settlement that District Judge Richard Myers II signed Monday. 
As the Board unanimously approved the new instructions, members engaged in a wide-ranging discussion about whether enough was being done to cull  noncitizen voters. 
Board member Robert Rucho, a former Republican state senator, questioned whether someone should be allowed to vote using a utility bill. 
The federal Help America Vote Act lists utility bills among the documents voters or new registrants can use to establish identity and residency. North Carolina law requires voters show a photo ID or fill out a form explaining why they don’t have one. 
“I just don’t think that we’re doing what our responsibility requires us to do,” Rucho said.

A Canadian citizen was charged late last month with illegally registering to vote in North Carolina and voting in federal elections in 2022 and 2024. 
Board member Jeff Carmon, a Democrat, said he hasn’t seen a widespread problem with noncitizen voting in his six years on the board, and told Rucho he shouldn’t have said staff wasn’t making a maximum effort. .
“What we’re doing is according to the law,” Carmon said. 
“Maybe the law is insane,” Board Chairman Francis De Luca interjected. 
Board member Stacy “Four” Eggers IV, a Republican, said there’s still interest in using the federal SAVE database to verify voters’  citizenship. 
Elections officials are working with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security on a memo “that would lay out the parameters of any potential data exchange with regard to the last four of Social Security,” said state Elections Director Sam Hayes.
Officials want to work with the state DMV to obtain full Social Security numbers, Hayes said. 
A bill proposed by House Republicans would require voters to supply their full Social Security numbers when registering. Voting and privacy experts told NC Newsline that provision would violate federal privacy law. 
The DVM, however, collects full Social Security numbers. 
Hayes said lawmakers are working on legislation “that would compel that data sharing, and we’re certainly supportive of that as well.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/P5071581-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-08 14:58:18.711770

(Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier will not defend a fatal road rage case prosecuted by state attorney Monique Worrell if any conviction goes to an appeals court, he warned in a Monday letter.
Instead, he may ask Gov. Ron DeSantis to suspend her. Again. It would be the latest strike in a lengthy feud between the DeSantis administration and Worrell, Orange County’s Democratic chief prosecutor, who only just retook her seat after the governor removed her from office.
Uthmeier will insist Worrell made a “plain error” in choosing to prosecute Tina Allgeo — a 47-year-old woman who shot and killed a man who attacked her in her car during a December road rage incident — if Allgeo is convicted and appeals her case. Uthmeier will also evaluate whether “further intervention is warranted.”
Monique Worrell via her webpage
“Your decision to pursue this case as you have despite Allgeo’s self-defense immunity under at least two Florida statutes may very likely require my office to admit plain error on appeal,” Uthmeier wrote in the letter, accusing Worrell of ignoring the state’s “stand your ground” laws allowing self-defense killings.
Uthmeier just hours later asked Worrell to investigate a former state senator for posting the whereabouts of Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agents. He wondered whether the ex-lawmaker, Linda Stewart, was “harassing” law enforcement.
As Florida’s chief legal officer, Uthmeier exercises a general “superintendence” role over Florida’s 20 elected state attorneys, although they function independently of him. The power to suspend a state attorney lies solely with the governor.
“Your actions likely constitute a breach of your ethical obligations. And they may also constitute misfeasance, malfeasance, neglect of duty, and incompetence,” he continued, reciting the Florida Constitution’s provisions allowing the governor to suspend an out-of-line officeholder.
“I strongly urge you to reconsider your prosecution of Allgeo.”
When asked whether DeSantis would consider suspending Worrell, the governor’s office pointed to DeSantis’s comments at the State Freedom Caucus last week:
“If you are a prosecutor, particularly those funded by George Soros, please know that if you don’t enforce the law, I will remove you from your post.”
DeSantis ousts another Democratic prosecutor — Monique Worrell of Orange County

The Orange County Grand Jury indicted Allgeo in February for the second-degree murder with a firearm of 42-year-old Mihail Tsvetkov. Surveillance footage shows Allgeo outside of her car, taking photos of Tsvetkov’s plates. When Tsvetkov drove away, she pursued him and struck his car with hers.
A red light camera video then follows Tsvetkov as he exits his car, yanks open Allgeo’s car door, and begins to beat her, seemingly attempting to pull her out of her vehicle. Allgeo then pulls the trigger on her firearm, shooting Tsvetkov “in the face” and killing him almost instantly, News 6 reported.
Allgeo later said that she initially confronted Tsvetkov because he tailgated her and allegedly purposely hit her car with his own.
“This is a case of great public importance that needed to be reviewed by the Grand Jury to determine whether the evidence supported an indictment,” Worrell said after the grand jury indictment. “Gun violence stemming from senseless disputes will not be tolerated, and our office will hold those who commit these acts accountable.”
This isn’t the first time Worrell and Uthmeier have clashed. In April, he accused her of both slow-walking and ignoring a mounting backlog of cases. He called a press conference to send six statewide prosecutors to help her with the workload, jabbing at her alleged ties to Democrat mega-donor Soros in the process.
This followed weeks of back-and-forth between the legal politicos, which involved accusations of Worrell being “soft on crime” and Uthmeier being “uninformed.”
Before Uthmeier was sworn in as attorney general in February, he served as DeSantis’s chief of staff. He held this title in August 2023, when DeSantis suspended Worrell for allegedly neglecting “her duty to faithfully prosecute crime in her jurisdiction.”
Although Worrell failed to get the Florida Supreme Court to overturn her suspension, she won a second term in November. This unseated Andrew Bain, whom DeSantis had appointed to replace her. DeSantis had also suspended Hillsborough County State Attorney Andrew Warren but he failed for re-election last year.
“You may not like Florida’s self-defense laws,” Uthmeier wrote Monday. “But those laws reflect the simple truth that a Floridian — a woman in this case — has the right to use deadly force to stop a man from brutalizing or killing her.”
Worrell’s office did not respond to a request for comment at the time of publishing.

The former executive director of the Vermont Council of Special Education Administrators was charged with felony embezzlement, the Montpelier Police Department said in a press release Friday.
Darren McIntrye, who served as the head of the organization from 2021 to 2023, embezzled more than $76,000 from the organization and used the funds “for personal gain,” police alleged in the release.
The investigation began in October 2024, when the organization reported the “misappropriation of company funds” to the Montpelier Police Department, Alesha Donovan, a police detective with the department, said in the release.
The Vermont Council of Special Education Administrators has been active in Vermont for decades, supporting special education administrators and employees in school districts across the state. Mary Lundeen, the organization’s executive director, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

Photo by Jon King.Last week’s passage of a student bathroom bill showcases a disturbing, yet all-too-familiar GOP strategy: demonize marginalized communities to hide failures elsewhere.
In this case, the failure is putting forth a realistic state budget proposal just weeks before a government shutdown.
Evidently, when the budget calendar counts down to zero, the distraction playbook pulls transgender students into the crosshairs.
The Republican-led Michigan House’s approval of House Bill 4024, a measure specifying bathroom and locker-room access by sex assigned at birth effectively bans transgender students from using facilities that align with their gender identity.
Setting aside the fact that enforcing such a law is impractical at best (after all, who is going to be in charge of double-checking genitalia?), or that the bill has zero chance of being taken up by Democrats in charge of the Senate, advocates argue it is a direct violation of the Elliott‑Larsen Civil Rights Act, an act enshrined in the Michigan Constitution, which lawmakers swear an oath to uphold, not undermine.
A day earlier, House Republicans stood at a press conference digging in their heels on budget talks, as Speaker Matt Hall touted his caucus’ $3.4 billion proposal for new road investments while essentially doubling down by accusing Senate Democrats of stonewalling a road funding plan.
But that was little more than smoke and mirrors: negotiations have stalled all while an Oct. 1 government shutdown looms with essential services – from school lunches to public safety – on the chopping block.
What’s clear is this: the House GOP prefers staging an attack on marginalized kids over passing tangible solutions. If the state shuts down, no amount of moral fervor around who uses which bathroom will register with families facing disruption, especially not with students denied programs, teachers left unpaid, or police understaffed.
Repeating history, members of this caucus can’t even justify their cuts with a coherent budget plan, so they resort instead to scapegoating.
Dismantling transgender rights isn’t progress. It’s a cynical, cowardly dodge when voters ask: “What are you doing about our schools? Our safety net?”
Let’s not be distracted. The fight for civil rights is non-negotiable, and it’s being used to distract from budgetary neglect.
Strong leadership means facing tough choices – not shirking responsibility and demonizing kids who deserve better.

(Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser led a group of 20 Democratic state attorneys general in a letter blasting the “undue influence” that reportedly led to the U.S. Department of Justice’s approval of a $14 billion deal between IT giants Hewlett-Packard Enterprise and Juniper Networks.
The DOJ’s Antitrust Division sued in January to block HPE’s proposed acquisition of Juniper Networks, which would lead to just two companies — HPE and Cisco Systems — controlling roughly 75% of the networking equipment market. But the Trump administration shifted course in June, agreeing to approve the deal in a settlement that included minor concessions from the companies, and a month later it fired two top antitrust officials who had worked on the case.
Citing news reports that senior DOJ officials were “lobbied by individuals with close ties to the President’s administration,” the letter says that the federal judge hearing the case should subject the proposed settlement to further review under a 1974 law known as the Tunney Act.

“The U.S. Department of Justice’s Antitrust Division must operate under the rule of law and decide antitrust cases based on principles applied equally to all companies — regardless of their political ties,” Weiser said in a press release Friday. “The allegations made about this settlement, and the defects of this settlement on its face, call out for scrutiny. Thankfully, the Tunney Act was enacted for just this purpose and can achieve its goal of ensuring that sunlight provides ‘the best of disinfectants.’”
Weiser, a 2026 candidate for Colorado governor, wrote in the letter to Leslie Wulff, civil chief of the DOJ Antitrust Division’s San Francisco Office, that in light of the “explosive and dangerous accusations” of corruption in the deal’s approval, Colorado and other states are “prepared to participate in further proceedings” to block the merger.
“The Court should hold an evidentiary hearing and require discovery into the Settlement and the allegedly corrupt process that led to it,” the letter says. “And if, upon exposing the settlement to sunlight, the evidence establishes that it was the product of undue influence, then the Court should reject it as against the public interest.”
In a separate letter on Sept. 4 to Republican and Democratic members of Congress, Weiser also called for congressional scrutiny of the deal.
“I strongly urge your committees to hold hearings to examine this case and to call attention to the importance of protecting impartial and fair merger review by the Antitrust Division,” wrote Weiser. “Your committees’ oversight obligations can provide necessary scrutiny to ensure that the Antitrust Division is truly acting according to its statutory duties and in the public’s best interest — and particularly to shed light on the troubling allegations surrounding this merger review.”

A large focus of the rally was to protest what members of No Detention Centers in Michigan have called punitive cancellations of family and attorney visits.
“Cancelling family visitation is a cruel, punitive and arbitrary response,” said Mindy Domke, a member of No Detention Centers in Michigan. “The GEO Group did not have to do this. They are looking for any excuse to isolate people even further, extending their fundamental practice of cutting off our immigrant friends and loved ones from their support networks and the outside world. It’s yet another reminder of why we oppose the system of immigration detention in the first place.”

Domke also noted that attorney visits had also been described as “unavailable” up until this past Sunday.
Attendees traveled from across the state in solidarity with the hundreds of immigrants now held at the Baldwin facility, which is operated by the federal government through GEO Group, a Florida-based private prison company.
Reports have emerged of harsh conditions at the facility, a trend reflecting the long history of ICE and other federal correctional detention facilities, with immigrants describing inadequate food and delays in their legal cases – and the latter leading indefinite terms of confinement.
“The members and movements of Fountain Street have stood beside you and will continue to stand beside you,” said Rev. Nathan Dannison of Fountain Street Church in Grand Rapids in a recorded message to the crowd. “You have allies in the faithful people of Grand Rapids. Any Christian who knows their Bible can tell you, somewhere inside the North Lake facility, a baby is being born into a manger. Somewhere inside the North Lake concentration camp, the soldiers of GEO Group are nailing Jesus Christ to the cross. Your actions today will serve as a testimony to our grandchildren—that we refused. … Enough!”

This story was originally published by CalMatters.
The U.S. Supreme Court today granted the Trump administration’s emergency request to lift a temporary restraining order barring federal immigration officials from conducting “roving patrols” and profiling people based on their appearance in Los Angeles and Southern California.
The case is likely to have an enormous impact, not just for Los Angeles but across the country, several experts told CalMatters. It means immigration agents can legally resume aggressive street sweeps that began in early June in Los Angeles, the epicenter for President Donald Trump’s mass deportation campaign.
The Supreme Court, by a 6-3 majority, agreed with the Trump administration that federal immigration officers can briefly detain and interrogate individuals about whether they are lawfully in the United States and that they can rely on a “totality of circumstances” standard for reasonable suspicion. That means everything the officer knew and observed at the time of the stop.
The U.S. Supreme Court took the case through its emergency docket, also known as the shadow docket, is used for cases that are handled speedily with limited briefing and typically no oral argument. The justices relied on briefs from the Trump administration and from California government officials.
Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote an opinion explaining his reasoning in lifting restrictions on Los Angeles immigration sweeps. “Here, those circumstances include: that there is an extremely high number and percentage of illegal immigrants in the Los Angeles area; that those individuals tend to gather in certain locations to seek daily work; that those individuals often work in certain kinds of jobs, such as day labor, landscaping, agriculture, and construction, that do not require paperwork and are therefore especially attractive to illegal immigrants; and that many of those illegally in the Los Angeles area come from Mexico or Central America and do not speak much English,” he wrote.
“To be clear,” he continued, “ethnicity alone cannot furnish reasonable suspicion; under this Court’s case law regarding immigration stops, however, it can be a ‘relevant factor’ when considered with other salient factors.”
The three justices appointed by Democratic presidents dissented from the majority, stressing that they objected to the court lifting limitations on immigration sweeps without oral argument and through the emergency docket, which the Trump administration used extensively this year.
The Supreme Court has sided with Trump in at least 17 cases in a row now.
“That decision is yet another grave misuse of our emergency docket,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in the dissent.  “We should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job. “
Los Angeles and dozens of other Southern California municipalities wrote in an amicus brief supporting the restraining order that, because of the population makeup that “half the population of the Central District” meets the federal government’s criteria for being stopped and questioned about their immigration status. It means officers can rely on little more than a person is located in the parking lot of a Home Depot and speaking Spanish to question someone about their immigration status.
The ruling means the Border Patrol can resume the aggressive tactics a district federal judge said violated people’s Fourth Amendment constitutional rights against unreasonable search and seizure.
In a brief asking justices to remove restrictions on immigration stops, Trump’s Department of Homeland Security wrote that the lower-court injunction interfered with agents’ efforts to remove unauthorized immigrants.
“The injunction raises the specter of contempt for every stop in the district, threatening agents with sanctions if the court disbelieves that they relied on additional factors in making any particular stop. It chills the exercise of Executive authority and usurps the President’s Article II powers to enforce our immigration laws,” attorneys for the Trump administration wrote.
 Why courts paused ‘roving patrols’

The district court found, based on a “mountain of evidence,” that the government engaged in a pattern of conducting stops without reasonable suspicion—relying solely on traits like race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or accented English, the location a person is in, and the type of work a person does.
The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals had upheld the lower court’s ruling, chiding the Trump administration for misrepresenting the restraining order in their appeal.
“If, as the Defendants suggest, they are not conducting stops that lack reasonable suspicion, they can hardly claim to be irreparably harmed by an injunction aimed at preventing … stops not supported by reasonable suspicion,” the three-judge panel from the 9th Circuit wrote.
A coalition of civil rights, immigrant rights, and local government agencies, including the American Civil Liberties Union and the United Farm Workers, sought the order, arguing the LA-area raids have violated people’s rights by allowing federal immigration agents to stop people who simply appear to be Latino, including U.S. citizens.
“The federal government is seeking to detain individuals solely because they are not white, speak Spanish or speak accented English. That idea is anathema to everything the United States stands for, and it should be rejected,” a group of cities in Los Angeles County wrote in amicus brief supporting restrictions on immigration agents. They wrote that this summer’s raids had “sown terror” in their communities.
 LA immigration sweeps continued

Despite the previous order barring profiling, agents have continued an aggressive enforcement blitz in the nation’s second-largest city.
About 40 agents hit a Westlake Home Depot on Aug. 28, using tear gas and pepper pellets to disperse a crowd before detaining eight people, a Border Patrol official confirmed Friday. That’s the same location where agents previously made a hype video set to rap music of themselves hiding in a Penske rental truck before bursting out to detain day laborers in a raid dubbed Operation Trojan Horse.
Under Operation-At-Large Chief Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol has detained Latino daylaborers, swarming Home Depots and carwashes across the nation’s second largest city. Bovino has vowed to bring similar tactics to cities across the country.
Kevin R. Johnson, the director of Aoki Center on Critical Race and Nation Studies at UC Davis School of Law said the federal government’s racial profiling has consequences beyond immigration enforcement. He wrote to CalMatters and also in a paper for the SMU Law Review that “race-based immigration enforcement undermines Latina/o sense of belonging in the national community for generations.”
“Importantly, the Trump administration’s campaign against people of color goes well beyond immigration law and immigrants. As exemplified by the administration’s war on diversity, equity, and inclusion, the President has sought to eliminate programs that seek to promote the full integration of racial and other minorities into U.S. society,” Johnson wrote.

That’s the message public health advocates want to spread today, throughout September (which is Suicide Awareness Month), and throughout the coming year to bring attention to the 988 suicide crisis lifeline and the role it can play in saving someone’s life.
“It’s really trying to bring attention that when somebody is in crisis or they’re having thoughts of suicide, that all they have to do is call 988. It doesn’t matter how big their issue is, how small they may think it is, 988 is always going to be available anytime and anywhere,” said Clara Reynolds, president and CEO of the Crisis Center of Tampa Bay, which answers the 988 line in Hillsborough County. The center is one of 13 around the state that answer the hotline.

Congress established the 988 line in 2020 to replace the old 10-digit call number, to make it easier for people to remember the digits and access the necessary help. Truncating the call line to just three digits, along with increased attention to suicide prevention efforts, has helped, Reynolds said. She also gives credit to law enforcement agencies and the news media for  promoting the line.
“We went from, you know, about 10 to 15 suicide calls a day up to an average of about 50, right now, suicide calls a day, “she said. 
“No matter how big your problem may be or how small you think your problem is, there is help, available, compassionate help, anytime, anywhere. It doesn’t matter where you are across our country or across the state, from Pensacola to Defuniak Springs, Jacksonville to Key West. All you have to know is you can call 988 at any time and receive help from somebody who is specially trained to listen to you, help you feel like you’re actually being heard, and help you get to your place of better — whatever that needs to look like for you.”

Suicide is the ninth leading cause of death in Florida, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data show. Florida’s age-adjusted suicide rate in 2023 was 14.38 deaths per 100,000 population, slightly higher than the 14.1 age-adjusted rate for the previous year. The state saw 3,620 deaths from suicide in 2023.
Nationally, more than 49,000 people died by suicide in 2023. CDC data show that 12.8 million people contemplated suicide, 3.7 million people made a suicide plan, and 1.5 million people tried to commit suicide.
The hotline is funded through a blend of federal and state dollars, Reynolds said, and different states fund the hotline differently. Some agree to a separate tax on telephone bills, similar to an assessment, to support 911. In Florida, the 988 hotline is funded through the state budget, including grants from the Department of Children and Families. 
“Some local counties are also providing additional resources, just to make sure, again, that 24-hours-a-day, seven-days-a-week, access is available,” Reynolds said.
Transcending generations

Tampa Bay real estate agent Nicole Gossett helps to promote the 988 hotline in her area.
Perhaps no one knows the price of suicide than Gossett, whose grandfather, father, and brother committed suicide. September — her father’s birth month — begins a 16-week span in which painful memories can come back. Her father killed himself in October — next month marks the 13th anniversary.
Her birthday is in November, and December is the month her brother killed himself. In January, her grandfather killed himself. She was just 10 years old at the time.
“So, I come into months of just like,’ What’s wrong with me?’ And then I realize, ‘Oh yeah, that’s what’s going on with me.’ Because no matter how hard I don’t want to remember, it happens, and it’s just the memories are so present,” Gossett told the Florida Phoenix in a telephone interview. 
“I try to flip the dialogue in my own brain and celebrate them. My dad loved Mexican food and margaritas, so I always have to have Mexican food and margaritas on his birthday and the day that we lost him. And my brother and I, just as kids, we loved Wendy’s. And so I get myself Wendy’s for his.”
Gossett stresses that the 988 line isn’t just for those feeling suicidal. It could be for the friends, family, or co-workers who know someone feeling suicidal.
“For the people that are being reached out to, if you’re not a professional, that’s a lot of information to take, and you may not know what to do. You as an individual receiving that someone is having a hard time, you need to call 988, to get professional advice to know how to guide that person,” Gossett said.
“Reach out and say, ‘So someone’s reached out to me. I don’t know how to help them. Can you please guide me? What resources do you have for me? Can I try to get you on a call with them? ‘You, we, as individuals who are not trained, we need the support, and it is there for us too.”

The move will force Shenandoah Valley residents to travel further for their primary and emergency health care needs. 
Dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the federal legislation entails forthcoming changes to Medicaid that’s projected to lead to enrollment drop offs and  big tweaks to hospital funding mechanisms. 
First reported by WHSV3, and according to a press release from Augusta Medical Group, Augusta Medical Group’s decision is part of the “ongoing response” to the OBBA and “the resulting realities for healthcare delivery.” 
Affected facilities are Buena Vista Primary Care, Churchville Primary Care and Weyers Cave Urgent Care. 
Buena Vista patients have already been contacted and reassigned to either August Health Maury River Family Practice or Augusta Primary Care in Lexington, each about 10 miles away. 
Churchville patients are encouraged to go to August Health Family Practice in Verona, also about 10 miles away. The release noted that it is open five days a week, while the Churchville facility had previously operated three days per week. 
Weyers Cave patients will need to travel further to access other Augusta Health urgent care locations in Stuarts Draft, Staunton, Waynesboro, or Crozet. Meanwhile, the company plans to deploy its mobile clinic to Weyer’s Cave to meet people where they are, but it’s unclear how frequently that would happen as of the time of this publication.
About 21% of 6th Congressional District residents are on Medicaid, according to the Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services. The 6th District includes much of Shenandoah Valley and is represented in Congress by Republican Rep. Ben Cline, who voted in favor of the OBBA this summer.
Most Republicans — including all of Virginia’s Republican congressional delegation — supported the President Donald Trump-backed bill, though some took issue with the health care portions of it. U.S. Reps. Rob Wittman, R-Westmoreland, and Jen Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach, had urged Congress to reconsider those portions of the bill, before ultimately voting for it anyway. All of Virginia’s Democratic delegation opposed the bill. 
Last week, U.S. Sen Mark Warner urged health systems to “be transparent” about any struggles they encounter amid the fallout of the legislation, much like Augusta Health has done. 
Augusta Health serves about 200,000 people in Shenandoah Valley to include Augusta County, Staunton, Waynesboro and surrounding areas across hospitals and clinics including the ones that are closing. The company is the largest local private employer in the area. According to its website, it employs over 2,000 people and has over 200 physicians. It’s unclear how many staff and medical professionals have been let go amid the closure of the three clinics. 
The Mercury’s call to Augusta Health to ask about lay offs and the mobile clinic was directed to a line that wasn’t answered and an inbox that was not accepting new voicemail. 
Kris Doan, president of Augusta Medical Group relayed in the press release that “these decisions are never easy, but demonstrate Augusta Health’s commitment to deploying innovative access strategies for addressing demand at the neighborhood level.”
He added that the choice was “necessary” to ensure the future of Augusta Health’s footprint in the region as a health care provider. 
“We remain focused on meeting the evolving needs of the Shenandoah Valley while keeping our patients at the center of everything we do,” he said.

Meet Shefali and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
New York Attorney General Letitia James announced Monday that she will defend her state’s abortion protections in a lawsuit brought by the state of Texas. James’ involvement sets up the first interstate fight over abortion laws since the fall of Roe v. Wade, opening the door for the Supreme Court to weigh in on a key legal mechanism that has helped people in states with bans access abortion.
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed a civil suit against Dr. Margaret Carpenter in December for providing a telehealth abortion to a Texas-based patient. Carpenter lives and practices in New York, where abortion is legal; in Texas, where her patient received the health care, there is an almost total ban on abortion. 
New York is one of several states where abortion providers are protected by shield laws — statutes that ban cooperation with other states’ attempts to enforce abortion bans. The law prohibits New York law enforcement officials from arresting or extraditing health professionals who provided abortions that are legal in New York; law enforcement also cannot cooperate with investigations or punishments of such procedures.
By setting up a clash between two states’ chief law enforcement offices, James’ intervention increases the likelihood that the New York-Texas dispute becomes a vehicle for the Supreme Court to weigh in on the constitutionality of shield laws and the telehealth abortions they enable. 
This month, James, the first woman and first Black person to serve as her state’s attorney general, will argue in legal filings that the Empire State has the right to pass laws protecting its residents from another state’s abortion bans.
“Texas has no authority in New York, and no power to impose its cruel abortion ban here,” James said in a statement.
The implications are significant. Since Roe’s undoing, tens of thousands of people living under abortion bans have relied on telehealth to get care. Health providers living in states with legal abortion consult with them virtually and then have abortion pills mailed to them to take from home. Now, about 1 in 4 abortions are done through telehealth — and half of those are for people receiving shield-law-protected care. The practice is medically safe and effective and often easier and more affordable for patients than traveling to another state. 
But the legality is fraught.
Supporters of the practice argue that, because the medical providers are practicing in their home states where abortion is legal they are not violating any laws. Abortion opponents say the opposite: that because the abortion ultimately occurs in a state where the procedure is banned, telehealth providers are breaking the law and must be punished accordingly.
Legal analysts have said the legality of shield laws will likely be decided by the Supreme Court. Several cases are pending that address abortions allegedly provided over telehealth to patients in states with bans, including a criminal case brought by Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill and two civil cases both filed by anti-abortion lawyer Jonathan Mitchell.
In February, a judge in a Texas state court ruled against Carpenter, saying she had to pay a penalty of $113,000. But New York state officials have refused to enforce the ruling, citing the state’s shield laws. Carpenter herself has not entered Texas. Then in July, Paxton sued the Ulster County, New York, clerk for declining to enter the Texas judgement against Carpenter. In that petition, he argued that New York’s shield law violates the U.S. Constitution’s Full Faith and Credit clause, which requires that states honor other states’ judicial proceedings.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AP_PlannedParenthood_2022-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-08 13:01:26.297293

Read it here.
La Corte Suprema de Estados Unidos concedió hoy la solicitud de emergencia de la administración Trump de levantar una orden de restricción temporal que prohíbe a los funcionarios federales de inmigración realizar “ patrullas itinerantes ” y perfilar a las personas en función de su apariencia en Los Ángeles y el sur de California.
 Es probable que el caso tenga un enorme impacto, no solo en Los Ángeles, sino en todo el país, según informaron varios expertos a CalMatters. Esto significa que los agentes de inmigración pueden reanudar legalmente las agresivas redadas callejeras que comenzaron a principios de junio en Los Ángeles, epicentro de la campaña de deportaciones masivas del presidente Donald Trump.
En un fallo de 31 páginas, la Corte Suprema, por una mayoría de 6 a 3, coincidió con la administración Trump en que los agentes federales de inmigración pueden detener e interrogar brevemente a personas para determinar si se encuentran legalmente en Estados Unidos y que pueden basarse en el criterio de “totalidad de circunstancias” para determinar una sospecha razonable. 
El expediente de emergencia de la Corte Suprema de los Estados Unidos se utiliza para casos que se tramitan con rapidez, con información limitada y, por lo general, sin argumentos orales. Los jueces suelen emitir órdenes sin firmar y con escasa o ninguna explicación.
 El fallo significa que la Patrulla Fronteriza puede reanudar las tácticas agresivas que un juez federal de distrito dijo que violaban los derechos constitucionales de la Cuarta Enmienda de las personas contra registros e incautaciones irrazonables.
 En un escrito pidiendo a los jueces que eliminen las restricciones a las detenciones de inmigrantes, el Departamento de Seguridad Nacional de Trump escribió que la orden judicial inferior interfería con los esfuerzos de los agentes para expulsar a inmigrantes no autorizados.
 “La orden judicial plantea la posibilidad de desacato por cada parada en el distrito, amenazando a los agentes con sanciones si el tribunal no cree que se basaron en factores adicionales para realizar una parada en particular. Bloquea el ejercicio de la autoridad ejecutiva y usurpa las facultades del Presidente, amparadas por el Artículo II, para hacer cumplir nuestras leyes de inmigración”, escribieron los abogados de la administración Trump.
El tribunal de distrito encontró, basándose en una “montaña de evidencia”, que el gobierno realizó detenciones sin sospecha razonable, basándose únicamente en rasgos como la raza o la etnia, hablar español o inglés con acento, la ubicación en la que se encuentra una persona y el tipo de trabajo que realiza una persona.
 El Tribunal de Apelaciones del Noveno Circuito confirmó el fallo del tribunal inferior, criticando a la administración Trump por tergiversar la orden de restricción en su apelación.
 “Si, como sugieren los demandados, no están realizando controles que carecen de sospecha razonable, difícilmente pueden afirmar que se ven perjudicados irreparablemente por una orden judicial destinada a impedir… controles que no están respaldados por una sospecha razonable”, escribió el panel de tres jueces del 9º Circuito.
 Una coalición de agencias de derechos civiles, derechos de los inmigrantes y gobiernos locales, incluida la Unión Estadounidense por las Libertades Civiles y los Trabajadores Agrícolas Unidos, solicitaron la orden, argumentando que las redadas en el área de Los Ángeles han violado los derechos de las personas al permitir que los agentes federales de inmigración detengan a personas que simplemente parecen ser latinas, incluidos ciudadanos estadounidenses.
 “El gobierno federal busca detener a personas únicamente por no ser blancas, hablar español o hablar inglés con acento. Esa idea es un anatema para todo lo que representa Estados Unidos y debe ser rechazada”, escribió un grupo de ciudades del condado de Los Ángeles en un escrito amicus, apoyando las restricciones a los agentes de inmigración. Escribieron que las redadas de este verano habían “sembrado el terror” en sus comunidades.
 A pesar de la orden anterior que prohibía la elaboración de perfiles, los agentes han continuado con una agresiva ofensiva para aplicar la ley en la segunda ciudad más grande del país.
Unos 40 agentes se presentaron en  un Home Depot de Westlake el 28 de agosto, utilizando gas lacrimógeno y perdigones de pimienta para despejar a una multitud antes de detener a ocho personas, confirmó el viernes un funcionario de la Patrulla Fronteriza. Ese es el mismo lugar donde los agentes grabaron previamente un video promocional con música rap en el que aparecían escondidos en una camioneta de alquiler de Penske antes de salir a detener a jornaleros en una redada denominada Operación Caballo de Troya.
 Bajo la dirección del Jefe de Operaciones Generales, Gregory Bovino , la Patrulla Fronteriza ha detenido a jornaleros latinos, invadiendo tiendas Home Depot y lavaderos de autos en la segunda ciudad más grande del país. Bovino se ha comprometido a implementar tácticas similares en ciudades de todo el país.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/062025-US-CBP-LA-Raids-GETTY-CM-02.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-08 13:01:26.297293

The House seat will be up for grabs in next year’s election because Republican U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson is running for governor. 
Gronli filed her Federal Election Commission statement of candidacy Monday morning and will launch her campaign at 1:30 p.m. on Wednesday at the Holiday Inn City Centre in downtown Sioux Falls. Sioux Falls nonprofit executive Billy Mawhiney announced last month he is running for the Democratic nomination as well.

If both stay in the race until next June’s primary, it’ll be the party’s first U.S. House primary race in South Dakota since 2012. The party did not have U.S. House candidates in the 2020 and 2022 elections.
South Dakota Attorney General Marty Jackley has announced his intention to seek the Republican nomination for the seat. Republican state Sen. Casey Crabtree, of Madison, filed his statement of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission this summer.
Gronli set out across South Dakota with other Democrats this spring to hold town hall meetings for South Dakotans concerned about federal policy changes under the Trump administration. 
“As I traveled the state and listened to people, I realized there might be a place for me in this,” Gronli said in an interview with South Dakota Searchlight. “There might be an opportunity to continue to listen to them and bring forward their ideas and voices and be that voice in D.C.”

Gronli is the former vice chair of the South Dakota Democratic Party and former state director for USDA Rural Development under the Biden administration. She oversaw investments in rural housing, broadband, infrastructure and other rural community projects. She is president of Flatlander Strategies, a marketing company.
Concerns about the economy, health care access and President Trump’s tariff policies “devastating” South Dakota farmers drove Gronli’s decision to enter the race. 
“I’m watching our current elected leaders not do what’s best for South Dakota,” Gronli said. “I’ve decided that I need to get in this race and give people another option. We need some folks who have the courage to stand up for South Dakota families.”
Besides Crabtree and Jackley, James Bialota, who describes himself as a small business owner and real estate investor, has said on Facebook that he plans to run as a Republican for the U.S. House.
A Democrat named Scott Schlagel has also filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission to run for the seat.

(Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)West Virginia has launched a new online chat tool, mandated in a Republican bill, that is supposed to improve communication between foster parents, social workers and others involved in a child’s case.
While the project missed its initial July deadline from lawmakers, the state Department of Human Services partially rolled out the system last week and said it will soon be statewide. The project will cost more than $5 million over five years.
“I believe it can be a gamechanger for every aspect of child welfare, and I look forward to the full implementation as quickly as we can,” said Del. Adam Burkhammer, R-Lewis, a sponsor of the bill.
West Virginia’s foster care system has more than 6,000 kids.
Lawmakers have struggled to address widespread problems in West Virginia’s overwhelmed system, and they’ve tried to use legislation to mandate changes from DoHS.
House Bill 4975, signed into law last year, was the brainchild of Burkhammer and Del. Jonathan Pinson, R-Mason, who are both foster parents. 
The pair said – based on their experiences fostering – there were major communication breakdowns between foster parents, Child Protective Services workers, attorneys and others involved in a child’s case. The problem contributed to children lingering in the system without permanency and foster parents closing their homes due to frustration, bill sponsors said. 
The legislation required DoHS to create a centralized communication tool for individuals involved in a child’s case by July 1. 
DoHS pushed the launch to September mainly to secure federal dollars to help pay for the technology. Brandon Lewis, chief of technology and information for DoHS, told lawmakers that the tool – named “COMETP” – partially rolled out last week.
“Right now, we started in Randolph County,” Lewis told the Joint Committee on Children and Families, which met Sunday during September Legislative Interim Meetings in Charleston. 
“You reduce the risk of other issues and problems that can be addressed by one county at a time,” he continued. “We will slowly roll out over the next, I would say two to three months.”
COMET stands for “communication and operations mobile engagement tool.” 
Lewis said the state’s contract with Cardinality.ai, an AI-solutions company for government, would cost $5.4 million for five years. Additionally, the state is paying Optum, which facilitates many online DoHS systems, to help roll out COMET. 
The state’s roughly $300 million contract with Optum has been a source of frustration for some lawmakers after DoHS and the tech company failed to meet the 2020 deadline for creating an online management system for foster care, Medicaid and more. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the project, a DoHS leader said last year. The system, known as PATH, is now operational.
CPS workers and others in Randolph County have begun using the COMET system for communication, Lewis said. State foster care leaders are working on communicating to foster parents and others that the chat tool is now available. 
“I think as we start rolling this out, we will start seeing more and more and more utilization of other tools,” Lewis said. 
DoHS is required, according to the bill, to provide quarterly reports to lawmakers about the communication tool’s use. Lewis said those reports will begin now that the product has launched.",https://westvirginiawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/COMET.jpg,,,2025-09-08 13:01:26.297293

For some, the wait is agonizing","Sophie Bates, Associated Press, Alex Rozier, Illan Ireland, Mississippi Free Press, David A. Lieb, The Associated Press and M.K.

Seconds later, a tornado tore apart Anthony’s home and damaged the truck while lifting it partly in the air. Anthony emerged unhurt. But he had to replace his vehicle with a used truck that became his home while waiting for President Donald Trump to issue a major disaster declaration so that federal money would be freed for individuals reeling from loss. That took weeks. 
“You wake up in the truck and look out the windshield and see nothing. That’s hard. That’s hard to swallow,” Anthony said.

Disaster survivors are having to wait longer to get aid from the federal government, according to a new Associated Press analysis of decades of data. On average, it took less than two weeks for a governor’s request for a presidential disaster declaration to be granted in the 1990s and early 2000s. That rose to about three weeks during the past decade under presidents from both major parties. It’s taking more than a month, on average, during Trump’s current term, the AP found.
The delays mean individuals must wait to receive federal aid for daily living expenses, temporary lodging and home repairs. Delays in disaster declarations also can hamper recovery efforts by local officials uncertain whether they will receive federal reimbursement for cleaning up debris and rebuilding infrastructure. The AP collaborated with Mississippi Today and Mississippi Free Press on the effects of these delays for this report.
“The message that I get in the delay, particularly for the individual assistance, is that the federal government has turned its back on its own people,” said Bob Griffin, dean of the College of Emergency Preparedness, Homeland Security and Cybersecurity at the University at Albany in New York. “It’s a fundamental shift in the position of this country.”


The wait for disaster aid has grown as Trump remakes government
The Federal Emergency Management Agency often consults immediately with communities to coordinate their initial disaster response. But direct payments to individuals, nonprofits and local governments must wait for a major disaster declaration from the president, who first must receive a request from a state, territory or tribe. Major disaster declarations are intended only for the most damaging events that are beyond the resources of states and local governments.
Trump has approved more than two dozen major disaster declarations since taking office in January, with an average wait of almost 34 days after a request. That ranged from a one-day turnaround after July’s deadly flash flooding in Texas to a 67-day wait after a request for aid because of a Michigan ice storm. The average wait is up from a 24-day delay during his first term and is nearly four times as long as the average for former Republican President George H.W. Bush, whose term from 1989-1993 coincided with the implementation of a new federal law setting parameters for disaster determinations. 
The delays have grown over time, regardless of the party in power. Former Democratic President Joe Biden, in his last year in office, averaged 26 days to declare major disasters — longer than any year under former Democratic President Barack Obama.

FEMA did not respond to the AP’s questions about what factors are contributing to the trend.
Others familiar with FEMA noted that its process for assessing and documenting natural disasters has become more complex over time. Disasters have also become more frequent and intense because of climate change, which is mostly caused by the burning of fuels such as gas, coal and oil.
The wait for disaster declarations has spiked as Trump’s administration undertakes an ambitious makeover of the federal government that has shed thousands of workers and reexamined the role of FEMA. A recently published letter from current and former FEMA employees warned the cuts could become debilitating if faced with a large-enough disaster. The letter also lamented that the Trump administration has stopped maintaining or removed long-term planning tools focused on extreme weather and disasters.
Shortly after taking office, Trump floated the idea of “getting rid” of FEMA, asserting: “It’s very bureaucratic, and it’s very slow.”
FEMA’s acting chief suggested more recently that states should shoulder more responsibility for disaster recovery, though FEMA thus far has continued to cover three-fourths of the costs of public assistance to local governments, as required under federal law. FEMA pays the full cost of its individual assistance.
Former FEMA Administrator Pete Gaynor, who served during Trump’s first term, said the delay in issuing major disaster declarations likely is related to a renewed focus on making sure the federal government isn’t paying for things state and local governments could handle.
“I think they’re probably giving those requests more scrutiny,” Gaynor said. “And I think it’s probably the right thing to do, because I think the (disaster) declaration process has become the ‘easy button’ for states.”

In Mississippi, frustration festered during wait for aid
The tornado that struck Anthony’s home in rural Tylertown on March 15 packed winds up to 140 mph. It was part of a powerful system that wrecked homes, businesses and lives across multiple states.
Mississippi’s governor requested a federal disaster declaration on April 1. Trump granted that request 50 days later, on May 21, while approving aid for both individuals and public entities.
On that same day, Trump also approved eight other major disaster declarations for storms, floods or fires in seven other states. In most cases, more than a month had passed since the request and about two months since the date of those disasters.
If a presidential declaration and federal money had come sooner, Anthony said he wouldn’t have needed to spend weeks sleeping in a truck before he could afford to rent the trailer where he is now living. His house was uninsured, Anthony said, and FEMA eventually gave him $30,000. 
In nearby Jayess in Lawrence County, Dana Grimes had insurance but not enough to cover the full value of her damaged home. After the eventual federal declaration, Grimes said FEMA provided about $750 for emergency expenses, but she is now waiting for the agency to determine whether she can receive more.

“We couldn’t figure out why the president took so long to help people in this country,” Grimes said. “I just want to tie up strings and move on. But FEMA — I’m still fooling with FEMA.”
Jonathan Young said he gave up on applying for FEMA aid after the Tylertown tornado killed his 7-year-old son and destroyed their home. The process seemed too difficult, and federal officials wanted paperwork he didn’t have, Young said. He made ends meet by working for those cleaning up from the storm.
“It’s a therapy for me,” Young said, “to pick up the debris that took my son away from me.”
Historically, presidential disaster declarations containing individual assistance have been approved more quickly than those providing assistance only to public entities, according to the AP’s analysis. That remains the case under Trump, though declarations for both types are taking longer.
About half the major disaster declarations approved by Trump this year have included individual assistance.
Some people whose homes are damaged turn to shelters hosted by churches or local nonprofit organizations in the initial chaotic days after a disaster. Others stay with friends or family or go to a hotel, if they can afford it.
But some insist on staying in damaged homes, even if they are unsafe, said Chris Smith, who administered FEMA’s individual assistance division under three presidents from 2015-2022. If homes aren’t repaired properly, mold can grow, compounding the recovery challenges.

That’s why it’s critical for FEMA’s individual assistance to get approved quickly — ideally, within two weeks of a disaster, said Smith, who’s now a disaster consultant for governments and companies.
“You want to keep the people where they are living. You want to ensure those communities are going to continue to be viable and recover,” Smith said. “And the earlier that individual assistance can be delivered … the earlier recovery can start.”
In the periods waiting for declarations, the pressure falls on local officials and volunteers to care for victims and distribute supplies. 
In Walthall County, where Tylertown is, insurance agent Les Lampton remembered watching the weather news as the first tornado missed his house by just an eighth of a mile. Lampton, who moonlights as a volunteer firefighter, navigated the collapsed trees in his yard and jumped into action. About 45 minutes later, the second tornado hit just a mile away.
“It was just chaos from there on out,” Lampton said. 
Walthall County, with a population of about 14,000, hasn’t had a working tornado siren in about 30 years, Lampton said. He added there isn’t a public safe room in the area, although a lot of residents have ones in their home. 
Rural areas with limited resources are hit hard by delays in receiving funds through FEMA’s public assistance program, which, unlike individual assistance, only reimburses local entities after their bills are paid. Long waits can stoke uncertainty and lead cost-conscious local officials to pause or scale-back their recovery efforts.

In Walthall County, officials initially spent about $700,000 cleaning up debris, then suspended the cleanup for more than a month because they couldn’t afford to spend more without assurance they would receive federal reimbursement, said county emergency manager Royce McKee. Meanwhile, rubble from splintered trees and shattered homes remained piled along the roadside, creating unsafe obstacles for motorists and habitat for snakes and rodents.
When it received the federal declaration, Walthall County took out a multimillion-dollar loan to pay contractors to resume the cleanup.
“We’re going to pay interest and pay that money back until FEMA pays us,” said Byran Martin, an elected county supervisor. “We’re hopeful that we’ll get some money by the first of the year, but people are telling us that it could be [longer].”
Lampton, who took after his father when he joined the volunteer firefighters 40 years ago, lauded the support of outside groups such as Cajun Navy, Eight Days of Hope, Samaritan’s Purse and others. That’s not to mention the neighbors who brought their own skid steers and power saws to help clear trees and other debris, he added. 
“That’s the only thing that got us through this storm, neighbors helping neighbors,” Lampton said. “If we waited on the government, we were going to be in bad shape.”

The U.S. Supreme Court lifted limits on immigration sweeps in Southern California, overturning a lower court ruling that prohibited agents from stopping people based on their appearance.


The U.S. Supreme Court today granted the Trump administration’s emergency request to lift a temporary restraining order barring federal immigration officials from conducting “roving patrols” and profiling people based on their appearance in Los Angeles and Southern California.
The case is likely to have an enormous impact, not just for Los Angeles but across the country, several experts told CalMatters. It means immigration agents can legally resume aggressive street sweeps that began in early June in Los Angeles, the epicenter for President Donald Trump’s mass deportation campaign. 
The Supreme Court, by a 6-3 majority, agreed with the Trump administration that federal immigration officers can briefly detain and interrogate individuals about whether they are lawfully in the United States and that they can rely on a “totality of circumstances” standard for reasonable suspicion. That means everything the officer knew and observed at the time of the stop. 
The U.S. Supreme Court took the case through its emergency docket, also known as the shadow docket, is used for cases that are handled speedily with limited briefing and typically no oral argument. The justices relied on briefs from the Trump administration and from California government officials.
Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote an opinion explaining his reasoning in lifting restrictions on Los Angeles immigration sweeps. “Here, those circumstances include: that there is an extremely high number and percentage of illegal immigrants in the Los Angeles area; that those individuals tend to gather in certain locations to seek daily work; that those individuals often work in certain kinds of jobs, such as day labor, landscaping, agriculture, and construction, that do not require paperwork and are therefore especially attractive to illegal immigrants; and that many of those illegally in the Los Angeles area come from Mexico or Central America and do not speak much English,” he wrote. 
“To be clear,” he continued, “ethnicity alone cannot furnish reasonable suspicion; under this Court’s case law regarding immigration stops, however, it can be a ‘relevant factor’ when considered with other salient factors.”
The three justices appointed by Democratic presidents dissented from the majority, stressing that they objected to the court lifting limitations on immigration sweeps without oral argument and through the emergency docket, which the Trump administration used extensively this year.
The Supreme Court has sided with Trump in at least 17 cases in a row now.
“That decision is yet another grave misuse of our emergency docket,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in the dissent.  “We should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job. “ 
Los Angeles and dozens of other Southern California municipalities wrote in an amicus brief supporting the restraining order that, because of the population makeup that “half the population of the Central District” meets the federal government’s criteria for being stopped and questioned about their immigration status. It means officers can rely on little more than a person is located in the parking lot of a Home Depot and speaking Spanish to question someone about their immigration status.  
The ruling means the Border Patrol can resume the aggressive tactics a district federal judge said violated people’s Fourth Amendment constitutional rights against unreasonable search and seizure.
In a brief asking justices to remove restrictions on immigration stops, Trump’s Department of Homeland Security wrote that the lower-court injunction interfered with agents’ efforts to remove unauthorized immigrants. 
“The injunction raises the specter of contempt for every stop in the district, threatening agents with sanctions if the court disbelieves that they relied on additional factors in making any particular stop. It chills the exercise of Executive authority and usurps the President’s Article II powers to enforce our immigration laws,” attorneys for the Trump administration wrote. 
Why courts paused ‘roving patrols’
The district court found, based on a “mountain of evidence,” that the government engaged in a pattern of conducting stops without reasonable suspicion—relying solely on traits like race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or accented English, the location a person is in, and the type of work a person does.
The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals had upheld the lower court’s ruling, chiding the Trump administration for misrepresenting the restraining order in their appeal. 
“If, as the Defendants suggest, they are not conducting stops that lack reasonable suspicion, they can hardly claim to be irreparably harmed by an injunction aimed at preventing … stops not supported by reasonable suspicion,” the three-judge panel from the 9th Circuit wrote.   
A coalition of civil rights, immigrant rights, and local government agencies, including the American Civil Liberties Union and the United Farm Workers, sought the order, arguing the LA-area raids have violated people’s rights by allowing federal immigration agents to stop people who simply appear to be Latino, including U.S. citizens. 
“The federal government is seeking to detain individuals solely because they are not white, speak Spanish or speak accented English. That idea is anathema to everything the United States stands for, and it should be rejected,” a group of cities in Los Angeles County wrote in amicus brief supporting restrictions on immigration agents. They wrote that this summer’s raids had “sown terror” in their communities. 
LA immigration sweeps continued
Despite the previous order barring profiling, agents have continued an aggressive enforcement blitz in the nation’s second-largest city. 
About 40 agents hit a Westlake Home Depot on Aug. 28, using tear gas and pepper pellets to disperse a crowd before detaining eight people, a Border Patrol official confirmed Friday. That’s the same location where agents previously made a hype video set to rap music of themselves hiding in a Penske rental truck before bursting out to detain day laborers in a raid dubbed Operation Trojan Horse.
Under Operation-At-Large Chief Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol has detained Latino daylaborers, swarming Home Depots and carwashes across the nation’s second largest city. Bovino has vowed to bring similar tactics to cities across the country.
Kevin R. Johnson, the director of Aoki Center on Critical Race and Nation Studies at UC Davis School of Law said the federal government’s racial profiling has consequences beyond immigration enforcement. He wrote to CalMatters and also in a paper for the SMU Law Review that “race-based immigration enforcement undermines Latina/o sense of belonging in the national community for generations.” 
“Importantly, the Trump administration’s campaign against people of color goes well beyond immigration law and immigrants. As exemplified by the administration’s war on diversity, equity, and inclusion, the President has sought to eliminate programs that seek to promote the full integration of racial and other minorities into U.S. society,” Johnson wrote.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/062025-US-CBP-LA-Raids-GETTY-CM-02.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-08 13:01:26.297293

“For some, this will complete their healing,” one said at the dedication of a memorial at Burlington’s shuttered St. Joseph’s Orphanage. “For others, there’s still much to do.”

BURLINGTON — Debbie Hazen recalls turning 6 when the nuns who ran the city’s former St. Joseph’s Orphanage locked her in an attic trunk in the early 1960s.
“They told me there were bats and snakes and spiders in there that were going to get me,” she said of the dark place.
Hazen never imagined she would eventually find herself outside the orphanage dedicating a “memorial healing space” for the more than 13,000 children who lived at the Catholic facility from its opening in 1854 to its closing in 1974.
“This has been a long time coming and quite the journey for all of us,” Hazen, now 70, told a crowd of 100 fellow survivors and supporters Friday. “For some, this will complete their healing. For others, there’s still much to do.”
The North Avenue memorial, which features a sculptural arbor and stones etched with the words of former orphanage residents, is the final project in a five-year restorative justice process.
“Your voices have been instrumental in shaping our approach to child protection,” Chris Winters, commissioner of the Vermont Department for Children and Families, told survivors. “This memorial is not just a reminder of the past, but it’s also a symbol of your resilience and of our commitment to a future where every child is safe.”

Former orphanage residents once feared no one would believe their memories of mistreatment, so they didn’t start publicizing their childhood conditions until the 1990s. But authorities didn’t launch an investigation until a 2018 BuzzFeed article exposed the full extent of past “unrelenting physical and psychological abuse.”
By 2020, the review confirmed “abuse did occur … and that many children suffered,” although the accusations were too old to pursue criminal charges. To compensate, local and state leaders initiated a “restorative justice inquiry” to help former residents push responsible parties to adopt measures “to ensure that these harms never happen again.”
Working with social service and legal professionals, former residents lobbied for a 2021 state law that eliminated time limits on filing civil lawsuits alleging childhood physical abuse — a success that won them the Vermont Center for Crime Victim Services’ 2021 Survivor/Activist Award.
But the orphanage’s overseers — the state’s Roman Catholic Diocese, the Sisters of Providence and Vermont Catholic Charities — would not meet with survivors as a group nor consider requests for childhood records or restitution.
As part of the inquiry, participants told their stories through several public projects, including two anthologies, a Vermont Folklife-supported oral history and traveling exhibition, and journalist Christine Kenneally’s 2018 BuzzFeed exposé and 2023 follow-up book, “Ghosts of the Orphanage.”
Inquiry organizers also released a 176-page final report that summed up the restorative justice process as both “helpful and healing” and “difficult and painful.”
The new memorial rose with help from Burlington’s Department of Parks, Recreation & Waterfront and supporters who donated $160,000. The dedication featured current and former  local and state leaders as well as survivors who came from as far away as Florida.
“I would like to acknowledge all the unseen victims who have gone unnoticed,” said Debi Gevry, 62, whose father, struggling to care for her and her two siblings, placed them at the orphanage in the 1960s.
“He did so thinking he was doing what was best for his children,” she said in a speech. “On a mechanic’s wage, he paid for our keep not knowing the suffering we were enduring on a daily basis.”
Gevry, who said she wasn’t hugged until after leaving at age 12, went on to raise her own family.
“I have yet to heal from the traumas hidden deep in my soul,” she said. “I have unknowingly passed on my fears and anxieties to the next generation. This is just a small example of the ripple effect abuse carries.”
Gevry closed by reading a poem she wrote. Chiseled into a memorial stone, it’s punctuated by the refrain, “We will be remembered.”
“I may never be completely whole,” she said, “but I will not be silenced.”

(Photo courtesy campaign)Henrico County Commonwealth’s Attorney Shannon Taylor launched her bid for Congress Monday morning, less than three months after losing the Democratic nomination for Virginia attorney general to Jay Jones. Taylor now joins nine other Democratic candidates hoping to take on longtime Republican incumbent U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman in November for the chance to represent Virginia’s First Congressional District for the next two years. 
With a track record as a hardline prosecutor, Taylor was first elected to serve as Henrico’s commonwealth’s attorney in 2011 and has spent three terms in the role. She has run for statewide office twice — both times in the Democratic primary for attorney general. In 2021, facing Jones and Mark Herring, she withdrew from the race. She chose not to run in order to “focus on the critical issues happening in Henrico from criminal justice reform to addressing longstanding systemic racism in our society,” Taylor said, according to WWBT. 
Herring won the nomination but lost the seat to Jason Miyares (who is now vying for reelection). Taylor’s loss to Jones in this year’s attorney general Democratic primary was a close one, with Jones edging Taylor with 51.5% of the votes to her 48.8%.

Taylor has set her sights on defeating Wittman, who has represented the 1st District since 2012, which spans from parts of Henrico, Hanover and Chesterfield Counties in Central Virginia to the Northern Neck and Middle Peninsula. There are over 471,000 registered voters in the district, according to the Virginia Public Access Project. 
The congressman has faced fierce public scrutiny for his support of the One Big Beautiful Bill and over 150 of constituents called him out in the spring for failing to appear in person at town halls to address his stance supporting the federal measure, which is set to slash billions from Medicaid, and his backing of sweeping immigration reforms that advocates and Democratic lawmakers say circumvents due process and breaks up families. Wittman said at the time he values talking with Virginians and hosts telephone town halls to reach as many as possible at one time, including one in March that he said included over 9,000 people.

“As Henrico’s top prosecutor, I’ve made it my mission to protect and defend Virginia families by locking up violent criminals, taking on fraudsters and scammers, and getting drugs and guns off our streets to keep our community safe,” Taylor said in a statement Monday. “Now I’m taking on a new fight to prosecute the case against Rob Wittman because he has spent nearly 20 years in Washington enriching himself while selling out the very community I’ve fought to protect.”
Taylor is running on a platform of defending working Virginians and keeping communities safe. She has been endorsed by U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., who said Taylor has ensured justice for Henrico citizens “without fear or favor.”
“Since 2012, Shannon has worked to keep the residents of Henrico safe by prosecuting murders, drug dealers, and fraudsters, and standing up for victims and their families,” Kain said. “Now she is running to stand up for hardworking families in Virginia’s 1st District. As a friend of Shannon’s for more than 15 years, I’m proud to endorse her as she runs to serve as an independent leader in Congress for her community.”
A native of Charlottesville, Taylor was previously a prosecutor in Richmond before serving as a special assistant in the U.S. Attorney’s office. She was the first woman elected as Henrico’s commonwealth’s attorney and, according to her campaign office, was “one of the first prosecutors in America to say she would defend the right to abortion care” after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. 
Taylor is the latest Democrat to take aim against Wittman; Salaam Bhatti, Timothy Cywinski, Ericka Kopp, Andrew Lucchetti, Amanda Pohl, James Shea, Sean Sublette, Mel Tull and Lisa Vedernikova Khanna will face Taylor in a primary whose date is yet to be determined. The winner will face off against Wittman in the general election on Nov. 4. Early voting begins in Virginia Sept. 19.

Micah Beckwith on Friday landed himself in hot water with supporters over social media posts about Haitian asylum-seekers.
Beckwith, a pastor at Life Church’s Noblesville campus, met with Haitian pastors on Thursday to talk about “faith and family.”
“Their people have endured earthquakes and violence, and now more than 40,000 are seeking asylum here in Indiana,” he wrote on X. “We spoke about barriers of language and culture while also discussing the power of faith and family.”
“What I saw was not a community asking for a handout, but people determined to work hard, raise their children to become contributors to the great Hoosier state, and assimilate to the American way of life,” he added.
The backlash from fellow conservatives was swift.

X users swarmed to the comment section, accusing Beckwith of trying to bring 40,000 Haitian nationals to Indiana. Some called for his deportation to Haiti.
Conservative news figures from across the country amplified the post.
Beckwith backtracked, at first.
“Ultimately, advocating for firmness does not mean abandoning love,” he wrote in one reply. “I was letting these pastors know that they have a responsibility to care for their own community. It is their job to do that — it is not our job to fund them.”
He got direct.
“I am not advocating for us to have Haitians come to America or Indiana,” Beckwith wrote in another reply. “I am saying that if Haitians come to our state, they must do it legally, learn English, and assimilate to our culture.”

Then, he turned off the comments to his official X account and deleted his original post and replies. Another wave of commenters seethed.
Beckwith’s office didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
Critics flooded comments to his personal X account instead.

“This guy asked to come on my show for well over a year,” conservative talk show host Steve Deace wrote. “We finally booked him as a positive example of Christian conservative leadership to our audience. Had I known he advocated this, I would’ve never done so.”
“I’m not calling for them to come to the US… I’m saying that are already here because of the idiotic policies of the previous administration… which I condemn!” Beckwith replied.
He said the meeting was to implore the pastors to “step up and care for their own people because taxpayer resources are not for them.” He also directed them to encourage self-deportation for any congregants in Indiana illegally.
“I’ve been the most supportive statewide elected official of the Trump immigration policies in the entire state of Indiana and that has not changed,” Beckwith concluded.

(Photo courtesy of League of Women Voters Maine)Maine leaders are pushing back on a federal policy change that will bar nonprofits and other nonpartisan organizations from helping new citizens register to vote immediately upon taking their oath. 
The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is the federal agency responsible for conferring citizenship upon new Americans, updated its policies at the end of August so that only state and local election officials will be allowed to offer voter registration services at the end of naturalization ceremonies. Nongovernmental entities were immediately barred from providing these services as of Aug. 29, the date of the letter outlining the policy change. 
That includes volunteers from the League of Women Voters of Maine who have attended naturalization ceremonies for years to help new citizens register to vote. Before the change, League volunteers had attended every Friday naturalization ceremony in South Portland this year, as well as some in Bangor and Acadia National Park. 
“The policy is unnecessary and only serves to decrease the ability of new citizens to participate in our democracy,” the organization said in a news release Monday.
Naturalization ceremonies are typically public events at which individuals who have been undergoing the process of becoming citizens take their oath of allegiance to officially become U.S. citizens. At that time, the new citizen is allowed to register to vote and participate in elections. 
In the last year, more than 800 new citizens approached the nonpartisan political organization at these ceremonies to either register to vote or learn more about the process. 
The Maine chapter joined the national League of Women Voters in asking the USCIS to revoke the policy, calling it an attempt to keep new citizens from exercising their full rights. 
“We are not only disappointed in the new USCIS policy, we find it an unnecessary interruption of important volunteer work,“ said Jill Ward, president of the League of Women Voters of Maine board. “Volunteers come to the League to do this work to honor and celebrate our shared values around citizen engagement and voter rights. This policy runs directly counter to those values.”
The USCIS said in the letter that the change is being implemented in part because of the administrative burden to ensure that the nongovernmental agencies that provide voter registration services are nonpartisan. 
It goes on to say that the change “in no way impacts new citizens’ access to information and applications to register to vote” because those materials will still be provided by local election officials or USCIS staff. The agency also said online voter registration reduces the need for nongovernmental organizations to help new citizens submit applications. 
Maine offers online voter registration services for people who wish to register to vote in the state for the first time or need or update their information. 
Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said her office is monitoring the decision to block community organizations from registering voters at these events and take on the work that nonprofits have historically done in this realm. 
“Until groups like the League of Women Voters can resume their longstanding tradition of registering new citizens as voters, our office will step in to support the rights of all citizens in Maine,” Bellows wrote in a statement she shared on social media last week.

This story by Clare Shanahan was first published by the Valley News on Sept. 7.
WOODSTOCK — Vermont State Police are investigating the Windsor County Sheriff Department’s finances following an anonymous tip.
The Vermont State Police’s criminal division is involved in the investigation into “a financial matter regarding the sheriff’s office,” spokesperson Adam Silverman confirmed Thursday. The investigation started in mid-August because the division was “asked” to look into it. Silverman declined to provide further details.
As of Friday, Windsor County Sheriff Ryan Palmer said he had not been contacted by Vermont State Police about the investigation but suggested that does not seem to be unusual. He confirmed that he learned about the investigation through media reports.
“I’m not hiding anything. I didn’t do anything wrong. I didn’t do anything illegal. There’s nothing to hide,” Palmer said in a Friday interview.
Palmer confirmed in an Aug. 29 Facebook post that he was aware of the investigation, denied any “wrongdoing or criminal behavior” and wrote that he understands the “serious nature of the claims and the public concern this may cause.”
Palmer also suggested on Facebook that the tip Vermont State Police received may have been politically motivated.
“I would also note that these complaints were submitted anonymously, as we approach the 2026 election year,” Palmer wrote at the end of his message.
When asked about this comment, Palmer said he did not know if the tip was politically motivated but said, “I guess we’ll have to wait and see, but it is coincidental at best.” He described the timing as “curious.”
Palmer, 38, was first elected as Windsor County’s sheriff in 2022.

He ran as a Democrat and campaigned on a platform of change for the department, which had been run for 40 nearly uninterrupted years by former Sheriff Michael Chamberlain, a Republican.
After winning the Democratic primary against Tom Battista, a longtime veteran of the department, Palmer prevailed again in November with 15,629 votes to Chamberlain’s 9,824. It was the first time Chamberlain faced a challenger in nearly 20 years.
Since his election, Palmer has grown the department both in staffing and coverage area and he has not shied away from spending money to do so.
As of the beginning of 2025, Palmer had 22 full-time and nine part-time deputies, more than doubling his 2022 numbers and had increased patrols from nine to 15 towns, including four in Orange County.
The expansion kicked off as soon as Palmer’s term began.

(Valley News / Report For America – Alex Driehaus)
In the first four months of 2023, Palmer spent $219,000 on five new cruisers and another almost $150,000 on other equipment through a combination of reserve funds, loans and grants, the Valley News reported at the time.
“My goal coming into this was to really change the paradigm and to change the way Vermont sheriff departments operate, because I felt there was a huge void in rural law enforcement and that has obviously been very expensive,” Palmer said of the investment.
In two and a half years under Palmer’s leadership, the Windsor County Sheriff’s Department has undergone two audits, both within the first six months of his term, according to reports filed with the Vermont state auditor. Vermont law requires that sheriff departments be audited by an outside accounting firm once every two years.
The first was a transition audit that primarily looked at money handled by Chamberlain, the former sheriff. The second audit concerned finances from Feb. 1 through June 30, 2023.
From Jan. 31 through June 30, 2023, the amount of money included in the Windsor Sheriff’s Department bank account decreased from just over $1 million to about $550,000, according to the reports. At the same time, the value of vehicles and equipment increased from about $70,000 to over $450,000.
The Department is about to kick off another regularly scheduled state-mandated audit, Palmer noted in the Facebook post.
Palmer has signed the paperwork to authorize the regular audit but it has not formally started, he said Friday. The last two audits each took about a month to complete.
For now, Palmer said he is focused on continuing his work as usual.
“If you look at where things were before I took over to now, I think that we’ve done a lot of good and that’s kind of my focus in moving forward.”

(iStock / Getty Images Plus)COLUMBIA — A third person this year has tested positive for measles in South Carolina, according to the Department of Public Health.
Nationwide, more than 1,400 people this year have tested positive for the disease thought eliminated in 2000. Three people, two in Texas and one in New Mexico, have died from measles in the U.S. this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The Upstate resident, who was unvaccinated and had not previously had measles, recently returned from an international trip to a country with a measles outbreak, according to the state health department, which did not name the country.

The Department of Public Health also declined to provide the person’s age, sex or the county where they live because of privacy concerns, according to a news release.
The first case this year, reported in July, also came from an unvaccinated Upstate resident who had recently been out of the country. They infected a second person soon after, who was also unvaccinated, according to the public health department.
One person tested positive for measles in 2024 following an international trip. The state had an outbreak of six cases in 2018, but the last case before that was in 1997.
Measles is highly infectious and can be fatal, especially in children. Often, people with measles will notice a fever, cough and runny nose, followed by a rash that lasts about a week. The disease can cause pneumonia and brain swelling in severe cases, according to the health department.
The measles vaccine is highly effective, according to the health department. Of the people who have tested positive for the disease across the country this year, 92% were unvaccinated, according to the CDC.
Typically, children receive a first dose of the measles vaccine between 12 and 15 months of age and a second between 4 and 6 years.
South Carolina’s rate of vaccination for school-age children has fallen in recent years, from about 96% during the 2020-2021 school year to about 94% in 2024-2025, according to health department data.
The state remained on par with national levels of kindergarteners receiving at least one dose of the vaccine during the 2023-2024 school year, according to the CDC’s most recent available data.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/measles-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-08 12:04:17.544934

The new facility will serve as a hub for the company, consolidating three existing Michigan locations into one state-of-the-art campus, according to a press release from the office of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.
It is designed to increase efficiency and collaboration for the company’s approximately 941 Michigan-based employees and provide an opportunity for co-location with employees from its parent company, Hitachi.
The new headquarters will feature both office space and manufacturing capabilities, the press release indicated.
 A boost for local manufacturing

Zeeland’s selection as the new global headquarters is a major endorsement of the area’s economic strategy, said Mayor Kevin Klynstra. The city was chosen over a location in South Carolina, where JR Automation has an existing facility with space to grow.
“We are very  proud to welcome JR Automation to the city of Zeeland. To have them pick our community is an honor. We have been known to be a business-friendly community for many years, and we have given many tax abatements out to industrial and commercial businesses over the years,” Klynstra said. “We hope to have a long and successful relationship with JR Automation.”
Beyond the direct jobs and investment, the project also has a ripple effect on the local economy, he said. The move will free up existing industrial space in nearby Holland, providing room for other growing companies, Klynstra said.
The company aims to create a “sustainable” building which will include solar panels, native prairie landscaping to promote biodiversity and a goal to have its baseline operations powered entirely by renewable energy, the press release indicated.
Klynstra said the headquarters will be a draw for skilled workers and new business, solidifying Zeeland’s role in the global automation industry.
Amanda Murray, vice president of business solutions for Lakeshore Advantage said the local community will benefit as well.
“This expansion not only highlights our strength in smart manufacturing, but also strengthens the opportunities available for local families and reinforces the Lakeshore as a thriving place to live and work,” she said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-08-102311-1024x630.png,,,2025-09-08 10:56:18.920629

That was the message from Mark P. Gardner, chaplain and volunteer services coordinator at Delaware’s secure juvenile detention facility, during this week’s A Better Discussion hosted by Jane Brady of A Better Delaware. Gardner said the simple act of wearing professional attire is helping residents reduce behavioral issues, build confidence and prepare for a future beyond incarceration.
“We’ve seen how putting on a suit changes the way these young men see themselves,” Gardner said. “One resident told me, ‘I feel like I can talk to the President.’ That kind of confidence can redirect a life.”
Suits as a tool for change
Gardner leads programs such as Mock Trial, where residents argue cases in donated business attire before volunteer jurists, and Monthly Manhood Mondays, where they attend classes in suits, ties and dress shoes instead of state-issued uniforms. Staff report a marked drop in behavioral problems on those days.
“These suits transform the young boys into young men,” Brady said during the discussion. “They make them see themselves differently in the mirror, and that vision carries beyond Ferris.”
But Gardner noted that many residents serve only about six months at Ferris — not long enough to cement lasting change. As recidivism rates climb, he believes something as simple as access to appropriate clothing can ease their transition. “Some of these young men want to take their suits home when they’re released,” he said. “That shows they’re ready to step into a new identity.”
Call for donations
Gardner is urging Delawareans to contribute conservative, professional suits — navy, charcoal, black or brown — along with ties, dress shirts and lace-up shoes. Flashy or novelty clothing is discouraged.
Donations can be arranged by contacting mark.gardener@delaware.gov.
A book on behavior and belief
Gardner, a longtime minister and author, recently published Keep the Change: A Book for Redirecting Behavior in the Lives of Adjudicated Youth. The book builds on his “Behavior Reflects Belief” approach, encouraging young people to align their actions with the values they claim to hold.
“If they can be influenced to do wrong, they can also be influenced to do right,” Gardner said. “A suit may seem small, but it can be the start of that change.”
Brady added that initiatives like Gardner’s reduce the burden on victims, communities and taxpayers. “We don’t prosper when we’re constantly pulling people back from behind the eight ball,” she said. “Programs like this give them the courage to make hard, but right, choices — and that makes Delaware stronger.”

His office criticizes administrative costs and “outside-of-classroom” spending in the report, and recommends diverting that money to boost assistant teacher pay, which averages $22,840 a year in Mississippi. 
While it’s the first time he’s focused on assistant teachers, White, who is weighing a run for Governor, has consistently drawn attention to education spending since he took office in 2018. 
White first drew attention to outside-of-classroom spending in a 2019 report that includes examples such as district office salaries, campus and building maintenance and the production of school informational material. Previous reports from the auditor’s office have similarly encouraged districts to cut spending that doesn’t directly go to the classroom, duplicative or unused equipment and administrative salaries. His predecessor had also criticized Mississippi’s spending on education administration.
Though he has no power over policy or appropriations, White proposed a bill last year that would mandate at least half of the state’s education dollars go toward teacher salaries. White has recently received criticism that some of his reports — including one for which he paid millions to a consultant — are aimed at his gubernatorial aspirations, rather than his job as auditor.
The new report is largely aimed at the Legislature and local school districts, a spokesperson for the auditor said. That’s because state law establishes the minimum salary for assistant teachers, not the Mississippi Department of Education. Districts can add to this base amount.
Advocates and some lawmakers have said for years that teacher assistants often get short shrift even when the Legislature raises pay for teachers.
The Legislature increased the minimum assistant teacher salary from $15,000 a year to $17,000 in 2022, but White is calling on lawmakers to raise the floor again. Raising the state’s average assistant teacher salary to the regional average would mean a $6,000 pay raise — a $67.3 million cost, the report says. 
“Assistant teachers are a vital part of Mississippi classrooms … many Mississippi students will suffer without classroom support from an assistant teacher,” the report reads. “Policymakers can build on Mississippi’s educational momentum by cutting runaway outside-the-classroom spending and reinvesting those dollars directly into classrooms—where they make the biggest difference.”
Assistant teachers in Mississippi are some of the lowest paid professionals in the state, according to data tracked by the Mississippi Department of Employment Security, and their salaries lag behind assistant teachers in almost every other state. Ample research shows that low pay discourages people from becoming teachers and drives them out of the profession. 
Mississippi requires that an assistant teacher be present in every kindergarten, first grade, second grade and third grade classroom. Though their specific duties vary by grade and classroom, they generally help manage students and assist with instruction. 
Mississippi Department of Education data shows that there have been at least 500 vacant assistant teacher positions in the state annually since the 2021-2022 school year. 
The report notes a discrepancy of about $62,000 between average entry-level pay for assistant teachers and entry-level school administrators. 
“I don’t make enough to cover most of my expenses,” said a Cleveland School District assistant teacher, who spoke to Mississippi Today on the condition of anonymity out of fear of losing her job. “I live from check to check.”
She supports three kids on an annual salary of $21,000. Cleveland School District does not offer biweekly pay, so her paychecks have to stretch further. The longtime assistant teacher has left other school districts in the Mississippi Delta because they offered annual salaries of less than $20,000.
Now, she’s working on a master’s degree and studying for the Praxis exam, a test that teachers must pass in order to be certified, hoping to make a livable wage.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/07000623/IMG_5158-scaled.jpg,,,2025-09-08 10:56:18.920629

This week on the Codcast, CommonWealth Beacon reporter Jennifer Smith talks with Rich Davey, who just finished his first year as CEO of Massport. They talk about his long history of ground transportation work, plans to improve air travel, and whether Boston actually could have handled the 2024 Olympics.
The post Blocking and tackling with Massport CEO Rich[...]","EPISODE INFO

HOST: Jennifer Smith
GUEST: Rich Davey, CEO of Massport







FOR A JOB about planes, Massport CEO Rich Davey still spends a lot of time with his eyes on the road. Not as a driver – the Back Bay resident still famously doesn’t have a car – but because the people flowing in and out of Logan Airport are getting stuck in the same traffic jams and navigating the same MBTA system as the rest of the region.  
On The Codcast, CommonWealth Beacon reporter Jennifer Smith talks with Davey about his first year at the helm of Massport, after two years as president of the New York City Transit Authority, part of the sprawling Metropolitan Transportation Authority.  
His move to the MTA in 2022 was a return to active transit management, though for once not in his home state of Massachusetts. That was more of a day-to-day “blocking and tackling” role as the system moved about five million people around its buses and subways every weekday. Now he can operate on a longer timeline, wrestling with traffic to and from the airport, what greener air travel could look like, plus pressures on tourism and travel prompted by the second Trump administration. 
Davey is the only person to serve as MBTA general manager, Massachusetts transportation secretary, and the CEO of Massport. Before leading MassDOT, Davey ran the state’s commuter rail system as general manager of the Massachusetts Bay Commuter Railroad. After leaving the MBTA leadership post in October 2014, Davey went into consulting, still with an expertise in transit, and was tapped to head up the unsuccessful bid for the Boston 2024 Olympics.  
It seems like quite a shift to go from overseeing the busiest transit system in the country to figuring out how to keep grumpy Bostonians sane at the baggage claim, but Davey says the role is a combination of easing customer pain points and broader-scale system improvements.  
Between the Silver Line bus system, navigating the rise of ride-share services like Uber and Lyft, and thinking about water transit through the Massport-controlled Port of Boston, Davey can never be too far removed from the flow of buses, trains, cars, and boats around the region. 
Driving to the airport can be a traffic nightmare, so Logan is working on TSA screenings “remote terminals” at offsite parking areas in places Braintree, Framingham, and Back Bay. After being screened and parking, customers could shuttle directly to the gates rather than wind through security at Logan. Interestingly, the closer a person lives to Logan Airport, he said, the more likely they are to take Uber or Lyft to the airport than public transit. 
“Part of what we need to do is offer services that allow folks to get their time back, but without causing the mass traffic,” Davey said. “I’m actually really worried about Waymo and autonomous vehicles in the future.” The technology is already here, he said, and people are taking self-driving cars to airports in San Francisco and Phoenix. “I do worry that could create massive traffic around Logan airport as well, so part of what we’re doing is working with the T to see if there are other opportunities.” 
On the episode, Smith and Davey discuss how to improve the daily experience of getting to and from Logan Airport (6:00), the climate impacts of air travel (19:45), his past in immigration enforcement (24:00), and whether the city’s system could have handled the strain if the Olympics landed in the Bay State (29:20).

,Mississippi Today,2025-09-08 14:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Mississippi State’s upset of No. 12 Arizona State tops a long day of college football,Rick Cleveland,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/09/08/college-football-recap-mississippi/,"""These weary eyes watched football — all or parts of four games — morning, noon and night Saturday,"" Rick Cleveland writes. ""I have some thoughts.""","These weary eyes watched football — all or parts of four games — morning, noon and night Saturday. I have some thoughts. 

Rick Cleveland
First, this: What does it say about college football when you watch game after game for nearly 12 hours, finally sleep, and your dreams are punctuated by TV timeouts?
It says, I believe, there are too dang many.
Other thoughts:
First up was San Jose State-Texas, one of any number of early season games when the visiting team, playing for a huge paycheck, is overmatched. San Jose State surely was. The attraction, of course, was Arch Manning, the young Texas quarterback with so many Mississippi connections. 
Young Manning was coming off his first meaningful college start — at defending national champion Ohio State, no less. That’s an incredibly daunting assignment for anyone, no matter pedigree and ability. Manning’s performance against the Buckeyes was uneven, as his stats showed: 17 of 30 passing for 170 yards, a touchdown and an interception, plus 38 yards rushing on 10 keeps. He showed both promise and at times uncertainty.
Fast forward to Saturday: After a slow start, Manning completed 19 of 30 for 295 yards and four touchdowns with one interception. At one point in the first half, he threw four touchdowns in slightly over five minutes of playing time. He ran for another touchdown, looking forever like his grandfather when he tucked the ball and took off. He missed some throws but hit far more than he missed.
Bottom line: He will only get better and better, as any young quarterback does with experience.

I didn’t even have to switch channels for the next leg of my football marathon: Ole Miss-Kentucky, a hard-fought 30-23 Ole Miss road victory.
Several takeaways:
• Similarly to Manning, Rebels quarterback Austin Simmons showed both promise and plenty room for improvement. Two interceptions helped dig the Rebels into a 10-0 hole on the road. But Simmons, displaying much poise for a 19-year-old, then helped them dig out of it, finishing 13 for 24 with the two interceptions and no touchdowns. Expect him to steadily improve.
• Meanwhile, running back Kewan Lacy, a sophomore transfer from Missouri, looks like the real deal. The Dallas native showed vision, speed and power in running for 138 yards and a touchdown on 28 carries.
• My biggest concern for Ole Miss was who was going to replace defensive tackle Walter Nolan, the NFL first rounder who was such a disruptive presence last season. Zxavian Harris, the Canton native and former Germantown standout, appears to be that dude. He was everywhere for the Rebels Saturday, a 6-foot-8, 330-pound force. His fourth quarter sack was one of the game’s biggest plays.
• Kudos also to backup quarterback Trinidad Chambliss, a transfer from Division II Ferris State, who filled in admirably and then some after Simmons suffered a fourth quarter injury. Playing before more partisans than he probably ever did in a full season at Ferris State, Chambliss led the Rebs to a game-clinching field goal on fourth quarter drive. His performance in the clutch was huge.
Don’t know what it is about Kentucky, but the Wildcats seem to play their best against Ole Miss. Bottom line: The 2025 Rebels did what the ’24 Rebels couldn’t, which is survive Kentucky.

Two TVs were necessitated to watch the second half of Ole Miss-Kentucky and the first half of Jackson State-Southern Miss, just the fourth time in history the two Mississippi schools have played one another. The Golden Eagles’ final winning margin, 38-20, is no indication whatsoever of how competitive this game was. Jackson State competed on even terms for most of the contest. T.C. Taylor’s Tigers appear a team that will once again dominate the SWAC and would be competitive in the Sun Belt. 
And Southern Miss, for the second straight week, appeared much improved in its first season under Charles Huff. Transfers from Huff’s Sun Belt champion Marshall team of a year ago were largely responsible for USM’s hard-won victory. Most notably, quarterback Braylon Braxton gives the Eagles a winner at the most important position on the field. Braxton threw for 214 yards and three touchdowns with no interceptions, and he ran for 20 more yards. He will give the Eagles a fighting chance to win every remaining game on the schedule. On the flip side, USM could lose to any team left on its schedule. 
Jackson State battled the Eagles evenly on both sides of the line of scrimmage. Southern Miss was plus-two in turnovers — and blocked a kick for a touchdown — and that was the difference.
A crowd of more than 32,000, fairly evenly divided, attended a well-played game that, clearly, should happen more often.

We save the best for last: Mississippi State’s scintillating 24-20 victory over No. 12 Arizona State. We must wait until later in the season to know whether Arizona State, a playoff team a year ago, is as good as projected. This we do know: Jeff Lebby’s Bulldogs are a whole lot better than almost everyone thought they would be. State, winner of just two games in 2024, will be favored to be 4-0 headed into a Sept. 27 home game with Tennessee.
The Bulldogs had looked much improved a week earlier in a 34-17 road victory over Southern Miss. They proved it a week later, taking a 17-0 lead against the Sun Devils and then fighting off a furious second half rally.
Lebby dipped heavily into the transfer portal and spent millions of NIL dollars to fix what was clearly broken. All indications are that he spent wisely. It helps immensely that Blake Shapen, a terrific, resourceful player, is back and healthy at quarterback. State would not have been 2-10 last year if Shapen had remained fit throughout.
The Bulldogs benefitted immensely from a raucous, cowbell-clanging crowd that had Arizona State unnerved from the get-go. 
“Awesome environment,” ASU coach Kenny Dillingham said afterward. “They were loud, really loud, but that’s what college football is supposed to be.”
Dillingham’s team had dominated the second half, taking its first and only lead, 20-17, on a chip shot field goal with 98 seconds remaining.
State needed only 68 of those ticks to respond on Shapen’s 58-yard touchdown strike to Brenen Thompson. Given the situation, it seemed hard to comprehend the Devils did not have a safety playing deep in the middle of the field on the third and nine play. But they didn’t, and they paid dearly.
Thus, it seemed the Bulldogs and their 50,000-plus fans experienced an emotional release of the frustrations of the death of a coaching legend and two long seasons of subsequent futility in a goalpost-dismantling postgame celebration. 
Yes, and a long, but eventful day in Mississippi football was done.

It wasn’t on TV, but Delta State’s 41-9 victory over North Greenville (S.C.) University deserves mention. That’s because, with the victory, Delta State coach Todd Cooley becomes the winningest coach in DSU’s 95 years of football. Cooley, the 19th coach in DSU history, has won 77 games and lost 46 as coach of the Statesmen. He passes the late Horace McCool, for whom the DSU football stadium is named, who was 76-58 over 13 seasons.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/07204844/AP25250127140308.jpg,,,2025-09-08 10:56:18.920629

About two dozen firefighters trained in wilderness strategies are scouting the steep country for natural barriers.
The post Wilderness crews work western Wyoming’s Dollar Lake Fire as it approaches Squaretop appeared first on WyoFile .","About two dozen wilderness firefighters are shuttling regularly across lower Green River Lake to help corral the Dollar Lake Fire as it burns through steep country toward Squaretop Mountain.
Two teams specializing in wilderness fire strategy assembled Sunday to boat and hike into the popular recreation area on the Bridger-Teton National Forest. Their deployment marks a new front on the blaze that’s covered 19,087 acres since it was discovered Aug. 21 along a dirt road heavily used for car and van camping.
Firefighters have not determined the cause of the blaze, according to the Forest Service.
“Extracting folks out of there, if something were to happen, would be extremely difficult.” Karsten Milek
Incident Commander Richard Hayner and his Wyoming Team 2 are wary about the rugged wilderness country and how difficult it would be to evacuate an injured firefighter, Karsten Milek, a BLM employee on the team said.
“It’s just a really tough, challenging area,” Milek said, “and medically extracting folks out of there, if something were to happen, would be extremely difficult.”
From the trailhead at the outlet of lower Green River Lake, the fire has burned about six miles to the south along the western side of the valley leading to Squaretop. The area, closed by the Forest Service because of the blaze, is heavily used by hikers, paddlers, hunters, climbers and trail riders.
The closure, which Forest Supervisor Chad Hudson expanded on Thursday, includes the Highline Trail portion of the Continental Divide Trail between the Clark Creek Trail and Union Pass Road. Altogether, 485 firefighters are working on the Dollar Lake Fire, which was 32% contained Sunday morning.
Near the fire’s point of origin at Dollar Lake, officials have relaxed evacuation notices for the Kendall community and are shoring up protection there and at other developed sites.
Wilderness specialists
The Wilderness squads, known as the Idaho Central and King’s Peak fire modules, enlist up to a dozen firefighters trained to assess and fight in rugged, remote areas. They are ensconced at a spike camp at the Green River Lakes Campground.
“They do a lot of the input for fire progression and the studies of terrain and the topography and how fire can move within those challenging areas,” said Milek, the team’s planning operations section chief who works with the BLM’s High Plains District in Wyoming. The crews can fight fire like any other hand crew, “but they do specialize on kind of the scientific end,” he said.
Rocky ground, cliffs, avalanche paths, landslides and talus slopes may provide fire breaks on the path toward Squaretop. The Squaretop front is in the Forest’s roadless Bridger Wilderness at the north end of the Wind River Range, where motors, wheels, chainsaws and other mechanized tools are prohibited.

The wilderness crews are looking for places they could “tie those natural barriers in together with the least exposure to firefighters,” Milek said. “There is also quite a bit of water in the bottom of the drainages that are also going to be natural barriers,” he said.
The crews have not asked for permission to use chainsaws, he said.
“The actions that we’re taking are based on firefighter safety and the highest probability of success with the really rugged terrain,” Milek said. “We have to take [rescue] into consideration and who we can put in and what kind of risk we’re exposing them to.”
Stan Decker Cannon said Sunday he is grateful firefighters saved what’s left of his family’s ranch at the outlet of Green River Lakes. The Forest Service now owns the historic house that was built in the 1950s.
His grandfather, Stan Decker, first saw Squaretop 100 years ago on a hunting trip with Harold Fabian. Fabian was John D. Rockefeller’s representative in the secret purchase of Jackson Hole land that would become part of Grand Teton National Park.
Decker bought what became the GP Bar Ranch (GP for Gannett Peak) during the Great Depression and turned it into a small, exclusive retreat for well-heeled international notables. A lake high above the ranch and now almost surrounded by fire was named Valaite (Va-late) after Stan Cannon’s grandmother.

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Jennifer-Ruth Green has stepped down as Indiana’s Secretary of Public Safety, Gov. Mike Braun announced Saturday, marking the first major shakeup in his cabinet since taking office.
Braun said Indiana State Police Superintendent Anthony Scott will take on an expanded role as the new secretary of public safety.
“I am pleased to announce that Anthony Scott, Superintendent of the Indiana State Police, has accepted the role of Secretary of Public Safety,” Braun said in a statement posted on X. “He will continue his strong and effective leadership of the Indiana State Police as Superintendent. Hoosiers will be safe with Anthony and the State Police setting the tone for all state government public safety agencies.”
The move came less than a year after Green joined Braun’s cabinet — and opened the door for a second congressional bid.
“She was a part of a transformative time in Indiana’s history and we wish her the best of luck on her next endeavor,” he said. The governor added that he would announce “additional personnel updates and efficiencies in the Office of Public Safety at the beginning of the week.”
On Sunday, Green posted her own statement on X.
“Many thanks to Governor Braun for the honor of serving as Indiana’s inaugural Secretary of Public Safety. I’m honored to have worked alongside so many great leaders around the state,” she said. “Secretary Scott will do an amazing job in this position, and I look forward to watching his successes. I’m off to military duty — always a privilege to wear the uniform, and I’m excited for the future.”
The military service Green referenced is not a deployment but routine National Guard duty, expected to last only a week or two.

Neither Green nor the governor’s office provided further details about her future plans, however.
Even so, Green has been a rising figure in state Republican politics since her 2022 run for U.S. Congress in Indiana’s 1st District, where she mounted a competitive challenge to Democratic Rep. Frank Mrvan. 
Despite losing that race, Green came within 5 percentage points in a traditionally Democratic stronghold.
Tim Edson, who served as Green’s consultant on her 2022 congressional race, told the Indiana Capital Chronicle that Green “is seriously weighing another run for Congress in northwest Indiana and Republican leaders in Indiana and nationally are encouraging her to enter the race.”
Republicans are currently weighing mid-cycle redistricting, aiming to grow the number of GOP-held seats in Congress. The 1st District, along with Marion County’s 7th District, are both held by Democrats.
Green, a combat veteran and cybersecurity expert, had been appointed to the post in December as part of Braun’s incoming administration. At the time, Braun said her “military and cybersecurity background made her uniquely qualified to lead Indiana’s public safety agencies.”
Green previously commanded the 122nd Cyber Operations Flight in Fort Wayne and deployed to Baghdad with the Multinational Security Transition Command-Iraq. A U.S. Air Force Academy graduate, she is an FAA-certified pilot and a former Air Force Special Agent. She also served as Deputy Commander of the 11th Operations Group at Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling in Washington, D.C.
Upon being named secretary, Green pledged to “bring a strategic, comprehensive approach to public safety that protects Hoosier families and supports our first responders.”
Scott, who has led the Indiana State Police since earlier this year, will now oversee the state’s entire public safety apparatus while remaining in charge of the department.

Nearly 100 special interest groups spent more than $820,000 last year to send California legislators to far-off places such as Hawaii, the United Kingdom, Vietnam and Israel, writes CalMatters’ Jeremia Kimelman. 
About three-quarters of the Legislature, or 92 Democratic and Republican lawmakers, were recipients of free trips, according to financial disclosure reports. Similar to years past, in 2022 and 2023 specifically, the largest sponsor of travel last year was the California Foundation on the Environment and the Economy. 
The nonprofit paid nearly $260,000 to take more than 40 lawmakers on domestic and international trips. The foundation is an unusual umbrella group that includes corporations, oil companies, environmental groups and others. Its international trips, known as “study tours,” allow representatives from these special interest groups to mingle with lawmakers. 
In March, a handful of legislators attended a trip to the U.K. focused on climate change, while another trip in November explored electric vehicles and high-speed rail systems in Taiwan and Vietnam.
The second-largest sponsor of trips was the Independent Voter Project. Focusing on voter education of public policy issues, the organization spent more than $100,000 on two trips for lawmakers: An annual trip to Maui attended by 17 legislators, and another to Mexico with six lawmakers called the “Make it with Mexico Cross Border Conference.”
The Jewish Community Relations Council and the Jewish Federation of Los Angeles paid nearly $82,000 in total for a trip to Israel last February. Seven Democratic lawmakers were in attendance, including the two co-chairpeople of the Legislative Jewish Caucus.
Sen. Scott Wiener, one of the co-chairs, said he went on the trip because it was “important to see with my own eyes the horrors of the October 7th terror attack.” The San Francisco Democrat added that he sometimes thinks the Israeli Prime Minister and his administration are Iranian assets because “they’re creating more danger for Israel, in addition to the horrors in Gaza.”

Rural hospital braces for closure as feds affirm decision

A reinterpretation of a federal rule has stripped a rural hospital in Glenn County of its “critical access” designation, leading to its likely closure in October, reports CalMatters’ Ana B. Ibarra.
For more than two decades, Glenn Medical Center has been considered a critical access hospital, which is a status for hospitals that are located at least 35 miles from the next closest hospital when traveling by main roads. 
This classification has allowed the center to receive increased federal reimbursement. But in April, the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services revoked the center of this status, saying that it is only 32 miles away from the next closest hospital.
For months Glenn Medical Center has been making its case to the federal health agency to reverse its decision, arguing that the route most people take measures 35.7 miles. But the agency has since remained firm.
Without critical access status, the hospital, about 90 minutes north of Sacramento, will be left with a budget gap it cannot fill. Its closure means Glenn County will lose its only hospital, 150 health workers will be out of a job, and local residents and ambulances will have to travel at least 40 minutes for emergency care.

Norwalk repeals homeless shelter ban

The city of Norwalk in L.A. County is reversing its ban on homeless shelters following a legal settlement it reached Friday with Gov. Gavin Newsom’s administration, writes CalMatters’ Marisa Kendall.
Last fall, the Southern California city temporarily banned emergency shelters and supportive housing, arguing that shelters and homeless housing could have “detrimental effects” on the community. Calling Norwalk’s actions at the time “immoral,” Newsom and the California Attorney General sued the city in November.
A judge in L.A. Superior Court still must approve the settlement, and if the deal goes through, Norwalk will also be required to put $250,000 toward developing new affordable housing in the city.

Speaking of housing development: An influential California construction union has agreed to drop its opposition to a contested housing bill, after striking a deal with the bill’s author, Sen. Wiener. 
The bill would make it easier to build taller and denser housing near major transit stations (a priority for Wiener), and would now include a provision that would require some housing projects that make use of the bill to hire union workers. Read more from CalMatters’ Ben Christopher.

California GOP split on centering him in redistricting campaign,Alexei Koseff,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/09/california-gop-proposition-50-campaign/,Gov. Gavin Newsom wants the campaign for Proposition 50 to be a battle between him and President Donald Trump. Republicans say they need to win over voters another way.,"In summary
Gov. Gavin Newsom wants the campaign for Proposition 50 to be a battle between him and President Donald Trump. Republicans say they need to win over voters another way. 


Since he first floated the idea on a podcast this summer, Gov. Gavin Newsom has been the face of a plan to redraw California’s congressional lines to favor Democrats.
Now, as the state hurtles toward a Nov. 4 special election in which voters will decide whether to adopt a new gerrymandered map, opponents are grappling with how much to center Newsom in their campaign to defeat the proposal.
At the California Republican Party convention in Garden Grove this past weekend — which aimed to mobilize conservatives against Newsom’s measure, known as Proposition 50 — the governor was a curiously negligible presence.
In strategy sessions and trainings, GOP leaders largely looked beyond Newsom, whose slick style, celebrity stature and unabashedly liberal politics have for years offered California Republicans a delicious foil. Even the merchandise tables were missing their usual fare depicting the governor as a dictator with a Hitler mustache.
“I don’t think this is about Gavin Newsom. This is what he wants to do, but this is about Californians,” Corrin Rankin, the party chair, told reporters. She said the party will run a get-out-the-vote operation educating Republicans about how the new map would effectively take away their right to choose who represents them.
“We’re going to make sure that fine print is in bold letters and people see what exactly they’re voting for and that they’re not fooled again by the Democratic Party,” Rankin said.
Make it about the map
During a presentation Saturday afternoon about legal challenges to the redistricting gambit, Orange County Republican Party Chair Will O’Neill told attendees their most effective talking point to defeat Proposition 50 is to simply show voters the new map.
Newsom’s plan would toss out congressional districts drawn by an independent citizen commission in 2021 and adopt lines that flip the partisan lean of five Republican-held seats while shoring up the Democratic registration advantage in five more swing districts. The GOP could be left with as few as four of California’s 52 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.

O’Neill told delegates to find the most “absurd” changes in their communities and post them on social media. He highlighted a proposed district around Lake Tahoe that’s been compared to an elephant head, because of a trunk-shaped swath that dips into the heavily Democratic suburbs of Sacramento, and a line drawn down the middle of a residential street in Mission Viejo, splitting houses on either side into different seats.
To win, O’Neill said in an interview, Republicans have to broaden the election to be about the detrimental impacts of Proposition 50 and reach the vast majority of Californians who are not living in hyperpartisan online environments. Only 25% of voters in the state are registered Republican, compared to 45% who are registered Democratic and 22% who have no party preference.
“Whether the person likes Donald Trump or Gavin Newsom isn’t really the issue,” O’Neill said. “If this is a straight Republican vs. Democrat election, we lose.”
There’s no escaping Newsom
For many voters, Proposition 50 will be a choice between Newsom and Trump. That’s exactly how Newsom himself has framed it.
The governor began talking about redistricting in July, after Trump pressured Texas Republicans to call a special session to redraw the state’s congressional map and bolster the GOP’s narrow control of the House. The new lines in Texas will likely flip five Democratic seats to Republicans.
Newsom has argued that California’s retaliation was necessary to save democracy — preserving Democrats’ chances of winning back the House in the 2026 midterms and preventing Trump from dragging the United States into authoritarianism.
The president, who remains deeply unpopular in California, is everywhere in Newsom’s campaign for Proposition 50, which he has dubbed the “Election Rigging Response Act.” It echoes the governor’s successful strategy for defeating a recall attempt in 2021.
But Newsom is everywhere as well. He stars prominently in one of the first ads for the campaign, which features footage from a rally he held in Los Angeles last month, where he urges voters to “stand up for our democracy.”
And some opponents are putting Newsom at the forefront of their pitch to voters.

Former California GOP Chair Jessica Millan Patterson is leading one of the campaigns against the measure, which has taken the name No On 50 – Stop Newsom’s Power Grab. She said in an interview that Newsom “turns out Republicans,” who are frustrated by their belief that he has treated his governorship like merely a stepping stone to the White House.
It makes Newsom a potent symbol for what Patterson called “the corruption and those backroom deals when Sacramento politicians have that type of power” to draw their own districts, which in this case would leave vast swaths of conservative Californians without representation in Washington, D.C. She slammed the governor for wearing gerrymandering “like a badge of honor.”
“It’s a sense of justice. I think people get really fired up about it,” Patterson said. “We’re going to make sure the rest of the country sees that even Californians aren’t falling for his lame vanity project here.”
A split campaign strategy
Around the convention, Assemblymember David Tangipa was the rare voice making Proposition 50 about Newsom. He urged attendees to ask everyone they know one question: Does Gavin Newsom deserve more power?
Tangipa, a Fresno Republican, said he expected that question to carry weight even in heavily Democratic California, because enough people have woken up to the problems created by the state’s liberal policies. Voters, he noted, overwhelmingly approved a tough-on-crime measure last year that Newsom fiercely opposed.
“He’s not running a redistricting campaign. He’s running an anti-Trump campaign,” Tangipa said. “They love that we want to get into facts and data and everything else and they’re getting into emotion.”
Not everyone is so convinced. Olivia Valentine, president of the Hawthorne Lawndale Gardena Republican Assembly, was in search of door signs and other materials she could use to canvass against Proposition 50. She said she would refrain from bashing Newsom because she didn’t want voters to think she was a “partisan hack.”
“I don’t want that response. I want them to understand why it’s going to be bad for everybody,” Valentine said. “Everyone should be concerned that their vote is being taken away. That’s scary.”

The conundrum over how much to involve Newsom — who Republicans seem uniformly convinced is using the redistricting fight to boost his prospects in an expected 2028 presidential run — is visible everywhere in the campaign.
Charles Munger, Jr., a longtime California GOP megadonor who poured millions into the ballot measure that created the independent redistricting commission, is running his own operation aimed at liberal-leaning voters. The ads have a good government message about the inherent corruption of politicians drawing their own districts, eschewing mention of Newsom and Trump altogether.
Republicans also hope that former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, the party’s last statewide officeholder and another champion of the commission, will rally independents against Proposition 50. Schwarzenegger has spoken out against the measure, posting himself online in a “terminate gerrymandering” T-shirt, but he has not announced a formal role  in the campaign. 
The motivating factor: fairness
On Saturday morning, California GOP delegates from the north state, a deeply conservative area that would be chopped up and redistributed into Democratic-leaning districts under the new congressional map, packed into a small hotel ballroom.
Most are currently represented by Rep. Doug LaMalfa, a Chico Republican, whose chief of staff, Mark Spannagel, visited the session to discuss the bifurcated strategy for defeating Proposition 50.
“What motivates our center-right is not the mealy-mouthed stuff that’s going to motivate our friends on the left,” he said. “So you need to speak to them differently and you need to motivate them in a different way.”
Then Johanna Lassaga, chair of the Yuba County Republican Central Committee, stepped to the front to show off a campaign sign she had made: black and yellow, featuring simple language (“No on 50: Defend Fair Elections”) with no mention of Newsom.

She had thousands available for delegates to buy and distribute around their communities. She asked if anyone had property along the highway where they would be willing to hang banners that could be seen by drivers — even liberals who might be drawn to the intentionally nonpartisan message.
In an interview, Lassaga said she is deeply worried about losing a member of Congress who understands her rural community. Her family farms rice and raises cattle, and she doesn’t think a Democratic representative from a more urban area would fight for them to get water.
But Lassaga said she is trying to lift people up by focusing on what they can do to win. She is trusting in the “power of seven” — encouraging everyone to tell seven people they know to vote against Proposition 50 and then have them pass on the word to seven more people. She recently talked to the salespeople at the dealership where her husband bought a new car.
“We can’t sit and wallow in our self-pity,” she said. “The whole thing is a multilevel marketing scheme with no product.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/090625-CA-GOP-OC-JAH-CM-12.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-08 08:56:28.880184

Betty Limon is a registered nurse in the Los Angeles area and a Cerritos College student success coach.


The road to becoming a nurse in California has been paved with roadblocks, sharp turns and bottlenecks. Where that education is offered has a lot to do with it.
As someone who has lived every long mile and continued to drive forward, I believe the solution lies in expanding the ability for California’s community colleges to offer bachelor of science degrees in nursing. 
Community colleges are where many nurses start. They should be where we have the chance to finish as we shift into our careers.
Assembly Bill 1400, if passed, would enable some of California’s community colleges to offer bachelor’s degrees in nursing programs. Students could pursue their education in their communities, at a cost they could afford. 
Before I earned my nursing license, I worked 15 years as a unit secretary in a busy hospital emergency department. I dreamed of becoming one of the nurses I watched delivering care.
I needed a program that was affordable, close to home and flexible enough so I could keep earning a living while studying. I chose Cerritos College and pursued an associate’s degree in nursing, since that program is known for rigorous training and a high success rate — including my cohort, who all passed the licensing exam.
Despite my dedication and on-the-job experience, I knew I wouldn’t qualify for the nursing position I sought without a bachelor’s degree. But I faced a frustrating reality: I had to leave Cerritos College and take on the expense of a four-year university.
I completed my bachelor’s at National University, which was a great opportunity, but it came with a high price tag and student loans. I managed the loans and the commute, but for many Californians who already work or have a family, a bachelor’s program at a community college would be life-changing.
AB 1400 is ultimately about equitable access and building a health care workforce that reflects California’s diverse communities. And it opens doors to health care careers that are desperately needed. Nearly 60% of California’s population lives in an area with a nursing shortage. To meet California’s projected need of 65,000 more full-time nurses by 2037, we need more than one solution. 
Today I work as an emergency room nurse for the trauma center where I started my career. I also pay it forward as a success coach for nursing students at Cerritos College. 
I’ve mentored many students who, like me, are the first in their families to enter a health care profession. I see their passion, their drive and, unfortunately, their fear of the next step. The tuition cost of a bachelor’s nursing program is tens of thousands of dollars, putting it out of reach for many.
We need to meet students where they are by adapting to their work, family and financial situations.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/100923_USF-Nursing-Program_AA_CM_09.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-08 08:56:28.880184

A new bill would give officials more tools to identify and combat sexual abuse and educate students to better identify the most common signs of grooming behavior.


A beloved teacher arrested for soliciting a minor. A coach convicted of sexual abuse. A school district hit with a multi-million-dollar jury verdict for failing to protect students. 
The steady drumbeat of stories in recent years about educator sexual abuse in K-12 school districts across California shows the scope of misconduct is much wider than previously known. Yet the stories only hint at how common sexual harassment and grooming behavior has become in schools, with the best available data from the U.S. Education Department suggesting that 1 in 10 children is targeted for grooming at some point in their K-12 education.  
A new bill, which is poised to pass the Legislature in the coming days, would give local and state officials more tools to identify and combat sexual abuse, and educate students to better identify the most common signs of grooming behavior. Senate Bill 848, or “Safe Learning Environments Act,” was authored by Sen. Sasha Renée Pérez, a Democrat from Alhambra, in response to an investigative report in Business Insider, The Predators’ Playground. The 2023 story documented decades of sexual misconduct involving nearly two dozen different educators, ranging from lewd remarks about students’ bodies during class to statutory rape, at a single California school, Rosemead High, which is in Pérez’s district. 
Since the article was published, at least five civil lawsuits have been filed by former Rosemead students, while the state attorney general’s Bureau of Children’s Justice opened a rare investigation into the handling of educator sexual misconduct claims, which is ongoing.
“California lacks a comprehensive standardized approach to preventing abuse in K-12 schools,”  Pérez told fellow lawmakers in urging their support. “Several high profile cases continue to highlight systemic failures and underscore an urgent need for stronger preventative measures to protect children.” 
In an interview with CalMatters, Pérez said she could personally relate to the Rosemead story. When she was in high school, a male staffer some 20 years her senior took an interest in her, asking her questions about sex and boys her age. Then one day, when she returned to campus soon after graduating, he stopped her to ask if she’d turned 18 and if he could take her to dinner. That’s when, Pérez said, it dawned on her that he’d been grooming her for a sexual relationship.

“I didn’t tell my parents or anything, but I talked about it with my friends,” she recalled. “And I remember talking about it, even at 17. That’s when my friends started sharing their own stories.” 
Law would mandate a database of employee misconduct
If it becomes law, Pérez’s bill would create a database of employee misconduct that district administrators must use to background prospective job candidates, require school district officials to report and track “egregious” instances of employee misconduct, mandate training for both educators and students on how to combat and recognize the signs of grooming, and require school districts to implement new written policies defining professional boundaries. It would also apply stricter prior employment check requirements for non-teachers, such as coaches, janitors and bus drivers, update the legal definition of “grooming” to include electronic communications and extend mandated reporter requirements to all employees. 
Much of the policy changes in the bill are drawn from a January report produced by the state-funded Fiscal Crisis & Management Assistance Team. The report studied the financial impact of a wave of lawsuits made possible through a landmark 2019 law that temporarily dropped the statute of limitations for victims of childhood sexual abuse to file civil claims against school districts for failing to protect them. Many of the resulting jury verdicts and settlements have been in the tens of millions of dollars, with some much higher.
As CalMatters previously reported, insurance premiums have skyrocketed for school districts, pushing some to the brink of financial insolvency. Estimates for the total value of claims statewide are around $3 billion, with many cases ongoing.
Pérez said this grim reality played a key role in her decision to draft the bill. “There are now dollars and cents being assigned to these cases,” she said. “It’s really opened up this conversation about what can we do to better prevent this abuse from happening.”
Billie-Jo Grant, a professor at Cal Poly Pomona and a leading researcher in educator sexual misconduct, said the majority of grooming cases in schools go unreported. In many cases, a student is ashamed or feels complicit in the behavior, Grant said, while employees routinely fail to report suspicious behavior for fear of tarnishing a colleague’s reputation.
Because of a lack of federal data, Grant has tracked teacher arrests using published news clips, which show that more than 3,000 educators nationwide have been arrested since 2017 following allegations of sexual misconduct involving students. California’s Commission on Teacher Credentialing, meanwhile, has opened more than 1,300 investigations of teacher sexual misconduct over the same time period – a figure that does not include cases which are never referred to the state by school district officials. 
Grant, who frequently serves as an expert witness in criminal sexual abuse cases, described  Pérez’s bill as a great start toward creating more complete data on the frequency of abuse. She stressed, however, that relying on school officials to determine whether misconduct allegations are “substantiated” will lead to underreporting.
“I think what’s left out is all of the times where they simply don’t do an investigation, look at a complaint at face value, and ask the teacher if they’d resign. And that’s the end of the story,” Grant said. “The problem is there is no accountability for school administrators. Our system relies on them doing thorough investigations.” 
Law would mandate a database of employee misconduct
A primary element of Pérez’s bill addresses “pass the trash,” a well-documented process in which teachers accused of sexual misconduct quietly resign, only to be hired elsewhere and re-offend. Research funded by the U.S. Department of Justice shows that an educator will on average pass through three different school districts before they are ultimately stopped. Many of these teachers are able to be rehired because of confidential separation agreements, in which school officials agree to not disclose allegations of misconduct to would-be employers in exchange for the educator’s resignation.
That’s what happened earlier this year with David Pitts, a former Rosemead High choir teacher who was placed on administrative leave at a nearby school after he was named in Business Insider’s reporting. A school district investigation of Pitts’ behavior nearly led to an administrative hearing at the state level — a final step that most cases never reach because the teacher has quietly resigned — before Pitts settled. Under the terms of his settlement agreement, Pitts will remain on the payroll until 2026. District officials agreed that if they receive any reference check from a potential employer, they would respond only by “providing Employee’s dates of employment and assignments, and indicating that Employee retired from the District.” Both Pitts and the district’s head of human resources declined to comment.
Pérez invited Cindy Lam, a Rosemead alum who said she was groomed by Pitts when she served as his student piano accompanist in 2001, to testify in Sacramento in support of her bill.  
“By the time he initiated sex with me, I was putty in his hands. And by the time I realized I had been groomed, I was completely isolated and psychologically destroyed,” Lam said. “A law like SB 848 would have adequately educated me about grooming behaviors. I would have known that these interactions were inappropriate and reported them.”
Opposition to the bill, which has bipartisan support, is focused on due process concerns raised by employee unions that have historically opposed similar attempts to strengthen pass the trash laws in California. The California Teachers Association — the state’s largest teacher’s union, which opposed similar legislation in 2012 and again in 2018, — notably does not oppose the bill. The California Federation of Teachers and California State Employees Association, however, which together represent both teachers and the non-credentialed educators who would be included in the disciplinary database that Pérez’s bill would create, recently opposed it. Both unions cited concerns over due process as the primary reason.
“We need to ensure a policy that captures individuals that are unfit to work in education while making sure innocent and unfairly charged employees have fair access to justice,” said California Federation of Teachers legislative director Tristan Brown. “We are committed to working with the senator to make that a reality.”
Numerous other states already rely on similar hiring databases, however, which regulators have cited as key tools in keeping students safe. California is one of just 16 states that lack a comprehensive pass the trash law, a 2022 report published by the Department of Education found.
Back in the Rosemead community, many have welcomed Pérez’s bill as a needed change in a community where boundaries between teachers and students have frequently been blurred. Kristy Rowe, a Rosemead alum who graduated before Lam, testified in support of Pérez’s bill as well. 
Rowe said she had a sexual relationship with Paul Arevalo, a business teacher known on campus for inviting cheerleaders to sit on his lap in between classes. Not long after Rowe met him, Arevalo was investigated by the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department for allegedly offering to buy another female student condoms and sending her sexually explicit messages during class, disciplinary documents show. Arevalo went on to marry a former student and, after transferring to a nearby school in the district, was placed on leave in 2017 when administrators found he’d sexually harassed another student, records show. Arevalo declined to comment.
“Comprehensive legal reform is urgently needed to center the voices of potential victims, to mandate specialized training for educational personnel, and to ensure that future harm is avoided,” Rowe told lawmakers. “Addressing these gaps is not only a matter of justice, it is a moral imperative to protect children, empower survivors, and create a society where such abuse is neither tolerated nor hidden.”

(Photo by Robin Bravender / States Newsroom)New Mexico Democratic U.S. Senators Martin Heinrich and Ben Ray Luján joined more than 40 Senate Democrats in calling upon U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to make clear that Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients have protection from deportation.
DACA is a status conferred through a 2012 federal law that affords immigrants who were brought to the United States as children protection, also known as “dreamers,” from being deported for renewable two-year periods.
According to a news release, the Sept. 3 letter to Noem stems from a statement made by DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, in which she said, “Illegal aliens who claim to be recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) are not automatically protected from deportation.”
The senators’ letter notes that, “DACA was created to provide protections from immigration enforcement for certain noncitizens brought to the United States as children, also known as Dreamers, who undergo strict background checks and meet specific educational or work requirements. In contrast to Ms. McLaughlin’s puzzling statement, public DHS guidance makes clear that DACA holders are ‘not considered to be unlawfully present’ in the United States and that ‘[a]n individual who has received deferred action is authorized by DHS to be in the United States for the duration of the deferred action period.’”
The American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico recently sued Noem and other federal and local officials over the arrest and “indefinite” detention of a DACA recipient in a state immigrant detention facility.
The letter urges Noem to correct McLaughlin’s statement “to accurately reflect DACA and ensure that DHS recognizes and abides by the protections of DACA moving forward.”
Heinrich, Luján and other Senate Democrats also sent a letter earlier this year to the Trump administration pushing for it to reopen applications for DACA status, following a court ruling that paved the way for them to resume. In July, Heinrich introduced legislation to protect DACA recipients’ private information.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DREAMERS-1024x683-1.jpg,,,2025-09-08 08:56:28.880184

Ibarra,,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/2025/09/glenn-county-hospital-medicaid-lamalfa-oz-closure/,Glenn Medical Center's ‘heartbreaking’ closure will put 150 people out of work and send rural patients to neighboring counties for care.,"In summary
Glenn Medical Center’s ‘heartbreaking’ closure will put 150 people out of work and send rural patients to neighboring counties for care. 


Absent a Hail Mary, Glenn County’s only hospital is set to close its doors in October.
Tucked between two national forests, the rural county is home to 28,000 people. Without a local emergency room, they’ll instead have to travel at least 40 minutes to a neighboring county for critical care. One hundred and fifty health workers will lose their jobs; they’re already resigning to seek work elsewhere. 
The planned closure of Glenn Medical Center follows a decision by the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to strip the hospital’s federal “critical access” designation, a status that has provided Glenn Medical increased reimbursement and regulatory flexibility. Without that status, the hospital’s $28 million in net annual revenue will take a hit of about 40% — a gap too large to fill any other way than closing the hospital, said Lauren Still, the hospital’s chief executive.
“It’s heartbreaking that we come to this. I am still kind of praying for that 11th hour miracle to come through,” Still said. “But honestly, we just have to be realistic, and this is the hand we’ve been dealt.”
Over the last several months Still and her team have been attempting to make their case with the federal health agency, even flying to Washington D.C in July in an attempt to lobby their case. 
At the crux of the issue is a federal rule, newly reinterpreted, that requires critical access hospitals to be at least 35 miles from the next closest hospital when traveling by main roads. Officials at CMS now say that the next closest hospital, Colusa Medical Center, is only 32 miles away — 3 miles short of the required distance. 
Glenn Medical Center and county health officials argue that most people and ambulances take a different route, I-5 to Highway 20. That route is 35.7 miles, a distance that would qualify. 
“We really felt that by getting all of our stories out there … showing all of the different people that would be impacted by this decision, we really thought that would be enough information for them [CMS] to consider the human and practical considerations of their decision,” Still said. “Unfortunately, the only thing that matters is how they’re measuring the distance on the roads.”

The feds first notified Glenn Medical in April that a recertification review found the hospital was not eligible for the critical access program. Hospital officials clung to hope that an appeal and communication with the agency would clarify the situation. But in a letter dated Aug. 13, the agency told the hospital it was standing by its original decision. 
“After reviewing the hospital’s additional information, CMS found that the hospital continues to not meet the distance requirement,” the letter reads.
The locations of Glenn Medical Center and its neighbor a county over have not changed since Glenn Medical first became eligible for the critical access program in 2001. CalMatters asked the federal agency why it was seeking to revoke the hospital’s designation now after more than two decades of eligibility at the same distance. The agency did not directly answer the question, but in an email simply reiterated the requirements to qualify for the program. 
CMS said Glenn Medical Center could convert to another provider type in order to continue participating in the Medicare program. But Still said no other Medicare reimbursement model would pay the hospital at a financially sustainable rate. Under the critical access program, the federal government pays hospitals 101% of their costs for inpatient and outpatient services provided to Medicare patients.
U.S. Rep. Doug LaMalfa, a Richvale Republican who represents Glenn County, said he continues to have conversations with Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator at CMS. He said they last spoke last week.
“We’re not giving up by any stretch, we’re going to pull out all the stops,” LaMalfa said. “We had a really good conversation with Dr. Oz and are looking for a way to make it work because the closure is not acceptable. It’s a technical issue that we oughta find a way to work through.”

LaMalfa said he is considering introducing a bill that could update the mileage requirement or give CMS more discretion when evaluating rural hospitals. But it’s unclear that something could get done before October. 
Glenn Medical Center and its staff cannot wait for much longer. The hospital announced it would keep its clinics open, but inpatient services will cease Oct. 21. Still said that’s when she expects to no longer have enough staff to be able to operate. 
“We had to start talking to staff and telling staff that, “Hey, we don’t have a future here. There’s no viable path forward for us without that critical access designation,’” Still said. “At that point, we started getting staff resignations.”
With the announced closure, most Glenn County residents will have to seek emergency services either at the hospital in Colusa County or further away at Butte County’s Enloe Medical Center, a larger Level II trauma center in Chico.
“We are actively reviewing available resources to ensure our readiness to absorb anticipated increased patient volumes at the Enloe Health Emergency Department,” wrote Enloe Health in an unsigned statement. 
Glenn County’s two ambulances will also have to travel further and be outside the county for longer periods of time, leaving residents with even more limited emergency resources.
The announced closure is a stark reminder of the precarious state of California’s rural hospitals. Even with increased Medicare reimbursement, Glenn Medical Center’s annual financial statements show that the hospital consistently operated in the red.
Two years ago, the state bailed out 17 rural and community hospitals – Glenn Medical was not one of them – by loaning them close to $300 million altogether. That loan program was largely prompted by the closure of Madera Community Hospital, which also left an entire county without emergency services. After bankruptcy proceedings, Madera Community is now owned and operated by American Advanced Management, a for-profit company that has made a business out of rescuing distressed and shuttered hospitals. The company also owns Glenn Medical Center. 
“It’s devastating for our group from a personal perspective because we really do pride ourselves in being somebody who comes in and re-opens hospitals,” Still said. “When we go into a community, we make that promise to the community that we’re not going to bail on them.”

(Getty Images)After jumping through hoops to flee their countries and establish themselves in the United States, refugees disproportionately face another issue while trying to adapt to their new homes — food insecurity. Especially, University of Utah researchers found, in these four moments:
“First, when they found their first job in the U.S. Second, after six months in the U.S., when they had to renew their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) application,” researchers wrote. “Third, when they were no longer receiving caseworkers’ support from resettlement agencies. Fourth, when they faced fluctuations in employment or household expenditures.”

University of Utah researchers collaborated with resettlement agencies in the state to conduct 36 interviews with refugees between July and September 2024 for a recently published study analyzing their temporal patterns of food insecurity. 
Refugees’ answers about the times in which they had the most difficulty affording food shocked Nasser Sharareh, the research assistant professor at the U. who led the study.
Utah refugee resettlement program finds self-sufficiency amid federal funding cuts

“Finding a job can make refugees more food insecure,” Sharareh said in a news release.
While resettlement agencies provide refugees with the necessary tools to become financially independent through jobs, often their first roles in the state are low-paying and unstable. Simultaneously, their earned income disqualifies them from having access to food assistance, like SNAP. 
With a paycheck that is still insufficient to cover food expenses, housing and utilities, refugees find themselves in crisis.
The refugees who participated in the study were predominantly in households with children and with an income below 185% of the federal poverty level.



Let us know what you think...


 


Food insecurity among different refugee groups living in the country can reach up to 85%, six times higher than the general national rate, which was 13.5% in 2023. About 83% of the surveyed participants reported food insecurity experiences in the past year. 
Some other factors contributing to food insecurity were language barriers while trying to get a job, or lack of awareness of the country’s food environment and programs, the study says.
While staff at resettlement agencies are well trained, researchers wrote, they have been historically underfunded throughout the country, limiting their ability to address refugees’ needs.
“The impact of these barriers has become even more significant in 2025 and could become worse in the future because the current U.S. administration has suspended refugees’ admission to the U.S. starting January 27, 2025,” the study says. “Consequently, caseworkers’ support has become very limited, as a large portion of resettlement agencies’ funding comes from the Office of Refugee Resettlement based on the number of newly admitted refugees.”
Despite these barriers, according to a 2024 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services report, refugees and asylees have produced a net fiscal impact of $123.8 billion from 2005 to 2019 — meaning that they have contributed more revenue than expenditures to the government, researchers wrote.
And overall, Sharareh added, reducing food insecurity will benefit the economy because of other factors. 
“Food insecurity is costing the U.S. health care system more than $53 billion annually,” he said in the release. “So besides having a public health impact, addressing food insecurity can have a positive economic impact on U.S. society.”

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)A state court Friday blocked an Alabama High School Athletic Association (AHSSA) policy barring transfer student-athletes from immediately participating in sports if they receive CHOOSE Act funds amid a lawsuit from Gov. Kay Ivey and Alabama House Speaker Nathaniel Ledbetter, R-Rainsville. 
The CHOOSE Act is a voucher-like program that offers families up to $7,000 per qualifying child per year for “non-public education” expenses, including private school tuition. The program currently operates under income caps scheduled to be lifted next year. 
The lawsuit, filed in Montgomery County Circuit Court, alleges AHSAA’s rules “specifically and unlawfully sideline CHOOSE Act students from AHSAA-sanctioned interscholastic athletic events for an entire year solely because they receive CHOOSE Act funds.”
“Every child deserves true choice in their education and that includes their right to participate in school athletics,” Ivey said in a statement Friday afternoon.  “The court’s decision restores fairness to the process which is, of course, the very basis of the CHOOSE Act.”
A message seeking comment was left with AHSAA on Friday. The AHSAA considers the CHOOSE Act a form of financial aid similar to scholarships or tuition reductions, and it requires students who receive that to be ineligible for sports for one year. AHSAA said in a statement Thursday that the rule is in place to prevent students from having unfair advantages.
“This policy, established by our member schools, promotes competitive equity and deters recruitment,” the organization said in its statement.
When the act was initially introduced in 2024, there was no language about high school athletics. During House floor debate over the bill in February of that year, Rep. Joe Lovvorn, R-Auburn, introduced an amendment saying that “Nothing in this chapter shall affect or change the athletic eligibility of student athletes governed by the Alabama High School Athletic Association or similar association.”
The amendment was adopted on a 74-17 vote. The language remained in the final version of the bill. 
Messages seeking comment were left Friday with Lovvorn.
Rep. Danny Garrett, R-Trussville, the sponsor of the CHOOSE Act and the chair of the House Ways and Means Education Committee, wrote in an email Friday that AHSAA was aware the governor and other politicians didn’t agree with the organization’s interpretation of the law.
“The Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Speaker of the House, the chief legislative legal officer and the bill sponsor have expressed the legislative intent of the CHOOSE Act during numerous conversations with AHSAA officials. The AHSAA’s position and response is obtuse, baffling and certainly not with the best interest of children and families in mind,” he wrote.
Ledbetter said in a statement Thursday AHSAA created the policy without getting clarification from policymakers which leaves families at a disadvantage, and implied that action from policymakers could be taken against AHSAA during the upcoming legislative session.
“For the AHSAA’s leadership to take such drastic action just as football season begins tells me they are not concerned with the best interests of all student-athletes.” the statement said. “While I fully expect members of the House and Senate will take a hard look at how the AHSAA operates in the upcoming session, this situation demands action today. My hope is the court will side with our student-athletes and not allow this organization to wrongfully take away their opportunity to compete.”
The AHSAA in 2016 altered its rules to allow homeschooled students to play sports in the public school districts in which they reside.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Nathaniel-Ledbetter-Kay-Ivey-Feb-12-2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-08 08:56:28.880184

(Photo: Getty Images)Nearly 3,000 youth experiencing homelessness in Nevada reached out to various social service providers for help last year, a number that more than likely falls orders of magnitude short of the actual number of youths who lack stable housing.
Yet infrastructure and funding to prevent and end homelessness among youth is sorely lacking, a recent statewide report found.
Youth-serving nonprofits and advocacy groups, state and local agencies, homeless service providers, youth who have experienced homelessness, and social workers all collaborated on the two-year study. The findings were released in August in the Youth Experiencing Homelessness Statewide Report.
The report showed there were 2,834 youth ages 12 to 24 who were identified in 2024 through the Homeless Management Information System, which tracks service interventions among unhoused people – 2,868 were identified the year before.
There are only 430 beds in Nevada shelters dedicated specifically for the youth population, none of which are in the 15 rural counties. 
Of the many takeaways and recommendations, the report found Nevada “currently lacks the necessary infrastructure, leadership, and funding” to solve youth homelessness and needs a dedicated state entity if it wants to prevent and end youth homelessness.
The analysis comes amid uncertainty around what federal funding and resources will be available to address homelessness, yet alone for youth experiencing homelessness. 
The report underscores that Nevada needs to “take increased ownership and accountability for this issue,” said Arash Ghafoori, executive director Nevada Partnership for Homeless Youth.
“We have relied on federal funding streams, federal definitions, and other federal entities that drive a lot of our system work when it comes to homelessness,” Ghafoori said. “Now that there’s sort of turbulent times there, it’s even more important to think about Nevada driving the investigation of what’s wrong, and driving the solution and investments” to address the problems.
Recommendations to address youth homelessness include developing a guaranteed basic income for youth, designating state general funds to build and support youth-specific housing and shelter beds, reducing barriers for youth to access housing and health care, and creating a statewide coordinated response to specifically address this population.  
The study estimates the cost of providing permanent housing for an individual youth at $20,014. Adding 1,000 youth-focused permanent housing options would cost the state an estimated $20 million a year. 
The analysis provides policymakers and providers a better understanding of “who the young people are from a demographic standpoint,” Andre Wade, state director of Silver State Equality who helped lead the study, said, adding it will help give the state a better insight of  “what interventions and resources are available, but more importantly, what’s not available and what’s needed.”
Added Ghafoori, “The money exists in our community. We need to prioritize it.” 
Understanding the issue
The transient nature of homelessness, along with inconsistent definitions of homelessness and reporting requirements, render the scope of Nevada youth homelessness difficult to understand, service providers say. 
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services have different definitions of homelessness, with the former looking at literal homelessness – living in places not meant for human habitation – and the latter considering inadequate or infrequent housing like weekly motels. 
Similar problems exist when it comes to collecting youth demographic data  such as race or LGBTQ+ affiliation.
These longstanding problems became more apparent during the Covid pandemic, when the state received funding from the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, Wade said.
State and local officials began discussing how to use millions of dollars in unprecedented funding provided by ARPA to address the state’s ongoing housing shortage. 
“Housing for youth is rarely, if ever, part of the actual conversation,” he said. “There just wasn’t information about the number of young people to determine how much money we would want for housing.”
ARPA funding was used to kick off a two-year study starting in 2023 to better understand the number of youth experiencing homelessness, their specific needs, and what resources were lacking, culminating in the Youth Experiencing Homelessness Statewide Report.
‘Have not touched the system yet’
While less than 3,000 youth statewide sought services to address homelessness, an estimated 33,443 youth under the age of 24 in Nevada could experience homelessness or lack adequate stable housing in any given year. 
The estimate was based on “national prevalence data, which reports that 10% of young adults (18-25) and 3% of adolescents (13-17)” are unhoused over a course of a year, the report says.
”The actual number of young people … that we know we actually served, is still a significant undercount,”  Ghafoori said. “There’s so many young people that are doubled up. There’s so many young people that have not touched the system yet.”
There were less than 500 beds for youth experiencing homelessness in 2024, all of them in Clark and Washoe counties.
Nearly three-quarters of them are emergency shelter beds or transitional housing, which the report notes “are short-to-medium term options that, if not paired with permanent housing options can become cyclical and keep individuals in a state of instability rather than providing a long-term solution.”
“None of these beds are located in Nevada’s 15 rural counties, which may have as many as 3,309 youth experiencing homelessness each year,” the report notes. 
Youth homelessness in rural and tribal communities “often takes on less visible forms,” the report reads. 
“Young people in these communities may rely on extended family or informal networks for shelter due to a lack of formal housing providers that operate in their area,” the report says. “Youth aging out of foster care are especially vulnerable, and some youth may choose to leave their communities altogether in search of greater opportunity or support in urban areas.”
Only a quarter of youth “successfully exited to permanency” between 2021 and 2024 according to the report and “between 56% to 68% had no known exit to permanency during the period covered by the study.“
The findings show that two-third of youth “served in Nevada had no record of achieving housing
Permanency” during that same time period and that “at least 4,379 youth who entered homelessness with no evidence that they exited into a stable housing situation.”
Similar to adult homeless populations, there is a disproportionately large number of Black youth who experience homelessness. 
Of the youth that utilized services – again,  far from the true number of those in need – 41% identify as Black and 25% as white, according to the report. 
Though 6% identify as Hispanic, the report notes it’s likely an undercount due to inadequate data collection procedures, the improvement of which being among the state’s recommendations. 
The data and recommendations were compiled between July 2023 and January 2025. The report notes that “youth who reviewed recommendations in February 2025 suggested that the environment has changed for youth, with more expressing fear and concern about the future due to the changed, and continuously changing, environment.”
“Shifts in federal policies regarding homeless and social services may impact the resources and
frameworks available to support vulnerable youth, including LGBTQ+ individuals and youth of color,” the report says.
Inaction costs more
One of the report’s many recommendations calls on the state to establish housing trust funds “financed through dedicated revenue sources, such as real estate transaction fees or taxes.” 
Funding to confront youth homelessness isn’t just a moral imperative, the report reads. It makes the case for it to be an economic necessity, adding that “the cost of not ending youth homelessness is notably higher.”
Failing to invest in youth homelessness prevention not only leads to overburdening other systems, such as emergency rooms or jails, but there is “actually a labor force argument to investing in youth homelessness,” Ghafoori said. 
If elected officials can be convinced to think beyond “one-term optics and say, ‘hey, the state is going to be in a worse situation in 5, 10, and 15 years unless we take these actions,’ then maybe we can start convincing them, because there’s a price tag and there’s an impact to their future constituents and neighbors,” he said. 
Wade hopes the findings will persuade people who oppose the development of supportive housing in their neighborhoods. 
“We need to get young people off the street,” he said.  “A lot of the pushback across the U.S. is the NIMBY, not in my backyard. It’s going to take the community to be able to support these young people and possible projects that may be built in their neighborhood.”
While building housing, and expanding youth-specific beds, is important, it’s not the only solution the state needs to consider, Ghafoori said. 
“The solutions to youth homelessness are complex, they vary, and they just don’t necessarily involve infrastructure,” he said. “Although infrastructure is critically important, you can’t build a house without a foundation, and we need more of that sort of foundation happening in our community.”
One proposal highlighted in the report: direct cash transfers of guaranteed basic income, in which youth experiencing homelessness are given direct financial assistance. 
“We already know the advantages of (direct cash transfers) and how providing that basic income has been effective not just around the world in developed countries, but has been effective in the pilots here in the United States,” Ghafoori said. 
Other policy considerations the report highlights include decriminalizing “acts of survival” like sleeping in public places, limiting the use of criminal background checks in housing applications, investing in early intervention models such as family reunification for youth, and having policies tailored to LGBTQ+ youth and youth of color.
“This issue is getting shoved under the rug and doesn’t get the spotlight it deserves,” Ghafoori said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/homeless-1024x684.jpeg,,,2025-09-08 08:56:28.880184

The program was started in 2019 with a dual mission: to increase higher education journalism and to lift up the voices of developing journalists. Funding is thanks to the College Futures Foundation and ECMC Foundation, along with CalMatters’ members (become a member today).
College Journalism Network Editor Jennifer Burger said this year’s fellows are eager to apply and build on their experience covering local politics and government, criminal justice, housing and homelessness, and campus policy.
Each fellow is paid for a school year to pitch, report and publish stories in CalMatters and our partner local news publications. The students will also partner with CalMatters’ engagement journalists to create social videos about their stories to expand information access to young people. Watch their first social video on what they plan to cover.
CalMatters will be hosting monthly virtual seminars, open to all student journalists, to hear from experts across the fields of education and journalism. If you’re a student journalist who wants to join, sign up for College Journalism Network updates to stay up-to-date.
Meet our 12 newest fellows

Last year, nearly 100 interest groups spent more than $820,000 to sponsor trips for 92 state lawmakers.



Pick any day in 2024 and it’s more likely than not that a California state lawmaker was on a trip sponsored by corporations or nonprofits, many of whom frequently have business before the state.
Last year, those interest groups spent more than $820,000 to take dozens of legislators on both domestic and international trips, according to financial disclosure reports filed by elected officials in March of this year. The total is less than the $1.1 million spent on similar trips the year before.
Nearly 100 groups sponsored trips for 92 lawmakers, about three-quarters of the Legislature, to destinations that ranged from areas like Berkeley and Napa to far-flung places such as Hawaii, Europe, Southeast Asia and Israel.
The largest sponsor of travel for legislators last year was the California Foundation on the Environment and the Economy, or CFEE, which paid nearly $260,000 to take more than 40 lawmakers on domestic and international trips. The nonprofit was also the largest trip patron for legislators in 2022 and 2023.
CFEE is a unique creature in California politics and brings together many organizations that normally fight each other on legislation and regulation. Companies and nonprofits can effectively pay to acquire seats on the board, which includes representatives from Big Oil, organized labor, environmental groups, large companies, tribes, and other industry associations, and some board members are invited to accompany elected officials on the tours.
The international trips are called “study tours” by the nonprofit, and it publishes a list of the most recent destinations and associated study areas on its website. Nine legislators attended the March trip to the United Kingdom which focused on the impact of and technology related to climate change, such as home insurance, offshore wind development and aviation fuel. Six lawmakers attended a November trip to Taiwan and Vietnam focused on electric vehicles, high-speed rail and natural-disaster preparedness. 
Each study tour had both Democratic and Republican representatives in attendance and lawmakers who went said that made the trip even more valuable. “I’m a lefty Dem,” said Sen. Scott Wiener, Democrat from San Francisco, “and one of the things I appreciate about the Legislature is that we can work across the aisle.” 
The trips allow members to really get to know each other and find ways to work together, said Assemblymember Heath Flora, a Republican from Ripon. He added, “bipartisan legislation is the best legislation.”
Lawmakers who have attended trips organized by the nonprofit in the past have described the trips as a valuable way to learn from other countries and get ideas for future legislation.
Wiener, who went on the trip to the U.K, said he finds the trips to be “completely exhausting.” Flora attended the same trip and said the tours are “some of the most valuable trips we take as elected officials.”
Sen. Anna Caballero, a Democrat from Merced, also attended the trip to the U.K. and said she is carrying three bills this session that were directly inspired by the trip: one related to long-term water supply issues, one that would invest in fusion energy research, and one to study the emissions of biomass. 
The second-largest sponsor of trips lawmakers took in 2024 was the Independent Voter Project, a nonprofit that focuses on voter education of public policy issues. It spent more than $100,000 on a pair of trips for elected officials: an annual trip to Maui, hosted by the organization since at least 2016, attended by 17 legislators, and another to Valle de Guadalupe in Mexico with six lawmakers called the “Make it with Mexico Cross Border Conference.” Both trips had Democratic and Republican representatives.
The organization filed rarely used disclosure reports that provide transparency about the donors who attended the Maui trip. State law requires that organizations annually disclose any major donors who travel alongside elected officials, if the travel for elected officials in a year totals more than $10,000 or at least $5,000 to a single official and if the trip sponsorship accounts for at least one-third of the organization’s total expenses.
The Independent Voter Project filed disclosure reports going back to 2021 after CalMatters reported in 2023 that the law mandating transparency had only resulted in two submitted reports. There are now 11 filed reports, six from the Independent Voter Project.
The state’s ethics agency, the Fair Political Practices Commission, found in a 2024 audit that the one-third of total expenses requirement can create transparency gaps since some well-funded organizations might not meet that threshold and, therefore, be exempt from the reporting requirements.
More than 100 representatives of corporations, unions, and other nonprofits attended last year’s trip to Maui alongside the legislators, according to the trip donor disclosure report, many of which have frequent business before the Legislature, such as the state’s prison guard union, Pacific Gas & Electric, an oil industry group and a trade association for California hospitals.
Among the representatives from companies and advocacy groups was Autumn Burke, a former legislator who was elected in 2014 and abruptly resigned in 2022. Burke was listed as a donor and attendee using her 2026 campaign committee for Lt. Governor. 
According to her committee’s campaign finance disclosure, the trip cost at least $17,500 to attend. At the time of the trip to Hawaii she was a registered lobbyist with Axiom Advisors though Burke said she didn’t lobby at the event and that she doesn’t lobby the Legislature even back in Sacramento.
“I had a vote, I do not have one now,” Burke said, “and I’m not comfortable telling them how.” 
Instead, she said she went to learn more about policy matters in case she runs for office in the future. “I thought that I would at some point run again and this was one of the few venues that I had access to that allowed me informational education,” she told CalMatters in a phone interview.

The Jewish Community Relations Council and the Jewish Federation of Los Angeles paid nearly $82,000 in total to send a delegation of seven Democratic lawmakers to Israel last February, including Democrats Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel from Encino and Wiener, both of whom are co-chairs of the Legislative Jewish Caucus.
One of the sponsors said the point of the trip was to develop connections between California and Israel. Jeremy Russell, director of communications for the Jewish Community Relations Council, wrote that that attendees met with Israelis and Palestinians as well as members of the Knesset, Israel’s national legislature, and visited a few cities in Israel. 
“The trips advance California and Israel’s long partnership on issues such as agriculture, technology and innovation,” Russell said.
Wiener said he went on the trip because Israel is home to about half of the world’s Jews and it was “important to see with my own eyes the horrors of the October 7th terror attack and to talk with the families of hostages” held by Hamas. But he said going to Israel doesn’t mean he supports the current government, which he called a “complete disaster.” 
“There are times I wonder if Netanyahu and his team are Iranian assets,” Wiener said, referring to the Israeli prime minister, “because they’re creating more danger for Israel, in addition to the horrors in Gaza.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Disclosure-Travel_AH_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-08 08:56:28.880184

CalMatters created a tool that allows anybody to explore the assets, gifts, and travel disclosed by state lawmakers.


In 2024, interest groups gave nearly $250,000 worth of gifts to California legislators and spent more than $820,000 taking them on trips across the world, according to annual financial transparency reports filed in March. That’s less than they gave in 2023 when lawmakers received $330,000 in gifts and more than $1.1 million on sponsored travel.

Sponsored travel
Organizations can pay for the travel of an elected official to a destination within California or beyond for educational purposes that often include touring a facility, going to a conference or learning about a policy issue. These organizations can also invite lobbyists or other guests to accompany legislators on these trips, allowing special access that is often undisclosed to the public.
In 2024, just like in 2022 and 2023, a nonprofit called the California Foundation on the Environment and the Economy, also known as CFEE, paid the most to take state legislators on trips to locations that included the United Kingdom, Vietnam and Taiwan. The group spent nearly $260,000 last year to pay for the travel of 42 legislators, almost one-third of all the money spent on lawmaker travel in 2024.
Assemblymember Damon Connolly, a Democrat from San Rafael, went on eight trips that cost $27,000, the most of anybody in the Legislature, while 28 officials didn’t report any travel. Connolly’s largest trip patron was CFEE.
Gifts
Legislators have to disclose any gifts they receive worth more than $50; if they received more than $590 in gifts from a single source in 2024 then they had to report it and reimburse the difference between the value and maximum gift amount to the gift-giver. In total, 108 legislators reported receiving gifts from more than 450 different sources last year, and 12 officials did not report receiving any gifts.
The single largest source of gifts last year was the California Democratic Party, which gave more than $27,000 in gifts, mostly as retreats and food, to 71 state lawmakers, including some Republicans.
About the data
State law requires every elected official to submit an annual financial transparency report each March to disclose any stocks, property or businesses they own, as well as gifts, sponsored travel and other income they received the previous year.
The documents, called Form 700s, are published by the Fair Political Practices Commission on their website as PDF files. We downloaded all of the reports filed by state legislators and used a Python script to crop each field on the form and then used OCR (which stands for Optical Character Recognition) to extract the value. Finally, we compared the extracted data to the original reports to verify accuracy.

Public officials laughing and celebrating. Promises of major economic impact, even transformation. President Donald Trump said Huntsville would be known as the Rocket City, a name it has borne for decades.
Here’s another way it could resemble all those prior announcements: The predicted impact and the actual one almost certainly won’t match.

Trump claimed moving Space Command to north Alabama from its home in Colorado would create over 30,000 jobs. But another estimate was far lower: 1,600 direct jobs and 3,000 indirect jobs. That’s a blip in the Huntsville area, where about 277,000 people work.
U.S. Sen. Tommy Tuberville claimed the relocation would save the federal government $480 million, an estimate that government auditors have questioned.
It’s also not clear when Space Command will actually arrive in Alabama’s largest city. Colorado’s leaders, both Democratic and Republican, aren’t happy with Trump’s decision. The state’s attorney general has threatened to sue. Trump did himself no favors by suggesting at last week’s press conference that Colorado’s use of mail-in ballots factored into the move. (Alabama has those, too, though it’s far harder to use them here than in Colorado.)
Moreover, many Space Command employees — presently living in Colorado Springs — may prefer unemployment to the Yellowhammer State.
In a report from the U.S. Inspector General’s Office earlier this year, Space Command officials expressed concerns that the move could set their current state of readiness back four years.
Three officials also said they feared that a large part of the current Space Command workforce would leave rather than live in the Rocket City.
“Mission success is highly dependent on human capital and infrastructure,” the report quoted the commander of Space Command saying. He added that “there is risk that most of the 1,000 civilians, contractors, and reservists will not relocate to another location.”
Another official said that he only expected 4% of the employees in his section to leave Colorado.
We won’t know how many employees will make the trip until the move is complete. But it’s clear that a big problem with moving Space Command to Alabama is, well, Alabama. The leaders of the command think many of their employees — highly trained, highly educated and not easy to replace — would quit before moving to our state.
And honestly, I get it. Colorado has its own charms, of course. But how exactly are you going to persuade people to come here?
Education? Colorado is in the bottom half of per pupil public school spending in the country. But it still invests more in its children than Alabama does.
Public safety? Colorado’s homicide rate is less than half of Alabama’s. And despite having almost 1 million more people than Alabama, Colorado had 273 fewer firearm deaths in 2023.
Health care? Yeah, no. Colorado expanded Medicaid over 10 years ago, helping to slash its uninsured rate. Alabama’s hospitals and health care professionals have all but begged our state leaders to follow suit, citing the dire condition of rural hospitals and the economic benefits of expansion.
Instead, Alabama leaders sulked about former President Barack Obama and whined about the cost, while eagerly directing federal money into the construction of a megaprison in Elmore County and smiling as the price tag for the facility flew into the stratosphere.
And at least until Trump got involved, Colorado was pretty welcoming to transgender youth and didn’t blithely take their health care away from them. Nor do I see Colorado leaders panicking at the idea of a child reading a book with an LGBTQ character in it.
Oh, and Colorado treats women like adults. Where Alabama forces sexual assault victims to bear their attackers’ children and sees no problem with an abortion ban that makes the treatment of pregnancy complications far more difficult than it should be, Colorado voters last year voted to put abortion protections in their state constitution.
If you’re a Colorado woman working for Space Command, are you going to jump at the chance to move to a place that thinks so little of your health and safety? Or your daughter’s?
Huntsville is a fine city. It has a lot to do and is within driving distance of larger metro areas like Nashville and Atlanta. There’s some spectacular hiking and natural views nearby, and the beauty of east Tennessee and north Georgia are easily accessible. Huntsville’s city school system is rated the best among the state’s four largest cities. And it’s growing at a rapid clip.
So if you see people from Space Command in Colorado objecting to moving there, just remember: it’s really not Huntsville they have a problem with. It’s our state government.
And it’s a bunch of politicians who care more about landing the Donald J. Trump Space Command Center than the lives of the people working there.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Donald-Trump-Katie-Britt-Tommy-Tuberville-Spet-2-2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-08 08:56:28.880184
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-08 11:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"Why CT’s congressional map looks odd, but is not a gerrymander",Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/08/ct-congressional-districts-redistricting/,Here’s how redistricting really works in Connecticut and why some people think they see a lobster claw in the congressional map.,"The U.S. is watching a rare redistricting arms race instigated at mid-decade by a president anxious to preserve his party’s fragile majority in the U.S. House of Representatives in next year’s midterm elections.
Texas redrew its congressional map with the stated goal of electing five more Republicans to Congress next year. California is responding with an effort to do the same in favor of Democrats. Now, Missouri is getting in the act for the GOP.
Where will it end?
Well, not in Connecticut. 
Democrats control two-thirds of the seats in the General Assembly and the office of the governor, but they cannot unilaterally draw more favorable maps in either congressional or state legislative districts.  And even if they could, Democrats already hold all five congressional seats.
One side effect of Texas delivering President Donald J. Trump a made-to-order congressional map is the buzz — OK, more like misinformation — on social media about whether Connecticut’s solid-blue map is the product of the same hardball politics we’re seeing in Texas, California and Missouri.
Here’s how redistricting really works in Connecticut, how the congressional delegation went from 60% red to 80% blue in the midterm election of 2006, and why some people think they see a lobster claw in the congressional map. 
Is the absence of CT Republicans in Congress evidence of gerrymandering?
No, though the current congressional map is flawed, as judged against redistricting principles, such as making a district as compact as possible. And it makes little sense today, unless you understand its origins and how it was produced. 
But it wasn’t a Democratic gerrymander. In fact, it initially favored Republicans.
The foundation of the current map are the radical changes forced by the 2000 Census, when Connecticut lost one of its six U.S. House seats. It has since been only lightly tweaked after the census results of 2010 and 2020.
Democrat James Maloney of Danbury, who represented the 5th District, and Republican Nancy Johnson of New Britain, who represented the soon-to-be-extinct 6th District, ended up in the same district in 2002.
The newly drawn 5th was drawn less to serve the interest of voters than those of Maloney and Johnson. The goal was to set up a fair fight, which required hollowing out the once-compact 1st District of Greater Hartford.
Johnson won in 2002. In fact, Republicans won three of the five seats in 2002 and 2004. Democrats flipped the 5th and 2nd in 2006, capitalizing on the unpopularity of George W. Bush and the war in Iraq. 
They completed the sweep in 2008, capturing the 4th in Fairfield County, helped by the coattails of Barack Obama. 
Johnson and Maloney are long gone from active politics. The ugly border between the 1st and 5th — the lobster claw —remains.
Why are congressional maps rarely drawn at mid-decade?
The impetus usually is equalizing the population of congressional districts after the completion of a decennial census, not reacting to the prospect of one party losing the House in a coming election.
Allocating congressional seats by population is a zero-sum game. The number of House seats remains constant at 435, and the courts have ruled each district should have roughly the same population to the extent that is practical. 
So that means the greater population growth in southern and western states shifted political power. The 2000 Census resulted in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, and Texas gaining two House seats, and California, Colorado, Nevada, and North Carolina gaining one.
New York and Pennsylvania lost two. Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Wisconsin lost one.
Who draws the maps in Connecticut?
In some states, winning control of the legislature means one party is in charge of drawing the map. Not so in Connecticut. The state constitution gives the task to an eight-person legislative committee with an equal number of House and Senate Republicans and Democrats. 
If they cannot agree on a map, then the legislators must choose eight members for a new reapportionment commission. Those eight members then must agree on a ninth member. If that fails to produce a consensus, the task of drawing new districts falls to the state Supreme Court.
Every 10 years, the legislators have little trouble negotiating new state legislative districts. But they have deadlocked on making changes to the congressional map. 
The result is that revising the congressional map after the 2010 and 2020 census was punted to the Supreme Court and a court-appointed special master, who have made only the minimal changes necessary to equalize the populations of the five districts. 
The court’s rationale: The map produced after the 2000 Census was fairly done, and it is up to the General Assembly to make more significant changes.
By the way, mapping software has made it relatively easy to draw new districts.
A work in progress: Using mapping software, Districtr.org, the CTMirror produced a congressional map that preserves the political balance of the current map, while eliminating its oddly jagged borders. The numbers do not reflect curent districts. Credit: CTMIRROR.ORG
If not the maps, how do you explain the lopsided results favoring Democrats?
The answer is numbers and trends.
First, the numbers. Only 21% of registered voters are Republicans, compared to 36% Democrats and 42% unaffiliated. Upscale suburbs that once were the GOP’s foundation, especially in Fairfield County, have been trending blue, just as some blue-collar suburbs have been going red.
The trend accelerated since the election of Trump.
Republicans fell to their modern low in 2008, when Obama’s popularity helped Democrats win majorities of 114-37 in the state House and 24-12 in the state Senate. The GOP steadily made gains, falling just short of majority in the House and winning an 18-18 tie in the Senate.
The GOP actually did fine with Trump topping the ballot in 2016, even though he badly lost the state: Republicans won an 18-18 tie in the state Senate and came within four seats of a House majority. 
But every election since Trump’s victory has been a problem for Republicans. The same legislative map that nearly produced parity in 2016 gave Democrats huge majorities in 2018 and 2020. 
The trend continued with the version produced after the 2020 Census.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-18-at-3.13.55-PM-1.png,,,2025-09-08 07:56:18.740134

The FAST-41 process was created by Title 41 of the “Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act,” signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2015. Coverage originally focused on transportation infrastructure. It was expanded to mining projects during the final days of Donald Trump’s first presidential administration in 2021.
Trump signed an executive order earlier this year directing federal officials to accelerate domestic critical mineral production, including copper, zinc, titanium and uranium. His administration is increasingly using FAST-41 to carry out the order.
Company says project could start in two years
EnCore Energy Executive Chairman William Sheriff said in a news release the Texas-based company is focused on “building a stronger domestic supply of clean and affordable energy and providing economic stimulus to southwest South Dakota.” Uranium is the key ingredient in nuclear power production.
Janet Lee-Sheriff, head of communications for enCore, said the company applied for FAST-41 with the expectation it would be a public, open and transparent process with clear deadlines.
The fast-track process can be misconstrued as “pushing permitting like a bulldozer,” Lee-Sheriff said. But there is no guarantee the project will be approved. 
NorthWestern Energy considers building a nuclear plant in South Dakota

“The reason we applied was because we wanted the federal process coordinated to give the state the confidence that this project will or won’t go forward,” Lee-Sheriff said. 
Once the permits are dealt with at the federal level, the state can begin its own permitting process.
Within the next two months, the Permitting Council will release a schedule that federal agencies and the company are expected to meet. Updates will be posted to the project’s page on the federal Permitting Dashboard.
If everything goes according to plan, Lee-Sheriff said, the project could be cleared through the federal process by next year, and the state permitting process could begin.
“In our best case, the state would get involved once they see this moving along at the federal level and we’d be able to advance the project toward development in a couple of years,” Lee-Sheriff said.
Opponents plan to continue challenging project
EnCore said in a news release that its method would have “minimal surface disturbance” compared to open pits and tunnels used to mine uranium in the same area from the 1950s to the ’70s. Lee-Sheriff described the operation as a series of “beehives” with piping underground.
The method is known as “in situ” mining: drilling wells to inject a water-based solution underground, dissolving uranium and pumping it to the surface. The water would be pulled from local aquifers and then treated and pumped back underground after being used for mining, causing opponents to fear pollution of local water sources.
Lilias Jarding, executive director of the Black Hills Clean Water Alliance, said the organization formed in 2009 in response to the Dewey Burdock project. She said the organization will continue to oppose the project because of its potential threat to groundwater and the people who rely on it.
“There is a danger to water and to human health. Those are the two main threats,” Jarding said. 
The Oglala Sioux Tribe and NDN Collective have also opposed the project over concerns about potential impacts to historic and cultural sites in the Black Hills, which are central to some tribes’ traditional spiritual beliefs and practices.
Another company, Clean Nuclear Energy Corp., filed a uranium exploration permit application with South Dakota last year to explore for more uranium deposits along the southwestern edge of the Black Hills. That application, which is also opposed by the Black Hills Clean Water Alliance, is under consideration by the state Board of Minerals and Environment.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/day5-004.jpg,,,2025-09-08 07:56:18.740134

Many Democrats are calling for a ban on assault rifles and high-capacity magazines, like those used by the shooter at Annunciation and in countless other mass shootings. These firearms, dubbed “assault weapons” for their military-style design and lethality, were banned federally from 1994 to 2004, but states have since been left to their own devices to figure out their own legislation on assault weapons.
Republican lawmakers have largely rejected the focus on guns, instead proposing increased funding for school security and mental health treatment.
Gov. Tim Walz, in announcing his intention to call a special session, said the public is with Democrats on gun control and Republicans risked public backlash by voting against it.
“If you ask the public about an assault weapon ban, it polls at about 80%. So if you want to go to the next election against the public here when we had an opportunity to do something about this, then I leave that to you,” Walz said.
Banning assault weapons only polls that high with Democrats, but past polls show it does have support from a majority of Minnesotans. So do other gun control policies like requirements for universal background checks, which passed in 2023, and, according to this year’s informal State Fair poll, banning guns in the Capitol with nearly 80% support.
Here’s what past opinion polls found about how Minnesotans and Americans overall feel about gun control.
54% of Minnesotans in 2022 strongly or somewhat favored banning assault weapons




Nearly half of surveyed Minnesotans strongly favored banning assault weapons in a 2022 MinnPost poll conducted with Change Research. An additional 7% said they somewhat favored banning assault weapons. That’s slightly less than the nation as a whole, according to a 2023 Pew Research poll.
That result is roughly in line with an older poll from the Star Tribune, which found that 58% of Minnesotans were in favor of banning assault weapons in 2019.
The MinnPost poll responses varied widely by party affiliation, with 86% of Democrats saying they strongly favored a ban compared to 11% of Republicans. Opinions on high-capacity magazines were similar.


In the same poll, a majority of Minnesotans said that they thought gun laws should be stricter, while only 16% said that gun laws should be less strict.
The 2022 poll had 1,551 respondents and was weighted to better reflect Minnesota’s demographics in age, gender, ethnicity, 2020 vote and region, according to the MinnPost article reporting the results.
The same percentage of Minnesotans in 2023 supported changes to statewide gun safety laws
A different poll in 2023 found that over half of Minnesotans supported changes to gun safety laws. The poll was published by two gun violence prevention nonprofits, Giffords and Protect Minnesota, and executed by Expedition Strategies, an opinion research company.
That poll of 1,300 respondents also showed that the majority of Minnesotans across political affiliations supported the red flag law and universal background check requirement that were  passed in Minnesota in 2023.
None of these Minnesota-specific polls in recent years asked voters their thoughts on firearm safe storage laws, which were passed in the House but never came up for vote in the Senate. A nationwide poll by APM Research Lab found that nearly 8 in 10 Americans supported mandating locked gun storage in 2019, which included 68% of Republicans and 88% of Democrats polled.
(Last year’s State Fair poll found that nearly 7 in 10 respondents supported mandating locked and unloaded gun storage.)
A majority of Americans in 2023 thought it was too easy to obtain a gun


A notebook in a YouTube video believed to be made by the Annunciation Church shooter said it was “shockingly easy” to buy a gun, the Star Tribune reported.
The majority of Americans agree. In a 2023 Pew Research poll, around 6 in 10 Americans said that it’s too easy to legally purchase a gun.
The answer varies widely by party affiliation, with 86% of Democrats and Democrat-leaning respondents saying it’s too easy to purchase a gun. Only 34% of Republicans and Republican-leaning respondents agreed.


We see the same patterns for opinions on banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Overall, Americans and especially Democrats supported bans, but over half of Republican and Republican-leaning respondents opposed such bans at the time of the poll.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/gun-rack-1024x678.jpeg,,,2025-09-08 09:56:09.776149

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)The stakes of the current redistricting debate threaten the health of our representative democracy. This is not hyperbole. Most elementary definitions of democracy indicate that free and fair elections are a prerequisite for government responsiveness. Voters get to choose their elected officials. It should not work the other way around.
National Republicans have targeted Indiana among other states where they see an opportunity to exploit. All seven members of Indiana’s Republican congressional delegation support further eroding democracy in Indiana. Vice President J.D. Vance visited Indianapolis last month before Republican members of the General Assembly visited the White House for an arm-twisting session to engage in an unusual round of redistricting and explicit partisan gerrymander in advance of the 2026 cycle to preserve the Republican’s narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives. 
I’d like to take the educational opportunity to correct how most people pronounce the word gerrymandering. I’m mindful this is appearing in print online, but I am confident that when people are reading it – they are saying it “jerrymandering” with a soft g. While political science professors like myself sometimes correct people whenever we get the chance, figures as diverse as stand-up comic John Mulaney to the U.S. Supreme Court have shared that it should be pronounced with a hard G (as in “Gary”).
The term gerrymandering is named after former Vice President and then Massachusetts Governor Elbridge Gerry. While he was Governor, districts were redrawn to benefit his Democratic-Republican Party. One of the oddly shaped districts resembled a salamander, and the term gerrymander (combining Gerry and salamander) was born. Setting this light-hearted history lesson aside, this blatant naked partisan power grab is extremely problematic and another step to further eroding the quality of democracy in the United States.
Gerrymandering in Indiana?
While some early opposition emerged that gave opponents of mid-decade redistricting hope, robocalls and political pressure, in addition the Washington, DC visit, are being utilized to move more Republicans to support this. It seems to be working as one early opponent said “I’m not opposed to it as I was.”  
Indiana’s State Legislature already engaged in gerrymandering after the 2020 Census, in part to redraw the 5th Congressional District to make it less competitive. At the time, George Washington University political science professor Christopher Warshaw identified that the maps had “historically extreme levels of partisan bias.” Now, in an effort to potentially pick up an additional seat, they may consider targeting Democratic Representatives Frank Mrvan or Andre Carson.
Indiana Republicans go to Washington D.C., critics rebuff redistricting push

To meet the principle of “one person, one vote,” the 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives are reapportioned across the fifty states (or reallocated based on changes in state population) after every U.S. Census. Once reapportionment occurs, it is up to each state to redraw their congressional and state legislative districts. The process varies by state as some states allow the elected state legislatures guide the process, like Indiana, whereas other states utilize independent and non-partisan commissions. 
States where partisan state legislatures control the process are more likely to engage in partisan gerrymanders. That “both sides” do it is problematic. In response to the Republican power grab in Texas (and potential targets like Indiana, Missouri, and other states), Democrats are proposing that they, too, would consider redistricting in states where they control state government like California and New York.
But choosing to fight “fire with fire” is dangerous as the problem with democratic backsliding is that it hard to stop. If Democrats in blue states do not return in kind, they are likely to stay in the political minority. If they do engage in this sort of redistricting, they are complicit and further erode trust in our political institutions. This is also problematic when representative forms of government engaged in anti-democratic behavior.
Who can we turn to?
The Courts? Not likely with the current composition. In a narrow 5-4 victory along ideological lines, Chief Justice wrote the majority opinion in the 2019 case Rucho v. Common Cause. The Supreme Court overturned a lower court ruling that stopped a partisan gerrymander in North Carolina. Roberts did so on a technicality by sidestepping the question of the constitutionality of partisan gerrymanders by calling it a “political question” to be decided by the elected bodies of government.
The Politicians? In general, elected officials are loathe to limit their own power. States that have been successful in implementing nonpartisan, independent commissions to handle redistricting rather than their partisan state legislature have largely utilized the ballot initiative. In Indiana, our elected officials do not trust us with that authority.
That may leave it to voters, who overwhelmingly oppose mid-decade redistricting, to apply pressure now and to utilize the ballot box next November. However, if legislators are choosing their constituents rather than the other way around, the choice is being taken away from the voters.

But new applicants will have to collect double the number of names and make twice the sales.,"An extensive license plate collection, belonging to Putnam County resident David Fuhrman, is shown on display in 2022. (Courtesy Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles)Hoosiers have poured almost $200 million into scholarships, medical research, child welfare and more in less than two decades — just by buying specialty license plates for their vehicles.
The Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles has sold nearly 8 million on behalf of a wide array of organizations between 2007 and July 31 of this year, according to agency data.
Upwards of 100 groups participate in the program. Each has its own design and earns up to $25 on every initial sale and annual renewal.
“You have to get a license plate every year if you’re driving a car,” said Mary Jane Michalak, Ivy Tech Community College’s senior vice president of legal and public affairs. “And so, if you want to, (you can) provide support to Ivy Tech at the same time.” The institution enrolls about 180,000 students annually.
“It’s something that people can do to support their favorite organizations across the state and help open a new revenue stream for bringing some good works to Hoosier lives,” said Special Olympics Indiana spokesman Joe Frollo. The group has 70 county programs with 10,000 coaches and volunteers supporting 19,000 athletes with intellectual disabilities.

Indiana Code caps the number of specialty license plates at 150.
To get one, a group must submit a detailed application backed by signatures from would-be buyers and survive multiple stages of review by the BMV and state lawmakers.
To keep it, the group has to sell enough.
Some participants already struggle to meet the signature and sales standards. But new applicants will have to collect double the number of names and make twice the sales.
The hikes were nestled in House Enrolled Act 1390, this year’s BMV agency law. Rep. Jim Pressel, R-Rolling Prairie, authored it.
“Controlling the amount of them — not going over (the cap), not statutorily changing that number — is important because we don’t want to dilute the system,” Pressel said.
“We don’t want to have 5,000 different license plates in Indiana,” he added. “So, if they’re meant to be something special, then they really should be treated like that.”
Boosting budgets and brands
Indiana University and Purdue University top the participant list when it comes to revenue, respectively earning about $26 million and $22 million off their plates between 2007 and July 31. IU has sold more than 1 million, while Purdue is approaching 900,000.


Ivy Tech, another public higher education system, has earned about $373,000 off 15,000 sales over that time period.
“The license plate is a point of pride for our donors, community members, alumni and students,” Michalak said. “It’s a way for those who care about Ivy Tech to promote the organization and … it also gives meaningful support back to current students.”
That’s because, under the law, educational institutions must use plate money on scholarships for Indiana residents.
For instance, Ivy Tech students who can’t meet their total cost of attendance — even after federal and state financial aid is applied — can pull from the college’s general scholarships, according to Michalak.

State agencies have also benefited: an environmental plate funds land conservation, while a “kids first” edition goes to the prevention of child abuse and neglect.
Other big earners include the Riley Hospital for Children at Indiana University Health, the Indiana Breast Cancer Awareness Trust, spay-neuter services, and organizations for nurses, sheriffs and professional firefighters.
The participant list is eclectic, with groups dedicated to conserving wild turkeys, golf, coal, museums and more.
“I think it’s serving its purpose by allowing folks to support the groups that are important to them,” Pressel said. “… It gives these organizations an opportunity to raise some dollars statewide and then be able to do good things with it.”
It’s also a brand-building opportunity. Pressel likened the plates to “small billboards going up and down the road.”
The Alzheimer’s Association Greater Indiana Chapter, which is in its first year of the program, plans to use plate revenue to accelerate treatment research and talk to Hoosiers — over social media and in person — about the warning signs, risk factors, diagnosis and treatment options.

“If you’re sitting in traffic on (Interstate) 465 … (and) see that plate, chances are they probably know someone that’s affected by this disease,” Sarah Donsbach, the chapter’s director of state affairs, said. “And we’re hoping that will prompt them to Google us, or to say, ‘That’s a really cool plate. I’d like to put that on my car.'”
Special Olympics Indiana puts its plate proceeds toward free, year-round training and competitions for athletes of all ages across a whopping 20 sports statewide.
The programming allows Hoosiers with intellectual disabilities to “enjoy the camaraderie and the fun of sports and competitions, just like everybody else enjoys doing,” Frollo said.
Some groups have come under fire, however.
The state’s second-highest official, Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith, and his Anti-Woke Advisory Committee have recommended an audit of the specialty license plate program to ensure participants are complying with “anti-DEI executive orders,” the Indiana Citizen reported.

The committee specifically called out the Indiana Youth Group, which supports young LGBTQ Hoosiers. CEO Chris Paulsen told the Citizen that the plate revenue helps his group provide food, clothing, and resources for those experiencing homelessness and other financial hardship.
BMV spokesman Greg Dunn told the Capital Chronicle that the agency “has not performed any anti-DEI audits” of program participants.
Indiana has other so-called “distinctive” plates, like the popular Hoosier veteran and Indiana Colts team designs, but they are explicitly excluded from the specialty plate requirements. The number of sales and amount of revenue for such plates were excluded from the totals in this article.
A higher bar
An average of 10 organizations annually have tried to join the program over the last five years, according to the BMV.
It’s a “complex” process, Pressel said.
Wannabe participants must submit a 14-part application by April for possible plate issuance the following year. But the toughest requirement to meet is for signatures of residents who pledge to purchase the plate.
Applicants used to be on the hook for 500, gathered within any amount of time. Beginning July 1, that’s doubled to 1,000 dated signatures collected within a single year.
The BMV checks submissions for completion, then forwards them to an interim legislative committee — led by Pressel and Sen. Mike Crider, R-Greenfield — for review.
The committee makes its recommendations. Then, the agency conducts its own review. Just five can be recommended and approved annually, at most.
Pressel’s law also doubled maintenance requirements.
Groups already in the program must sell 500 in the first two years and then annually. For plates issued after Jan. 1, the bar rises to 1,000 sales in the first two years and annually after.
Some clear the bar easily.

“For us, it’s not been difficult to meet the requirement,” Ivy Tech’s Michalak said. “I think the challenge is just ensuring that we continue to make the case to individuals that this is a great way to support students.”
But those that fall short spend a year on probation. Missing the mark a second time results in termination.
“We were having quite a few folks struggling,” Pressel said.
His theory? Groups that took multiple years to get 500 signatures — which are an expression of interest rather than a commitment to buy — had “slim to none” chances of cracking 500 sales a year, every year.
“And that’s why the interim committee’s seeing some of these license plates come back to us, and we were having to take some away,” Pressel said. “So, rather than have to deal with that, maybe set the standard a little bit higher and set the time frame a little bit shorter.”
“By raising the bar, I think we streamline that process a little bit, and we don’t give anybody any false hope,” he added.
From 2007 through 2024, an average of 15 groups annually failed to make 500 sales, according to BMV data. At a 1,000-sale cutoff, 34 would’ve failed each year, on average.
Current participants are grandfathered into the lower sales requirement. The hike is prospective because “that’s not what they agreed to” when they signed up, Pressel said.
His goal was to ensure the BMV at least breaks even on managing and producing less popular plates.
The BMV indicated that’s not a concern, however.
The agency “does not incur additional costs to produce or administer these plates,” Dunn said.
On the edge
Thousands descended upon Ohio’s Kings Island one sweltering July weekend for an adventure away from medical appointments, treatments, bills and fears.
Parents, healthy children and those with life-threatening medical conditions frolicked free of charge, in a collaboration between Hoosier and Buckeye chapters of children’s charity A Kid Again.
In November, they will gather again at the Indiana State Fairgrounds for a “winter wonderland” featuring a Santa Claus, a DJ, bounce houses, face painting, rabbits and more.
“These families usually feel very isolated and very alone and or forgotten,” said Katie Pappas, who leads A Kid Again’s Indiana chapter.
The outings — dubbed “adventures” — give them “hope,” time to make memories together and connect with others like them, outside the doctor’s office.
But, because enrollment has ballooned from a couple dozen to more than 1,200 families, “there’s no way a venue or a partner can cover that whole cost for us,” Pappas said. Donations are key.

After chapters in Ohio earned “significant” support off speciality license plates there, A Kid Again Indiana spent two years gathering signatures to get its own.
“It may be small to some, but it’s honestly huge to us,” Pappas said. “It’s that recurring gift, every month, that … helps us as an organization become more sustainable, not only from a financial standpoint, but also from a brand-awareness standpoint.”
The chapter often hears from families who’ve unexpectedly connected with fellow enrollees at Riley, the Peyton Manning Children’s Hospital at Ascension St. Vincent or even the grocery store via the plate.
“The joy that comes out of them … it’ll melt your heart,” Pappas said.
But three years in, A Kid Again Indiana has fallen short on sales and is on probation. The chapter could lose its plate at the turn of the year.
Pappas’ team has embarked on an “all-out blitz” to keep the plate — highlighting it in communications with enrollees, donors and volunteers; posting on social media and running paid advertisements; printing big posters about the plate to display at adventures and fundraising events; and more.
Still, Pappas is worried.
If the chapter is kicked out of the program, it would have to wait two years to reapply. Then, it would be subject to the higher signature and sales requirements.
“We’ll really have to take a look at: is it worth our time? Because we are so small and lean as a staff, I’m just not sure that it’ll make sense,” she said.

Mikie Sherrill wants to freeze electric rates — a plan that faces some hurdles if Sherrill is elected governor in November. (Getty Images)A pitch by Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill to freeze energy rates for a year if she is elected governor in the fall could boost affordability for New Jersey residents amid a steep and continuing spike to wholesale electricity prices — but designing such a freeze won’t be simple.
Sherrill’s path to rate caps would prove winding because the price-setting capacity auctions spurring recent rate spikes fall outside of state officials’ control, and offsetting those increases elsewhere could cost the state hundreds of millions in revenue, risk delaying new power generation, or leave ratepayers with larger bills down the line.
New Jersey and the 12 other states on the grid run by PJM Interconnection have seen electricity prices soar as artificial intelligence data centers’ mammoth energy needs push demand toward the edge of the grid’s peak power output, spurring concerns over affordability across the system.
Sherrill’s pitch comes as New Jerseyans’ rising electric bills have become a key issue in this year’s race for governor. Sherrill in November faces Republican former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli.
“A lot of the costs in a customer’s bill are direct pass-throughs from PJM. Those costs can’t really be frozen. You’re going to continue to see those costs show up on your electric bill,” said Abe Silverman, a research scholar at Johns Hopkins University who studies energy regulation.
But regulators still have opportunities to offset rising energy prices to keep the consumer rates steady by requiring regulators to temporarily bar investments in grid infrastructure, delay utilities’ ability to recoup the cost of prior investments, or lower utilities’ profit margins on those investments, Silverman said.
Utilities’ profit margins on investments are typically fixed at about 9.6% in New Jersey, and the state’s four electric distribution companies — regulated utilities like PSE&G and Jersey Central Power and Light that deliver bills and electricity to customers — do not profit on the sale of electricity, which they pass through at cost.
Each of Sherrill’s options comes at a cost. Delays to some infrastructure upgrades can lock out new generation and reduce grid reliability. 
Regulators have already delayed some transmission infrastructure related to offshore wind projects that are stalled amid a federal permitting and leasing freeze.
Delaying utilities’ ability to recoup their investments could expose the state’s four electric distribution companies to financial harm, while lowering their ability to profit from infrastructure projects could disincentivize future grid upgrades.
It’s not clear how ready New Jersey’s four regulated utilities are to withstand the economics of a rate freeze.
A spokesperson for the New Jersey Utilities Association did not return a request for comment. A statement issued by the association’s president, Rich Henning, in response to Sherrill’s proposal acknowledged growing price concerns but did not directly state a position on a rate freeze.
“We share New Jersey residents’ frustration with the significant bill increases from higher energy supply costs,” Henning said in the statement. “It’s important to remember that New Jersey electric companies don’t control or earn any profit from electric supply prices. We have been sounding the alarm on the power supply-demand imbalance and advocating for market reforms for years.”
Wholesale electricity prices are set by a three-year blend of annual auction prices. New Jersey’s electric distribution companies play no role in that process, though polling has shown residents still place the largest share of blame for rising prices on their utility provider.
Other parts of ratepayers’ bills, like certain energy sales taxes or the state’s societal benefits charge — a roughly 3% surcharge on all New Jersey electricity bills — could be targeted to reduce rates, Silverman said.
Changes there could also be unattractive for a new governor facing budgetary challenges. Reducing energy sales taxes would impact revenue at the state and local levels. The state is expected to collect more than $1.1 billion from sales taxes on energy in the current fiscal year, including through energy tax receipts that are meant to be passed on to municipalities but are mostly retained by the state.
The societal benefits charge helps fund energy assistance and efficiency programs, and officials have tapped its funds to incent solar and battery storage projects, which come online far faster than other types of generation.
The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities can delay utility projects and recoupments under its own regulatory power. Legislation could force a freeze, as it did when lawmakers overhauled the state’s regulatory system for energy in 1999.

Though much about Sherrill’s proposal remains unknown — her campaign did not return answers to a list of detailed questions about a rate freeze — she has said the freeze would remain in place for a year.
“On Day One as governor, I will declare a State of Emergency on Utility Costs and freeze rate hikes so families will not see bill increases as we massively expand cheaper energy generation to bring costs down,” the congresswoman said in a statement. “My priority is relief to New Jersey consumers, and I will bring everyone to the table to deliver it.”
Capacity prices are set to rise again next year as a result of a price-setting auction held in July. PJM has said those results are expected to raise ratepayer bills by between 1.5% and 5%, depending on a resident’s state, beginning June 1, 2026, or about six months into the new governor’s term.
Board of Public Utilities officials expect further increases to flow from next July’s capacity auctions, which would affect energy prices beginning June 2027.
There’s another, simpler avenue to freezing electricity rates: Officials could keep energy rates locked in place by directing utilities to defer seeking payment of the portions of bills that exceed price caps.
Bill deferrals aren’t unprecedented in New Jersey, though prior efforts have delivered mixed results.
In a bid to boost competition and reduce costs, New Jersey in 1999 decoupled electricity generators from the state’s regulated utilities. (PSE&G continues to operate nuclear plants in South Jersey.)
The Electric Discount and Energy Competition Act mandated that electricity rates be reduced by 10% then locked in place for a period of years, and allowed electric distribution companies to recover their generation costs, even when those costs exceeded price caps. Effectively, ratepayers were billed for only a portion of their electricity use, while the remaining portions were deferred.
A task force convened on the issue by then-Gov. Jim McGreevey estimated residential ratepayers’ deferred balances would reach an average of $299 by August 2003, before interest. That would be about $523 in real terms. 
Commercial and industrial customers’ deferred balances were far larger, averaging $2,362 and $34,827, respectively. At the time, utilities said they could need rate increases as large as 20% to cover the difference.
Silverman, a former general counsel for the utilities board, warned deregulation may not be the best point of comparison, as that shift entailed broad changes to the state’s regulatory system and allowances for utilities to recover costs from generation-related investments they were now required to shed.
“The better example might be pandemic cost recovery issues because restructuring was sort of a one-time thing where all the parties got together and negotiated and talked about how you were going to handle the transition, who was going to be paying what, what costs were locked in for what period of time,” he said.
When COVID-19-related business closures led to skyrocketing unemployment rates, utilities were barred from shutting off service for nonpayment between March 2020 and March 2023. Pandemic arrearages across hundreds of thousands of accounts rose above $416 million at the end of March 2023.
Jersey Central Power and Light, Atlantic City Electric, and Rockland Electric Company reported nearly $109 million in arrearages in July and June. PSE&G said its customers owed nearly $262.8 million in February, the most recent month for which filings are available. Utilities have forgiven millions in pandemic-related customer debts.

Some of the requests are months old, but all but one were submitted this year, said Stephanie Whitaker, spokeswoman for the attorney general’s office.
And while higher than most state agencies, the 126 requests is an improvement on the 224 Hanaway’s predecessor, Andrew Bailey, inherited when he took office in 2023. That number ballooned at one point during Bailey’s short stint as attorney general to more than 400, with Missourians stuck in limbo for months — and in some cases, years — waiting for public records to be turned over.
The backlog of public records requests has bedeviled Bailey since he was appointed to take over the office after Eric Schmitt resigned to join the U.S. Senate. It’s a situation observers say would be unacceptable for any government agency but is especially problematic for the office in charge of enforcing Missouri’s Sunshine Law — designed to ensure the public has access to government records and meetings. 
Bailey assigned five staffers to deal with Missouri Sunshine Law backlog, Whitaker said — four attorneys, one intern and a custodian of records. It’s why only 126 requests remain unfinished, she said, despite the office receiving more than 400 between January and July. 
“There is definitely not a massive backlog that Catherine will be inheriting,” Whitaker said. 
‘Black hole’: Public faces long delays obtaining records from Missouri attorney general

 
Bailey is resigning from office early to become co-deputy director of the FBI. Gov. Mike Kehoe appointed Hanaway, a former U.S. attorney and speaker of the Missouri House, as his replacement. She will be sworn into office in a private ceremony Monday morning.
Testifying to a Missouri Senate committee in February, Bailey said the office had received 1,465 requests under the Sunshine Law since January 2023 and managed to complete work on 1,390. Only 75 pending requests remained, he said at the time, a tally some lawmakers still felt was too high.
The only request left over from 2024, Whitaker said, produced more than 40,000 records and will take some time to complete. But, she said that is not slowing down work on others. 
Whitaker signaled a change in the office’s policy that has focused on working through requests on a first come, first serve basis. That meant newer inquiries that were small and easily dispensed with sat on hold as staff worked on older and more expansive requests.
Critics argued the policy exacerbated the problem, letting requests pile up and ensuring the backlog took even longer to work through.
Whitaker said that’s no longer the case. 
“It has changed a little,” she said. “We’re not putting you or anyone else on hold to satisfy this one request from 2024. So it would not be accurate to say inquiries are fulfilled in the order they’ve been received.”
But that doesn’t mean the public doesn’t still face delays.
In May, The Independent submitted a request for Bailey’s public calendar. Most state agencies turn around that type of request in a matter of days. The attorney general’s office turned the records over last week. 
While slow, it’s still an improvement over previous attempts by The Independent to access Bailey’s calendar that took more than 10 months.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1063332692-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-08 06:56:46.909658

It has not survived thus far without courageous voices defending it.
It will neither survive today nor move forward without our courageous voices.
Let us keep in mind that America is an infant compared to many countries.
Next year we will be celebrating 250 years of this country’s unique existence. What will we be celebrating?
America’s strength, when challenged, has been in her people’s ability to put aside their selfish needs and interests and come together, fight and even die for the values and way of life that have set this country apart.
Historically, this has been the case whether the threat was from external or internal adversaries.
Whether it was entering World War I to make the world safe for democracy, or World War II in the fight against fascism, or even back to our own Civil War, courageous people came together for a greater cause.
There have been many other threats to our democracy since this nation’s founding. But the people stood and fought for the fundamental principles and what they believed was  good about democracy and the way of life it provides.
Fast forward to today. We are confronted by a different kind of assault against our democratic form of government.
It is both an internal and external threat playing out at the same time for all to see.
Within our borders, in a barrage of rapid fire, we are at once confronted with major challenges of how we should continue to function as a democratic republic. Simultaneously, we see long-standing agreements undone and radical shifts in how we relate to other countries.
On the world stage, there are signs that America’s allies and foes alike are wondering what America stands for as they encounter and endure a whiplash of positions caused by policies and actions changing almost on a daily or weekly basis.
Here at home, efforts are afoot at the local, state and federal level to eliminate, nullify and render impotent the bedrock of our democratic form of government: the constitution where the will and power of the people as expressed in elections and adherence to the rule of law are inherent.
Many of those efforts did not begin recently.
Look at the fundamental right of voting. In recent years, many states have pursued and implemented measures to make it difficult for long-standing citizens to cast a vote.
Today, at the federal level, the executive branch is seeking to change by edict how we cast our vote, eliminating some ways altogether rather than making exercising the vote more accessible.
Such efforts can only result in disenfranchising and silencing many legitimate and deserving citizens voices.
It does not stop there.
Look at what is happening in states calling special legislative sessions to change Congressional districts simply to influence the distribution of partisan political power, with utter disregard for whose voting power they minimize or totally silence.
It is happening in Missouri and other states.
There is more.
In Missouri, while the legislature has returned for a special session to redraw districts mid-census to control the balance of power in Washington, they are also going to try to pass legislation to make direct participation in the democratic process more difficulty by setting higher hurdles for a petition initiative to pass.
So, what are we to do?
Nothing?
There is an adage worth remembering: If you don’t use it, you lose it.
While often issued as a warning to maintain optimum body functions and usefulness through regular and rigorous exercises, it also applies to other areas.
As in physical health and relationships, it seems particularly apropos to exercising our individual rights to maintain, protect and preserve our democracy.
We can complain about what our elected representatives are doing or not doing to uphold our state and U.S constitutions, to uphold the rule of law, to represent, protect and advance our interests.
We can complain about their cowardice, their repeated propensity to put their selfish interests ahead of their constituents, but why are they comfortable doing it time after  time, during election term after election term?
Because we are not using the powers invested in us. More importantly, we are at risk of losing them.
We cannot afford to continue to embrace a sedentary political life, characterized by silence, inaction where we allow others — our own elected officials or outsiders to dictate what goes on in our state, how the public process and decisions are determined without input or oversight.
We must use and exercise our political power to ensure a political process that makes decisions that are in our best interests.
Vigilance. Resistance. Resilience.
This is what is required of us now to make sure that our democratic form of government prevails.
Lest we lose it.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OurDemocracy1-Rustic-1024x760.jpg,,,2025-09-08 06:56:46.909658

The facility, Algoa Correctional Center, is one of four Missouri prisons with no air conditioning in any of the housing units. In Jefferson City, where Algoa is located, the first 90-degree day of the year arrived in May.
The following month, a blistering heat wave torched the Midwest, bringing temperatures in the mid-90s for a week straight. Similar bouts of extreme heat continued into July and August, following a pattern of record-breaking temperatures that has become increasingly common in recent years.

This article was published in partnership with The Marshall Project – St. Louis, a nonprofit news team covering Missouri’s criminal justice systems. Subscribe to their email list, and follow The Marshall Project on Instagram, Reddit and YouTube.

In July, attorneys argued that Cole County Circuit Judge Christopher Limbaugh should require the Missouri Department of Corrections to immediately create a heat mitigation plan for Algoa.
When a man housed at Algoa died on July 23, MacArthur Justice Center attorneys were concerned that his death could be heat-related. Missouri Department of Corrections Communications Director Karen Pojmann said on Aug. 22 that an autopsy has been ordered, and the cause of death is still unconfirmed. Pojmann added that, to date, there have been no heat-related deaths in Missouri prisons.
“Multiple times throughout the summer, conditions were ripe for heat-related illness or death,” said Shubra Ohri, one of the lawyers on the case. “There were a few weeks where the heat index surpassed 100 degrees for days. The risk of heatstroke was scary and acute, and it happens every year.”
As of Sept. 2, Limbaugh has yet to issue a ruling on a mitigation plan.
While litigation unfolds, people in prisons without air conditioning continue to endure the effects of extreme heat, which is often exacerbated by building materials that trap heat and humidity.
The Marshall Project – St. Louis asked Jeremy Hann, one of the people who gave sworn testimony in the lawsuit against Algoa, to log his days during the first heat wave of the summer. The heat wave began on June 20 and lasted for about a week, with outdoor air temperatures reaching 96 degrees Fahrenheit and a heat index of up to 105 degrees in eastern Missouri, according to the National Weather Service.
Hann has since been relocated to Boonville Correctional Center, and is scheduled to be released later this year. Originally from Kansas City, he earned his high school equivalency while in prison and is currently enrolled in Missouri’s Central Methodist University, studying business. The log below is representative of entries from the week, drawing mostly from Sunday, June 22. Entries have been edited for length and clarity.
 6 a.m.

I wake up to the lights on — breakfast! It’s hot already, my pillow mat and sheets are soaked in sweat. For breakfast, it’s oatmeal and peanut butter. I eat, but it makes my stomach hurt it’s so hot! I lay back down and try my best to go back to bed.
The worst part about this whole thing is my sink hardly works — water just trickles from the hole it comes out of. The drain doesn’t drain more than maybe a centimeter an hour. There is a film over the water that’s in there, and rust around the edges of the sink … so I have no fluids to drink other than ice in a cup they give us, or the drink we get with our meals. I can hear a fan in the hallway, but feel no air.
I finally fall asleep by counting the water droplets as they drip into my sink.
 11 a.m.

I get woken up again for lunch time, but I can’t eat – it’s so hot and miserable. I have a sick feeling in my stomach. My face, arms, and upper body are sticky from sweating in my sleep.
Even as I lay here writing this, I have a cold rag on my chest and it’s almost dry already. I just dunked it in the nasty sink water — it stinks, but it’s all we got to cool off with.
 12 p.m.

It is now ice pass (when correctional officers hand out a cup of ice to people on hot days) and I get super excited — it’s like Christmas! I have my insulated cup with me, so the ice lasts about 2 hours unless I eat it really fast to cool off. Without the cup, it melts in a matter of minutes.
With no airflow, though, I can still hardly eat lunch. I just lay on my bunk, which is still damp, and the humidity is up today so that doesn’t help the sheets to dry.
I flip my pillow over, and the pillow case has already got rust on it.
 3 p.m.

The new shift of correctional officers comes in and I’m already really thirsty – out of ice and no water to drink. I’ve asked the officers to tell maintenance to come fix the sink. They haven’t, but still I ask every day.
I’ve got my towel on my pillow and a T-shirt on my mat to keep the sweat off. Like this, it’s just tolerable. Again, the fan in the hallway is a teaser. I wonder: How can this be legal? Dinner is soon and I’m not even close to being hungry because of the heat.
 4 p.m.

The correctional officers bring us the dinner trays, but the best thing is the sweet tea. I wait for ice to drink it.
It’s really muggy and the smell of food makes my stomach super nauseous, but I eat anyways because I’m starving. I get done eating and wait for them to bring around the last ice we get till tomorrow morning. I lay here looking around the cell and think, How is this humane? There’s mold on the walls close to the ceiling. I feel like these conditions are worse than most pigs and cows get treated.
 6 p.m.

It’s heating up in here, so I sit up on my bunk and try to focus on my book. I can’t, so I watch the Pando app (a Christian app for incarcerated people) on my tablet … ice finally comes and it’s like I won the lottery. But it’s short-lived because the ice melts super fast again, so I just lay down and close my eyes. It’s hard to breathe so I just hope it cools down soon.
 7:30 p.m.

I don’t want to lay down, so I pace the cell. I have run out of ice and it’s so humid it’s miserable. I wish they would transfer me so I could get out of this hole.
 11 p.m.

It’s finally starting to cool down. I close my eyes and try to get comfortable. Finally the light goes out, but I’m still uncomfortable. It’s so sticky, I know it’s going to be dreadful sleeping tonight.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/NUOVO_STL-HEAT-LOG_250904_header-1024x536.jpg,,,2025-09-08 06:56:46.909658

Winters with enough snow cover that the family of ski-enthusiasts could get on the slopes from Thanksgiving to Easter. 
But despite the state’s continued connection with ice and snow, winters like those of her family’s past are gone. Climate change has caused Wisconsin’s winters to warm more than any other season. A number of recent winters have seen drought conditions with little to no snow across the northern part of the state — severely damaging winter tourism and canceling or modifying events such as the American Birkebeiner. While data shows that the amount of snowfall on average is similar to decades past, the weather doesn’t stay as cold throughout the winter, meaning that the snow melts before it can accumulate to the truly deep levels of previous generations.

“I hear all these great stories about how they got to ski over Thanksgiving, how they skied past Easter time, how they went on all these great trips around the state of Wisconsin to all these ski hills, mountains, all these amazing places,” Dunn, a 17-year-old Onalaska resident, tells the Wisconsin Examiner. “And I can’t help but feel incredibly saddened by this. I will never experience these things. These are family traditions, trips that my family would go on, with family members, with friends, and do all these amazing and fun things. And honestly, I do feel left out. I feel let down by my state. I can no longer enjoy these things due to the direct results of fossil fuels in the environment.” 
Dunn is one of 15 young people suing the state of Wisconsin, arguing that state laws violate their constitutional rights and worsen climate change. The lawsuit mirrors a similar lawsuit from children in Montana, who successfully argued that the state had to consider the greenhouse gas emissions and climate change impact of permits involving fossil fuels. 
The children are represented in the lawsuit by Madison-based Midwest Environmental Advocates and Oregon-based Our Children’s Trust. 
In Wisconsin, the suit argues that state lawmakers have made a number of declarations that the state’s energy production should be decarbonized and the greenhouse gas emissions of that production should be reduced, but state laws prevent that from happening. 
The state’s law for siting power plants requires that the state Public Service Commission determine that “[t]he proposed facility will not have undue adverse impact on other environmental values such as, but not limited to, ecological balance, public health and welfare, historic sites, geological formations, the aesthetics of land and water and recreational use.” However the law also prohibits the PSC from considering air pollution, including from greenhouse gas emissions, in that determination. 
Additionally, the state set a goal in 2005 that 10% of Wisconsin’s energy come from renewable sources by 2015. That goal was met in 2013. However, now that the goal has been met, state law treats it as a ceiling on renewable energy the PSC can require. 
“The Commission cannot require any electric provider to increase its percentage of renewable energy generation above the required level,” the lawsuit states, meaning that for more than a decade, Wisconsin’s energy regulators have been unable to push the state’s power companies to develop more renewable energy sources. 
Coal and natural gas make up 75% of the energy produced in Wisconsin and renewable sources make up 17%. 
Skylar Harris, an attorney for Midwest Environmental Advocates, says that children today are going to spend most of their lives dealing with the effects of climate change on their health and lifestyles yet don’t yet have the ability to vote and influence environmental policy. 
“I think people are really starting to acknowledge the direness of the situation that we’re in and the situation that climate change is causing, and how it impacts our inherent rights such as life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness,” Harris says. “And courts are really starting to see that without the right to a stable climate, which is what we’re arguing for in this case, the rights to life, the rights to liberty, the rights to the pursuit of happiness, they mean nothing, because people can’t pursue them to the fullest extent.” 
Harris says that if the lawsuit is successful, she believes that the PSC will use its new authority to deny permits for new or expanded fossil fuel burning power plants and push the state’s power companies to expand their renewable capacities. 
In the Montana lawsuit, officials argued that the state can’t be held responsible for the effects of climate change on the children in that lawsuit because climate change is caused by emissions from across the globe. Harris says that yes, climate change is a global problem, but it gets fixed by individual governments doing something about it. 
“Climate change is a global problem, but there is no such thing as a global government,” she says. “So if we are to address this global issue, that means every individual, every business and every government, including the state of Wisconsin, has to step forward and do its part. And that’s what we’re trying to make sure is happening with this lawsuit.”
The 15 children in the lawsuit represent a wide swathe of Wisconsin. They live in urban and rural parts of the state and include athletes who have had wildfire smoke affect their sports, farm kids who have had droughts and heavy rains affect their families’ livelihoods and members of the state’s Native American tribes who have seen their cultural traditions put at risk. 
Dunn has spent much of her childhood fighting for environmental causes as president of her local 4-H club and has won three grants for environmentally focused projects from the Bloomberg Philanthropies Climate Action Fund. She says she joined the lawsuit because it can help her community and kids like her across the state. 
“I began my environmental work because I always believed in doing the right thing,” she says. “I believe in fighting for my community, fighting for my family, fighting for my siblings, fighting for everyone, fighting for youth and fighting for families.”
She adds that the PSC “knows that what they are doing is wrong. The governor and the Wisconsin Legislature have indicated that they want renewable energy, and the Public Service Commission simply isn’t changing the laws, and the Legislature isn’t changing the laws.” 
Dunn’s family has lived western Wisconsin’s Driftless Region for generations and she spent most of her childhood in Vernon County. She says the Mississippi River is “almost a family member.”
But massive rain events causing flooding and erosion triggered a massive boulder to tumble down a bluff and into her backyard, making her family fear that it wasn’t safe in their home anymore. They moved north to La Crosse County. 
“We felt very unsafe in the childhood home that I planned to live my entire life in. We made the difficult decision to move cities, move counties, move school districts,” she says. 
A member of her school’s tennis team, Dunn says hotter summers and poor air quality caused by wildfires elsewhere on the continent have forced her to change how and when she practices. Flooding has prevented her and her family from swimming off the dock at her grandparents’ home and affected the work done at their walnut tree farm. 
Dunn says that for her, joining the lawsuit is about standing up and trying to force her state government to admit it has a role to play in mitigating climate change and responding to the ways in which climate change has harmed her life and the lives of the other kids in the suit. 
“Ultimately, our country knows the science that is creating climate change, the fossil fuel industry, and especially Wisconsin, they can no longer stand behind saying, ‘There’s nothing we can do. We don’t know about it. There’s nothing that we can do,’” she says. “But ultimately, we have the science and technology to make changes and to save my life and my future children’s life and have a safe and healthy environment.”

Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) speaks Friday at a press conference to promote her legislation that would extend enhanced tax breaks on the cost of insurance purchased through the Affordable Care Act. Business owners Kyle LaFond, left, and Evan Dannells also spoke in favor of extending the tax credits. (Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)Federal legislation that would hold down the cost of health insurance for millions of Americans and nearly a quarter-million Wisconsin residents has quiet support from Republicans in the Senate, according to Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisconsin).
So far, however, none of them have spoken out, Baldwin said at a news conference in Madison on Friday.
Baldwin has introduced a bill that would extend tax credits that have cut the health insurance costs for people who buy coverage on the federal marketplace, HealthCare.gov.
When the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was enacted in 2010 and the HealthCare.gov marketplace was launched to make it easier and cheaper for people without health insurance to buy coverage, the law included tax credits to lower the cost of premiums for people with incomes up to 400% of the federal poverty guideline.
In 2021, the premium tax credits were supercharged to impart far greater savings to people buying insurance through the marketplace. The enhanced tax credits were extended in 2022 with a sunset at the end of this year.
The extra tax breaks helped insurance coverage through the HealthCare.gov marketplace rise to record highs in the last few years, both in the U.S. and in Wisconsin.
“This tax break, the enhanced premium tax credit, saves more than 230,000 Wisconsinites an average of $500 every single month” on their insurance premiums, Baldwin said. “Not extending these tax breaks and jacking up costs on the open marketplace will crush families — but also small businesses that are the fabric of our communities.”
In January Baldwin and New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) introduced legislation to make the enhanced tax credits permanent, in place of the lower tax credits that will resume when the enhanced credits expire Dec. 31.
A paper published Sept. 3 by the Georgetown University Law School Center on Poverty and Inequality reported that according to the Congressional Budget Office, without the enhanced credits 30 million more people will lack health insurance by 2034 — an average of 3.8 million a year.
For people with incomes between 100% and 150% of the federal poverty guideline, insurance premiums will go up by 7.9% between 2026 and 2034, the Georgetown researchers calculated.
For people with incomes between 150% and 400% of the federal poverty guideline, premiums would rise between 29% and 160% in the same period, according to the report.
The report also notes without the enhanced tax credits, people who lose Medicaid coverage due to cuts in the Republican megabill President Donald Trump signed on July 4 could be unable to afford insurance on HealthCare.gov.
‘Encouraged by conversations’
“There are, in the Senate, Republicans who have quietly indicated that they want to extend breaks to make [HealthCare.gov] marketplace insurance affordable,” Baldwin said. “I don’t have a count yet to tell you that we have enough, but I’m encouraged by the conversations I’m having.”
In the U.S. House, a bipartisan bill has been introduced extending the enhanced credits for a year — “notably getting them past the midterm elections,” Baldwin said. But that’s not long enough for her.
“I don’t think this should be political,” Baldwin said. “I think this should be something that Democrats and Republicans should agree on, that people should be able to afford their health care coverage.”
Baldwin’s press conference was held at Access Community Health Center, which serves low-income Wisconsin residents. Joining Baldwin, Madison chef and restaurant owner Evan Dannells said that the passage of the ACA and the opening of the HealthCare.gov marketplace made health care newly available in his industry after years of the youngest group of workers going uninsured.
Before the ACA, for people who entered hospitality jobs in their late teens or early 20s, “it was essentially, fundamentally understood that you wouldn’t have health care until you were in your 30s,” Dannells said.
The ACA required insurers to cover young people on their parents’ plans up to the age of 26, then made it possible for them to find more affordable coverage at HealthCare.gov after that.
“I have a half dozen full time employees over the age of 26 at a restaurant, and so what they’re going to do is they’re going to leave for corporate jobs that have the buying power to get their premiums down,” Dannells said — something not possible for small employers.
“This is essentially the beginning of the dismantlement of the Affordable Care Act with no plan and process for the future,” Dannells said.
Kyle LaFond, owner of a Middleton manufacturing firm that makes custom cosmetic products for celebrity brands, said the ACA and the HealthCare.gov was “a godsend” for small employers such as his company. “These subsidies are important because, of course, now more than ever, folks are living paycheck to paycheck,” he said.
Baldwin said she will campaign to attach her proposal to one of “several must-pass bills coming up in the days and the weeks ahead.”
Avoiding the ‘cliff’
While the enhancements increased the value of the tax credits for people with incomes up to 400% of the poverty guideline, they also made tax credits available for the first time to people with higher incomes — up to more than 1000% of the guideline.
Baldwin told the Wisconsin Examiner that those higher income groups were added to avoid “what we call a cliff.” That occurs when a person’s income rises even slightly above a benefit’s income ceiling — suddenly cutting off the benefit and possibly demanding they make a repayment. Many safety-net programs have cliffs, she explained.
In Wisconsin, most Medicaid programs have income limits, and many are only available to people with incomes up to the federal poverty guideline, she said. People who may work several part-time jobs and usually qualify for Medicaid can find themselves kicked off the program if they have a brief boost in their income, due to overtime work, for instance.
“Then you have to do all sorts of work to get back on, and then you have to be very mindful that you don’t get an extra hour or a raise” that could lead to being kicked off again, Baldwin said.
“So we were trying to avoid there being the sort of equivalent cliff in the Affordable Care Act marketplace tax credits,” Baldwin said.
For that reason, her bill would continue the tax credits available to the higher income population, she said, “and I would be committed to not reintroducing a cliff.”
Baldwin criticized GOP lawmakers for passing the Republican megabill that extended Trump’s 2017 tax cuts without considering an extension of the enhanced ACA credits.
“You would think including tax breaks for tens of millions of families to afford health care would be a centerpiece of that legislation. Right? Wrong,” Baldwin said.
Instead, she charged, the bill made cuts to Medicaid and the federal nutrition program SNAP to pay for tax cuts “in favor of the biggest corporations and the wealthiest Americans.”

SHOSHONE, Idaho — Just east of town, a road cuts through sagebrush and fields of cows toward Donley Farms, where Darren Taber manages the multigenerational operation. The Sawtooth Mountains rise in the distance, marking the northern edge of the Snake River Plain — the backdrop for Taber’s work.
As the Magic Valley wakes up, the 900-cow dairy is already in motion. Taber has owned Donley Farms for more than 25 years. These days, he focuses on crop and management decisions — planning pesticide spray schedules, overseeing planting and training the next generation of family farmers.
It’s demanding, unpredictable work – but for Taber, the farm is also home.
“It’s the best place in the world to raise a family,” he said. “It’s a lot of late nights. There’s a lot of times that I’m (working) 24-hour days. … If a milker doesn’t show up, guess what? You gotta go milk.”
Taber manages the operation with his son. But more and more, he has been pulled away from this work and into policy, traveling to Washington, D.C., to advocate for immigration reform that has been stalled for years.
“I have been there for the Goodlatte bill. I have been there for the Lofgren and Newhouse bill. I have been there for Sen. Crapo’s bill,” Taber said, ticking off more than six years’ worth of legislation intended to address immigration reform for agricultural employers and workers.



“What I cannot stand is the fact that Congress cannot get anything across the finish line,” he said. “Maybe we can’t solve it all in one big, beautiful bill. Who knows? Maybe we can.”
The Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration has left farmers worried about their livelihoods and workers frightened for their lives. It’s also renewed bipartisan calls to implement reforms for the people who help feed America.
“Yeah, get the criminals out,” Taber said. “But your farmworkers are not your criminals.”
President Donald Trump has indicated he might be amenable to a solution.
In June – after reports of raids at a New Mexico dairy, at a Nebraska meat production plant and in the fields of California – Trump took to social media and promised that “changes are coming” for “our great farmers” who are losing “very good, long time workers.”

The administration then ordered a pause on workplace raids in agriculture and hospitality, but reversed course days later.
Trump then said in a July 3 speech that he was working to help farmers who depend on migrant labor – indicating his administration was making progress on legislation to address the issue.
“We have a country to run,” he said, “and we wanna have them come in and we wanna have them help our farmers.”
Trump and other leaders have discussed a work program that would ensure farmers have the labor they need but would not provide amnesty for farmworkers who lack legal status.

Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins has said the goal is a 100% American workforce and that reforms could include a shift toward automation or looking to the 34 million “able-bodied adults on Medicaid” as a way to fill labor needs, adding that deportations must be carried out strategically “so as not to compromise our food supply.”
Most farmworkers earn less than $40,000 annually. Nearly 70% of people working in agriculture were not born in the United States, according to federal data, and about 42% of that workforce lacks legal status.
Yet protections for workers without legal status are limited.
“During the pandemic, it was actually the first Trump administration that designated farmworkers essential,” said Antonio De Loera-Brust, a spokesman for United Farm Workers. “Five years later, these same workers who we said were essential are now being treated as disposable.”
The H-2A visa is a temporary permit that allows farmers to hire foreign farmworkers if there aren’t enough domestic workers to fill labor needs — a growing reality for employers.
“We have not deferred to migrant labor or H-2A programs because we’re trying to save money,” said Andrew Mickelsen, partner of a large potato farm in Idaho Falls. “We’re doing it because that void is not filling up.”

In 2014, the U.S. issued around 90,000 H-2A visas. Last year, that number rose to 315,000.
Yet industries that require year-round labor, such as Idaho dairy, cannot legally hire workers using the temporary visa.
Since 2019, some members of Congress have been attempting to address these issues through legislation that would provide temporary legal status to agricultural workers.
The latest version of the bill, introduced in May, would allow a qualified individual with extended employment in farmwork to become a “certified agricultural worker” on the condition of continued employment.
The bill would also provide at least 20,000 H-2A visas each year for the next decade for farmers with year-round labor needs. Half of those visas would be reserved for the dairy industry.
Similar legislation has twice passed the U.S. House with bipartisan support but then died in the U.S. Senate, noted Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat who is co-sponsoring the bill.
“We are reaching out to our Senate friends on a bipartisan basis to encourage them to move this bill forward,” Lofgren told News21.
News21 also contacted Republican Reps. Mike Simpson of Idaho, David Valadao of California and Dan Newhouse of Washington – all co-sponsors of the current bill. None responded to requests for comment.

Zach Rutledge, an agricultural economics expert at Michigan State University, said the bill’s pathway to legal status may be what’s holding it back.
“It’s hard to get bipartisan support when you’re talking about legalizing hundreds of thousands of unauthorized workers – especially in our current political climate,” Rutledge said.
Other bills look to expand H-2A flexibility, create a temporary status for those who’ve been in the U.S. for years, and implement E-Verify nationwide, but labor advocates say reforms must also guarantee higher wages, better working conditions and union rights.

Given that immigrants play an important role across many sectors of the country’s economy, tension between business interests and those who support mass deportations is growing.
“We understand the need for enforcement,” said Rick Naerebout, CEO of the Idaho Dairymen’s Association. “But we also have to have a conversation around immigration reform so that we don’t damage our economy.”
 In Idaho, immigration enforcement tensions rise

Stephanie Mickelsen was at her home in Idaho Falls when her sons started calling and texting. Immigration agents had arrived at one of her farms.
It was Jan. 24, three days after Ryan Spoon, vice chair of the Ada County Republican Committee, accused Mickelsen on social media of hiring illegal workers and said he had contacted Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Her operation, Mickelsen Farms, is one of the largest potato producers in the region.
Agents detained one immigrant employee that day, but Mickelsen, a sixth-generation farmer and Republican state representative, said the incident served as a warning for anyone speaking out against immigration enforcement.
“I became more fearful of actually standing up and just trying to have honest, earnest debate,” she said.
Last year, as the Idaho House considered legislation to allow local law enforcement to arrest immigrants in the state without authorization, Mickelsen noted that businesses all across Idaho likely employ such immigrants.

“If you guys think that you haven’t been touched by an illegal immigrant’s hands in some way, through either your traveling or your food, you’re kidding yourselves,” she said during floor debate. “We have people here that provide great value to our communities and to our society.”
Agriculture is the backbone of Idaho’s economy, contributing some $37 billion in sales in 2022, according to a University of Idaho report – mainly from farms spread out across the 400-milelong Snake River Plain in the southern part of the state.

Warm days, cool nights and abundant sunshine create ideal growing conditions for a wide range of crops, especially potatoes, of which Idaho leads the nation in production.
From the Idaho Potato Museum in Blackfoot to a potato-shaped mascot named Spuddy Buddy and even holding a potato drop on New Year’s Eve, Idaho has fully leaned into its spud reputation.
While potatoes remain the icon, the dairy industry has quietly overtaken crops as the top agricultural sector by revenue, generating just under $11 billion in annual sales from over 300 dairy farms and around 700,000 cows, according to the Idaho Dairymen’s Association.
Today, Idaho ranks fourth in the nation for milk production, with dairy farms heavily concentrated in the Magic Valley – home to Taber’s farm. The industry has become a cultural staple in its own right, one that’s celebrated each summer at Dairy Days.
Idaho’s dairy industry relies on a labor force that comes primarily from Mexico, said Rick Naerebout, CEO of the dairymen’s association.
“When you (have) a workforce that’s 90% foreign born, and you don’t have access to a visa program, you can guess how dependent we are on an unauthorized workforce,” he said.
From both his office in Twin Falls and the halls of Congress, Naerebout has worked for decades with other dairy leaders in support of immigration reform. The goal is twofold: to secure legal status for existing workers, and to gain access to the H-2A visa program to meet labor demands.
After 20 years, Naerebout said, the needle has barely moved. If the issue isn’t addressed, he added, the ripple effect will be felt across the supply chain, increasing the price of dairy products.
“We can’t feed ourselves as a country if we don’t find a solution to this problem,” Naerebout said. “For our dairy producers … their business livelihood depends on it.”
The absence of immigration reform and a declining domestic workforce have contributed to a labor shortage across Idaho agriculture, according to Naerebout.
“There’s not an interest, and when there is an interest, there’s not the grit to stay in the job and actually see it through,” he said.

Naerebout pointed to data shared with him by an H-2A contractor. Last season, the contractor advertised for 6,000 positions. Just 35 domestic applications were submitted. Of the 35, 12 people were willing to be interviewed. Two were eventually hired, but neither made it to harvest.
Mickelsen Farms needs around 125 temporary workers to harvest several thousand acres, but it typically receives just one or two domestic applications. Andrew Mickelsen, who runs the operation alongside his mother and other relatives, said the company used to get by without using H-2A workers. Now they’re reliant on them.
“If we did not have the H-2A program, there would be no way for us to get our harvest done,” he said.
Mickelsen Farms insists it does what is required of any employer across the country when hiring workers: Collect I-9 and W-4 forms, and trust that workers’ documents are valid.
Recently, the Mickelsens have become even more vigilant in the hiring process, but they said there’s a line farmers can’t cross.
Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, an employer cannot reject valid documents, request additional ones or treat someone differently based on perceived immigration status or national origin. Doing so can open the employer up to legal penalties under federal law.
Stephanie Mickelsen said there’s a growing expectation that employers police workers’ legal status. She and other farmers disagree.
“You’re making bad guys out of employers who have followed the law,” she said. “Don’t make us your enforcer. Do your job.”
Aside from that January morning at Mickelsen Farms, there have been few reports of immigration raids in the state, but Mickelsen believes enforcement actions are happening quietly. According to a New York Times analysis, ICE arrests in Idaho are up a whopping 924% from last year — the highest percentage change in the nation.
“I think that there are raids going on; I think that everybody is trying to keep it really, really quiet,” she said. “I know people that are being served with I-9 audit requests. … I know that they’ve picked up people and removed people right and left, up and down this valley.
“But nobody’s talking about it,” she said, “because they’re all afraid.”
 In California, farmworkers continue to toil

As the sun rises over the golden hills of California’s Salinas Valley, the region’s 25,000 farmworkers are already hunched at the waist, planting and harvesting America’s produce.
At one operation off a two-lane road dotted with farm stands, a worker gathers cauliflower, a pouch of rubber bands hooked to his belt. Bands snake up his arm, and when he reaches into the pouch to resupply his stack, some scatter on the soil beneath his feet.
Most of his fellow farmworkers have their faces covered with wide-brimmed hats or bandannas to protect their skin from the sun. Within the first three hours of their shift, the temperature will climb by nearly 30 degrees.

The worker, S.H., emigrated from Hidalgo, Mexico, about 15 years ago. He requested anonymity because he, like most of his co-workers, is in the U.S. without legal status, and the fear looms that ICE officers could appear at any time.
“You don’t feel safe anywhere,” he said. “In the morning, you wake up and pray to God and say, ‘Let’s put ourselves in God’s hands, because he is the only one who decides.’”
S.H. is one of about 10 employees at an organic operation nestled in the fertile soil of San Benito County, a part of the “Salad Bowl of the World.”
California’s $58 billion agriculture industry supplies over a third of the nation’s vegetables and the majority of America’s fruits and nuts.
The state has the largest number of immigrants lacking legal status in the U.S., according to the Pew Research Center, and is home to about half of the unauthorized agricultural worker population, statistics show.
It is also a key target for carrying out Trump’s mass deportation agenda.
Since January, agents have raided farms in Santa Maria, Oxnard and Bakersfield, according to media outlets. ICE reports over 600 arrests in the state, though a New York Times analysis puts that number at about 5,800.
In early June, Trump deployed several thousand troops to Los Angeles to counter anti-ICE protests. And in early July, a farmworker died from injuries sustained fleeing agents who raided two cannabis farms in Carpinteria and Camarillo. About 360 other workers were arrested.
Tom Homan, who serves as Trump’s “border czar,” has set daily arrest goals in the thousands. Farmers, workers and advocates worry that could cripple the state’s labor force.
“If you’re arresting a farmworker at a gas station or at a church or dropping your kid off at school, that’s still a farmworker who’s being picked up,” said De Loera-Brust, the United Farm Workers spokesman. “That’s still a farmworker who’s not going to be able to go to work the next day.”

Zamora wonders why the Trump administration would want to deport the people who help stock grocery shelves.
“America would not be as great as it is now if all my workforce were taken away,” he said.
Lawmakers, he said, “need to wake up and they need to do something. And it needs to be done quickly – before it’s too late.”
M.M., her shirt damp with sweat and dew from an early morning of harvesting cauliflower at another farm, works without legal permission so she can support her daughter and son.
She’s been in the U.S. for 15 years. But now, she worries when she sends her children off to school that it will be the last time she sees them. They’re getting therapy to cope with the fear that their mother may not come home.
“We don’t know when they could detain us,” M.M. said. “Or they could come right here to work.”
Nearly every day, she hears about ICE’s presence near her home or the farm where she’s employed. She said she leaves the house only to go to work but knows other migrants have stopped working altogether.
“In the fields, they are running out of people,” she said. “There is a lot of fruit that is rotting.”
Each morning, she’s up before dawn, preparing for another eight-hour day dedicated to weeding, planting and harvesting.
“I’m still afraid due to the uncertainty of being deported,” she said. “But, oh well. We have to keep working and move forward.”

Kevin Stitt gives his State of the State Address in the House chamber of the state Capitol on Feb. 3, 2025. (Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)Editor’s note: Parts of this column contain graphic depictions of domestic violence.
It’s become clear two systems of justice exist in Oklahoma : one that caters to the good ol’ boys, and another for everyone else.
The good ol’ boy network features Republican officials shielding each other from the types of scrutiny that would get an everyday person skewered in the court of public opinion, fired from their job or thrown in jail.
Let’s take the case of state Rep. Ty Burns, R-Pawnee. For months, people at the highest levels of government kept silent about the fact that he was accused of not one, but two, separate and horrific attacks on his own family. 
In April, Burns used his pickup to chase a vehicle carrying two of his family members, according to court documents. He ran them into a ditch, injuring both occupants. In a second incident, Burns tried to gouge out his wife’s eye the Pawnee County Sheriff’s Office learned while investigating the roadway assaults. His wife’s injuries forced her to miss a week of work, according to court records.
To their credit, the Pawnee County Sheriff’s Office appears to have swiftly investigated both attacks, collecting recorded interviews and a video depicting Burns’ terrifying chase. The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation was called in, as was a child welfare specialist from the Department of Human Services.
But then, things were hushed up. The OSBI didn’t file the findings of their investigation with the court until Aug. 27. Burns was never arrested or charged with a crime for over four months.
Pawnee County District Attorney Mike Fisher himself recused from the matter, according to the Attorney General’s Office. Attorney General Gentner Drummond suddenly decided to step in. At some point, Burns hired his Republican colleague, state Rep. Chris Kannady, an attorney who is listed on his state House bio as “counselor to the Speaker,” to represent him. Kannady is also a donor to Drummond’s gubernatorial campaign. Burns hasn’t donated to Drummond, but either directly or via his campaign, he has donated to over two dozen seated House lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, according to ethics filings.
Meanwhile, Burns got to go about his life in state government as if nothing happened — for months. 
He continued voting on legislation, including House Bill 1273, which is now law. It shortens the time some people convicted in domestic abuse cases have to spend time in classes to curb their behavior from 52 weeks to 26.
In his veto message, attempting to block the passage of the law, Gov. Kevin Stitt wrote it “will make it easier for abusers to sidestep meaningful consequences and avoid jail time with less effort. This isn’t meaningful reform — it’s a concession to abusers, and it puts victims at greater risk.”
By that late May vote, Burns knew he was under criminal investigation. But rather than recusing himself because of a clear conflict of interest, he was one of the 89 House lawmakers who voted to overturn Stitt’s veto.
They were successful, and no one said a word about Burns’ case as they weakened consequences for abusers.
In August, Drummond’s office finally got around to prosecuting the matter, disclosing in a press release after-the-fact that Burns had pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of domestic abuse and assault. In a highly unusual move, Burns was allowed to plead guilty the same day he was charged, sparing him months of deserved public scrutiny during continued court appearances.
Burns received a one-year suspended sentence, and then was allowed to use House media resources — funded by you and me — to put out a statement justifying the plea, in which he noted he’s begun a 52-week batterers intervention program — you know, that same program he championed shortening for other abusers beginning Nov. 1.
Fellow Republicans Drummond and House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, meanwhile, gave Burns the equivalent of a metaphorical pat on the back following his plea, both condemning his violence, but praising him for taking responsibility.
Neither man demanded that he resign. And while state law doesn’t actually require a lawmaker to resign unless they’re convicted of a felony, it doesn’t mean they shouldn’t.
Elected officials should be held to a higher standard because if recent history is any judge, we know they’re not willing to hold each other to one.
Former House Rep. Dean Davis, R-Broken Arrow, whose campaign Burns donated to, was censured and briefly removed from all committees by the state House following a 2023 arrest for public intoxication in Oklahoma City. Body cam footage showed Dean, who later pleaded no contest to the charge, arguing with officers and saying he was immune from prosecution because he was a lawmaker. 
But he was allowed to be immediately reinstated to those committees when he publicly apologized. Voters later booted him themselves.
And Drummond tossed out a case against former House Majority Whip Terry O’Donnell, R-Catoosa, that involved allegations that he ran a bill allowing his wife to be appointed as a state tag agent. Drummond said at the time that the reason he dismissed the case wasn’t because he thought O’Donnell was blameless, but because he believed he was unfairly “targeted.”
Republican lawmakers though had no problem targeting former state Rep. Mauree Turner, the nation’s first nonbinary legislator, after a protester went to the Democrat’s office following an altercation with the state’s Highway Patrol. Turner, who is also Black and Muslim, was never charged with a crime, but that didn’t stop Republican legislators from censuring and stripping Turner of all committees for an imaginary House made up charge of “harboring a fugitive.” Republicans said Turner would be reinstated after apologizing. Turner never did, and later said the vote was a symbolic reminder to marginalized Oklahomans that they don’t belong.  
In Burns’ case, it wasn’t until Stitt and state Republican Party Chair Charity Linch demanded he resign that the 46-year-old actually did so. But that resignation won’t be effective until next month.
Burns said he still wants to complete an interim study at the Capitol on post traumatic stress disorders and doesn’t plan to step down until that’s done. And apparently his good ol’ buddies are going to allow him that final gesture of respect.
He doesn’t deserve that.
Lawmakers should not reward people who try to gouge out their spouse’s eyes or run people  off the road.
GOP chair Linch wrote in a statement that “the ‘good old boy’ system concealing nefarious behavior should no longer be tolerated in Oklahoma.”
Maybe the good ol’ boys can live up to that apparent Republican ideal next time one of their buddies breaks the law.

Wyoming needs to pay teachers more to retain and recruit the best, educators tell lawmakers. 
The post Teacher salary, class size, school counselors come into focus as recalibration advances appeared first on WyoFile .","In Sheridan County School District 3, which serves schools in the tiny community of Clearmont, the base pay for a first-year teacher is $48,000. But the median home price in the community, Superintendent Chase Chris​tensen said, is over $400,000.
“I believe that a couple that are both involved in education should be able to make a living to a point where they can raise a family, buy a house in the community they live in,” said Chris​tensen, who noted that he also serves as special ed director, tech director, principal and part-time bus driver for Wyoming’s second-smallest district. 
He urged lawmakers to increase teacher pay Friday during the Select Committee on School Finance Recalibration meeting in Casper. For too long, educators have been underpaid, and it will hurt the state, he said. 
“I urge you not to be guided by what has been done before, or by practices that have taken advantage of a group of professionals for far too long,” Christensen said. “Instead, I invite you to step out and set a base rate of pay that you believe is respectful of the profession, that is right, that will help recruit and retain the best, and that will drive our state’s economy for generations.” 
A base salary of $70,000 better reflects the preparation, skill and responsibility required by the job, he concluded. “I recognize that this represents a significant increase, but our students are worth the investment.”
As lawmakers waded through the preliminary findings of consultants tasked with assessing Wyoming’s educational funding model last week, the need to pay teachers better was a recurring theme.
Pay is one of the myriad components being assessed by the ongoing recalibration process. The Legislature’s exhaustive and tedious assessment of public education funding is mandated every five years. 
This time, however, lawmakers are doing so in the shadow of a district court ruling that the Wyoming Legislature violated the state’s constitution by underfunding public education and must amend that. They are also doing so in an age when many legislators are seeking government spending cuts. 
Preliminary findings 
The recalibration process is required every five years to ensure the Legislature fulfills its constitutional duty to “provide for the establishment and maintenance of a complete and uniform system of public instruction.” 
To do that, the state’s consultants, Picus, Odden and Associates, are holding meetings with Wyoming educators, analyzing data and making recommendations over the course of several months.

The consultants, who have been working through the assessment since early summer, presented their preliminary findings to the committee Thursday and Friday. Amid the minutiae and acronym-heavy language of education, several issues emerged as topics of high interest for educators and lawmakers. They include teacher retention, school resource officers, school nutrition programs, transportation needs and technology.
Many of those issues overlap with areas identified in the February court decision on school funding. The ruling, which the state is appealing, is the latest in a string of court cases that have further delineated the state’s education obligations.
In his 186-page order, Laramie County District Court Judge Peter Froelicher found the Legislature failed to properly fund the “basket of quality educational goods and services,” that the Wyoming Supreme Court in 1995 ordered lawmakers to set, update and fund every two years. The judge also found the state failed to properly adjust funding for inflation; failed to provide funding for adequate salaries for teachers and staff; and failed to provide sufficient funding for mental health counselors, school safety resource officers, nutritional programs and computers for students. Lawmakers have failed as well to properly assess school buildings for “educational suitability,” and have allowed inadequate facilities to exist for too long without repair or replacement, he ruled.
Consultants don’t yet have salary recommendations; they plan to dig into that topic during the next meeting in October, consultant Dr. Larry Picus said. 
However, in terms of the court-required elementary school mental health counselors, Picus said, it appears Wyoming’s 2025 “evidence-based model” for funding already meets that. That model, he said, funds one core counselor per prototypical elementary school (288 students), plus counselors for struggling students. The additional cost is $13 million.
Discussions of other court-identified areas led lawmakers to seek more details, answers or information. That included the costs, models and benefits of school resource officers; caps on school reserve accounts; and how much general fund money districts are spending on nutrition programs.
“This is a terribly important issue,” Sen. Tim Salazar, R-Riverton, said about school nutrition. “It’s something that we need to get right, and do it right, and so I think there’s still a great deal of work that needs to be done on this particular issue.”

Technology in schools — such as providing computers to every student — also generated questions. Aside from salary levels, Picus said, this topic was the top thing identified as not adequately funded by the state’s model. 
The annual cost of a computer per pupil, Picus estimated, is $215. But when you add in hardware, technical assistance and other related costs, it bumps up to nearly $500 a student. 
Sen. Bo Biteman, R-Ranchester, pushed back on the assumption that giving every student a computer is essential. 
“My question regarding computers is, ‘Where is the evidence?’” Biteman asked. “Where’s the evidence that shows that having each kid have a Chromebook, in this case, rather than a textbook, produces better outcomes for the students? I’m just not seeing the evidence.”
The data he’s found, he said, actually links heavy computer use with worse outcomes. 
“So I really want to see the evidence before we go down this rabbit hole that the judge sent us on,” Biteman said, adding that to do so would be inefficient and expensive. “Just because it feels good to a judge doesn’t necessarily mean that that’s what’s best for our kids.”
Teacher pay 
Though consultants were not prepared to present on teacher pay, Picus did suggest Wyoming pay its substitute teachers more — up to about $300 a day. 
And teacher pay still came up. Many of the district superintendents and administrators at the meeting at least touched on how the high cost of living and low salaries have made attracting and keeping teachers more difficult.
“When we talk about, what does it cost for someone in Teton County to actually live in Teton County, we can’t pay enough right now,” said Kristen Mayo, Teton County School District 1’s executive director of resources. She recognized her county is an anomaly and said that while the district and local communities have launched separate initiatives to address the issue, it’s still a serious problem. Owning a home is virtually impossible, she said, and renting is becoming increasingly out of reach.

“Really, at the end of the day, I would say we need more money in our salaries, just so our teachers can live in Teton County, in the community that they work in,” she said. 
Sheridan County School District 1 Superintendent Jeff Jones said salary increases will have a direct impact on the quality of educators in a state struggling to fill positions.
“If things improve with salaries here, we’re going to see a different salary pool,” he said. “Not just in numbers of people, but the quality of people is going to change as well.”
Consultants plan to hold more in-person listening sessions with educators around Wyoming before the next committee meeting, scheduled for Oct. 28-29 in Casper.

State and coal industry officials want a new 440 million ton coal tract offered for sale, but opponents warn lease won't benefit public coffers like years past.
The post Wyoming’s massive new federal coal tract not likely to draw high bids appeared first on WyoFile .","WRIGHT—What’s the value of a new 440 million ton federal coal tract in Wyoming’s Powder River Basin mining district in today’s market?
Pretty low, according to some Powder River Basin coal producers and those familiar with the industry.
Yes, Antelope coal mine operator Navajo Transitional Energy Company would like to add more tonnage to its legally mineable coal reserve, Technical Services Manager Blake Jones told WyoFile. But only if the price is right. 
Another Powder River Basin coal producer and, conceivably, a potential competitive bidder, CORE Natural Resources, told federal officials that today’s fair-market value for the coal is far below past bids and valuations in the region.
“Even though the [Trump] administration is working hard to improve the market, it will take some time to dig out of the current hole,” CORE’s Thunder Basin Coal Co. Manager of Environmental Affairs Jamie Olson told U.S. Bureau of Land Management officials on Wednesday.
“For that reason,” Olson said, “the fair-market value of coal in the Powder River Basin will remain soft for the next number of years.” The BLM should give “little weight” to past coal tract valuations, she added.

Olson was among about a dozen who attended the federal agency’s public meeting here — a step in the BLM’s expedited action on the West Antelope III coal lease-by-application project. The BLM resurrected the 10-year-old lease request in July after years of limbo due to a lack of interest on behalf of NTEC and a Biden-era leasing moratorium in the basin. The 440 million ton federal coal tract spans some 3,500 acres in Campbell and Converse counties. The intent of the meeting, according to the BLM, was to gather public comment regarding “the project’s fair-market value and maximum economic recovery.”
Though companies like NTEC and CORE suggested the fair-market value is much lower than comparable coal tracts in the past, they — along with other industry supporters — suggest the real value is not entirely wrapped up in the purchase price, but in the various taxes that apply once the coal is leased and mined, as well as the jobs and lucrative mining service industry sector that the massive coal tract would support.
“The other part of the fair-market value is the job component,” Wyoming Mining Association Executive Director Travis Deti told WyoFile. “You’re keeping companies operating, you’re keeping the resource under development and you keep people employed, and that’s part of the fair return.”
Conservation groups, however, worry the BLM, under pressure from the Trump administration’s Unleashing American Energy and Reinvigorating America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry executive orders, might be tempted to undervalue the coal tract. Even if it is sold, they doubt whether a coal company can line up enough buyers for the estimated 20-25 years it would take to mine the coal.
“The thing that is really frustrating is that the federal government is going out of its way to throw lifelines to the private coal industry,” Sierra Club Wyoming Chapter Climate and Energy Organizer Emma Jones told WyoFile.

Jones noted that even if a coal company offers a successful bid to buy the federal coal tract, Wyoming stands to earn less revenue from mining it. That’s because a provision in the One Big Beautiful Bill reduced the federal royalty rate for coal from 12.5% to 7% — an estimated $50 million annual revenue loss to Wyoming coffers. Wyoming lawmakers this year also reduced the state’s severance tax rate for surface-mined coal from 6.5% to 6% — an estimated revenue loss of about $10 million in 2026 and potentially lower each year afterward, if coal production continues to decline, according to state figures. 
“It makes it even less clear how this is actually going to be beneficial to Wyoming,” Jones said. “If the only way to keep this industry alive is for the federal government to basically give away coal for free, how does that make any sense?”
Cash cow goes to slaughter
The decades-long march of coal shovels in the Powder River Basin has required continuous access to new tracts of coal, most of which are owned by the federal government and managed by the BLM. In that time, the agency refined a federal coal “lease by application” process specific to the basin and subject to the National Environmental Policy Act to weigh the environmental and socioeconomic implications for each leasing action.

To obtain the right to mine federal coal, a qualifying operator typically nominates a specified tract of coal. If approved, the operator makes an offer in a competitive, sealed-bid lease sale. The tract goes to the highest bid if it meets the BLM’s undisclosed fair-market value for the coal tract.
Winning “bonus bids” ranged from 11 cents-per-ton to 38 cents-per-ton in the 1990s, according to federal data. Bids then crept up more than $1 in the 2010s — the height of competition for new federal coal tracts here. 
There’s a lot of coal in each tract, so a bonus bid payment typically amounts to tens of millions of dollars, and the money is split between the federal treasury and the state where the coal is mined. Federal coal tracts in the basin began selling for more than $100 million in the 1990s and topped out in 2012 with a 721 million ton tract that sold for $793 million, going to the North Antelope Rochelle mine.
During his tenure, former Gov. Dave Freudenthal commonly encouraged Powder River Basin coal companies to bid vigorously, noting the enormous revenue coal bonus bids provided to the state — most of which was dedicated to K-12 school capital construction. From 1992 to 2012, coal bonus bid payments generated some $5.4 billion, about half of which went to Wyoming.
But that all began to change about 10 years ago with a shrinking coal market and a series of coal company bankruptcies.
Flipping the switch
Cloud Peak Energy, which owned and operated three mines in the basin, including the Antelope mine, nominated the 440 million ton West Antelope III federal coal tract in 2015, and the BLM initiated the leasing and environmental review process. But the company went bankrupt in 2019 and the mines were eventually sold to NTEC. The company, for years, didn’t ask the BLM to reinitiate the leasing process, but mulled it over more after the election of Donald Trump, according to NTEC’s Blake Jones.

It was the BLM that approached NTEC just days after the One Big Beautiful Bill passed in July, he said, adding that the company is considering taking on the tract.
While NTEC weighs the risks and benefits, Wyoming officials are cheering the BLM’s swift action to put the tract up for bid.
“In today’s electric power demand market and economy, and in consideration of the current and future national power generation need alone, this leasing action should move forward through the [environmental impact statement] and Record of Decision process, based on a fair market value assessment,” Wyoming Energy Authority’s Director of Fossil Fuel Development Kyle Wendtland told BLM officials.
In fact, Wendtland worked for Cloud Peak Energy when it initiated the West Antelope III coal lease-by-application in 2015, he said.
“So I’m pretty familiar with this lease,” Wendtland told BLM officials. “I therefore feel it is important to speak to the facts when discussing or commenting on a mineral leasing action. First and foremost, ensuring that Wyoming and the nation have an uninterrupted, adequate and competitively priced coal-fuel supply based on accurate valuation has never been more important.”
The BLM is moving quickly on the lease.
After restarting the process in July, the BLM published a Final Environmental Impact Statement for the project on Aug. 15. It includes two alternatives: to deny the West Antelope III coal lease-by-application or to offer it for competitive lease sale.Go to the BLM National NEPA Register for additional information and planning documents.

Efforts by Wyoming politicians at the state and national levels to transfer or sell federal land left guest columnist Earl DeGroot wondering whether officially recognizing the day was meaningless.
The post Was Wyoming Public Lands Day legislation meaningless? appeared first on WyoFile .","In 2018 and 2019, I joined many others in promoting legislation calling for the designation of a Wyoming Public Lands Day on the last Saturday in September. We testified at various committees in favor of the bill, which took two years to pass. 

Opinion

Recent efforts by Wyoming politicians at the state and national levels to transfer or sell federal land make me wonder whether the Public Lands Day bill was meaningless. Our elected officials continue to take action contrary to the spirit of the legislation and the wishes of their constituents.
Our politicians have a long history of ignoring public opinion on this issue. That history dates back at least to the 1970s, when the Wyoming Legislature attempted to force the transfer of federal land. But let’s start with something more recent. 
In 2016, a constitutional amendment was proposed that would have paved the way for federal land to be transferred to Wyoming. Sponsors dubiously claimed the amendment prohibited the state from selling the transferred land. Public land advocates were not convinced. Many believed it was the first step toward privatization. I joined more than a hundred people to testify in Cheyenne in opposition. The proposed amendment was withdrawn shortly thereafter. 
During the 2025 legislative session, Senate Joint Resolution 2, sponsored by Republican Sen. Bob Ide of Casper and co-sponsored by 13 others, called for the transfer of all federal land in Wyoming to the state except Yellowstone Park. Bill supporters erroneously claimed the U.S. Constitution doesn’t allow the federal government to own large quantities of land. Reminders that the Legislative Service Office had issued a legal opinion to the contrary did not dissuade them. 
Promoters of the resolution also ignored the findings of a 2016 study commissioned by the Legislature to determine the feasibility of transferring management of federal lands to the State. The resulting report by Y2 Consultants recommended against transfer largely because the state couldn’t afford to manage millions of acres of federal land. Nevertheless, the dislike for the federal government among supporters of the resolution was so strong that they were willing to ignore the recommendations of the study as well as the legal opinion of their own attorneys. Furthermore, they were willing to trample on the wishes of thousands of Wyoming citizens. I watched in dismay as numerous legislators tried to outdo each other as they attacked federal land ownership. The bill was defeated in the Senate by only one vote. 
Just a few months ago, attacks on our federal land came at the national level. Utah Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican, proposed an amendment to the congressional budget reconciliation bill that would require the sale of millions of acres of federal land. In many respects, the proposed amendment was worse than state efforts to transfer federal land. At least with the transfer, there was a dim hope that the land would remain public. Lee’s amendment was withdrawn after intense nationwide opposition, including numerous well-attended public protests in Wyoming. 
With great consternation and considerable anger, I watched all three of Wyoming’s congressional delegation back Lee’s efforts, or at least do nothing to stop them. Sen. John Barrasso said, “I support federal land sales when they serve the interests of states, local communities and the public.” Sen. Cynthia Lummis said, “The federal government doesn’t need to perpetually own every piece of land.” Rep. Harriet Hageman voted for a similar proposal in the House of Representatives.
Clearly, Barrasso, Lummis, and Hageman are out of touch with how important federal lands are to the lifestyle of Wyoming residents. Many of us live here solely because of the access to federal land. We don’t want even ONE ACRE sold or transferred!
I am increasingly frustrated by politicians who are less than friendly to our public land. Even more frustrating and perplexing is the fact that so many anti-federal land politicians are elected to office. On the one hand, there is strong public support for federal land, and on the other hand, anti-federal land politicians are elected and re-elected. I can only surmise that public land supporters are not doing their due diligence when vetting candidates. 
This needs to stop! Please join me in my commitment to vet candidates more carefully. If they don’t voice strong support for federal land, don’t vote them in! And if they have already taken action against federal land, vote them out!
In the meantime, let’s enjoy Wyoming Public Lands Day on Sept. 27. History tells us we must never take our federal lands for granted! They are constantly under threat.

(Courtesy of Jackie Augustine/Audubon of Kansas) LINCOLN – Supporters of the Niobrara River are contesting claims made by a local official about the status of federal funding and programs for managing the river and its environs as a congressionally designated scenic river.
The Friends of the Niobrara — a successor organization to one that stopped the Norden Dam project on the river — said in a recent press release that Mike Murphy, general manager of the Middle Niobrara Natural Resources District, was spreading inaccurate information about that status of support and programs by the National Park Service.
Murphy, when contacted by the Examiner, mostly contested the claims, saying that he had been taken out of context to some extent.
The exchange comes as a state legislative committee prepares to hold an interim study hearing Sept. 19 on whether the State of Nebraska should replace the Park Service as the lead manager of the Niobrara.
The federal government does allow such state management in rare instances, but 34 years ago, when Congress designated 76 miles of the river in north-central Nebraska as a federal national wild and scenic river, the National Park Service was put in charge of preserving its natural beauty.


Interim study hearing
The Sept. 19 interim study hearing at the State Capitol in Lincoln by the Legislature’s Natural Resources Commission will involve invited testimony only, leading to concerns by the Friends of the Niobrara, and other river supporters, that their voices won’t be heard.
State Sen. Tom Brandt of Plymouth, the committee’s chairman, said that there may be some confusion about the purpose of an interim study, which is to gather information and not necessarily to hear from a long line of public testifiers.
The hearing will be limited to five testifiers, said State Sen. Tanya Storer of Whitman, who introduced the study resolution to transfer management to the state.
She said Thursday that she is hoping that a representative of the National Park Service will testify, but has been told that the federal agency is unable to comment on pending policy or legislation.


That stretch of the Niobrara is one of Nebraska’s most popular tourist destinations, drawing upwards of 75,000 visitors a year for float trips and sight-seeing. The Friends group feels that replacing the Park Service with local management would diminish the visitor experience, hurt tourism, and could lead to the delisting of the Niobrara as a federal scenic river.
“Ultimately we’re concerned that the state doesn’t have the resources to handle the scenic river designation,” said Kim Stuhr, president of the Friends of the Niobrara, citing the state’s current budget shortfalls.
Murphy, a key supporter of shifting management locally, told the Examiner that one of the key purposes of the Sept. 19 interim study hearing by the Legislature’s Natural Resources Committee is to discover what responsibilities the state and local entities would be taking on if it took over management of the river. He said it’s a subject worth pursuing, given the federal cuts in spending on Park Service activities.
Murphy added that the current relationship between the Park Service and a local advisory council, the Niobrara Council (of which Murphy is a member), is not working.
“To me, this hearing is bringing out the good and bad and will shed light on what is going on,” he said.
The Park Service was designated to manage the Niobrara Scenic River when it was established in 1991. Utilizing an annual budget of $1.2 million, it operates a visitors center in Valentine, monitors water quantity and quality, provides law enforcement staff, and facilitates several educational and cultural programs. In addition, it helps landowners plan proper bank stabilization projects and paid for a recent canoe landing at Smith Falls State Park.
The Park Service had also been providing $100,000 a year to the Niobrara Council for its activities, which included maintaining toilets along the river, trash removal, camps for youth and funding two employees at a Niobrara Council office in Valentine.
But due to a freeze on funding by the Trump administration, the last funds given to the Council was $80,000 in May 2024.
The Niobrara Council – which is intended to be an outlet for local landowners and organizations to provide input to the Park Service – responded by laying off one employee and having its executive director go part time.

The Council gets about $52,000 a year from the State of Nebraska to operate, and has continued to hold regular meetings to provide input. The Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, this summer, agreed to pick up the maintenance and trash pickup duties, but the loss of federal funding has been a major complaint of some on the Council.
To be sure, there’s been on-and-off tension between local landowners and the Park Service since the scenic river designation.
The Park Service’s mission is to keep the Niobrara as wild and scenic as possible, by discouraging cabin and campground development along the river that could spoil the view and character of the river, which two years ago became the first location in North America designated as an international “quiet trail.”
Landowners and canoe outfitters, meanwhile, seek to build cabins and canoe launches for the visitors, development that can conflict with scenic river goals.
The most recent clash involves a recent story in the Valentine Midland News, in which Murphy was quoted saying the Niobrara Council has been operating “without any funding” for the past two years and that the visitors center in Valentine is slated to close, and the Park Service superintendent eliminated, when a lease on the center ends at the end of 2026.
Murphy, in the article, also questioned what federal money was spent on, besides salaries and vehicles.
“Some explanation of what their $1.5 million to $2 million budget pays for and goes for, besides personnel, vehicles, etc., would be beneficial,” he was quoted as saying.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The Friends, in a press release entitled “Separating Fact from Fiction,” said that Murphy, as a long-time member of the Niobrara Council, ought to know how the Park Service money is spent given that there are regular briefings at meetings about their activities, which range from youth education and natural resources protection to public access and safety.
The press release also said the Valentine visitors center was not closing and that the federal government is seeking to renew the lease.
George Johnson, who leases the visitors center to the Park Service, said that the five-year lease on the building runs out in December 2026 but that he’s been told by Park Service officials that the lease is expected to be extended.

The Friends also said a new cooperative agreement with the Niobrara Council will be negotiated as soon as a new federal budget is adopted, which would restore funding and lead to the hiring of a new superintendent. Current Superintendent Susan Cook is retiring in October.
“At a time when the region faces mounting political and environmental pressures, the National Park Service has provided steady leadership, local engagement, and meaningful investment,” the Friends of the Niobrara said. The statement added that “Nebraskans deserve clarity—not confusion” prior to the hearing.
Murphy, asked about the press release, said he wasn’t “saying if I said that or not” concerning the closing of the visitors center. But the bottom line is, he said, is “we don’t know what the future holds” about future federal support for the scenic river.
What is known, Murphy said, is that the Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE had earmarked the visitors center for closing earlier this year, until that decision was reversed, and that the current lease on the center runs out in a year.
“That’s the only thing we know,” he said, adding that he’d like to hear from Park Service officials at the September hearing.
Murphy added that he recalls only one detailed briefing about Park Service spending since he’s been on the Council, and that was several years ago.

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)Mark your calendars, everyone in Eastern Montana, for 5 p.m., Sept. 9 – Rep. Troy Downing will bestow on his constituency his fourth “telephone town hall” since he took office in January.
If you don’t follow his Facebook page – doesn’t everyone? – you may have missed it. But then, again, he sends out a recorded telephone “blast” just before it starts. But, best to sign up in advance.
Downing is in full re-election mode after recently receiving Donald Trump’s “complete and total endorsement” in no small part because he has been a complete and total acolyte for the president’s direct orders to the House GOP. It’s unknown if he has any opposing or varying views of the administration’s unlimited power grab to re-create American government and life in so many ways.
While decrying federal spending, Downing belittles concern for the projected increase of $3.4 trillion to the federal budget deficit as a result of the presidentially renamed “Working Families Tax Cut,” née “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” The Congressional Budget Office projects an “increase over the next decade (2025-2034), with total national debt rising by $4.1 trillion when accounting for interest costs,” according to a July analysis.
Right now, Downing is crowing on national conservative cable channels about his sponsorship of H.J.R. 104, a Congressional Review Act, leading to overturning a Biden-era limit on Powder River Basin coal extraction. The resolution, passed on a four-vote margin, does not have the effect of law; it is only a sentiment of the House GOP majority but sets the tone. It has moved to the Senate for consideration into the eager hands of Montana’s two U.S. senators. 
Without mentioning U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke of the western district as co-sponsor, Downing rests his laurels on a claim Thursday that his legislative moxie “protects approximately $46 million in annual state revenue which is used to fund public K-12 education.” But is that true? 
The portion of the Coal Severance Tax Trust Fund he may have in mind is a school facilities fund that “may be used only for school facility projects authorized by the Legislature,” according to the Legislative Fiscal Division. This fund is the only one of seven sub-fund trusts, the others not related to public education.
Perhaps we can get clarification Tuesday evening?
He brags that 13,000 people were registered to be on the line for the first two calls. Adding another 6,500 from the third telephone call, we can estimate that 19,500 persons “attended” the three calls. With perhaps 12 people having opportunity to ask a question, that leaves 19,464 constituents who couldn’t and are still waiting. 
He could have had unexpected opportunity to have an actual in-person town hall during the last week in August when the House GOP got orders to march out of Washington early so as not to deal with the growing fracas over release of the full Epstein files.
But instead he and three other Republicans fled the country to visit Mexico, Paraguay and Peru. In early August he squeezed in a trip to Israel with a congressional delegation hosted by a pro-Israel American group to visit Jerusalem and Capernaum on the Sea of Galilee where he and his wife, Heather, renewed their baptismal vows in the Sea of Galilee.
“Incredibly moving,” Downing reported. He made no mention of prospects for peace in Gaza or concern for Palestine noncombatants.

Pennsylvania has entered its third month without a new budget, while Michigan is just weeks away from a potential shutdown. Meanwhile, lawmakers in other states have figured out their spending plans – or contingencies.

Aside from their current budget woes, the Rust Belt states mirror each other in some unique ways. Both are helmed by Democratic governors with presidential ambitions and national profiles to match in Josh Shapiro and Gretchen Whitmer. They are considered battleground states with recently redrawn legislative districts generally regarded as fairer – and that resulted in split legislatures, two of three nationally. Transportation funding has emerged as the sticking point in the disparate budget negotiations, for very different reasons.
And the stakes in each of the impasses aren’t exactly the same.

 A Michigan shutdown would shutter services, inspections

If Michigan’s budget gridlock lasts long enough, the government would shut down in a dramatic fashion, loosely mirroring a federal shutdown that would shutter services and operations. State workers would be left without pay and potentially their benefits. State parks, statewide law enforcement services and seemingly mundane activities like food safety inspections could also be impacted, according to WDIV-TV Detroit.
Unlike the federal government, Michigan can’t pass resolutions supporting government functions without a budget. That’s led the state, on at least two recent occasions, to pass holdover “continuation budgets,” defined as a short term appropriation of the previous fiscal year’s spending, if the game gets too close to the final whistle.

Pennsylvania’s partisan gridlock drives impasse
In Pennsylvania, there is no possibility of a shutdown. The commonwealth’s Supreme Court ruled in 2009 that state workers must be paid during a budget impasse. But schools and counties don’t have that same guarantee – and taxpayers have to cover the interest on any loans to continue operations until state funding starts flowing again.
That’s on top of having state leaders consumed with the budget fight at the expense of other issues – such as the looming impact of recent reductions in federal programs and funding. And then there are the long-term costs if the resulting budget’s apparent “balance” relies on deferring expenses such as pension contributions or infrastructure investment. What’s more, discussion often happens behind closed doors with updates leaked or proposals rushed to public debate, which creates confusion.
Either way, both states will face consequences if their spending plans aren’t approved and signed into law soon.

 Transportation funding talks at a dead end

Future Michigan road maintenance and repair face dire consequences if a funding plan isn’t a part of the coming fiscal year budget. Many projects that were funded by bonds during Whitmer’s tenure are coming to a close, and there is no plan to reauthorize those bonds, necessitating a legislative solution.
The bonds were authorized by the state’s Transportation Commission in 2020 because the Republicans, who were previously in control of the Legislature in 2019, refused to raise taxes to pay for roads.
Budget talks this year have stalled partly due to road funding, but also because the House waited to pass its full government spending plan until late August; the Senate passed its full budget in May. Whitmer delivered her budget recommendations much earlier in the year.

Now that the Michigan House has a budget plan on the table, Republicans in the chamber say it is incumbent on the Senate to come forward with a roads funding plan to get negotiations going.
Michigan Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks and the Democrats in the Senate have offered no clear sign of when it would deliver a road funding plan, nor what it would look like. The GOP plan would put $3.4 billion toward roads.  Those dollars come from deep cuts elsewhere in their proposed budget, like major reductions to key departments that oversee statewide law enforcement, the attorney general’s office, environmental regulations and natural resources rules.
Whitmer has proposed $3 billion for roads and has been adamant that no deal can be reached without funding for roads, putting pressure on the Senate, which is controlled by her party.

This past Wednesday, several thousand construction workers, union members and business leaders were at the state Capitol building to urge lawmakers to find a sustainable solution to Michigan’s looming road funding cliff.
Schools in Michigan are also warning that they are now operating without real budgets that reflect the dollars they’ll actually be receiving from the state in the next fiscal year. Some school groups have said that layoff notices have already been issued because of the standoff.
The urban-rural divide present in both states hasn’t driven the wedge in Michigan’s transportation debate so much as it has in Pennsylvania.
The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in Philadelphia had been warning for months about service cuts and fare increases while seeking additional funding to make up a $240 million budget deficit the agency has attributed to the loss of federal COVID-19 funding. Public entities nationwide used the funding – intended to serve as one-time, temporary emergency relief – to plug budget holes, creating what public finance experts have described as a looming fiscal crisis.

SEPTA’s planned fare increases and regional metro service reductions are on hold after they were blocked by a court ruling. Another judge then ordered the agency to restore service following a 20 percent reduction to bus and rail rides that had taken effect as the school year began in Philadelphia. In the interim, gambling site Fan Duel kicked in some money so Eagles fans had adequate subway service for the season opener.
Meanwhile, transit agencies in urban, suburban and rural areas outside the Philadelphia region say they might cut service, increase prices or both if the deadlock persists.
The debate has left the one million people (one in 13 Pennsylvanians) who use mass transit wondering what comes next.
Lawmakers have floated myriad options – from gambling revenue to legalizing recreational cannabis (already on the books in Michigan and included in Shapiro’s proposed budget) – not only to fund transit but address an overall structural deficit projected to grow to $6 billion during the upcoming year.
As in the past, oversimplified versions of the current transit funding dustup pitted mass transit agencies and the riders they serve in densely populated areas against drivers throughout the rest of the commonwealth.
Those drivers, the Republican argument goes, contribute to maintaining roads and bridges through tolls and license and registration fees. But most SEPTA riders also have a car or access to one through someone else in their household, according to the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission.
Senate Republicans have meanwhile struggled to reach consensus within their own caucus, which – with Democratic control of the House and governor’s office – has contributed to the deadlock, said Marc Stier, executive director of Penn Policy Center.
Gov. Josh Shapiro has publicly described his role almost as a mediator while calling for legislators – the GOP-controlled Senate, in particular – to work more and make tough decisions.

 Michigan has twice danced with shutdowns and could again

Under Hall, Michigan’s House GOP leadership has been on a mission to undo Democratic policies passed during their past two sessions in power. That includes trimming what it considers excessive and wasteful spending during the Whitmer years. They’ve taken a slow approach to finding cuts, contributing to the House delaying passage of its version of a budget until Aug. 26.
But Whitmer’s legacy depends partly on her campaign pledge to “fix the damn roads,” a centerpiece of her budget goals before she leaves office in 2026.
Despite different dynamics, those working long enough in the state’s capital of Lansing have opined on how closely the situation resembles the last two government shutdowns in 2007 and 2009 under then-Democratic Gov. Jennifer Granholm.The state government was divided then, too. Democrats controlled the House, while Republicans had the Senate.
The 2007 stalemate focused on a $2 billion revenue shortfall during the Great Recession, the seeds of which showed up in budgeting analyses as early as 2005.
“We were in a depression in Michigan, unlike anything the rest of the country was seeing,” former Republican House Majority Leader Mike Bishop recently told Michigan Advance.“If anybody wonders why there was so much venom and anxiety in Lansing during those times, that was the reason.”
Ultimately, the 2007 shutdown only lasted a few hours in the dark of night before a budget deal in the early morning.

In 2009, the budget battle again saw the era’s Democrats fighting for new revenue and the Republican zeal to balance the budget with cuts – similar to the actions being taken now by House Republicans in 2025.
With uncertainty about federal recovery dollars and lingering fatigue from 2007, the fight over revenue still loomed large in 2009, and the House, Senate and Granholm were again at odds. This time, Dillon agreed to some of the cuts Bishop proposed, putting him at odds with his own caucus and Granholm.
A budget deal wasn’t reached by the end of the fiscal year, a government shutdown began, but ended within hours after a continuation budget was passed.
 Pennsylvania’s costly standoff

In Pennsylvania, the government won’t cease to function over a budget impasse.
But the nine-month standoff a decade ago prompted some counties and school districts – which get about one-third of their revenue from the state – to borrow money that’s still being paid back in some cases, with taxpayers covering the interest.
“It’s a hidden tax,” said Bill Glasgall, public finance adviser at government-focused think tank the Volcker Alliance.
As the current impasse dragged on through the summer, counties and human service providers were bracing for impacts. State payments had stopped for schools as well as county-run programs like child welfare enforcement, senior citizen care and public health. Bipartisan House Bill 1609 would ensure payments for those critical needs continue; it’s been parked in the appropriations committee for months.
Some programs serving the most vulnerable Pennsylvanians have cut pay and delayed spending on less urgent needs like conferences and tech upgrades.
About one third of the state’s 67 counties already have dipped into savings to cover costs and a few are researching borrowing just in case the stalemate drags on, according to Kyle Kopko, executive director of the County Commissioners Association of Pennsylvania.
“If this is going to be a continuous feature of Pennsylvania politics, …  it’s just not fair,” Kopko said. “It’s not efficient. It’s not good at all. This isn’t how it’s supposed to work.”
Senate Republicans advanced what they described as a stop-gap budget to mitigate the fallout alongside a transit funding proposal. But both measures quickly died in the Democrat-controlled House.  Appropriations Committee Chair Jordan Harris (D-Philadelphia) said his Republican colleagues lack urgency.
“The only time you use numbers from last year is early on in the process, to move the process forward,” Harris said. “This is not something that you do a month-and-a-half after that. Literally last year’s numbers –  [that’s] a spending plan that says, ‘We’re not serious.’”
Stier, who once ran for a state House seat as a Democrat, predicts a resolution by mid-to-late September achieved by shifting money around so that the budget appears to be balanced – but isn’t really.
“You can keep the budget artificially under $50 billion. But you’re in fact, going to be spending more later,” he said.
Public finance experts advise against such one-time maneuvers.
“People talk about kicking the can down the road. Really, it’s rolling a snowball,” said Noah Winn-Ritzenberg, Volcker’s senior director of public finance. “When you get there, the problem is just going to be larger.”
And it looks bad to lenders, potentially increasing borrowing costs, Glasgall noted.
“Higher interest rates on debt – that’s effectively a tax on the citizens,” he said.
While Pennsylvania has improved its approach to budgeting and finance in recent years, Glasgall – like Stier – said the ongoing stalemate could prompt leaders to delay pension payments, artificially suppress estimated Medicaid costs (another sticking point in negotiations), delay infrastructure investment or resort to another such “gimmick” or a combination thereof.
“If there were structural changes that could make people be honest about things like this,” Stier said, “I would be all in favor of it.”

 Is there a better way to budget? 

Past years have seen more dramatic budget impasses than what’s transpired so far in Pennsylvania and Michigan, Glasgall noted. Illinois once operated for years without a budget. A New Jersey shutdown once infamously afforded then-Gov. Chris Christie an extremely private beach trip. Massachusetts hit its deadline this year after a 14-year late streak (to Pennsylvania’s 13 missed deadlines of the past 20).
A couple of other states haven’t exactly finalized theirs for 2025-26. North Carolina adopted a mini-budget to keep the government running as deliberations continue. Oregon’s spending plan has come together in pieces to prevent a sticking point or two from delaying the entire thing.
Both strategies often emerge in conversations about structural change that happen when budgets are late.
Another is the automatic continuation resolution (a state defaults to operating according to its outgoing budget until electeds can agree on the next). Twenty states have this option, which has its critics. Public finance experts seem to agree that reducing pressure on budget negotiations doesn’t help them resolve faster.
Stier pointed to the 2009 Pennsylvania court decision requiring state workers to be paid during an impasse as a structural change that has “made things worse.”
“It’s harder to get a budget done because there’s less pressure,” Stier said.
A piecemeal budgeting approach like Oregon’s system affords flexibility, Glasgall noted.
Stier said he doesn’t think that would work in Pennsylvania because it would advantage the GOP, because it delays tax and/or spending increases and so Democrats wouldn’t agree to the change.
Structural changes also won’t negate political divisions nor the temptation to succumb to quick fixes when negotiations lock up.
“As a political scientist, … we like to find that structure makes a huge difference. And sadly, the research over the last 30 or 40 years has not shown that’s the case,” Stier said.
Partisanship also is contributing to both states’ budget delays, as is party infighting. Glasgall said others have endured budget stalemates when under single-party control, including in California, Kansas and New Jersey.

In Michigan, enduring the crisis of two shutdowns in close succession created political momentum for change.
The Citizens Research Council of Michigan made the case for an earlier budget timeline during the 2009 budget standoff, noting that the process itself might be to blame.
And John Nixon, the former budget director in Utah, was hired in late 2010 as director of the Michigan Department of Technology, Management and Budget to help Michigan after the incoming Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican, was elected that year.
Nixon was tasked with not just fixing the budget process, but with helping Snyder improve Michigan’s subpar financial standing in several areas.
“It was trying to incorporate best practices and spending within our means,” Nixon said. “We’re feeding a bunch of local governments. We’re feeding school districts. How can they count on it?”
The solution from Snyder was to hold the Legislature to a loose June 30 deadline for talks to end and having a budget passed on July 1.
Despite some pushback, the move was embraced, Nixon said. The 2011 Legislature also saw Republicans back in control of the trifecta governor’s office, the House and the Senate. In 2019, the Legislature codified the deadline into statute, but with no real penalties for missing the mark.
Michigan’s Legislature has since missed that July 1 deadline on multiple occasions, but only by a few days or weeks, and the state never went down to the wire with its budget talks quite like it did in 2007 and 2009
Hall attempted to pass a resolution last month that would mean no pay for legislators if they blow the July 1 deadline. The measure ultimately failed.
“Would that swing people?” Nixon said. “The thing you don’t want to do is you don’t want to pass a junk budget.”
Nixon noted that in Utah, a budget impasse led the state’s leaders to enact measures that obligated them to pass base budgets during the first week of session. That way, the government wouldn’t shut down in the event of a stalemate.
He also said a solution would be needed to the current impasse and budget struggles in the years to come if Michigan gets a “double whammy” of a state shutdown and a potential federal shutdown – which appears more likely in the era of uncertainty during the  second Trump administration.
Winn-Ritzenberg says institutional values tend to be most influential, ultimately.
“A lot of it really comes down more to culture within a state of either relying on budget maneuvers or a culture where [lawmakers] pass a clean budget and take pride in a professional approach in the budget office,” Winn-Ritzenberg said.
In Michigan’s case, the question is whether that culture will persist, while in Pennsylvania, it’s whether it ever emerges.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/PA-and-MI-budget.png,,,2025-09-08 06:56:46.909658

For nearly a decade, Catholic Charities of East Tennessee has relied on federal funding to provide legal aid to victims of elder abuse, domestic violence and child sexual and physical abuse. 
But, earlier this summer, the Knoxville nonprofit was put on notice by the Tennessee Office of Criminal Justice Programs: it could no longer receive public crime victim funding if the crime victims being served were also immigrants.
When agency staff inquired about a new federal grant notice that could sustain their ongoing work with children victimized by physical abuse, sexual abuse, human trafficking and other crimes, they got a similar answer.
“The response we got was that the goal is to serve American children only. American citizen children,” Alessandra Ceccarelli-Masters, the agency’s immigration services manager, said.
It was a blow for the agency, which aids crime victims regardless of immigration status in three dozen east Tennessee counties.
“Why are we differentiating between kids who have gone through the same, horrific experiences?” she said. 
Tennessee ends funding for legal clinic serving immigrant crime victims  

“I thought that in a country like the United States we were able, willing and it was one of our values to be able to help survivors of crime, especially children, regardless of their legal status, so it’s very sad to see that they’re imposing these types of restrictions.”
Catholic Charities is among scores of Tennessee nonprofit agencies now contending with a flurry of directives from state and federal officials about who they can and cannot serve as the Trump administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration reshapes crime victim funding. 
The federal government, through the Department of Justice, is the single largest source of funding for many Tennessee domestic violence shelters, abuse hotlines, sexual assault centers and child counseling services — organizations that generally don’t ask a victim’s immigration status.
Some Tennessee nonprofits rely on federal funding for half or more of their annual operating budgets. Collectively these organizations have served more than 95,000 victims in Tennessee annually.
Nonprofit directors described the volume and, in some instances, vagueness of emails and memos outlining restrictions on serving immigrants — and threatening punitive action against organizations for noncompliance — as destabilizing.
Dismantling programs that have enabled victims to come forward will only hamper the ability to hold perpetrators accountable, contrary to the Trump administration’s stated tough-on-crime goals, they said.
‘Barriers being created at every turn’
In July, the Department of Justice’s Office of Victims of Crime announced that states and nonprofits receiving federal victim grants must agree to support and assist in federal immigration enforcement — including granting entry to their facilities.  A coalition of 20 Democratic-led states has filed suit challenging the restrictions.
New grant descriptions subsequently posted online by the Department of Justice require victim-serving nonprofits to describe in writing how they will use federal funds in “supporting law enforcement operations (including immigration law enforcement operations),” “supporting American victims of trafficking and sexual assault,” and “protecting American children.”
On August 22, a memo issued by the Tennessee Office of Criminal Justice Programs warned against diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives for nonprofits receiving the federal grants, raising uncertainty about whether agencies that conduct targeted outreach to Black, Hispanic, LGBTQ and other communities to encourage victims to seek help could run afoul of new rules. 
Then, late last month the Department of Justice issued a memo to states and nonprofits barring the use of federal dollars to provide legal services to crime who are living in the country illegally, the Reuters news service reported.
Even before the federal directive, the Tennessee Office of Criminal Justice Programs informed nonprofits they could no longer provide legal services to immigrant crime victims with federal grants. The Tennessee Coalition to End Domestic and Sexual Violence, on June 30, shut down a long-running legal clinic that had helped immigrant survivors of domestic violence and human trafficking access visas specifically set aside for victims who cooperated with law enforcement to bring perpetrators to justice.
“There are barriers being created at every turn,” Cecelia Friedman Levin, advocacy coordinator for the Alliance for Immigrant Survivors, a national network of agencies that serve immigrant survivors of violence.
Friedman Levin said that directives jeopardize decades of work by advocates to earn the trust of immigrant crime victims.
“We’re seeing all these safeguards being overshadowed by an enforcement over everything mentality, which means victims don’t feel safe coming out their door to seek help, and their safety is compromised, which makes communities less safe,” she said. “This undermines decades of efforts to make sure survivors know there’s a place for them to go.”
The Department of Justice did not respond last week to Lookout questions about the funding changes.
Survey: Immigrants increasingly hesitant to report crimes
High visibility immigration sweeps across the nation and a  proliferation of cooperation agreements between Immigration and Customs Enforcement and local law enforcement are further deterring victims who lack legal immigration status from coming forward, she said.
In Tennessee more than two dozen local sheriff and police departments have entered into so-called 287(g) agreements with federal officials to serve immigration warrants, jail immigrants or operate enhanced task forces that give local law enforcement immigration enforcement powers since the beginning of the second Trump administration. The Tennessee Department of Safety & Homeland Security has also entered into an agreement.
Separately, Immigration and Customs Enforcement also reversed its longstanding policy of requiring agents to ascertain whether an individual is a crime victim before taking enforcement action. 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement “dragnet” in Nashville results in detentions

As a result, victims of crime who lack legal immigration status are increasingly hesitant to report crimes, according to a survey conducted in the Spring by the Alliance for Immigrant Survivors. 
Of 170 advocates and attorneys who responded to the survey, half reported immigrant crime victims opted not to contact police, or show up to court out of fear of being swept up.
Officer Mario Diaz, Metro Nashville Police Department’s Hispanic community liaison, said patrol officers have seen the hesitance to call police play out after widely publicized immigration sweeps in the city. 
In May, mass traffic stops conducted by the Tennessee Highway Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Nashville’s heavily immigrant south side resulted in the detention of about 200 people. 
In the weeks that followed, Diaz said, “patrol officers were telling me ‘hey, we’re not getting any calls for service in particular neighborhoods.”
The calls for services have since returned to normal levels, but Diaz said “people are obviously more concerned and more worried.”
The Nashville police department has not entered into any agreement with the federal government to enforce immigration laws, a message Diaz said he has found himself repeating more this year.
“People will say to me I saw Metro police make a traffic stop,” he said. “Are you guys collaborating with ICE? Those questions I’ve never been asked before. People are more worried and more alert.”
Tennessee nonprofit organization leaders also expressed worries that speaking out against new immigration restrictions on federal funding could further hobble their ability to carry out their mission of aiding victims. A half dozen nonprofit directors contacted by the Lookout declined to speak publicly about the impact of new federal funding restrictions on the adult and child victims they serve.
Ceccarelli-Masters, Catholic Charities’ immigration services manager, said her agency was also initially reluctant to speak up about the new limits imposted on their ability to serve victims. Catholic Charities will continue to provide the same services to victims regardless of immigration status, but rely on sliding scale fees and non-public funding to do so, she said. 
“In February, March, we were a bit reluctant to talk to journalists because we did not want to draw too much attention to the work we do,” she said. “But I think it’s important to let people know what’s happening now. The consequences of the policies that this administration is administering is that we’re not able to provide services to survivors who are not citizens. It’s shortsighted. We’re setting ourselves up for circles of violence to continue.”

Nearly a dozen candidates entered the Republican primary, but the conservative think tank American for Prosperity Tennessee invited only four candidates to its Sept. 5 debate in West Nashville based on polling and fundraising numbers.
Barrett, Brentwood state Rep. Gino Bulso, Franklin state Rep. Lee Reeves, and former Tennessee General Services Commissioner Matt Vanns are also the four candidates in the race with state-level legislative or government experience.
A pre-debate Americans for Prosperity poll of 500 voters showed the four men each getting between 15-20% support. The poll’s margin of error effectively means they are tied.

For two hours, moderators attempted to create some separation between the candidates, but the debate rules banned cross-talk between candidates, and they weren’t allowed to mention each other’s names.
The moderators also tried to distinguish any policy differences between the four men and President Donald Trump. Only Barrett criticized any of Trump’s actions, calling out his support for Operation Warp Speed to create the coronavirus vaccine.
Americans for Prosperity was one of the few conservative groups that didn’t endorse Trump in his 2024 presidential primary, backing former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley instead.
All the candidates agreed they would have voted for the Big Beautiful Bill, wouldn’t push legalization for marijuana and that the federal government needs to be smaller. The differences that emerged were more stylistic than substantial.
Bulso’s answers tended to linger as he attempted to show his legal knowledge. The state representative in his second term is a lawyer who often tries to argue political debates like they are written arguments before a court. Bulso cited clauses in the constitution at least five times during the debate.
Reeves made it clear from the start that he wanted to be known as the “America First” candidate in the race, trying to tie himself to Trump. The first-term state representative hit all the key conservative points, calling for the elimination of the Department of Education, more immigration crackdowns, and the defunding of “sanctuary cities.”

The congressional district borders the U.S. Army’s Fort Campbell base, which straddles the Tennessee-Kentucky border. Many of the district’s voters are current or former military, which helped Green as a former infantry officer when he first ran for the seat.
The district encompasses the western half of Middle Tennessee before taking a claw-like shape out of Nashville and Williamson County. Since it was partisanly redrawn in 2022, Green consistently won about 60% of the district’s vote.
Democrats are also holding a competitive primary between Nashville state reps. Aftyn Behn, Vincent Dixie and Bo Mitchell, and Nashville businessman Darden Copeland. Despite it being a special election, political rating agencies still score the seat as solidly Republican.
The general election is on December 2.

The state received about $1.6 million this year from a federal grant meant to prevent teen pregnancies and teach teenagers about sexually transmitted infections, as well as other life skills, according to the federal Department of Health and Human Services. That money went to five nonprofits across the state, according to the Department of Public Health, which is in charge of distributing the grant.
Last month, the Trump administration sent a letter to 40 states, including South Carolina, telling them to remove references to gender found in the sexual education materials the groups were using, saying the law included nothing authorizing states to teach about gender. The federal Administration for Children and Families had previously approved the curriculum for organizations to use, which the letter said was an error.
South Carolina’s organizations reported using three teachers’ manuals to which the administration objected. One suggested instructors ask students to share their pronouns as “a way of creating a safe space for transgender or gender nonconforming youth.” All three explained differences between a person’s gender identity, gender expression and sex assigned at birth, according to the letter.

Gov. Henry McMaster praised the move as a way of removing “goofy stuff” from the materials “that have no business being in there.”
“I think the Trump administration has done a big favor going through these materials and finding these things and calling it to everyone’s attention,” McMaster told reporters last week.
The information about gender flagged in the letter make up little to none of the actual content of the lessons, said leaders for three of the five groups receiving the funding. The curriculum is meant to teach teenagers about how to practice safe sex, as well as how to have healthy relationships, overcome obstacles in life and be responsible with money, the organizations’ leaders said.
The letter gave organizations until Oct. 27 to stop using those materials or risk losing funding. The Department of Public Health is working with those nonprofits to make sure they meet that deadline, a spokesperson said in an email.
Representatives for Columbia Housing Authority and Auxilium Community Development Corporation, two of the groups that receive grant funding, did not respond to requests for comment. Both advertise programs teaching youth life skills on their websites.
Lowcountry Youth Services
Lowcountry Youth Services, which runs several programs in Charleston, Berkeley and Dorchester counties, wasn’t using the instructions on gender and sexuality at all, said executive director ReZsaun Lewis.
At a school district’s request, the nonprofit will come into the school for 10 weeks and teach groups of about 15 to 20 students life skills, such as how to respond to difficult situations in life, how to communicate effectively and how to advocate for themselves, Lewis said.
“There was nothing related to gender ideology or anything like that,” Lewis said. “It was all about making sure that the kids had a better framework for life.”
Children, their parents and the school officials who sat in on the courses all enjoyed the program, which the nonprofit chose because it offered good exercises to teach students about leadership and communication, Lewis said.
For example, programs for elementary schools taught children how to share and make others feel included during playtime, Lewis said. For older children, the lessons grew more complex, such as helping young men overcome the stigma around showing emotions and teaching them to communicate their feelings, he said.
The nonprofit, which has run programs in more than a dozen schools across three Lowcountry school districts, is evaluating its options moving forward, Lewis said. Whatever curriculum leaders decide to use, Lewis’ top priority is keeping the program going to make sure students who might lack mentorship at home have access to trustworthy adults, he said.
“We’re going to do the work, and if the work requires us getting a different curriculum, we’ll get a different curriculum,” Lewis said.
Federal health agency orders states to strip references to gender identity from sex ed

Whatever curriculum the nonprofit decides to use, Lewis said he worries about federal or state officials finding another “boogeyman,” or another topic mentioned in the materials, that will force the group to change its programming again.
“We don’t know how we’re able to do the work in a way that makes them happy, to be honest with you,” Lewis said. “We’re doing the best we can, and we’ll continue to do the best we can, because the kids need us.”
“If we’re not doing the work and organizations like ours are taken out of the fight, then our kids really are left at an extreme disadvantage,” he continued.
Palmetto Place Children and Youth Services
In Columbia, Palmetto Place Children and Youth Services is also focused on how to keep its afterschool programs on sexual health running, said executive director Damien Talley.
No matter what directives come up, Palmetto Place will continue helping teenagers in whatever capacity possible, even if that means directing them to other resources, Talley said.
“As long as there’s a need for us and the services we provide, we will find a way to navigate any challenges with funding to support our youth,” Talley said.
The nonprofit chose its curriculum because leaders felt it was particularly instructive about both abstinence and contraception. The hundreds of teenagers who have gone through the program have found it helpful to avoid pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections, as well as know what to do if they end up in one of those situations, Talley said.
“We wanted to give them as much information as they could have so they could make the best possible choices,” he said.
The group is continuing to use parts of the curriculum but have removed any reference to gender, Talley said. Based on the instructions the nonprofit received from the state, that should put the program in compliance with the letter, he said.
Boys and Girls Clubs of the Pee Dee
Along with lessons about sexual health, the Boys and Girls Clubs of the Pee Dee use $60,000 in federal grant funding each year to teach preteens and teens about how to be good leaders and manage their finances, said program director Michael Woods.
About 120 youth participated in the program this year, Woods said. The programs take place outside of school, and anyone participating needs their parents’ permission to discuss sexual health, Woods said.
The Florence-based nonprofit has stopped the courses using the curriculum flagged in the letter, Woods said. To do otherwise and risk losing grant funding would mean halting the programs altogether, taking away a vital resource for many children in the community, he said.
The Boys & Girls Club is still figuring out how to move forward, he said.
“It’s our responsibility to make sure they’re responsible and caring citizens, at the end of the day,” Woods said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sex-education-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-08 06:56:46.909658

(Courtesy of Howard K. Marcus)OMAHA — The new Omaha mayor weighed in Monday on the 2nd Congressional District’s Democratic primary.
Omaha Mayor John Ewing endorsed Douglas County District Court Clerk Crystal Rhoades in a busy field as the Democratic nominee for the U.S. House seat in the state’s most politically divided and diverse district.

Ewing said Congress requires “leaders who are ready to get to work from day one” and said, “Crystal Rhoades is that leader.”
“Her leadership as a key advisor on my mayoral campaign was not just instrumental to our victory,” Ewing said. “It was a clear demonstration of her ability to navigate complex challenges and deliver results.”
Rhoades said having Ewing’s endorsement was a great honor. She called him “an experienced leader” and said she was “grateful for his support.” 
Democrats started lining up to run next year even before news broke of U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., not running in 2026, partly because the Omaha-based district is a place where the party’s nominees have lost four straight times by single digits. 
The crowded Democratic field includes State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, Douglas County newcomer Denise Powell and Navy veteran Kishla Askins. 
Randall Adkins, a University of Nebraska at Omaha political science professor, described Ewing as Omaha’s most prominent Democrat. 
“His endorsement is a signal to his supporters that they should consider supporting her financially or otherwise,” Adkins said.

Some Democrats point to the mayoral election in May as a hint of a possible blue tide for the state’s second-largest party to capitalize on, though political observers acknowledge that the fundamentals of the slightly right-leaning 2nd District haven’t changed. 
National and state GOP strategists have acknowledged that an open-seat 2nd District race is winnable for Democrats, but they say Republicans can win and hold the seat. The GOP primary to replace Bacon includes Omaha City Council Vice President Brinker Harding and former State Sen. Brett Lindstrom of Omaha. 
Rhoades, a lifetime Omahan, was previously elected as a member of the Nebraska Public Service Commission, the state’s catch-all regulator. 
She has a history of helping local Democrats win elections as a political consultant, including helping Ewing become the first Democrat in more than a decade to lead the largest city in Nebraska. She also has faced criticisms for butting heads with people who disagree with her.
“Whether it’s advocating for working families, protecting access to healthcare, or standing up for civil rights,” Ewing said, “Crystal has never backed down. She will go to Washington with a clear mandate to get Congress working for the people again.”

In October 2023, a group calling itself Return to the Land established its first “Whites only community” in the Ozark Mountains of Arkansas. They followed that with a second enclave nearby in 2025.
The group, which describes itself as a “private membership association” that helps groups form “European heritage communities,” plans to build four more sites, including another location in the Ozarks and two in Appalachia.
Return to the Land believes that by calling themselves a private membership association they can create a white ethnostate – a type of state in which residence is limited to white people – and legally exclude people based on race, religion and sexual orientation.
If you read the words of Eric Orwoll, the group’s co-founder, its mission is clear: “You want a white nation? Build a white town … it can be done. We’re doing it.”
As a scholar of right-wing extremism, I have examined several groups calling for a white homeland in America. The creation of a white ethnostate is often seen as an ultimate goal of such white nationalism, which argues that white people form part of a genetically and culturally superior race deserving of protection and preservation. While Return to the Land doesn’t identify as white nationalists, their statements often align with the ideology.
White ethnostates, big and small
One of the best-known plans for a white ethnostate is the Northwest Imperative, popularized by white nationalists during the 1970s and ’80s. The plan involved certain citizens taking 10% of the United States – the states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Wyoming and Montana – and excluding all nonwhite people from living there.
Proponents of the plan argued that these states were already majority white and contained large tracts of undeveloped land, making the territory ideal for white-only settlement. High-profile extremists of the time such as Richard Butler, Robert Mathews and David Lane supported the plan.
Still today, groups such as the Northwest Front, a white nationalist group founded in 2009 and located in the Pacific Northwest, continue to promote variations of this idea.
While the Pacific Northwest has a long history with right-wing extremist organizing, the proponents of whites-only communities have also targeted areas of the Northeast as possible locations for a white ethnostate.
In 2018, for example, Tom Kawczynski, town manager of Jackman, Maine, was fired when his views came to light, including views that have been characterized as “pro-white.”
More recently, in 2023, the People’s Initiative of New England, a splinter group of the neo-Nazi organization National Socialist Club-131, introduced themselves on the online platform Substack. There, the group laid out its goal of establishing the six states of New England — Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont — as white-only.
The goal of gaining control of multiple states is unrealistic, of course, at least peacefully. Therefore, a popular alternative, along the lines of Return to the Land’s actions, is to establish smaller all-white communities.
In 2013, media outlets reported that neo-Nazi Craig Cobb was buying land in the small town of Leith, North Dakota, to build a white nationalist community. The town rallied to oppose this attempt.
Later that year, Cobb was charged with seven felonies related to confronting residents with a gun. He was sentenced to probation for four years and deeded the property back to the town in 2014.
And in 2021, leaked Telegram chats revealed that Christopher Pohlhaus, a former U.S. Marine and founder of the neo-Nazi group Blood Tribe, wanted to establish a whites-only community in Springfield, Maine. Pohlhaus was developing a military training facility as part of these efforts when media coverage led him to sell the property and move out of state.
The danger of a white ethnostate
These various attempts to develop a white ethnostate are not simply individual, isolated cases. They form part of a larger movement toward achieving white nationalism.
A major part of white nationalism today is focused on anti-immigrant hatred. That has spurred major acts of extreme violence such as the 2019 murders of 23 people in El Paso, Texas, the majority of whom were Hispanic.

The “great replacement theory,” a conspiracy theory popular among white nationalists, argues that various policies are leading to the destruction of the white race. This theory inspired the 2022 mass killing of 10 Black Americans in a supermarket in Buffalo, New York.
The shooter selected the supermarket because of its location in a predominantly Black neighborhood and left behind a white supremacy manifesto.
Communities across the U.S. have successfully resisted the establishment of white ethnostates.
The residents of Leith, North Dakota, did this by creating a website informing people about what was happening in their community. Public outcry also met Pohlhaus in Maine.
As for Return to the Land, Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin said in July 2025 that his office is reviewing the group’s actions and whether they violate the law.
“Racism has no place in a free society,” he said, “but from a legal perspective, we have not seen anything that would indicate any state or federal laws have been broken.”

(Moe Clark/Colorado Newsline) Criminal justice reform advocates are pressing Colorado corrections officials for more details on their efforts to reduce the state’s prison population after the requirements of a 2018 law were triggered for the first time.
The vacancy rate in state prisons stood at 1.92% as of Aug. 16, marking the 30th consecutive day the department maintained a vacancy rate below 3%,  according to a Colorado Department of Corrections letter reviewed by Newsline. House Bill 18-1410, a bipartisan law passed unanimously by the General Assembly in 2018, requires that once that threshold is reached, the department must begin to take steps to reduce the incarcerated population in coordination with the state parole board and the Office of Community Corrections, which oversees halfway houses.
The Office of Community Corrections is required to identify open beds that CDOC can use on a weekly basis until the vacancy rate rises above 4% for 30 consecutive days, according to CDOC spokesperson Alonda Gonzalez. The department must also provide a list of people who are incarcerated who meet a specific set of criteria that would make them eligible for parole to the state parole board.

“Beyond these statutory requirements, CDOC actively monitors facilities, adjusts bed assignments and staffing, facilitates transfers, and ensures safe and orderly operations statewide,” Gonzalez said in a statement. 
The parole board isn’t required to release all of those people under the population management law — only to hold a hearing to review each of their cases.
Colorado’s prison population has been steadily on the rise since it drastically decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic, rising from a low of 15,434 in June 2021 to 17,945 at the end of July, according to CDOC data. 
It’s been just over three weeks since CDOC reached the threshold requiring measures to reduce the prison population, but the department was unable to provide Newsline with updated information before publication. The Office of Community Corrections, which is part of the state Division of Criminal Justice within the Department of Public Safety, did not respond to a request for comment.
Sheriffs seek ‘urgent action’
Christie Donner, executive director of the Colorado Criminal Justice Reform Coalition, said the law outlines three groups of people CDOC must make lists of to send to the parole board to review eligibility, and she obtained two of those lists through an open records request. 
The list of those who are close to their mandatory release date included 13 people, and the list of people who are considered low risk due to non-violent convictions included 92 people. She did not receive information on “conditional releases,” which refers to someone who needs to complete a task, such as a victim notification or a drug and alcohol class, before they can be released. 
“We never really intended for this bill to be big releases,” Donner said of the 2018 law. “It was just, can we be efficient? Can we fully utilize community corrections?”
Donner also hasn’t been able to get confirmation of exactly how many community corrections beds are available from the state, but providers have told her there are “hundreds” available that could be better used by the department. Using those beds, to Donner, is the “biggest opportunity” to efficiently reduce the prison population.
The Colorado Legislature considered a bill this year that considered additional options for housing people who make parole and to slow prison population growth, but it failed after the state House never took it up for a floor vote. 
People sentenced to state prison have been held in county jails longer than normal as a result of CDOC’s low bed capacity, which Donner said has been an intentional way the department has artificially inflated its vacancy rates to avoid hitting the 3% threshold. 
In July, 17 Colorado sheriffs wrote a letter to Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, seeking “urgent action” to address the backlog of people in county jail custody awaiting transfer to CDOC. The state reimburses sheriffs offices $77.16 per person per day awaiting transfer to prison, which the letter says leads to sheriffs absorbing a funding shortfall of more than $60 per day.  
“County jails were never designed — or funded — to house state inmates for extended periods,” the letter said. “Yet we’re being forced to expand capacity and stretch already limited staff to accommodate inmates who should be in state custody. This isn’t just unsustainable — it’s unfair to local taxpayers.”
Donner emphasized that the 2018 law was bipartisan and passed the Colorado Legislature unanimously, “so this is not a controversial concept in terms of managing the population through efficiency — nobody is getting out ‘early.’” She said if jail backlogs were addressed sooner, some of the measures in the law could have been implemented sooner and more beds could have been opened.

(Photo courtesy of Xcel Energy)A North Dakota interim legislative committee has selected Nucleon Energy, a Canadian development company, to chart the state’s path to a nuclear-powered future. 
The Alberta-based nuclear development company will spend the next 12 months studying the possibility of attracting the resurgent nuclear power industry to the state. The key elements of the study will include identifying potential locations, gauging public support and laying the groundwork for the federal licensing process. 
“We’re believers that nuclear will be an affordable source of power that does not need subsidies that can be competitive with other fuel types,” said Will Bridge, chief technology officer for Nucleon Energy. “That hasn’t proven itself out yet. But we also believe we need to start now.”
Nuclear energy research gets green light in North Dakota

The selection was made by the Advanced Nuclear Energy Committee, an interim committee composed of legislators, executive agency representatives and private sector leaders. The group reviewed proposals from nine firms during a Wednesday hearing, including two with North Dakota ties, but ultimately chose Nucleon Energy. 
Lawmakers earlier this year approved House Bill 1025, which authorized up to $300,000 in state funding for a nuclear energy study. Nucleon’s proposal included a cost estimate of $275,000. 
Nucleon specializes in small modular reactors – smaller and less expensive alternatives to the behemoth facilities providing conventional nuclear power. The company’s presentation emphasized the importance of public engagement. 
“I thought Nucleon had the best background material and plan,” said Sen. Tim Mathern, D-Fargo, a member of the committee.

The company’s first step will be finding the right site. Executives emphasized the importance of existing or planned transmission infrastructure in the site selection process. 
“It’s fundamental that we put these where the transmission grid either now or in the near future allows, otherwise we drive up costs for ratepayers and that’s not going to make sense for North Dakotans,” said Ryan Tourigny, Nucleon’s chief development officer. 
But the crucial factor in determining whether a site could realistically host a nuclear power plant will be whether there is public support in the local community – or not. 
“The permitting cycle for nuclear plants is so long and so expensive that you can’t push that into a community,” Bridge said. Nucleon has had success with bringing neutral experts into a community to educate people on the technology and ensuring that community feels like a partner on the project from day one. “We see that as just good business. You can’t push nuclear facilities into communities that don’t want them.”
The importance of early public engagement was echoed by many committee members. 
“As elected officials, we run into the fact that you say the word ‘nuclear’ and you get a radioactive reaction from communities,” said Sen. Janne Myrdal, R-Edinburg, a member of Legislative Management. 
Nuclear seen as a power solution but needs more study, legislators say

Pam Gorman Prochaska, general manager of Xcel Energy’s nuclear fleet and one of the private sector representatives on the committee, said she has seen that play out. County officials in Minnesota approached Xcel about bringing nuclear power to their community at one point, Gorman Prochaska said, but “within weeks, the anti-nuclear community had infiltrated that community and went literally door-to-door” using a lot of “scare tactics.” 
One of the biggest drivers of anti-nuclear sentiment has been the question of where the radioactive waste, a byproduct of nuclear power generation, will be stored. The United States, unlike some other countries, has no centralized permanent storage facility. 
“It seems like, nationally, we’ve got a crisis that we don’t have permanent storage facilities,” said Rep. Ben Koppelman, R-West Fargo. 
Michelle Zietlow-Miller, testifying for the Gateway for Accelerated Innovation in Nuclear, said the lack of a central depository for nuclear waste is not a significant issue. All of the nuclear waste produced in the United States during the last 40 years can fit on a single football field, she said, 15 yards high. The waste is solid, not liquid, and is typically stored in secure casks on-site at nuclear power facilities, she said.

Yet many questions about next generation nuclear reactors remain. Tourigny said they believe the technology will become economical over time and right now North Dakota should focus on laying the groundwork for future projects without necessarily needing to have customers for the electricity lined up. 
Bridge, the chief technology officer, acknowledged there are still questions about whether the new generation of reactor technology will be economically viable. There are small modular reactors being developed around the world, Bridge said, but none have so far been proven as both affordable and commercially viable.
Other obstacles in the nuclear industry include lengthy regulatory timelines at the federal level, the potentially prohibitive cost of nuclear power plants compared to alternative fuel sources and reconstructing the domestic supply chain that has been mostly dormant for decades. 
Nucleon Energy was not a unanimous choice. Five members of the committee expressed a preference for the runner-up: Excel Services Corporation, which has specialized in nuclear energy development for over 40 years. Excel was named first alternate. Nucleon’s contract for the study will be negotiated by Legislative Council and is subject to approval by Legislative Management’s chair, Sen. David Hogue, R-Minot. 
Interest in nuclear power is growing as public utilities look for ways to meet the rising demand for electricity driven, in part, by the proliferation of artificial intelligence and data centers. Katie Austgen, with the Nuclear Energy Institute, told the committee there have been 530 nuclear reactors proposed across North America that could begin operating in the 2030s. Of those, two reactors were recently completed and began operating in Georgia, nine are under construction, and 23 are officially planned. 
“The whole country is taking this challenge on,” said Rep. Don Vigesaa, R-Cooperstown. “It’s time to get in the race and get going with this because it’s quite a long process.”

I’ve been  thinking the two former papers I used to work for – Spooner Advocate and Sawyer County Record – were probably looking for readers who have friends or relatives with some connection to the recent mass shooting Wednesday, Aug. 27, at the Annunciation Catholic Church in South Minneapolis that left two youngsters dead and 21 others injured.
I  Googled the church’s location and realized that I had been just six blocks from it early this spring when I visited the Russian Art Museum. The church is also 10 or 15 minutes north of where my sister, Charlotte, lives.
Later, Charlotte called me and said she and my other sister, Alma, had attended the church for Christmas Eve or New Year’s Eve mass. Charlotte mentioned that a neighbor had a daughter who attended the same pre-K-8 Catholic school as the students who were  fired upon.
Without knowing any victims, just the proximity of the church to my previous visit and my sisters’ and the neighbors’ experience, there is some connection I have with that tragedy, be it ever so thin.
A couple of years ago, when I worked for the Sawyer County Record, I did a story on a woman who works in Hayward whose son had been attending Michigan State University when a man went on a short shooting rampage in February 2023 on campus.
It was after doing that story of the local boy to the Michigan State University shooting, that it hit me that more and more of us are having some connection to a gun shooting, especially school shootings.
We may not have witnessed the shooting, and we hopefully didn’t have any loved one injured or traumatized, but still we might be one or two or three or four persons removed from the tragedy, like the  woman whose son was in proximity to the Michigan State shooter.
It’s just logical with more and more of these mass shootings more of us would have these connections.
There are those directly impacted by mass shootings, the victims and their families, but there are scores more that are indirectly connected, and because of those connections the tragedy has more importance. The event becomes less abstract as you hear about a friend’s daughter or niece or cousin who had to hide under her desk to avoid rounds of gunfire echoing through the halls of education. It becomes less abstract as the mother of the Michigan State University student describes her fear when she heard about the gunman and knew her son might be shot.
After a mass shooting happens, we hear people argue  that it’s not the guns causing the deaths but the shooters, and then others advocate for legislation that would keep guns out of the hands of people likely to commit such atrocities.
After a mass shooting, we’ve become too familiar with how this debate over guns unfolds, and many of us are frustrated that very little ever changes.
However, I believe we will have sensible gun legislation so those with mental illnesses don’t have access to a gun, and red flag laws will help law enforcement identify those who are more likely to go on a shooting spree and secure weapons before a tragedy occurs.
I think it is inevitable because attitudes are going to change as more and more of us have these direct and indirect connections to mass shootings.
And a connection to a tragedy changes attitudes.
When drug overdose deaths were a thing that appeared to mostly happen in far-away cities, there wasn’t that much support in rural Wisconsin for attacking the problem. But when overdose deaths began to occur in the suburbs and rural communities, the reality of the drug epidemic hit home, and widespread support for addressing it grew. 
We are slowly, incrementally, each finding some point of connection to a mass shooting just because there have been so many of them: 503 mass shootings in 2024 alone.
The question in my mind is not if the legislation will happen, but how many people will have to die before enough of us, regardless of political affiliation, demand  sensible gun legislation.

(Photo courtesy of Sarina Larson)I fell in love with flying when I was 15 years old right here in Horseshoe Bend, Idaho. My dad’s friend, Jerry — who I later learned was a legendary local flight instructor — nonchalantly offered me an airplane ride one summer morning. I had no idea it would change the course of my life.
Jerry said something that day that I’ll never forget: “You know, girls make good pilots. They’re often less impulsive and more thoughtful than men.”
As I processed his words over the hum of the engine and the view of the mountains below, a light switched on in my head. Until then, I thought flying was something men did. Jerry helped me see that I could belong in aviation too.
But my path from that airplane ride to pursuing an aviation career was anything but simple. Flight training costs are high. Mentorship is limited, especially in rural or smaller communities. Often, the young people who succeed are those with family ties in aviation or the financial ability to fund years of training. I had neither.
Today, the aviation industry needs new talent more than ever. Boeing projects that by 2042, the United States will need 127,000 new pilots and 135,000 new Airframe & Powerplant mechanics to maintain and expand the nation’s fleets. Meanwhile, the FAA is short 3,000 air traffic controllers, with training pipelines that take years to complete. The future of aviation depends on welcoming diverse, motivated professionals, including young women who struggle to see themselves in the cockpit, control tower or hangar.
I founded the Gem State Chapter of Women in Aviation International to change this, and it’s what motivates our Girls in Aviation Day held each year in Boise.
This year’s free, community event is slated for Saturday, Sept. 20 at Jackson Jet Center at the Boise Airport, from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Girls ages 8 to 18 will get the chance to explore inside real airplanes, connect with real pilots, and experience real opportunities in aviation.
When I was a teenager, I didn’t know any female pilots. If I had, I might have realized sooner that I was fully capable of achieving this dream. Girls in Aviation Day offers early exposure to aviation. Without this kind of mentorship and financial support, many students never make it past the starting line.
For today’s dreamers, Girls in Aviation Day is the spark. It says: This could be you. The skies are for everyone. Together, we can lift the next generation into the skies.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)As federal prosecutors push harder for swift deportations and accounts of immigration officers arresting people at court hearings circulate, a Memphis-based legal nonprofit and clergy members are working together to ensure these events don’t go unwitnessed.
Advocates for Immigrant Rights (AIR) is in the early stages of building what the law firm hopes will become a robust immigration court watch program run with clergy volunteers, Executive Director Casey Bryant said.
The firm provides affordable legal help and support services to immigrants, serving people in Tennessee, North Mississippi, Arkansas and sometimes Kentucky — all areas handled by the Memphis immigration court. There are 126,623 pending immigration cases in the Memphis court as of July 31, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a University of Syracuse organization that gathers federal data.
This spring, immigration attorneys began to take note of a new legal tactic across the country. When immigrants who have been released at the border show up for their assigned court dates, prosecutors are pushing for their cases to be dismissed, leaving them without the protection of the court process. When they leave, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers are waiting to arrest them and sometimes quickly deport them in a process called expedited removal, Bryant said.
A Department of Homeland Security notice issued in January walked back Biden-era limits on expedited removal in an effort to “apply expedited removal to the fullest extent authorized by Congress.” In July, advocates filed a class-action lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Justice on behalf of 12 immigrants from several countries who were arrested after their first court hearing and face expedited removal orders.
Tennessee faith leaders criticize ICE anti-immigrant action, “harassment” of Nashville mayor

“Secretary (Kristi) Noem is reversing Biden’s catch-and-release policy that allowed millions of unvetted illegal aliens to be let loose on American streets,” the Department of Homeland Security wrote in a May statement to CBS News regarding the administration’s shift in policy.
Bryant said the tactic “blindsided” court advocates. Most immigrants do not have legal representation, meaning “a ton of people were just getting whisked away from immigration courts with no witness except for the staff of the court,” Bryant said.
That’s where Catholic priest Juan Antonio “Tony” Romo comes in. Members of his majority-Hispanic congregation at his Memphis church have been arrested and deported, and the church community is afraid, he said. Romo saw a news story about a bishop in San Diego who attended immigration court hearings and felt compelled to act.
Romo and Monsignor Valentine Handwerker — a retired Memphis priest who spent nearly 50 years in ministry and remains concerned with social justice issues — reached out to ask Bryant to attend hearings with them and explain what they were seeing.
Inside immigration court
Romo recalled an immigration immersion trip he made with other clergy members and nuns in southern Arizona a few years ago. They traced immigrants’ paths through the desert and attended a court hearing. Romo said immigrants were led in wearing jail uniforms and chains, with no representation.
“The judge would just say, boom … you are deported, boom, you are deported,” he said. “It was a pretty disgusting experience of the way the people were mistreated.”
Romo said he cares about social issues — issues “faced by the people of God beyond the spiritual.”
“I’m a missionary,” he said. “I don’t call myself an immigrant, but in some ways, I am. I came to the U.S., not in the way of making a better life, but in a way to minister, to serve the people of God. But to the (Trump) administration and for most people, I’m an immigrant.”
Romo was born in Mexico and moved to the United States after completing two years of law school to join the Society of the Divine Word, a Catholic clerical congregation. He completed his undergraduate and masters degrees in Iowa and Illinois, and spent two years training as a missionary in Portugal. Romo has lived in California, Florida and Washington, D.C., according to the Saint Joseph Catholic Church, where he has served as pastor since 2012.
In the Memphis immigration court, Romo’s experience was different. None of the immigrants he saw had legal representation, he said, but translators were available and Romo described one judge as calm and caring. 
“As we engaged in conversation with (the judge), he told us about people who are already frightened when they come to court,” Romo said. “And he said, ‘Why make it worse?’”
Romo did not see any arrests or ICE presence during his first two visits. 
“Everyone got another day in court,” he said. “Their judges asked them for more documents and to edit their application for asylum.”
When Romo first walked into the building, he saw three people there to appear in court. He introduced himself and Handwerker as priests who “decided to just come and be present for people” and asked if they would like the priests to attend their hearings. 
“The smiles on their faces — it was like, yes, Father, please,” he said. 
Later, they thanked the priests as they left. 
“That told us how people feel when they see their priest is standing up with them,” Romo said. “Just being there. Even if you cannot do anything, even if you cannot say anything, just being there means a lot to them.”
Bryant envisions a program where there is always someone in each courtroom bearing witness to the court proceedings and decisions made.
“It’s also about people seeing friendly faces” in a “process that is so dehumanizing,” Bryant said.
Next steps
The next steps to build a formal court watch program include recruiting more court watchers and obtaining buy-in from the court’s administration, Bryant said.
AIR partners with multiple organizations, including Catholic Charities of East and West Tennessee, and Bryant said the nonprofit is also working with the Memphis Interfaith Coalition for Action and Hope, a group that has connections with clergy from different denominations.
Ultimately, AIR will develop training for volunteers to familiarize them with court decorum and protocol.
Getting the court to recognize the program is the next key step, Bryant said. While immigration court hearings are generally open to the public for observation, Bryant said the court’s formal blessing would “ensure volunteer observers could get into the courts without hassle.” It could also help with scheduling volunteers if the program gets advance notice on which judges have hearings on which days.
Bryant said the Memphis court directed AIR to contact court administration on the national level. Bryant is awaiting their response.
The U.S. Department of Justice’s Executive Office for Immigration Review, which administers the immigration court system, doesn’t have a formal pathway to set up a court watch system, but it does offer a Model Hearing Program that explains the court’s procedures and offers opportunities to observe live model hearings with a review of relevant law.
Religious and advocacy groups have successfully set up immigration court watch programs in other cities, including Chicago Courtwatch and the Human Rights Defender Project in Minnesota. Depending on the program, volunteers are sometimes asked to collect data and observations on court proceedings.
Court watch programs also reach beyond immigration court across the United States. The programs “ensure scrutiny and evaluation,” according to the American Bar Association (ABA). “They serve to highlight the realities of our legal system by recording data, uncovering stories, identifying trends, and highlighting problems” that can potentially drive reform, ABA states.
In the meantime, Romo has told his parishioners that he will do his best to attend immigration hearings for anyone who wants him to be there.
Bryant said court watching is also an opportunity for people to see the system in action, and perhaps challenge misconceptions.
“I really think that bringing people to court, even if it’s just one time, will open their eyes to the way that people are being treated in this country, and it will change their mind,” Bryant said. “If they think one way, I think they’re going to see it’s something totally different.”",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/gavel.jpg,,,2025-09-08 06:56:46.909658

(Photo: John Partipilo)Back to school season was always an exciting time for me as a kid. Every year, my parents would take my sisters and me shopping for new clothes, shoes, backpacks, Trapper Keepers, folders, book covers, pens and pencils. For a nerdy girl, the start of a new school year was like another birthday. I loved my new school supplies and couldn’t wait to see my friends after the summer break. 
But now with schools back in session, it’s a time fraught with anxiety and fear. Back to school now means back to school shooting season. The season officially started this year on August 28 with a mass shooting at a private school in Minneapolis. For the parents, kids, teachers and staff at that school, their dreaded nightmare became tragically real. 
Here in Nashville, I couldn’t help but reflect on the mass shooting that happened here at the Covenant school just two years ago. Our city collectively mourned that tragedy and turned up at the state capitol in droves, demanding action and change. It seemed like Gov. Bill Lee was listening when he called the special session of the state legislature.
3 kids, 3 adults killed in shooting at Nashville private elementary school

Frustratingly, of the four bills that became law as a result of that session, only one had anything to do with guns.
Since that special session, gun safety advocates have been ever present at the Capitol, trying to convince legislators to do more on gun safety. Poll after poll shows the majority of Tennesseans want gun safety laws like extreme risk protection orders. But what do we get from our lawmakers? The obligatory “thoughts and prayers” and laws that will do little to nothing to help fix the root cause of the problem.
Several kids have gotten caught in the crosshairs of “school safety” laws. Schools now expel students for making statements thought to be threats of violence, calling the police and having them arrested. Instead of performing an investigation into a student’s possibly misunderstood statement and determining the appropriate disciplinary action, kids are being placed in handcuffs and sent to jail. When asked if they plan to fix this obvious problem with the law, our lawmakers have doubled down, saying “it’s working the way we want it to.” 
Another bill our state legislature passed to address school safety provided funding for schools to employ School Resource Officers, or SROs, typically off duty police officers. A bill sponsored by Rep. Chris Todd of Jackson, which has yet to pass, would expand this role to include retired police officers and honorably discharged veterans.
There is controversy surrounding SROs. Some studies have shown that while having an SRO present can lead to less violence in schools, Black, Hispanic, and children with disabilities are disproportionately disciplined, leading to higher interactions with law enforcement and contributing to the school to prison pipeline. There have also been issues with SROs being careless with their firearms, putting students, teachers and staff at risk. In 2017, a student at a school in Morgan County found a gun left unattended by an SRO in a school bathroom.
Having an SRO in your school is no guarantee for your kids’ safety. In the most recent school shooting here in Nashville, at Antioch High School this past January, two SROs were present.
Instead of protecting children, these laws have turned schools into pipelines to the justice system. Students are being expelled and arrested for minor infractions, and this impact is gravely disproportionate. Rather than investigating and addressing behavior in a way that actually supports safety, lawmakers are choosing to criminalize children for being children, while refusing to pass the kinds of gun safety laws that would actually keep schools safe. 
Tennessee reps irked by state’s failure on gun safe storage campaign

Another “school safety” bill passed last year, allowing Tennessee teachers to carry guns in schools, this one sponsored by Rep. Ryan Williams of Cookeville. Under the new law, school districts can opt in to arm teachers who must go through 40 hours of training, pass a psychological evaluation, submit fingerprints and get a handgun permit, steps that we somehow don’t require of other gun owners in Tennessee. Parents were understandably upset, especially since they would not be notified if there was a gun in their child’s classroom. The idea of having teachers carry guns in their classrooms is so ridiculous that we have yet to hear any school district adopt this policy.
This year, Tennessee parents may be surprised to learn about a new law that went into effect which requires students to learn about guns. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Chris Todd and Sen. Paul Bailey of Sparta, passed in 2024 but didn’t take effect until this school year. With the passage of this law, Tennessee became the first state in the country to require gun safety classes statewide. 
Instead of requiring adults who own guns to go through mandatory safety training and require them to safely store their firearms out of the reach, lawmakers are putting the onus on kindergarteners to keep themselves and those around them safe. It’s absolutely maddening. Unfortunately we have months until our state legislature is back in session to push them to pass gun safety laws that actually make sense. Until then, we’ll force Tennessee’s school kids to be the adults in the room. 
In Tennessee, school is back in session. Let’s hope our lawmakers learn how to pass gun laws that will actually keep our kids safe. Until they do, the outcome is predictable: more traumatized youth, more broken futures, and schools no safer than before.

Enough of the stink that stretches for miles and lingers for days. Enough of the sewage-laden trucks rumbling down local roads. Enough of the environmental fines, the lawsuits, the contract disputes and costly equipment repairs. 
“The quality of life in this city has suffered long enough,” Woonsocket Mayor Christopher Beauchamp said in a recent interview. “We don’t want to be the disposal of everyone else’s waste.”
After more than a century under city ownership, Beauchamp and the Woonsocket City Council are looking to wash their hands of the Woonsocket Wastewater Treatment Facility: They want to shut down the incineration arm that burns dried waste, and sell off the sewage treatment segment. An Aug. 25 resolution unanimously approved by the City Council authorizes negotiations to transfer the plant title and permits to the Narragansett Bay Commission, a quasi-public agency that already runs the largest wastewater operations in the state.
The resolution is preliminary and nonbinding, dependent on the agreement of the Narragansett Bay Commission and of the two private companies under contract to manage Woonsocket’s wastewater treatment plan into the next decade. Also a key consideration: the financial implications for a cash-strapped city that brings in money from treating waste throughout the region, while getting free access for its own sewage. 
“It’s like playing 20 games of chess at the same time,” City Solicitor Michael Lepizzera said. “It’s going to take a long time. There are a lot of parts and people involved.”
But Lepizzera thinks the payoff could be worth the challenge. 
“This could be a generational change,” Lepizzera said.

A ‘generational change’
Once heralded as a pinnacle of engineering ingenuity and government self-sufficiency, the sprawling, riverfront sewage plant has soured with time. Aging equipment demands costly fixes, or even costlier environmental and legal fees when malfunctions lead to water and air pollution. 
Look no further than the series of complaints about untreated sewage pouring into the Blackstone River beginning in 2021, culminating in a March 2023 lawsuit by the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management and the Rhode Island Attorney General’s Office against the city and the companies contracted to run the plant. Four months later, a second lawsuit: this time, a federal class-action case from local residents alleging the smells emanating from the plant have hurt their property values and quality of life. Both cases remain pending, according to court records.
The City Council’s resolution, sponsored by Council President Dan Gendron, points to the drain on financial and legal resources from the protracted legal battles.










The quality of life in this city has suffered long enough. We don’t want to be the disposal of everyone else’s waste.


– Woonsocket Mayor Christopher Beauchamp 


And while the immediate pollution concerns appear resolved thanks to emergency equipment purchases — for which the city is still repaying the debt — the bill keeps growing.
The incineration arm still requires “substantial upgrades and infrastructure improvements,” to the tune of $40 to $50 million, the City Council resolution states. Neighbors are still filing complaints over the smell.
However, wriggling out of the contracts with the companies hired to run the operations might not be costly or hard. Synagro Woonsocket LLC, the company hired to oversee the incinerator, has indicated it would be open to cutting the 20-year contract off, according to multiple city officials.
“They’re spending a lot of money on legal fees,” Lepizzera said of the two private contractors. “Eliminating these contracts might be beneficial to them.”
Jennifer Cervenka, an attorney for Synagro, did not return multiple inquiries for comment. Jacobs Engineering Group, which oversees the wastewater treatment side of the plant, also did not respond to requests for comment.
Both vendors signed 20-year contracts with the city in 2012, guaranteeing their work and income from services provided through 2032, according to contracts previously obtained by Rhode Island Current through a public records request.

Looking for an exit
However, the agreements also offer all parties legal exit routes, including for potential negligence — something Beauchamp sees as a firm rationale given the sewage spills that led to the state lawsuit.
“Synagro has not kept up their end of the bargain in fixing that plant,” Beauchamp said.
Lepizzera was reluctant to “disregard” the legally binding agreements with Synagro and Jacobs. He looks to find a mutually beneficial resolution that would allow the city to shut down the incinerator and sell the treatment plant for the right price.
Much hinges on the terms of a potential sale to the Narragansett Bay Commission, or another owner. Lepizzera declined to name a dollar figure, but wanted a price that covers the city’s $29 million debt on the money it borrowed to pay for plant upgrades last year, and to offset the lost revenue it gets from treating sewage for more than dozen other cities, companies and wastewater plants across the region. 
The city brings in $3 million in annual host fees from the two contractors plus a share of royalties from incineration up to $600,000 a year under its contracts with Synagro and Jacobs. And, Woonsocket has its waste treated for free.
“All of that is going to be part of the equation,” Lepizzera said. “If NBC doesn’t give us the best deal and bang for our buck, and protect our community, we could go in another direction.”
Jamie Samons, a Narragansett Bay Commission spokesperson, declined to comment on specific terms of an agreement, noting that negotiations are just beginning.
“Should NBC and Woonsocket reach a mutually beneficial agreement, these communities — and all who enjoy the Blackstone River — will benefit from NBC’s nationally recognized excellence in clean water operations, financial stewardship and community engagement,” Samons said in an emailed response. “In the coming months, NBC staff and Board of Commissioners will work closely with key stakeholders to conduct thorough due diligence. If a transfer is approved, NBC is committed to making the transition as seamless and transparent as possible.”

A proven track record 
Narragansett Bay Commission has proven its skill in transforming struggling municipal wastewater treatment facilities into nationally acclaimed success stories, first with the Field’s Point Wastewater Treatment Facility in Providence in 1982, and a decade later, East Providence’s Bucklin Point Wastewater Treatment Facility. The award-winning clean water agency now provides wastewater treatment services to more than 400,000 state residents, while investing in large-scale capital projects to protect Narragansett Bay from sewage during heavy rainfalls.
“They’re one of the best, if not the best, operated wastewater treatment facilities in the state,” said Joseph Habarek, administrator of surface water protection for the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management. “Overall, they have an excellent compliance record.”










They’re one of the best, if not the best, operated wastewater treatment facilities in the state.


– Joseph Haberek of the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management regarding Narragansett Bay Commission


At the time Synagro took over the Woonsocket incinerator in 1988, it too received acclaim from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for transforming a hearth furnace combustion system into one that uses electricity and a wet flushing system to treat solid waste. Subsequent upgrades turned the local incineration facility into a regional powerhouse, able to burn up to 105 tons of dried waste a day, 90% of which comes from government and commercial customers across Rhode Island, Massachusetts and Connecticut. The remaining 10% is Woonsocket’s own waste. 
But as its customer base grew, so did the fines and penalties. Synagro Woonsocket was fined $175,000 by the Department of Environmental Management in 2018 for excess pollutants and chemicals found in the water, including cyanide, dating back to 2014. In 2021, a different subsidiary of the Baltimore-based company reached a $373,660 settlement with the EPA for violating federal air pollution protections at its Woonsocket plant. In July 2022, nine months before the state lawsuit, Synagro entered into another settlement with state environmental watchdogs for pollution problems with the incinerator, agreeing to pay $20,000 for water treatment improvements in the Blackstone River, along with investing in infrastructure upgrades to its incinerator.
Since the state lawsuit in March 2023, the plant has remained under close monitoring by environmental regulators, with monthly inspections of operations and bacteria and pollutant discharge levels.
In 2024, the plant exceeded maximum state discharge allowances for phosphorus in the water for six consecutive months, leading to several warnings, but no fines, because the issues were considered “minor,” Haberek said. 
“Overall, they’re doing better,” Haberek said. “Broad-brush, they’ve been meeting their permit limits.”
Odor complaints have persisted, though fewer than at the peak in 2023. Jacobs received 25 complaints about smells from the wastewater plant through July of this year —  less than 25% of 107 documented in 2024, and under one-fifth of the 132 complaints made in 2023, according to an Aug. 12 report to the City Council.
Transferring ownership of the sewage treatment service might reduce these occurrences, but it’s unlikely to scrub them entirely. Even the best-run wastewater treatment plants have occasional smells and discharge levels that exceed state permit caps, Haberek said.
Regional consequences 
What is guaranteed if the city shutters its incinerator: Dozens of local governments, manufacturers and other wastewater treatment facilities — including the Narragansett Bay Commission — will be forced to find an alternative place to send their sewage byproducts. 
“We all rely on the Woonsocket incinerator as a disposal option,” Haberek said. “That would be problematic if they were to stop accepting biosolids.”
The Cranston Wastewater Treatment Facility is the only other wastewater treatment plant in Rhode Island with an incinerator, but it does not have capacity to handle Woonsocket’s load, Haberek said.
Beauchamp was unconcerned.
“Let everybody else figure it out,” he said. “It’s about time we put Woonsocket first.”
The city has not yet notified its municipal and commercial customers about the tentative plan to shut down the incinerator. However, last year, the City Council approved a separate, non-binding resolution to stop accepting liquid sludge from other cities and towns and companies, instead limiting its services to the already dried “cakes.” The switch, if made, would have affected about half of the existing incinerator customers. But it never advanced beyond the May 22, 2024, council vote.
Lepizzera stressed that any changes, including closure of the incinerator and transfer of the wastewater treatment plant to a new owner, would not take effect immediately. 
Gendron, the City Council president, does not share the same timeline.
“I would hope it would be done by Friday of this week,” Gendron said. “I am worried first about the health and wellbeing of the residents of Woonsocket. That’s where my real priority lies.”
Also factored into the calendar calculations: the July 1, 2027, deadline by which the city is contractually required to assume maintenance of the incinerator from Synagro, although the latter would continue to provide daily operating service through 2032 under the existing contract.
Beauchamp wants the transfer deal done before then.
“We know this incinerator is not going to get any better unless you put money into it,” he said. “We certainly don’t have that money. We don’t want to spend that money.”

(Photo by Leann Ray/West Virginia Watch)There’s a reason people come to West Virginia, and it’s not just the mountains. They come for authenticity. Culture. Art. Music. Elements setting us apart. Goldenseal magazine highlights those unique differences. 
It has been a cultural touchstone for over 45 years. It tells our quirkiest stories: ghost tales of Harper’s Ferry, the honey economy and bees, quilters, bakers, fiddlers and singers. It is one of the last surviving public platforms in the state dedicated solely to folk traditions, oral histories and regional storytelling. 
Goldenseal was not always subscription-based. It was once free and state-funded. Why? Because the state understood its value wasn’t financial. In the 1980s, the state asked for voluntary payments. In 1995, it became fully self-funded. That’s when the decline began. Readership plummeted. But let’s be clear: it’s not on shaky ground because it failed its mission. It’s at risk financially because we stopped investing in it.
The Department of Tourism now oversees it. And that worries me. Because if the only lens we use is revenue, Goldenseal will lose every time. Culture doesn’t always pay in dollars. And if West Virginia is to excel? Artistic support must be prioritized. The Department of Tourism can work to make a new, revamped website for the magazine. Promote artists, storytellers and culture Goldenseal writes about. Written by West Virginia writers. 
Critics call it a money pit. Others call it outdated. But that misses the point. You see, culture is a long game. And art keeps the soul and identity of a place alive. And tourists? They want to understand our people and culture. They aren’t just coming for cabins and trails. 
I agree, Goldenseal should evolve. Keep the print edition — for the thousands of loyal readers who still find joy in paper and long-form storytelling. But also bring Goldenseal into the 21st century. How? Make it interactive. Digitize the archives. Launch social media storytelling. A podcast. Short videos. Instagram reels featuring young Appalachian voices — writers, musicians, photographers. Folk recipes. Local trivia. Create music playlists amplifying new, hip local bands as well as traditions like the Augusta Folk Music program in Randolph County schools, as well as the Vandalia Festival in Charleston. 
Tourists like print. Something with milky way images by West Virginia photographers. Make it free. (That’s what my generation is used to.) That is why the wonderful Highland Outdoors — a large, glossy West Virginia magazine — is free (funded by advertising.) This is why the small town Tucker County Observer is free. Free means accessible. Free means people read it. Keep the current version of Goldenseal, and make a second print version that is slim and focuses more on contemporary stories. Place it across the state. 
Let the print stay. Let the stories grow. Let it evolve. And yes — get state funding again. This is not radical. It’s common sense. We fund libraries. We fund museums. We fund highways. Why not fund a cultural institution that has served this state for decades?
Chelsea Ruby has an opportunity. Ruby serves as West Virginia’s Cabinet Secretary of the Department of Tourism (and now, by extension, the Department of Arts, Culture and History as of its merger in 2025.) Here’s what’s cool about Ruby: she survives administrations. Maintained her position under both former Gov.Jim Justice and Gov. Patrick Morrisey. This is an unusual feat in today’s volatile political landscape. Ruby is awesome at her job. She has led consistent and record-breaking growth in tourism. In 2023, tourism brought in $6.3 billion to West Virginia. Nearly $600 million of that went directly to state and local governments. 
But here’s the potential rub: Tourism, by nature, often demands a return on investment — measured in economic impact, job creation and tax revenue. The arts, however, are not always profitable. Art cannot always be measured in dollars, but its influence enriches lives. It is our lifeblood. 
Ruby is now the steward of all West Virginia creativity. It is her unique responsibility to ensure that programming, grants, and cultural investments continue and grow for artists. Value should not always be equated with profitability. Read that again. The Department of Tourism must remember this. It may be a new paradigm for them. 
Ruby’s opportunity is clear — and well as her responsibility to preserve the arts. I have belief she will continue to champion both economic vitality and Appalachian writers, arts and culture.  Now that tourism and the arts are under the same umbrella, they cannot be adversaries. That’s not an option. They must be partners. They must work together to elevate West Virginia.

State and federal agencies recently confirmed eight cases of chronic wasting disease (CWD) at a deer farm in Breckinridge County where the illness had first been […],"Do deer farms increase the risk that wild deer like this buck will contract a contagious and deadly neurological disease? Opinions differ. (Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources)A disease outbreak on a Kentucky deer farm is renewing questions about whether stronger rules are needed for the more than 100 “captive cervid facilities” the state has permitted.
State and federal agencies recently confirmed eight cases of chronic wasting disease (CWD) at a deer farm in Breckinridge County where the illness had first been detected in a single deer in October 2024.
Chronic wasting disease is a fatal prion disorder similar to mad cow disease. Only 10 cases have been confirmed in Kentucky — nine of them on the Breckinridge County farm — out of 40,000 tests since 2002. But the disease’s spread in other states has made preventing it a priority for wildlife managers nationwide because it causes population declines in deer and elk when prevalent.
Much about the neurological condition — dubbed “zombie deer disease” — is unknown. In deer, it causes significant weight loss, listlessness and death. A deer can appear healthy and have CWD for months or years before symptoms appear. Research has produced conflicting conclusions on the risk of it spreading to humans.
In Breckinridge County, more than 100 captive deer were killed in early July at Sinking Creek Whitetails, said co-owner Laura Voyles, whose family started the deer farm in 2020. A Kentucky Department of Agriculture statement said the “depopulation was carried out” at the request of the owner “to protect animal health and prevent further spread. KDA’s role was to collect the necessary samples and submit them to the lab for testing.”
Several state and federal agencies were involved, the state ag department said.

Voyles said the farm’s only other option would have been to quarantine the deer for years and hope no further cases appeared. She said the farm kept the deer alive and quarantined for months until the agencies “got their ducks in a row enough to come massacre them.”
“It’s just devastating to know that what you have poured your life into, from just a blood, sweat and tears perspective, in addition to all of the finances that had been poured into it was just gone in a moment,” Voyles said.
Voyles said the initial chronic wasting disease case found last year came from a healthy-appearing female deer, purchased from outside her farm, that was harvested for meat and subsequently tested. She said she was skeptical of the positive test results because the Kentucky Department of Agriculture “refused” to allow for third-party testing. A Kentucky Department of Agriculture spokesperson said it had “full confidence” in the testing done at the “nation’s premier facility for livestock disease testing”, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Iowa. 
After the first diseased deer was discovered at Voyles’ farm last fall, Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources officials responded by putting Breckenridge County and adjoining Meade and Hardin counties into a surveillance zone in an effort to block spread of the disease. Hunters who take deer in those three counties are required to have the animals tested for chronic wasting disease, and only specific parts — deboned meat, a clean skull with no brain tissue, cleaned teeth, hides, antlers and finished taxidermy mounts — can be taken out of the surveillance zone.
The only other confirmed wasting disease in Kentucky is an isolated case discovered in 2023 in a wild deer in Ballard County. 
A bill stalls to add deer farm regulations
Earlier this year, legislation was introduced in Frankfort aimed at containing the disease. The bill died after opposition from a vocal deer farming industry that views deer as a form of agriculture and an income source.
Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources Commissioner Rich Storm told lawmakers that the measure was “critically important” to protect not only the state’s deer population but also the elk herd that has rebounded in Eastern Kentucky. He said tourism generated by hunting brings in billions of dollars every year. 
The bill, sponsored by Rep. Josh Bray, R-Mount Vernon, would have expanded the radius of a surveillance zone when chronic wasting disease is detected in a wild deer or on a deer farm. It also would have halted the transfer of captive deer within and from areas where a case is found on a deer farm. Deer farms could have been exempted from the restrictions by surrounding themselves with a  second fence to prevent wild deer from interacting with captive deer. The bill advanced out of a committee but didn’t receive a vote by the Kentucky House of Representatives.

One of the main ways deer farms make money is by selling deer with desirable genetics, such as large antlers, to private preserves for people to hunt and to other deer farms. A desirable buck may sell for thousands of dollars. 
Jason Becker, president of the Kentucky Alternative Livestock Association that represents deer farmers, disputes the need for new limits on deer farms. “Most concerns over the spread of CWD relating to deer farms are completely unfounded,” Becker told the Lantern, adding that requiring a second fence would be financially burdensome. 
Debates over how to control chronic wasting disease — and the role of deer farms — have been heated in other states. Wildlife biologists interviewed by the Lantern agree requiring a second fence on deer farms would protect the wild deer population, though these biologists also acknowledged more is still being learned about how the disease is spread. 
The unknowns of chronic wasting disease
Rep. Bray, sponsor of this year’s deer farm bill, said he grew up a hunter and sees deer on his farm. The unknowns of what chronic wasting disease could mean not only for hunting, but even potentially for public health, worry him. 
“The idea that I have to be scared of a natural resource like that causing damage to my family’s health — that’s not acceptable,” Bray said, referring to concerns about chronic wasting disease potentially infecting species other than cervids. 
Recent research has shown the prions that infect deer can change to become infectious in humans, the fear being it could cause Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, a fatal prion disease, in people. Another study from 2024, though, found the likelihood of chronic wasting disease crossing over and infecting humans was low. Prions are abnormal proteins that can harm neurons and cause brain damage that has no cure.

Bray, who favors requiring a second fence for deer farms, points to the broad spread of chronic wasting disease in Wisconsin as something Kentucky should be trying to avoid. 
“I just think some really common sense, simple things can be done to provide additional protection. You know, we’ve got one shot at it. Once it’s in the wild population, it’s in there,” Bray said.
Matthew Springer, an associate extension professor of wildlife management at the University of Kentucky, told the Lantern he collaborated with the Kentucky Department of Agriculture and the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources in 2020 where the fence lines of several deer farms were studied to see interactions between wild deer and captive deer. 
“We had noted several interactions of various levels, including direct contact between individuals through the fence,” Springer said. 
He said requiring two fences around deer farms “greatly reduces” the risk of interaction but comes at an “extreme cost” for deer farms. He said the Kentucky chapter of the Wildlife Society, which represents wildlife biologists, sent a letter of support for Bray’s bill. 
Some sportspeople view deer farming and private hunting preserves as unethical, Springer said. But deer farms are not the sole cause of chronic wasting disease spread, he said.  
“There’s a lot of very good deer farmers that are out there trying to abide by all the regulations and do the best they can to protect both their resource and the wild resource,” Springer said. 
A ‘national security threat’
Some states have taken stronger measures beyond requiring two fences on deer farms. Minnesota lawmakers placed a moratorium on new deer farms, and deer farmers sued arguing it violated their economic liberty. 
The moratorium was implemented following a 2022 report from Minnesota wildlife management officials that cited the transport of deer between deer farms as a reason chronic wasting disease  cases were appearing hundreds of miles apart.  
Becker, the president of the Kentucky association representing deer farmers, argued the restrictions placed or proposed on deer farms ultimately don’t stop the spread of chronic wasting disease given its spread in wild deer. He also said deer farms in Kentucky have to follow a number of regulations already. That includes a state ban on bringing whole deer carcasses or “high-risk” parts of a deer from other states, quarterly inspections of deer farms by state agriculture officials, required state permits and required testing of any deer that dies on a farm over one year old. 
“No state has passed a law that has effectively limited the spread of CWD in their state,” Becker said. “It’s not a farm deer problem. It is a deer problem.” 
Becker instead pointed to efforts in Oklahoma to develop deer that are genetically “resistant” to chronic wasting disease. Wildlife biologists interviewed by the Lantern are skeptical of efforts to create “resistant” deer.

Peter Larsen, a co-director of the Minnesota Center for Prion Research and Outreach at the University of Minnesota, said a “genetic background” of deer can make chronic wasting disease develop more slowly. 
“But there’s other research that shows that those animals are still shedding prions. It could be at a lower level, but they’re still positive and they’re still shedding it,” Larsen said. “There is not enough data available to justify that approach.” 
Larsen considers chronic wasting disease a “national security threat” because of the potential accumulation of prions in the environment and the potential for species spillover. He said the prions can be absorbed by plants; data shows prions can combine with dust particles, be carried in the wind and accumulate in agricultural commodities. 
“You have a lot of prions accumulating in the environment. And where does that go?” Larsen said. “We need to get aggressive on it.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Deer-buck-in-field-1024x670.jpg,,,2025-09-08 05:56:09.889825

Stebbins State agencies are warning Wisconsinites to limit the amount of ducks that they eat, or to avoid certain birds entirely, due to PFAS contamination. Waterfowl harvested around Green Bay were shown to have high levels of the man-made “forever chemicals,” which persist in the environment forever and have been linked to several chronic diseases including cancers. 
The Department of Natural Resources (DNR) and Department of Health Services (DHS) are advising people not to eat mallards from around lower Green Bay from Longtail Point to Point au Sable, and south of the mouth of the Fox River. Additionally, mallards and wood ducks living around Green Bay from the city of Marinette across to Sturgeon Bay should not be consumed frequently — no more more often than once per month for mallards and only one meal per week for wood ducks. 
Back in 2022 levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), another man-made chemical, in waterfowl led to similar advisories in lower Green Bay. Further assessments found concentrations of PFAS in breast muscle tissue, according to a DNR press release. In 2023 and 2024, more samples were taken from ducks, with all samples taken during July and August when the birds were most likely to represent local breeding populations. Those efforts revealed elevated levels of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), which is a type of PFAS, in the breast muscles of the birds. The inquiry suggested that both adult and juvenile ducks in lower Green Bay have higher concentrations of PFOS than in the northern portion of the bay. 
PFAS chemicals were first developed as part of U.S. government nuclear and atomic weapons research during the Manhattan Project. After the project ended private companies, particularly DuPont, began researching the compounds for commercial use. Over the subsequent decades, PFAS was used in products including  non-stick Teflon pans, fast food wrappers, and firefighting foam. The chemicals do not degrade in the environment, nor within the body, and have been linked to cancers and other chronic diseases. 
The DNR tracks PFAS consumption advisories spanning multiple species including deer, fish and waterfowl. On Sept. 4, deer and fish advisories for PFAS were issued for the Town of Stella and surrounding waterbodies in Oneida County. All fish in the Moen Lake Chain were included in a “do not eat” advisory due to PFAS contamination, and a similar warning was distributed against the consumption of deer liver near the Town of Stella.

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)In 2022, Denver residents overwhelmingly approved Measure 306, Waste No More Denver, a citizens’ initiative to mandate access to landfill diversion systems in all places where municipal services are not allowed to serve. In 2023, a task force provided a full slate of implementation recommendations to enable the citizens’ initiative to become enforceable by statute.

Waste diversion through donation, recycling, composting, and reusing materials is one of the fastest and most cost-effective ways to cut climate pollution and be a profitable business. Yet our policies lag far behind our potential, and proposed rollbacks to Denver’s Waste No More ordinance risk undoing hard-won progress before it has a chance to work.
A report by the nonprofit GAIA emphasizes that cities investing in organic waste diversion and circular waste systems can significantly reduce climate pollution while also creating jobs and promoting healthier communities. In Denver, our 10-year Solid Waste plan updates consistently indicate that businesses need to expand recycling and compost diversion efforts. Unfortunately, as a city, we have been slow to do so. An example of this can be seen in the three years it has taken to implement the Waste No More ballot measure.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
As someone deeply involved in Denver’s Waste No More citizens’ initiative since 2021, I’ve seen firsthand how local communities are transforming the way we think about waste. In 2022, nearly 71% of Denver voters approved the Waste No More ballot measure, which put new requirements on almost all commercial properties, food producers, events, and construction and demolition projects to separate and recycle materials. Doing so sparked dialogue and built community-wide momentum toward zero waste. Since its passage, cities like Aspen have followed suit with similar strong mandates, proving this approach is scalable, achievable, and popular.
Exempting these businesses from diversion plans like donating consumable food waste sends the wrong message and delays the cultural shift we need, not to mention the impractical disconnect between revenue and waste. Diversion plans will allow for a review of shared bin systems, co-ops, and property-managed diversion. These methods are all proven models that small businesses can use to effectively divert without adding undue burdens to their bottom line. 
With the rollout of Extended Producer Responsibility by 2030 for small businesses and significant shifts in the amount of landfill-bound waste, it is essential to review cost savings in waste management that will offset the costs of organic waste diversion. Exemptions should be temporary and tied to meaningful thresholds, not open-ended carve-outs that let high-waste entities opt out indefinitely. 
We can look to those who have already implemented these changes since 2022, such as farmers’ markets, neighborhood festivals, and food banks, which are already leading by example with diverting food waste and recycling. But current pre-exemption proposals risk excluding them altogether, missing an opportunity to scale diversion as infrastructure improves. 
Additionally, the state of Colorado has established a groundwork to assert that these responsibilities are not opt-in responsibilities but are part of the cost of doing business. Every business and department in the state has a responsibility to do its part in order to do business in Colorado. Regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are part of state statute, and landfill methane emissions are the third-largest emitter of methane in the state.
This is the point of Waste No More. By creating diversion plans that are supported by commercial systems for composting and recycling at retail food establishments, businesses, construction sites, multifamily buildings, and events, we can prevent waste from becoming pollution and creating the methane and other emissions that impact public health and our global environment.
Unfortunately, proposed permanent pre-exemptions would undermine the effort. By offering businesses an opt-in method of being responsible for waste diversion, we are missing the clear mandate that Denver voters approved. Producing clean diversion streams is an act of practice, and to build a societal shift, we need to incorporate these practices into all aspects of our community.
Denver voters decided to raise the bar for landfill diversion and significantly reduce methane emissions — and the solution is in our trash. But only if we resist weakening the rules before they’ve had a chance to work. This is why Denver City Council needs to vote for amendments to the proposed updates to this regulation, to protect the intention of the citizens’ initiative and to move into an implementation model that provides diversion access to all.

(Graphics by States Newsroom)This story was reported collaboratively between the Pennsylvania Capital-Star and its sister outlet Michigan Advance.
Just two states in the nation have been unable to pass budgets for the 2025-26 fiscal year – and now, they’re staring down significant consequences if their respective legislative bodies fail to act soon.
 Pennsylvania has entered its third month without a new budget, while Michigan is just weeks away from a potential shutdown. Meanwhile, lawmakers in other states have figured out their spending plans – or contingencies.
Listen to Emily’s audio recap:

https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MIPA-radio-mx2.mp3

Aside from their current budget woes, the Rust Belt states mirror each other in some unique ways. Both are helmed by Democratic governors with presidential ambitions and national profiles to match in Josh Shapiro and Gretchen Whitmer. They are considered battleground states with recently redrawn legislative districts generally regarded as fairer – and that resulted in split legislatures, two of three nationally. Transportation funding has emerged as the sticking point in the disparate budget negotiations, for very different reasons.
And the stakes in each of the impasses aren’t exactly the same.

A Michigan shutdown would shutter services, inspections
If Michigan’s budget gridlock lasts long enough, the government would shut down in a dramatic fashion, loosely mirroring a federal shutdown that would shutter services and operations. State workers would be left without pay and potentially their benefits. State parks, statewide law enforcement services and seemingly mundane activities like food safety inspections could also be impacted, according to WDIV-TV Detroit.

Unlike the federal government, Michigan can’t pass resolutions supporting government functions without a budget. That’s led the state, on at least two recent occasions, to pass holdover “continuation budgets,” defined as a short term appropriation of the previous fiscal year’s spending, if the game gets too close to the final whistle.

Pennsylvania’s partisan gridlock drives impasse
In Pennsylvania, there is no possibility of a shutdown. The commonwealth’s Supreme Court ruled in 2009 that state workers must be paid during a budget impasse. But schools and counties don’t have that same guarantee – and taxpayers have to cover the interest on any loans to continue operations until state funding starts flowing again.
That’s on top of having state leaders consumed with the budget fight at the expense of other issues – such as the looming impact of recent reductions in federal programs and funding. And then there are the long-term costs if the resulting budget’s apparent “balance” relies on deferring expenses such as pension contributions or infrastructure investment. What’s more, discussion often happens behind closed doors with updates leaked or proposals rushed to public debate, which creates confusion. 
Either way, both states will face consequences if their spending plans aren’t approved and signed into law soon.

Transportation funding talks at a dead end 
Future Michigan road maintenance and repair face dire consequences if a funding plan isn’t a part of the coming fiscal year budget. Many projects that were funded by bonds during Whitmer’s tenure are coming to a close, and there is no plan to reauthorize those bonds, necessitating a legislative solution.

The bonds were authorized by the state’s Transportation Commission in 2020 because the Republicans, who were previously in control of the Legislature in 2019, refused to raise taxes to pay for roads.

Budget talks this year have stalled partly due to road funding, but also because the House waited to pass its full government spending plan until late August; the Senate passed its full budget in May. Whitmer delivered her budget recommendations much earlier in the year.

Now that the Michigan House has a budget plan on the table, Republicans in the chamber say it is incumbent on the Senate to come forward with a roads funding plan to get negotiations going. 

Michigan Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks and the Democrats in the Senate have offered no clear sign of when it would deliver a road funding plan, nor what it would look like. The GOP plan would put $3.4 billion toward roads.  Those dollars come from deep cuts elsewhere in their proposed budget, like major reductions to key departments that oversee statewide law enforcement, the attorney general’s office, environmental regulations and natural resources rules.

Whitmer has proposed $3 billion for roads and has been adamant that no deal can be reached without funding for roads, putting pressure on the Senate, which is controlled by her party.

This past Wednesday, several thousand construction workers, union members and business leaders were at the state Capitol building to urge lawmakers to find a sustainable solution to Michigan’s looming road funding cliff.
Schools in Michigan are also warning that they are now operating without real budgets that reflect the dollars they’ll actually be receiving from the state in the next fiscal year. Some school groups have said that layoff notices have already been issued because of the standoff.

The urban-rural divide present in both states hasn’t driven the wedge in Michigan’s transportation debate so much as it has in Pennsylvania. 
The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in Philadelphia had been warning for months about service cuts and fare increases while seeking additional funding to make up a $240 million budget deficit the agency has attributed to the loss of federal COVID-19 funding. Public entities nationwide used the funding – intended to serve as one-time, temporary emergency relief – to plug budget holes, creating what public finance experts have described as a looming fiscal crisis.

SEPTA’s planned fare increases and regional metro service reductions are on hold after they were blocked by a court ruling. Another judge then ordered the agency to restore service following a 20 percent reduction to bus and rail rides that had taken effect as the school year began in Philadelphia. In the interim, gambling site Fan Duel kicked in some money so Eagles fans had adequate subway service for the season opener. 
Meanwhile, transit agencies in urban, suburban and rural areas outside the Philadelphia region say they might cut service, increase prices or both if the deadlock persists. 
The debate has left the one million people (one in 13 Pennsylvanians) who use mass transit wondering what comes next.
Lawmakers have floated myriad options – from gambling revenue to legalizing recreational cannabis (already on the books in Michigan and included in Shapiro’s proposed budget) – not only to fund transit but address an overall structural deficit projected to grow to $6 billion during the upcoming year. 
As in the past, oversimplified versions of the current transit funding dustup pitted mass transit agencies and the riders they serve in densely populated areas against drivers throughout the rest of the commonwealth. 
Those drivers, the Republican argument goes, contribute to maintaining roads and bridges through tolls and license and registration fees. But most SEPTA riders also have a car or access to one through someone else in their household, according to the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission. 
Senate Republicans have meanwhile struggled to reach consensus within their own caucus, which – with Democratic control of the House and governor’s office – has contributed to the deadlock, said Marc Stier, executive director of Penn Policy Center. 
Gov. Josh Shapiro has publicly described his role almost as a mediator while calling for legislators – the GOP-controlled Senate, in particular – to work more and make tough decisions.

 Michigan has twice danced with shutdowns and could again

Under Hall, Michigan’s House GOP leadership has been on a mission to undo Democratic policies passed during their past two sessions in power. That includes trimming what it considers excessive and wasteful spending during the Whitmer years. They’ve taken a slow approach to finding cuts, contributing to the House delaying passage of its version of a budget until Aug. 26.

But Whitmer’s legacy depends partly on her campaign pledge to “fix the damn roads,” a centerpiece of her budget goals before she leaves office in 2026.

Despite different dynamics, those working long enough in the state’s capital of Lansing have opined on how closely the situation resembles the last two government shutdowns in 2007 and 2009 under then-Democratic Gov. Jennifer Granholm.The state government was divided then, too. Democrats controlled the House, while Republicans had the Senate. 
The 2007 stalemate focused on a $2 billion revenue shortfall during the Great Recession, the seeds of which showed up in budgeting analyses as early as 2005.

“We were in a depression in Michigan, unlike anything the rest of the country was seeing,” former Republican House Majority Leader Mike Bishop recently told Michigan Advance.“If anybody wonders why there was so much venom and anxiety in Lansing during those times, that was the reason.”

Ultimately, the 2007 shutdown only lasted a few hours in the dark of night before a budget deal in the early morning.

In 2009, the budget battle again saw the era’s Democrats fighting for new revenue and the Republican zeal to balance the budget with cuts – similar to the actions being taken now by House Republicans in 2025.

With uncertainty about federal recovery dollars and lingering fatigue from 2007, the fight over revenue still loomed large in 2009, and the House, Senate and Granholm were again at odds. This time, Dillon agreed to some of the cuts Bishop proposed, putting him at odds with his own caucus and Granholm.

A budget deal wasn’t reached by the end of the fiscal year, a government shutdown began, but ended within hours after a continuation budget was passed.
Pennsylvania’s costly standoff
In Pennsylvania, the government won’t cease to function over a budget impasse.
But the nine-month standoff a decade ago prompted some counties and school districts – which get about one-third of their revenue from the state – to borrow money that’s still being paid back in some cases, with taxpayers covering the interest. 
“It’s a hidden tax,” said Bill Glasgall, public finance adviser at government-focused think tank the Volcker Alliance. 










If this is going to be a continuous feature of Pennsylvania politics, … and [counties] are left scrambling with some regularity, it's just not fair. It's not efficient. This isn't how it's supposed to work.


– Kyle Kopko, executive director of the County Commissioners Association of Pennsylvania.


As the current impasse dragged on through the summer, counties and human service providers were bracing for impacts. State payments had stopped for schools as well as county-run programs like child welfare enforcement, senior citizen care and public health. Bipartisan House Bill 1609 would ensure payments for those critical needs continue; it’s been parked in the appropriations committee for months. 
Some programs serving the most vulnerable Pennsylvanians have cut pay and delayed spending on less urgent needs like conferences and tech upgrades. 
About one third of the state’s 67 counties already have dipped into savings to cover costs and a few are researching borrowing just in case the stalemate drags on, according to Kyle Kopko, executive director of the County Commissioners Association of Pennsylvania.
“If this is going to be a continuous feature of Pennsylvania politics, …  it’s just not fair,” Kopko said. “It’s not efficient. It’s not good at all. This isn’t how it’s supposed to work.” 
Senate Republicans advanced what they described as a stop-gap budget to mitigate the fallout alongside a transit funding proposal. But both measures quickly died in the Democrat-controlled House.  Appropriations Committee Chair Jordan Harris (D-Philadelphia) said his Republican colleagues lack urgency. 
“The only time you use numbers from last year is early on in the process, to move the process forward,” Harris said. “This is not something that you do a month-and-a-half after that. Literally last year’s numbers –  [that’s] a spending plan that says, ‘We’re not serious.’”
Stier, who once ran for a state House seat as a Democrat, predicts a resolution by mid-to-late September achieved by shifting money around so that the budget appears to be balanced – but isn’t really. 
“You can keep the budget artificially under $50 billion. But you’re in fact, going to be spending more later,” he said. 
Public finance experts advise against such one-time maneuvers. 
“People talk about kicking the can down the road. Really, it’s rolling a snowball,” said Noah Winn-Ritzenberg, Volcker’s senior director of public finance. “When you get there, the problem is just going to be larger.”
And it looks bad to lenders, potentially increasing borrowing costs, Glasgall noted. 
“Higher interest rates on debt – that’s effectively a tax on the citizens,” he said.
While Pennsylvania has improved its approach to budgeting and finance in recent years, Glasgall – like Stier – said the ongoing stalemate could prompt leaders to delay pension payments, artificially suppress estimated Medicaid costs (another sticking point in negotiations), delay infrastructure investment or resort to another such “gimmick” or a combination thereof. 
“If there were structural changes that could make people be honest about things like this,” Stier said, “I would be all in favor of it.”

Is there a better way to budget? 
Past years have seen more dramatic budget impasses than what’s transpired so far in Pennsylvania and Michigan, Glasgall noted. Illinois once operated for years without a budget. A New Jersey shutdown once infamously afforded then-Gov. Chris Christie an extremely private beach trip. Massachusetts hit its deadline this year after a 14-year late streak (to Pennsylvania’s 13 missed deadlines of the past 20). 

A couple of other states haven’t exactly finalized theirs for 2025-26. North Carolina adopted a mini-budget to keep the government running as deliberations continue. Oregon’s spending plan has come together in pieces to prevent a sticking point or two from delaying the entire thing.
Both strategies often emerge in conversations about structural change that happen when budgets are late.
Another is the automatic continuation resolution (a state defaults to operating according to its outgoing budget until electeds can agree on the next). Twenty states have this option, which has its critics. Public finance experts seem to agree that reducing pressure on budget negotiations doesn’t help them resolve faster. 
Stier pointed to the 2009 Pennsylvania court decision requiring state workers to be paid during an impasse as a structural change that has “made things worse.”
“It’s harder to get a budget done because there’s less pressure,” Stier said. 
A piecemeal budgeting approach like Oregon’s system affords flexibility, Glasgall noted. 
Stier said he doesn’t think that would work in Pennsylvania because it would advantage the GOP, because it delays tax and/or spending increases and so Democrats wouldn’t agree to the change. 
Structural changes also won’t negate political divisions nor the temptation to succumb to quick fixes when negotiations lock up. 
“As a political scientist, … we like to find that structure makes a huge difference. And sadly, the research over the last 30 or 40 years has not shown that’s the case,” Stier said. 
Partisanship also is contributing to both states’ budget delays, as is party infighting. Glasgall said others have endured budget stalemates when under single-party control, including in California, Kansas and New Jersey.

In Michigan, enduring the crisis of two shutdowns in close succession created political momentum for change.
The Citizens Research Council of Michigan made the case for an earlier budget timeline during the 2009 budget standoff, noting that the process itself might be to blame.
And John Nixon, the former budget director in Utah, was hired in late 2010 as director of the Michigan Department of Technology, Management and Budget to help Michigan after the incoming Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican, was elected that year.
Nixon was tasked with not just fixing the budget process, but with helping Snyder improve Michigan’s subpar financial standing in several areas. 
“It was trying to incorporate best practices and spending within our means,” Nixon said. “We’re feeding a bunch of local governments. We’re feeding school districts. How can they count on it?”
The solution from Snyder was to hold the Legislature to a loose June 30 deadline for talks to end and having a budget passed on July 1.
Despite some pushback, the move was embraced, Nixon said. The 2011 Legislature also saw Republicans back in control of the trifecta governor’s office, the House and the Senate. In 2019, the Legislature codified the deadline into statute, but with no real penalties for missing the mark.
Michigan’s Legislature has since missed that July 1 deadline on multiple occasions, but only by a few days or weeks, and the state never went down to the wire with its budget talks quite like it did in 2007 and 2009

Hall attempted to pass a resolution last month that would mean no pay for legislators if they blow the July 1 deadline. The measure ultimately failed. 
“Would that swing people?” Nixon said. “The thing you don’t want to do is you don’t want to pass a junk budget.”
Nixon noted that in Utah, a budget impasse led the state’s leaders to enact measures that obligated them to pass base budgets during the first week of session. That way, the government wouldn’t shut down in the event of a stalemate. 
He also said a solution would be needed to the current impasse and budget struggles in the years to come if Michigan gets a “double whammy” of a state shutdown and a potential federal shutdown – which appears more likely in the era of uncertainty during the  second Trump administration.
Winn-Ritzenberg says institutional values tend to be most influential, ultimately. 
“A lot of it really comes down more to culture within a state of either relying on budget maneuvers or a culture where [lawmakers] pass a clean budget and take pride in a professional approach in the budget office,” Winn-Ritzenberg said.

In Michigan’s case, the question is whether that culture will persist, while in Pennsylvania, it’s whether it ever emerges.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/PA-and-MI-budget.png,,,2025-09-08 05:56:09.889825

(University of Kentucky photo by Mark Cornelison )At a time when food insecurity has increased in the commonwealth, the University of Kentucky’s Big Blue Pantry is expanding services to meet students’ emergency food needs. 
Students can already go to the Big Blue Pantry, located in Frazee Hall’s Room 016, and get a bag of food items. But it’s open during work hours — not on weekends or holidays. 
Now, students can access emergency supplies after-hours with the installment of nine stocked food lockers in the basement of the William T. Young Library.

Andrew Perkins, the program coordinator for the Big Blue Pantry, said these new lockers “are a way for us to expand our reach, to help a student who is in a crisis situation or an emergency situation, to provide that bag of food outside of our regular open hours.” 
A student in need of food can apply online and will receive a unique code to one of the lockers, where they can go get a bag of food that should last two or three days. The bag has staple, nonperishable items like ramen noodles, macaroni and cheese, oatmeal, granola bars and canned goods. 
It’s not clear how many University of Kentucky students live with food insecurity. Across the state, nearly 17% of Kentuckians have a shortage of food, data shows. In the last academic year, the Big Blue Pantry served around 900 people over 2,500–3,000 visits to the pantry, Perkins said. 
“I think people can know anecdotally from their own experience at college that … sometimes going without, or  having to skip a meal every once in a while has been part of it, and it’s sometimes been considered a rite of passage,” Perkins said. “Well, we think differently about that today. We know that … if a student is worrying about where their next meal is coming from, or if they’re going to have the opportunity to eat today, then they’re not going to be as focused on their studies or their or their success in life in the bigger picture. Our mission is to remove that barrier, to remove the barrier of food insecurity, so a student can reach their ultimate potential.” 
The semester that just started is the first time the pantry is using the lockers, Perkins said, so staff need to study the needs and best ways to meet them. As of Sept. 5, two students had used the lockers. 
“A low number is fantastic — I’m glad we have them; I hope they never get used, Perkins said. “I hope that a student is never in that kind of situation, but if they are now, we have the ability to mitigate that situation.” 
According to Feeding America, hunger can worsen a person’s mental health, make it difficult to focus and lead to chronic health issues like heart disease and diabetes. 
Making sure students have enough food, Perkins said, is key to helping them be academically successful. 
“It is okay to need help,” he said, “and to ask for help as well.”

(Photo by Megan Schnabel)As an advocate for miners with black lung disease and their families, I was so disappointed to see a tax break for metallurgical coal in the Big Beautiful Bill Act in July. Why? Because that tax break will encourage the mining of coal that isn’t subject to the excise tax that supplements the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund.
Black lung disease is killing our communities. Miners are falling sick with the disease younger and younger. My husband has been battling black lung for 11 years, since he was 47 years old. I see what it does to him and to our family every day. Because of that, I deeply understand some of what the thousands of people in Appalachia who are impacted by black lung disease go through every day.
For nearly a decade I’ve poured my heart and soul into fighting for these men and their families and acting as a resource — whether they need help applying for benefits or a shoulder to cry on. As the vice president of the National Black Lung Association, I, along with other coal miner advocates, speak with congressional offices abbout the need to support mining families with a better black lung benefit system and the importance of preventing the disease among current and future coal miners once and for all. 
Something I have heard time and again when I push politicians to do better is, “but what about the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund? Isn’t it running out of money?” This often becomes a stopping point. We agree we’d like to work on ways to put more money into the fund in order to pay for stronger cost of living adjustments for mining families, but the conversations often end there.
The black lung trust fund, which kicks in to pay black lung benefits when a coal company can’t, is funded by an excise tax only on coal sold within the United States. The majority of met coal is exported overseas. Revenue from exported coal doesn’t go in to support the trust fund, but those miners are just as likely to get black lung as any other coal miner is. 
The least Congress could do is increase the monthly disability benefit that coal miners with black lung receive. It hasn’t kept up with inflation in decades. You can do the math yourself, or you can just ask any family that depends on the stipend as times get hard. 
So it felt like a slap in the face to give tax breaks to mining companies and not tie that tax break  to solving the problems faced by the miners that keep those companies afloat. But we can change that, and we know that Congress will listen to coal mining communities when we work together.
We recently had a victory when Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. cut coal program staff at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. The black lung associations, clinics and others worked together and told lawmakers that wasn’t right and it would hurt us. Many of those cuts were reversed. That shows me what’s possible when we’re united. Now coal communities need to band together again to ask our lawmakers to honor their commitment to coal miners who have and continue to help power this country with energy for homes and for our industries. We need to increase the black lung benefit levels while also making sure we protect miners from the silica dust that is making the black lung epidemic worse. 
If they want to give a tax break to met coal, that’s fine, but they better also find a way to stabilize the trust fund while also improving benefits for the mining families that depend on the stipend. Our miners deserve care and commitment to their health and future.

Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia MercuryAfter four years presiding over the state Senate, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears is attempting to make the leap to the governor’s mansion this fall. She is running on a platform of conservative values and her campaign largely mirrors the themes that brought Gov. Glenn Youngkin victory in 2021 — parents’ rights, fiscal responsibility and defending personal freedoms. 
For most of the year she has trailed Democratic opponent Abigail Spanberger in fundraising and popularity, though the race appears to be tightening. According to an August Roanoke College poll, 39% of likely Virginia voters said they would choose Earle-Sears and 46% would pick Spanberger. In the spring, just 26% percent said they’d select Earle-Sears compared to Spanberger’s 43% of the vote. Earle-Sears’ campaign has raised over $11.5 million, according to her latest campaign finance filings, with $4.5 million in cash on hand. Spanberger has raised over $27 million and has more than $15 million in the pot. 
An immigrant from Jamaica whose background and policy positions are rooted in a firm Christian faith, Earle-Sears is a married mother of three (one of her daughters is deceased). She served in Virginia’s House of Delegates from 2002 to 2003.
Earle-Sears became the first Black woman to hold statewide office in Virginia when she was elected lieutenant governor in 2021. If she ascends to the governorship, she will be the first Black woman in America to hold such a title. 
The Virginia Mercury reached out to both campaigns to learn more about their priorities and how they match up with Virginians’, and to find out how they plan to accomplish their legislative goals. Spanberger sat down with the Mercury’s team for an in-depth interview at her campaign office in Central Virginia. Earle-Sears agreed to an interview but canceled on the day of and has not responded to reschedule requests and other questions. Here’s a close look at her positions and promises, based on the Mercury’s previous reporting and that of other media outlets, as well as Earle-Sears’ public statements and actions in the Virginia General Assembly.
 Energy and environment

Earle-Sears has stated in previous interviews that she supports an “all of the above” energy profile for the state including nonrenewables like coal and gas. 
To combat the growing demand for more energy production in the state, Earle-Sears has publicly stated her support for “all of the above” energy profile for the state. That includes coal, gas, and nuclear energy, as well as renewable sources. She has not explicitly said whether she would repeal the Virginia Clean Economy Act, which mandates the transition to renewable energy production completely for utilities by 2050, but she has disparaged it and her approach to energy needs would be in conflict with the law.
“We will use clean coal, oil, renewables, nuclear, natural gas,” Earle-Sears said in an interview with Newsmax. “That’s a national security issue. The rogue nations of this world are not just going to do solar, and they’re not just going to do wind.”
In an op-ed she wrote in the Washington Examiner, Sears called the VCEA a “disastrous law”. 
Earle-Sears has also been supportive of the state’s removal from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. Sears stated on social media last year that she supported Youngkin’s executive order to remove Virginia from the agreement, calling it an unnecessary tax on residents.
“The RGGI’s energy tax also made it impossible for Virginia’s natural gas plants to compete with producers in states without an energy tax,” Sears said in her op-ed. “As a result, electric generation in the Commonwealth decreased by 9% in 2021. If Spanberger brings back the energy tax, Virginia could face billions of dollars in economic costs.” 
 Health care

Congress passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act this summer, setting the stage for major changes to Medicaid and hospital funding mechanisms. As governor, Spanberger or Earle-Sears could sign off on future state budgets and legislation to address the impact to Virginia residents’ health care. 
As thousands of Virginians could lose their Medicaid coverage, hospitals are also bracing for absorbing higher costs before being faced with cutting services, closing, or negotiating higher rates with private insurers. 
Earle-Sears previously told Newsmax that the reconciliation “bill does so many great things.” 
Meanwhile, Congress has until the end of the year to decide whether to renew expiring tax credits that help people without employer-provided health insurance purchase plans. Aetna has already announced it is leaving the Affordable Care Act marketplace by the end of the year. The reduction of credits could further increase the number of uninsured people and their potential for reliance on free clinics, federally-qualified health centers and hospitals. 
In audio obtained by Cardinal News, Earle-Sears signaled interest in tapping into Virginia’s “rainy day fund,” a reserve meant for short term use, to shore up dwindling Medicaid funding. She would have to work with state lawmakers to do so; several of them who sit on financial committees told Cardinal they would support Earle-Sears’ idea but cautioned against over-utilizing in the long-term. 
 Immigration

Earle-Sears has spoken sparingly about immigration during her time in office, but when she does, her message has been clear: Virginia must strictly enforce immigration laws and partner closely with federal authorities.
When Youngkin announced Executive Order 47 in February — directing state police and local law enforcement to assist federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers in removing undocumented immigrants accused of violent crimes — Earle-Sears linked the policy to her own journey as a legal immigrant.
“I am a legal immigrant and now a naturalized citizen. Working together, the Governor, Attorney General, and I have made Virginia safer,” she said at the time. “We’ve seen too many tragic stories after dangerous criminals in this country illegally were put back on the streets, and this Executive Order will make sure we send them back to where they came from.”
The order also coincided with Youngkin’s creation of a Virginia Homeland Security Task Force, designed to boost cooperation between state agencies, local police and federal partners, including ICE. It has drawn strong criticism from Democrats — including Earle-Sears’ opponent, Democratic gubernatorial nominee Abigail Spanberger — who argue the directive undermines community trust in law enforcement and inflates claims of criminal activity tied to immigration. 
Youngkin has defended the measure, pointing to high-profile ICE courthouse raids and a “gang and immigration sweep” that his administration said led to more than 2,500 arrests of “violent criminals” who were in the country illegally.
Earle-Sears has framed the debate through a personal lens. 
In unveiling a “No Sanctuary Cities” budget proposal late last year, she recalled the paperwork her family filed to immigrate legally. 
“My father and I had to file documents and wait to be granted permission to enter the United States,” she said. “Under Governor Youngkin’s leadership, Virginia stands firm: we are not a sanctuary state. … The rule of law is not negotiable — it is the foundation of our safety, our freedom, and the promise of opportunity that defines America.”
While Youngkin and Attorney General Jason Miyares have been more vocal in defending the state’s immigration crackdown, Earle-Sears’ remarks underscore her alignment with the administration’s hard-line approach and her willingness to root that position in her own experience.

 Public education

Recently, Earle-Sears shared her views on gender policies in Virginia schools when, at an August 21 school board meeting, she  spoke against Arlington Public Schools’ transgender bathroom policy that allows students to use bathrooms and locker rooms that align with their gender identity.
“What is happening in our schools right now is just, it’s dangerous, it’s insane and it has to stop,” Sears said. “Here’s the truth. There are two sexes, boys and girls, and for generations, we’ve understood this — that they deserve their own sports teams, their own locker rooms, their own bathrooms.”
During her tenure as lieutenant governor, Sears has been vocal about her support of enforcing gender-segregated policies much like the Youngkin administration, which overhauled policies to require students to use bathrooms and locker rooms based on their sex assigned at birth.
Conservatives argue that having students use bathrooms and locker rooms based on their sex at birth protects other students and preserves moral and religious foundations.
The Mercury contacted Earle-Sears’ campaign to learn more about her history on gender policies, considering she has served on the state’s Board of Education, even as vice president, and did not raise these concerns about gender issues in public education during her tenure. She did not respond.
Earle-Sears has taken stands to overturn Virginia’s ban on conversion therapy, which is a practice that attempts to change someone’s sexual orientation or gender identity that the American Psychological Association said is not rooted in science and can be harmful.
She also supported other schooling options including proposals that would allow low-income parents to use the state portion of per-pupil funding for tuition at private schools or for other education expenses.
 Reproductive rights

Earle-Sears has made her stance against abortion clear during and before her gubernatorial campaign’s launch. 
She served as a keynote speaker at this year’s March for Life anti-abortion rally in Richmond, asking the crowd of about 2,000 attendees, “We stand for life and how can it ever be wrong to stand for life?”
During Virginia’s General Assembly session this year, Earle-Sears expressed opposition to Virginia’s in-progress effort to enshrine reproductive rights including abortion into the constitution, but has not answered follow-up questions on whether she would support the measure if its language were adjusted. 
When signing the advanced legislation earlier this year, her duty as lieutenant governor, Earle-Sears wrote that she was “morally opposed to this bill; no protections for the child.” 
During her 2021 lieutenant governor campaignshe described abortions at “genocide” and noted threat to the life of the parent-to-be as the only exception she believed the procedure should have. But closer to Election Day that year, she scrubbed anti-abortion language from her campaign website. 
Republican-led abortion restrictions or near-total bans that have been proposed in the legislature did not advance far enough for her to weigh in with a tie-breaking vote.  She did cast such a vote on a right-to-contraception bill, voting against it. 
 Elections and voting 

Earle-Sears has consistently framed election integrity as central to her public message, emphasizing that only U.S. citizens should have access to the ballot while largely avoiding debate on restoring voting rights for felons who have completed their sentences.
After the U.S. Supreme Court issued an emergency stay last October allowing Virginia to continue removing thousands of people from its voter rolls under Youngkin’s order, Earle-Sears praised the decision as a victory for fairness.
“As an immigrant and a naturalized citizen of our great country, I am personally grateful for this decision that upholds the rule of law,” she said in a statement. “Voting is one of the most fundamental rights we have as Americans and this decision is essential in protecting the rights of naturalized citizens and all Americans.”
She also thanked Attorney General Jason Miyares for defending the policy in court, saying Virginians could cast ballots “with ease” and have “complete confidence our elections are free from politically-motivated interference.” 
Democrats criticized the order as a voter purge, while Republicans cast it as enforcing laws already on the books.
Earle-Sears has used her platform to remind Virginians that state law has long required removal of non-citizens from voter rolls. In a Facebook post in October, she highlighted that in 2006 then-Gov. Tim Kaine, a Democrat, signed legislation to that effect. 
“It was the law then and it REMAINS the law now,” she wrote, presenting the statute as a guardrail against fraud.
Her rhetoric on elections has also touched on the political fallout from President Donald Trump’s efforts to challenge the 2020 results. 
Following the 2022 midterms, she told the Associated Press that Republicans received “a very clear message” from voters and that “it is time to move on” from Trump. While not outlining specific reforms, the remarks placed her among GOP officials urging the party to look ahead rather than dwell on Trump’s grievance.
On one of the most contentious state debates — whether to automatically restore voting rights for felons who have served their time — Earle-Sears has remained mostly silent. 
Youngkin ended his predecessors’ automatic restoration policy in favor of case-by-case review, leaving thousands uncertain about their eligibility. Earle-Sears has not publicly commented on the shift, even as civil rights advocates and Democrats push a constitutional amendment to guarantee automatic restoration.
 Housing policy 

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce estimates there’s a shortage of about 4.5 million homes in America, nearly a third of Virginia households spend over 30% of their income on housing costs, and there’s a severe lack of affordable housing options statewide, state studies found. Housing policies would have been a focal point of The Mercury’s planned August interview with Earle-Sears because it’s not a subject she has addressed specifically on the campaign trail. 
She has, however, spoken broadly about goals to address the cost of living. To help with this, Earle-Sears plans to push to eliminate the state’s car tax — a long-simmering proposal politicians in both parties have explored but have yet to fully achieve. 
Earle-Sears’ campaign website also states that she “will scour the government books to cut wasteful government spending and job-killing regulations because taxpayers know how to spend their money and run their businesses better than (the) government.”
While none of these policies tie directly to housing, in theory money constituents save elsewhere could decrease housing affordability burdens. 
 Criminal justice and policing

At an August campaign event in Chesterfield County, Earle-Sears reiterated her commitment to supporting law enforcement officials. 
“I believe in ‘backing the blue,’ I believe in honoring our law enforcement,” she said.  
Earle-Sears added that she planned to support legislation that would prevent the first $20,000 of law enforcement officers’ salaries from being taxed by the state. 
“We need them and we don’t have enough of them,” she said. 
She also supports Trump’s ramp up of deportations for undocumented immigrants. Her campaign website mentions opposing “radical policies like catch and release.” 
On the flip side, she signaled a warm response to a bipartisan probation reform bill that passed this year, designed to help former prisoners shorten their probation times by achieving different rehabilitative milestones. 
Though she declined to comment further on the measure when asked by The Mercury at the time, during a Feb. 12 segment of conservative radio program The John Fredericks Show, Earle-Sears said that the state should “do as much as possible to ensure we don’t spend money twice” — a reference to housing people in prisons and jails or processing them through the court systems when they reoffend. 
She discussed broader access to educational and vocational opportunities for incarcerated individuals, aiming to help with employment and housing once their sentences are completed. 
“If we can give them incentives then we can get them engaged, get them an education. … Then if you have a job, of course there’s something about work that dignifies the soul,” Earle-Sears said. “I’m all for lifting up that soul.”
Her background providing Christian ministry in prisons likely informs her views on second chances.

The Trump administration certainly validates the first part of that maxim, but increasingly shows no interest in the second part.
President Donald Trump on Friday signed an executive order aiming to change the name of the Department of Defense back to the Department of War. That was what the cabinet agency overseeing the nation’s military forces was called from its creation by Congress in 1789 until 1949. The name change reflected the merging of the Navy, Army and Air Force as a single organization led by a civilian secretary. 
Trump’s move screams of chest-thumping bravado, likely in large part in response to the recent ca -rides, shared laughter and hand-holding events well-covered by the media between “bros” Russian President Vladimir Putin, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping. What we are witnessing is an ego-driven display of male “mine-is-bigger-than-yours” on an international scale that will not bode well for people trying to live their lives and make ends meet under these autocratic rulers. 
All leaders have egos, but when egos go into hyperdrive and are linked to national security, it does not bode well. Lyndon Johnson’s tragic mishandling of Vietnam was in large part due to personalizing the war, seeing the troops as “my boys,” and Ho Chi Minh as “his enemy,” thereby making “losing” a threat to his ego.
Conventional wisdom posits that “fight or flight” is the human response to threat. Actually, however, those two options are more prevalent among men — and the UNESCO adage specifically references men. Women favor what is known as “tend and befriend” options, where they seek to deescalate conflicts and build defenses with allies. “Flight” is often associated with cowardice, and hence unacceptable if ego is driving decisions. Strong leaders not led by ego have long recognized the value of using all options — fight, flight, tend and befriend — and using them prudently. 










All leaders have egos, but when egos go into hyper-drive and are linked to national security, it does not bode well.


The idea that a best offense is a good defense dates back to George Washington, who considered “prudence” — which differentiates sound strategy from ego-driven, shoot-from-the hip aggression — a key attribute of his leadership. Defense is the cornerstone of deterrence, a strategy that has long served the United States well. And as my son’s baseball coach used to point out: “if they don’t score, you can’t lose.”
Renaming  the Defense Department would allow Trump to create conditions for a self-fulfilling prophecy, and those rarely go well for politicians who initiate them. Unfortunately, trying to stop the ill-advised instincts of politicians can be difficult for individuals around them. The head of Central Command, Adm. William “Fox” Fallon, found himself embroiled in a scandal that led to his resignation after Esquire magazine ran an article in 2008 titled “The Man Between War and Peace.” Fallon was quoted in the article as having said that the George W. Bush administration’s aggressive rhetoric toward Iran – “a constant drumbeat of conflict” was not useful. 
Even acolytes must be careful not to rile the wrath of sensitive ego-driven leaders or risk retribution. Witness the long list of former Trump friends, staff members, friends and even political allies denounced when they seemingly failed ego-driven loyalty tests.
Officially changing the name of the Defense Department would require congressional action. Republicans U.S. Sen. Mike Lee of Utah and Rep. Greg Steube of Florida filed legislation calling for such a rebrand in their respective chambers. But the second Trump administration has already proven masterful at work-arounds, loopholes and simply ignoring U.S. law. Wanting this name change, however, communicates a signal of U.S. intentions that will almost certainly push panic buttons among U.S. allies regarding the logic and stability of U.S. leadership and policy, and push adversaries closer together, neither of which will be good for the country.
I was recently reminded of a Turkish proverb that well describes the “normalized insanity” environment in which we currently live. “Though the forest thinned, the people continued to vote for the ax. The ax told them that because his handle was wood, he was one of them, and they believed him.” The people of Russia and China have lived under autocratic rule for so long their voices are largely muted. 
National security should not be a partisan issue. In the United States there is still time to stop what could otherwise become a runaway train toward not just autocratic rule, but international conflict, if enough people say “enough.”

Tucker High School in Henrico County on June 16, 2025. (Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)Democratic gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger told the Mercury in a recent interview that “nothing is off the table” when it comes to reconciling the differences among federal and state leaders over higher education issues that have boiled over in Virginia this year.
Spanberger’s response comes as President Donald Trump’s administration continues to target colleges and universities in Virginia and across the nation for DEI practices, alleging that the institutions are hiring instructors based on race or gender and discriminating against certain students, which the schools have refuted. George Mason University is facing four federal investigations. The University of Virginia has also come under federal scrutiny for allegedly failing to fully dismantle its DEI program. 
Democratic leaders in the Virginia Senate have rejected 22 of Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s appointments to university governing boards, prompted by the lawmakers’ “genuine concerns about the qualifications, backgrounds, and intentions” of the appointees, Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, President Pro Tempore Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, and Senate Democratic Caucus Chair Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, wrote in a letter to Youngkin.
Senate committee Democrats block 14 more Youngkin appointees from Va. college boards

The governor’s office, in turn, criticized the lawmakers, writing that they have “consistently caused harm to the governance and operation of our colleges and universities.” The governor’s administration has filed an appeal with the Supreme Court to lift a temporary suspension on the appointments for three governing boards at Virginia’s higher education institutions brought forward by Senate Democrats.
Spanberger said she would support efforts to allow universities to hire their own counsel, approved by university boards. She also said she would support a confirmation process that is “truly confirmatory” compared to the current delayed process that, by practice, has allowed appointments to begin serving immediately, before confirmation by the full General Assembly during its session. She said she would also support efforts to have appointments start at the beginning of the year and emphasized the need for clear appointee removal standards.
On August 12, Spanberger announced some of her ideas for higher education as part of her overall “Strengthening Virginia Schools Plan,” which includes making college more affordable and accessible, as well as increasing college coursework for high school students.
“I still have the benefit of many months to continue looking at the way that some of the board members are handling themselves,” Spanberger said in the interview “but certainly nothing is off the table in terms of the steps that I would take to frankly, strengthen what is clearly a weak system where universities here in Virginia can become this punching bag (to) the detriment of students and professors in the larger university community, but most importantly, the students.”
The campaign office for Winsome Earle-Sears, the Republican nominee, did not respond to questions about her higher education stance and has not published any plans about it. She has expressed support for laboratory schools, which operate like charter schools, that are created and operated in partnership with colleges and universities. 
Early voting for governor and other statewide seats will begin on Sept. 19.

Gary Click is joining the chorus of Ohio officials floating ideas to rein in property taxes.
The Vickery Republican recently introduced a “trilogy” of property tax reforms restricting what levies are available, potentially requiring more of them to go to the voters and imposing higher thresholds to pass more expensive levies.
“I know that our constituents are demanding a response, and this is me saying, ‘I’m listening,’” Click said.
His ideas join several others up for debate. A handful of proposals would cap the growth in property taxes — either to a specific percentage, the rate of inflation or based on a homeowner’s wealth. Others would expand the homestead exemption.
After vetoing several property tax measures in the state budget, Gov. Mike DeWine put together a new working group to come up with suggestions as well. The group continues to meet and is tasked with sharing their ideas at the end of the month.

Click’s trio
The first bill Click filed, House Bill 420, would eliminate continuing levies. In short, every property tax proposal on the ballot after 2030 would need to have an end date.
“We’re not saying that these are bad levies that are out there,” Click said. “But it’s saying, okay, each generation should have a voice in saying ‘I understand what I’m paying this tax for, I agree, or I disagree.’ I think that’s too much, or not enough, or whatever it is, but that each generation gets to have their voice heard.”

Continuing levies filed prior to that cutoff would expire unless they were approved to pay for bonds. Any taxes that did expire as a result of the bill would be eligible for renewal, but taxing authorities would have to take the proposal to the ballot.
Click’s second measure allows local organizers to reduce what’s known as “inside millage.” The Ohio Constitution allows local authorities to levy up to 10 mills (or 1%) in property taxes without going to the voters. Anything beyond that amount requires voter approval. House Bill 421 would allow petitioners to go to the ballot to lower that 10-mill ceiling further.
Organizers would need to gather signatures from 15% of the area’s voters in the most recent gubernatorial election to get the question on the ballot. The bill also requires two-thirds approval from local taxing authorities to put the question of restoring the 10-mill ceiling on the ballot.
“What works in Sandusky County might not work in Seneca County; what works in Seneca County might not work in Crawford County or Marion County,” Click argued. “And so each county gets to assess and look at the situation, and what works for their community, rather than imposing a statewide assessment on property.”
His last proposal, House Bill 422, would require supermajority support for proposals with higher millage rates. Levies of less than one mill (or 0.1%) could pass with a simple majority, but those of one mill to 1.9 mills would need at least 60% approval and those of two mills or more would have to clear 66%.
“The more you want, the more you ask for, the higher the bar is going to be,” Click said.
His second and third proposals, however, could test the boundaries within the state constitution. The Ohio Constitution sets the terms, barring local authorities from taxing property “in excess of one per cent of its true value” unless those levies are “approved by at least a majority of the electors.”
Whether courts would interpret that section as guaranteeing 10 mills of unvoted property tax or a simple majority standard for additional levies is an open question. So far, Click said, he hasn’t heard any warning about constitutional conflicts.
Working group check in
The governor’s working group continues to wrestle with recommendations for lawmakers. At its most recent hearing, the group debated a pair of delay tactics.
First, the working group considered offering some kind of deferral for homeowners hit with eye-popping property tax bills. But even that simple idea raises a host of other questions. Should it be one-time or renewable? Should the state charge interest? What about minimum requirements — do homeowners need a certain amount of equity or ownership history?
The group largely settled on capping deferrals at a dollar amount whether they run once or consecutively. It also nixed the idea of charging interest, while leaving the door open for charging an administrative fee. In terms of minimum requirements, a home equity benchmark was popular, but Warren County Auditor Matt Nolan explained it would be difficult to assess.
“You know, I can pull your mortgage to see what you took a mortgage out for,” he said, “but I can’t see how much you’ve paid down on that or not, and are there other outstanding liens that aren’t recorded?”
Instead, the group landed on a 10-year home ownership minimum as a decent proxy. The members also seemed open to making ownership transferrable, so seniors who downsize don’t wind up resetting the clock.
But not everyone was on board with deferrals. Lake County Auditor Chris Galloway likened pushing off payment amounts to kicking the can down the road.
“It doesn’t change what somebody’s tax liability is,” Galloway said. “All we’re doing is changing the taking — collecting those taxes from grandma or her corpse, right?”
Instead, Galloway suggested lawmakers pause property tax increases temporarily while they come up with a comprehensive response.
“The idea behind it is to, like, hit the pause button somehow,” he said. “To stop the outrage, to stop the bleeding, to be able to say, let’s give ourselves some time to fix this problem right.”
Auditors would still go forward with assessing properties and updating valuations, but tax bills would hold steady. That delay might give lawmakers time to pass legislation like House Bill 186 — an idea popular with working group members that would limit tax increases to the rate of inflation.
But other working group members, particularly Chair Bill Seitz, seemed skeptical of the idea. Those paused tax increases would eventually come due, and in the meantime, the benefits would land unevenly. For instance, Galloway acknowledged taxpayers who saw spikes after last year’s reassessments, including those in his county, wouldn’t get any immediate relief.

(Photo by Molly Rains/New Hampshire Bulletin)Over the course of a summer as hot and dry as this one, without intervention, New Hampshire’s apple crop might drop right off their branches before eager apple pickers could reach them.
But as summer turns to fall and drought conditions wear on across much of the state, New Hampshire farmers aren’t letting their crops wilt. Instead, in the face of increasingly extreme weather fluctuations, some farmers are turning to new technologies and data-driven approaches they hope will keep them productive and competitive despite New Hampshire’s changing climate.
“We’re definitely taking steps to minimize the impact of weather events, including drought. We’re seeing all sorts of changes on farms, and proactive approaches to that,” said Jeremy Delisle, fruit and vegetable production field specialist with UNH Extension in Merrimack County.
The changing climate in New Hampshire, and the Northeast, is characterized by greater rainfall overall — but that rain falls unevenly throughout the year, said New Hampshire State Climatologist Mary Stampone. That, coupled with increasingly warm summers, can quickly lead to drought conditions like those the state is experiencing this summer, she said. 
As of Sept. 5, more than 91% of New Hampshire was experiencing some degree of drought, with about 46% of the state under severe drought conditions, according to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s U.S. Drought Monitor.
“The droughts are happening. They’re going to happen. They have for a long time, but it’s the intensity, it’s how dry we get that we can attribute to climate change,” Stampone said.

The pendulum swing pattern from heavy rainfall in late winter and springtime to dry summers can be hard for farmers, said Zoe Hardy, an apple grower at Brookdale Fruit Farm in Hollis and a member of the New Hampshire Fruit Growers Association.
“It seems to be feast or famine — we’re either flooded or dry,” she said.
To handle this shift, farmers are employing a suite of evolving practices to keep crops coming. And much of this, said Delisle and UNH Extension Soil Health State Specialist Renuka Mathur, comes down to soil management.
In the field, Delisle and Mathur said they have increasingly observed farmers adopting soil management practices designed to make their crops more drought-resistant.
The most ubiquitous among these is targeted, or drip, irrigation, which uses lines to deliver water directly to the cultivated crop.
“Irrigation is an insurance policy,” Hardy said. “If you didn’t (irrigate), you’d lose your crop.”

Drip irrigation is more water-efficient and precise than other traditional forms of irrigation, like overhead sprinklers, that deliver water to places it isn’t needed — like the empty spaces between rows of crops, Delisle said. This efficiency boost, he said, may be what’s driving the increasing use of drip irrigation on New Hampshire farms, which vary widely in their access to water, especially in times of drought.
“Every drop counts,” he said.
To take their efficiency even further, Delisle said, a growing number of farms have deployed soil moisture sensors — electronic devices buried in fields that provide real-time information about soil moisture content. Some broadcast this information right to farmers’ phones, allowing growers to add just the right amount of water to their fields for plant health.
And broader applications of real-time data help farmers, too, like an Extension computer model that can estimate how much water a particular field of apple trees is pulling from the soil on a given day. Fed on data from a network of weather stations across the state, the model is intended to help farmers focus their water use even further, Delisle said.
“It really is the age of information and data to help make those decisions,” he said.
Some more analog farming techniques are also crucial for drought resilience, Mathur said. A foundational element of soil health is related to how much organic material it contains, a measure boosted by additives like compost, manure, or cover crops. In addition to adding nutrients to the soil, these materials also cling to water, helping keep soil damp and cool in times of limited rainfall, she said.
Once organic materials are present in the soil, they can be retained for longer with methods like no-till farming or reduced-till farming, in which farmers refrain as much as possible from plowing their fields. Chewing up a field before planting a crop adds air to the soil, fueling the decomposition of the important organic matter within, Delisle said. While no-till and reduced-till farming isn’t a good fit for every crop, he added, many New Hampshire farmers have had success using the method with the common local crops of corn and pumpkins.
Preserving the organic matter in New Hampshire’s soil is important not only in times of drought but also, Delisle said, in times of heavy rain and flooding, when farm equipment can compress fields. This compacts the soil and makes it less hospitable to plants.
“Soils with higher organic matter in them have the capacity to spring back once they’re pressed down, and that’s an important factor in the resiliency of that soil,” Delisle said.

(Photo by Molly Rains/New Hampshire Bulletin)
Beyond soil management techniques, New Hampshire farmers’ adaptations to changing weather patterns are evident in shifting crop stocks, he added. In the specific case of fruit trees, this may involve swapping out rootstocks, the hardy lower portion of a tree onto which farmers graft fruit-producing branches.
Instead of common “dwarf” rootstocks, which keep trees small and compact, more New Hampshire farmers are opting for slightly larger varieties, said Delisle. These stocks grow deeper root networks that allow them to tap into water deep underground in times of drought. But they are also unwieldy, harder to prune and harvest than trees grown on dwarf rootstocks, and can take years longer to begin producing fruit.
While a combination of these adaptations can allow farmers to successfully navigate the challenges of extreme weather, evolving does come at a cost.
This summer, at Brookdale, drought conditions have required near-constant irrigation, including the efforts of three to four farm employees at a time who must drive around watching for leaks and checking valves, Hardy said.
“We’ve been irrigating pretty much around the clock. It definitely is making it more challenging, but it shouldn’t impact our harvest,” she said. “…It just takes a lot more of our time. It’s just one more thing that we need to really manage.”
But the commitment, Hardy said, is essential. In a week without rain, Brookdale’s irrigation system draws from 11 irrigation ponds, two wells, and — at one optimally placed field — the Nashua River to deliver about 9,000 gallons of water to each acre of apple trees. Without this, Hardy said, the fruit might not reach its target size — or, worse, the stems could dry up, causing the apples to fall off the trees before they can be harvested.
This year, according to Hardy, it looks like Brookdale has just enough water available to scrape by with a successful harvest. Even so, as of Sept. 4, some of the farm’s irrigation ponds had run too low to use. The farming team decided to cut off irrigation to some other crops earlier than they would have liked to direct more to their apples, the farm’s biggest crop, Hardy said.
“You have to prioritize when it’s this dry,” she said. “…Like anything with limited resources, you have to pick and choose.”
Despite their importance, some of the resilience methods described by Mathur and Delisle can also be costly to implement. This is particularly challenging for New Hampshire’s small farms; about 80% of farms in the state make less than $25,000 a year in sales, according to data from the UNH Extension.
“There are some farms that are marginal or subsistence levels, you can say — not everybody’s very productive,” Mathur said. “… Beginner farmers in the field … for less than five years won’t have that much capital to invest in these big structural modifications on their farms to overcome these climate problems.”
For some of these growers, a cost-sharing incentive program with the Natural Resources Conservation Service, a division of the U.S. Department of Agriculture that provides sustainability support for farmers, has paved the way for broader adoption of resilience technologies, said Mathur and Delisle. But even with that help, the task of keeping farms productive in New Hampshire’s changing climate has not been easy.
“Those costs, growers have already laid out that money to implement all of this stuff so they can pull off these great crops for us,” Delisle said. “And so, as always, my message is, you know, now it’s our turn to get out there and support our local farms, because the crop is there and waiting for us.”

The drug helps reduce cravings for opioids and the likelihood of a fatal overdose.
While the nation as a whole has seen decreases in opioid overdose deaths in recent years, overdose deaths among Black, Latino and Indigenous people have continued to increase.
Many medical and health policy experts fear the broad domestic policy law President Donald Trump signed in July will worsen the problem by increasing the number of people without health insurance. As a result of the law, the number of people without coverage will increase by about 10 million by 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
About 7.5 million of the people who will lose coverage under the new law are covered by Medicaid. Shortly before Trump signed the bill into law, researchers from the University of Pennsylvania and Boston University estimated that roughly 156,000 Medicaid recipients will lose access to medications for opioid addiction because of the cuts, resulting in approximately 1,000 more overdose deaths annually.
Because Black and Hispanic people are overrepresented on the rolls, the Medicaid cuts will have a disproportionate effect on communities that already face higher barriers to getting medications to treat addiction.
Overdose deaths are rising among Black and Indigenous Americans

From 2017 to 2023, the percentage of U.S. retail pharmacies regularly dispensing buprenorphine increased from 33% to 39%, according to a study published last week in Health Affairs.
But researchers found the drug was much less likely to be available in pharmacies in mostly Black (18% of pharmacies) and Hispanic neighborhoods (17%), compared with mostly white ones (46%).
In some states, the disparity was even worse. In California, for example, only about 9% of pharmacies in Black neighborhoods dispensed buprenorphine, compared with 52% in white neighborhoods.
The researchers found buprenorphine was least available in Black and Latino neighborhoods across nearly all states.
Barriers to treatment
Dr. Rebecca Trotzky-Sirr, a family physician who specializes in addiction medicine, said many communities of color are “pharmacy deserts.” Even the pharmacies that do exist in those neighborhoods tend to “have additional barriers to obtain buprenorphine and other controlled substances out of a concern for historic overuse of some treatments,” said Trotzky-Sirr, who wasn’t involved in the study.
In addition to its federal classification as a controlled substance, buprenorphine is also subject to state regulations to prevent illegal use. Pharmacies that carry it know that wholesalers and distributors audit their orders, which dissuades some from stocking or dispensing it.
Dima Qato, associate professor of clinical pharmacy at the University of Southern California and an author of the Health Affairs study, said that without changes in policy, Black and Hispanic people will continue to have an especially hard time getting buprenorphine.
“If you don’t address these dispensing regulations, or regulate buprenorphine from the aspect of pharmacy regulations, people are still going to encounter barriers accessing it,” she said.


Medicaid covers 47% of nonelderly adults who suffer from opioid use disorder.


In neighborhoods where at least a fifth of the population is on Medicaid, just 35% of pharmacies dispensed buprenorphine, Qato and her team found. But in neighborhoods with fewer residents on Medicaid, about 42% of pharmacies carried the drug.
Medicaid covers nearly half — 47% — of nonelderly adults who suffer from opioid use disorder. In states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, another recent study found an increase in people getting prescriptions for buprenorphine.
“Medicaid is the backbone of care for people struggling with opioid use disorder,” said Cherlette McCullough, a Florida-based mental health therapist. “We’re going to see people in relapse. We’re going to see more overdoses. We’re going to see more people in the ER.”
Qato said the shortage of pharmacies in minority communities is likely to get worse, as many independent pharmacists are already struggling to stay open.
“We know they’re more likely to close in neighborhoods of color, so there’s going to be even fewer pharmacies that carry it in the neighborhoods that really need it,” she said.
‘There needs to be urgency’
Qato and her colleagues say states and local governments should mandate that pharmacies carry a minimum stock of buprenorphine and dispense it to anyone coming in with a legitimate prescription. As examples, they point to a Philadelphia ordinance mandating that pharmacies carry the opioid overdose-reversal drug naloxone and similar emergency contraception requirements in Massachusetts.
“We need to create expectations. We need to encourage our pharmacies to carry this to make it accessible, same day, and there needs to be urgency,” said Arianna Campbell, a physician assistant and co-founder of the Bridge Center, a California-based organization that aims to help increase addiction treatment in emergency rooms.
“In many of the conversations I have with pharmacies, when I’m getting some pushback, I have to say: ‘Hey, this person’s at the highest risk of dying right now. They need this medication right now.’”
State suicide prevention efforts are lacking amid federal cuts

She said patients frequently become discouraged due to barriers they face in getting prescriptions filled. The Bridge Center has been expanding its patient navigator program across the state, and helping other states start their own. The program helps patients identify pharmacies where they can fill their prescription fastest.
“There’s a medication that can help you, but at every turn it’s really hard to get it,” she said, calling the disparities in access to medication treatment “unacceptable.”
Trotzky-Sirr, the California doctor, fears the looming Medicaid cuts will cause many of her patients to discontinue treatment and relapse. Many of her patients are covered by Medi-Cal, the state’s Medicaid program.
“A lot of our patients are able to obtain medications for treatment of addiction like buprenorphine, because of the state covering the cost of the medication,” said Trotzky-Sirr, who also is a regional coordinator at the Bridge Center.
“They don’t have the resources to pay for it, cash, out of pocket.”
Some low-income patients switch between multiple providers or clinics as they try to find care and coverage, she added. These could be interpreted as red flags to a pharmacy.
Trotzky-Sirr argued buprenorphine does not need to be monitored as carefully as opioids and other drugs that are easier to misuse or overuse.
“Buprenorphine does not have those features and really needs to be in a class by itself,” she said. “Unfortunately, it’s hard to explain that to a pharmacist in 30 seconds over the phone.”
New studies find wide racial disparities in opioid overdose treatment

More is known about the medication now than when it was placed on the controlled substances list about two decades ago, said Brendan Saloner, a Bloomberg Professor of American Health in Addiction and Overdose at Johns Hopkins University.
Pharmacies are fearful of regulatory scrutiny and don’t have “countervailing pressure” to ensure patients get the treatments, he said.
On top of that fear, Medicaid managed care plans’ prior authorization processes may also be adding to the pharmacy bottleneck, he said.
“Black and Latino communities have higher rates of Medicaid enrollment, so to the extent that Medicaid prior authorization techniques are a hassle to pharmacies, that may also kind of discourage them [pharmacies] from stocking buprenorphine,” he said.
In some states, buprenorphine is much more readily available. In Maine, New Hampshire, Oregon, Rhode Island, Utah and Vermont, more than 70% of pharmacies carried the drug, according to the study. Buprenorphine availability was highest in states such as Oregon that have the least restrictive regulations for dispensing it.
In contrast, less than a quarter of pharmacies in Iowa, North Dakota, Texas, Virginia and Washington, D.C., carried the medication.
“We’re going to see more people becoming unhoused, because without treatment, they’re going to go back to those old habits,” McCullough, the Florida therapist, said. “When we talk about marginalized communities, these are the populations that are going to suffer the most because they already have challenges with access to care.”

The Arkansas Department of Human Services terminated its contract with Chicago-based RedMane Technology last September after the contractor did not deliver the product the state wanted, according to documents obtained via the state Freedom of Information Act.
RedMane Technology inked a $44 million deal with Kansas in July for a similar project.
Emails and reports obtained from DHS document RedMane’s lack of progress on the project and state officials’ subsequent frustration over the course of two years.
DHS and RedMane “mutually agreed to end the project” in August 2024, agency spokesperson Gavin Lesnick said that month in response to media inquiries.
“The project ended because a viable product was not developed within the contractually agreed time, scope, and budget parameters,” according to the project’s final progress report issued last September.
Since 1997, Arkansas has kept records of child maltreatment reports and cases using the Children’s Reporting and Information System (CHRIS). The Arkansas Child Abuse Hotline, which is part of the system, received 8,154 reports between Jan. 1 and March 31 of this year, DHS reported to lawmakers in May.
The state sought to update CHRIS, a federally recognized Statewide Automated Child Welfare Information System, because of financial incentives under a 2016 federal rule that gives states “a more favorable cost allocation” if they switch to a Comprehensive Child Welfare Information System.











There is a continuing disconnect between the State’s expectations and RedMane’s system configurations.


– Maximus Human Services' March 2023 report on the ARfocus project



DHS’ Division of Children and Family Services (DCFS) tasked RedMane with creating this new system, called ARfocus, starting March 1, 2022, according to the original contract. The contract set a maximum cost of $10.9 million for the first year of what was expected to be a seven-year, $26.2 million project.
The contract was amended four times, with the final one signed in November 2023. At that time, the agreement projected $14.3 million through February 2025 and $26.7 million through February 2029.
The state paid $12.2 million to RedMane between April 2022 and January of this year, according to invoices the Advocate obtained via FOIA.
CHRIS is “fully capable of meeting all our needs at this time,” but a new system “built on modern cloud-based software that uses a mobile-friendly application” would be more efficient, Lesnick told the Advocate.
“It’s less about the current system not working and more about the need to support future upgrades and compatibility,” he said.
 ‘This just isn’t acceptable’

RedMane was supposed to build the ARfocus database on a “modern and mobile-friendly case management system [that] will allow users to work and collaborate in ways the previous system simply could not,” according to an April 2022 news release from RedMane announcing the project. The news release noted that RedMane was opening a Little Rock office.

AR DHS Significant Concerns 
“Implementing this system will be transformative to how DCFS staff engage and support the children, families, and caregivers we serve,” then-DCFS Director Mischa Martin said at the time.
Nearly a year and a half later, Martin emailed RedMane with “significant concerns” about the functionality of ARfocus and RedMane’s capacity to fix things.
The Arkansas State Police’s Child Abuse Hotline staff had been “consistently reporting about the system slowness” since ARfocus launched on May 30, 2023, Martin told RedMane staff in her Sept. 11, 2023 email.
Hotline administrator Dan Mack said in an August 2023 email to DHS staff that ARfocus was “creeping along.”
“We’re getting killed every day at the same time and it’s taking us hours to recover,” Mack said. “This just isn’t acceptable.”
RedMane staff attributed the “slowness” to “an ASP infrastructure issue” in an email to DCFS earlier that month.
Other issues included failed mandated reporter portals and “stalled servers that appear to have not been monitored,” Martin wrote. RedMane had not resolved the issues “despite the daily stand-up calls and deployment efforts,” she added.
“Even if these issues are fixed and resolved, we are concerned about the product quality and the impact for the next major phase [of implementation],” Martin wrote. “This would be a project failure if we had rolled out the entire system to statewide field staff and stakeholders. Our organization values the partnership we have had with RedMane, but the ongoing problems have eroded our confidence in your ability to deliver reliable and high-quality code.”
Martin left DHS in October 2023 and is now running for state Senate. She declined an interview for this article.
RedMane did not respond to calls and emails requesting comment.

 More frustrations

Virginia-based Maximus Human Services monitored and assessed RedMane’s performance on the development of ARfocus throughout the project. As of February 2025, DHS had paid Maximus more than $6 million over five years.
Maximus’ monthly reports on ARfocus, starting in October 2022 and ending in August 2024, detailed the fraught working relationship between RedMane and DCFS.
A seven-week delay of the first phase of the ARfocus rollout cost the state $158,000, Maximus reported in March 2023.
“And even with this extra time, there is a continuing disconnect between the State’s expectations and RedMane’s system configurations,” the report states.
By June 2024, ARfocus had “by far exceeded the cost we anticipated and is now totalling about 400% of what we had projected,” RedMane principal Colin Michaelis wrote in an email to DCFS staff. “This has left RedMane in an untenable fiscal position.”
Michaelis suggested making several changes to the project, including “for the state to share the fiscal burden for completing the implementation of ARFocus on a 50/50 basis for the work remaining.”
Tiffany Wright, Martin’s successor as DCFS director, said the suggestions needed to be more specific.

FW_ Meeting follow-up-DCFS Response 
“I have asked for this several times based upon the two months of conversations we have been having and also how it impacts the larger project,” Wright wrote later in June 2024.
By July, DHS officials expected the project “to continue to move forward as currently agreed,” said Jeff Dean, chief information officer in DHS’ Office of Information Technology.
“We’ll be happy to celebrate with you when the project actually starts hitting milestones,” Dean wrote in an email to RedMane.
At the time, RedMane staff had been “looking to hopefully reduce some of the complexity” of the design of ARfocus, but as of July 2024, there still was no scheduled meeting to discuss such changes, “nor have we been given a list of what areas this could be found in,” DHS’ ARfocus project director, Miranda Raines, wrote in an email to RedMane.
RedMane continued to bill the state during the project’s unwinding from August 2024 to January 2025, according to invoices from the company.
The state is still using CHRIS to keep records of child welfare cases, and the federal Administration for Children and Families considers the program transitional in anticipation of a future Comprehensive Child Welfare Information System, according to its website.
Lesnick noted that despite the problems with the project, it resulted in the launch of the Arkansas Mandated Reporter Portal, a secure webpage for mandated reporters to submit reports of child maltreatment.
“While we regret that the project with RedMane did not come to fruition, we remain focused on bettering our platform to ensure we are providing the best resources to staff so we can best serve families in need going forward,” Lesnick said.

(Photo by Graham Stokes for the Ohio Capital Journal. Republish photo only with original story.)As artificial intelligence becomes more prevalent, Ohio universities are finding ways to responsibly incorporate AI into the classroom. 
Ohio State University is starting a new artificial intelligence initiative this semester. 
Ohio’s two-year operating budget requires the Ohio Department of Education and Workforce to adopt a model policy by Dec. 31 on the use of AI in schools and requires K-12 public schools to adopt an AI policy by July 1, 2026. 
The state budget also created the AI Integration in Community Colleges Pilot Program which requires the Chancellor of Higher Education to award five $100,000 grants each fiscal year to community colleges, technical colleges and state community colleges to implement AI initiatives. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXOhio state Reps. Tex Fischer, R-Boardman, and Steve Demetriou, R-Bainbridge Twp., introduced a bill that would regulate AI systems in the state. 
House Bill 392 defines an artificial intelligence system as “any system that utilizes machine learning or similar technologies to infer from inputs how to produce outputs that affect or influence physical or virtual environments, including content generation, decisions, recommendations, or predictions.”
“We’d like bilingual students, students who know both AI and know the practice and application of that transformative technology in the context of their disciplines and the fields that they came to college to study,” said Ravi V. Bellamkonda, Ohio State’s executive vice president and provost. 
It’s up to each department to decide how to incorporate AI, he said. 
“We’re not saying you have to use this tool,” Bellamkonda said. “We’re just saying that you have to have familiarity with and fluency with this tool to see if it’s appropriate to use.” 
About 85% of college students have already integrated generative AI into their academic lives, according to a June 2025 study published in TechTrends. 
Ohio State is creating guidelines when it comes to AI and plagiarism. 
“I do want curated spaces where they’re allowed to use it because that’s the whole point of the initiative, but it may not be appropriate in every course,” Bellamkonda said. “It may not be appropriate for every assignment.” 
Research from MIT’s Media Lab suggests frequently using AI tools could reduce critical thinking skills, especially among younger users. 
“I think critical thinking becomes more important in this age of AI because only those people who are really smart in how they engage AI will do really well,” said Gaurav Bansal, chair and O’Bleness Full Professor of Analytics & Information System at Ohio University’s College of Business.
Bellamkonda compared using AI to using a calculator. 
“The use of calculators has not dumbed us down,” he said. “We found other things to do with our brains. … Every single time we’ve dealt with technology, we brought value to the table.” 
OU’s College of Business is incorporating more AI-specific courses including a new AI in business graduate certificate and a new AI concentration for their graduate program. 
“When we ask the students how you see your future in the age of AI and many of them indicate fear, it talks about job displacement and fear and … how many jobs will survive in the age of AI,” Bansal said. “Our focus is that we teach students, that they learn how they can augment themselves.”
Humans “can play a very important role in making sure that AI is used, developed, and implemented in an ethical way,” he said.

(Photo by Maddie Meyer/Getty Images)Whether you have enjoyed a hike to a summit in the Green or White Mountains, fishing a cold-water trout stream, a postcard-perfect view from a highway overlook, or a glass of clean water from your tap, there’s a good chance that a U.S. Forest Service “Inventoried Roadless Area” is to thank. 
But on Aug. 29, the Trump administration put New England’s irreplaceable roadless areas in its crosshairs for logging and development by announcing its intent to rescind the “Roadless Rule.” More than one-fifth of the White and Green Mountain National Forests are at risk.
America can’t afford to lose its roadless areas.
For a quarter century, the Roadless Rule has provided an essential layer of protection for 58.5 million acres of our national forests, or about a third of all lands managed by the U.S. Forest Service. Here in New England, the rule safeguards 260,000 acres of the White and Green Mountain National Forests (WMNF and GMNF), including iconic landscapes like New Hampshire’s Franconia Notch, Mount Moosilauke, Mount Chocorua, and the Presidential Range. Portions of Vermont’s famous White Rocks National Recreation Area were spared from road construction and clearcuts in an ongoing 14,000-acre logging project only because of the Roadless Rule.
For an administration that has made big claims about improving government efficiency, rescinding the Roadless Rule may be among its most foolish stunts yet. The Forest Service has a $10.8 billion road maintenance backlog on its 370,000-mile road network, more miles of road than are managed by any other state or federal agency. Those roads — enough to circle the Earth 14 times — degrade water quality, worsen flooding, fragment important habitat, and endanger communities by facilitating human ignitions of wildfires.
Recognizing the exceptional value of Inventoried Roadless Areas (totaling just 2% of the lower-48 states), the agency promulgated the 2001 Roadless Area Conservation Rule as “a down payment on the well-being of future generations,” in the words of former Forest Service Chief Mike Dombeck, who oversaw the rule’s development. Over 1.5 million Americans submitted comments in support of the rule, a record for public participation in federal rulemaking.
The irreplaceable landscapes protected by the Roadless Rule were central to the cultures and well-being of Indigenous people across North America prior to European colonization, and they remain important today. Randy Kritkausky of Vermont, a federally enrolled member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation, wrote that: “Repeal of the Roadless Area Conservation Rule would literally make permanent and devastating inroads into protected National Forests which are, for many Indigenous Peoples, our primary connection with unspoiled ancestral lands. This threat is not only ecological, it is profoundly spiritual.”
Only 3.3% of New England is protected from timber harvest and road construction, but scientists broadly agree we must protect at least 10% of the region for the benefit of biodiversity, the climate, and the well-being of our communities. Rescinding the Roadless Rule would set our region back, making our conservation goals harder to achieve than ever.
We have learned all too well what will happen to roadless lands if the Roadless Rule is rescinded. Over the last two decades, the Forest Service has systematically targeted roadless areas for logging that were inventoried after 2001 and lack the protections afforded by the Roadless Rule. In the GMNF, a single project approved in 2019 will cut 6,000 roadless acres, including more than 4,000 acres of clearcuts and similar “even-aged” harvests. A new WMNF project proposes nearly 1,000-acres of roadless area logging, including about 200 acres of clearcuts.
Standing Trees is litigating to stop this reckless destruction, but a political solution is required in the long run. That’s why we’re grateful to members of Congress, including many here in New England, who have signed onto the Roadless Area Conservation Act of 2025 (RACA), which would make the 2001 Roadless Rule permanent.
RACA is an essential step to stopping the Trump administration’s attacks and maintaining existing protections, but ultimately, our precious national forests deserve even stronger safeguards. New England’s state and federal public lands, spanning just 11% of the landscape, are worth far more to our regional economy when left intact. It’s time to reinvigorate the discussion of expanding congressionally designated wildlands across our two national forests, or even converting the forests to national parks.
In the short term, the clock is ticking to defend the Roadless Rule — and you can make yourself heard by submitting a comment.
In the words of retired Forest Service Chief Dale Bosworth, “The 2001 Roadless Area Conservation Rule was a landmark accomplishment of the USDA Forest Service. …The Roadless Rule is working for America’s National Forest System and it’s working for the American taxpayer. As we say, ‘If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.’”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/whitemountainsroadless-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-08 04:56:23.965836

(Photo by Morgan Trau, WEWS)Ohio lawmakers have their claws out — introducing a bipartisan bill to make it illegal to declaw a cat.
Al Cutrona just purrfected his family.
“I just recently adopted Archie,” Cutrona said. “I’m happy, and it’s been exciting to have him in my life.”
His new cat has quickly become his best friend. As many cat companions know, they use their paws — and their claws — to play, to fight and to make biscuits.
Veterinarian Dr. Aziza Glass explained that claws are part of a cat’s paws and are sharp. But not all cats have them.
“Declawing, the process of removing the claw or essentially the nail of the fingers, the digits, the toes,” Glass said.
Taking away claws can, but not always, cause chronic pain and health problems, behavioral issues and an inability to run, jump or climb.
“It’s basically sadistic,” Cutrona said. “And so I thought, ‘Why the heck do we even allow that in the state of Ohio?'”
Cutrona is also a Republican state senator. He and Sen. Hearcel Craig (D-Columbus) put forward bipartisan S.B. 252, which would ban the declawing of cats. Violations could lead to thousands of dollars in fines. There are carve-outs in the legislation if the cat needs their claws removed for their overall health.
Declawing is already banned in New York, Maryland, Massachusetts, Virginia and Rhode Island, along with a plethora of cities in the U.S. Dozens of other areas across the world, like the United Kingdom, Canada and Spain have major restrictions or total bans.
Some people want cats that are declawed because they are afraid of the damage to furniture or children, and veterinarian Dr. Sarah Wallace said cats might not get adopted — or could get returned — if they are not declawed.
“Cats, specifically that like to paw on their furniture or on the corner of couches, it can sometimes be so irritating that owners actually consider re-homing or giving up their cat,” Wallace said.
Cutrona understood the concern, but said that furniture getting scratched isn’t worth harming your pets or possibly losing them.
“There are a lot of things that people can do with it, whether it’s scratch pads, clipping their nails,” he said. “Cats are more likely to get out of the house, to be out and about, and you’re essentially taking away the only form of defense.”
This bill will be heard in the coming weeks.

Much attention has been given to stranded costs, which is the smallest slice of the price breakdown. (Photo by Lauren McCauley/ Maine Morning Star)Concerns about the high cost of energy were frequently heard in legislative hearings, debates, and throughout the halls of the State House this past session. It’s front of mind for many Mainers as prices have noticeably increased in recent years.
Calls for lawmakers to do more were heard during multiple public hearings before the Legislature’s Energy, Utilities and Technology Committee where people lined up to speak for hours, including businesses who feared their livelihood could be in jeopardy over high electricity bills. 
It is an issue that Republicans in particular have raised, arguing that state policies that encourage sustainable energy use are to blame.
“The reason Maine ranks so high in electricity rates is because of bad policies passed in our state,” said House Minority Leader Billy Bob Faulkingham of Winter Harbor.
How concerns about energy costs paved way for a prohibition on towns banning heating fuel sources

However, the actual dollar amount ratepayers end up shelling out each month is influenced by a multitude of factors — some of which lawmakers have more control over than others. While the global markets that dictate prices of natural gas and other energy sources are beyond the reach of state senators and representatives, there are some ways that energy costs can be addressed from Augusta. 
Misleading data 
In early August, new data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration garnered a lot of attention by seeming to indicate that Maine had the biggest increase in the country for residential electricity rates between May 2024 and 2025.
Republican lawmakers latched onto that stat as evidence that the policies coming out of Augusta are driving up costs for ratepayers in Maine. 
“Unlike other states, Maine’s leaders have pursued an agenda that prioritizes green mandates and out-of-state profits over affordability for ratepayers,” said Peter Wood (R-Norway) in the Maine House Republican August 22 radio address highlighting that statistics.
However, state energy officials have pushed back against those findings.
Phil Bartlett, chairman of the Public Utilities Commission, said it is hard to understand what methodology was used for that research because that data isn’t consistent with what the state is seeing for customers of the two privately owned utility companies, Central Maine Power and Versant.
“There have been increases over the last several years, but this year it’s actually a little bit less than it was two years ago,” Bartlett said. “It’s been a bit of seesaw in the last few years, but we’ve seen increases in various components of the bills, but it’s more like 10%, not 36%.”
Public Advocate Heather Sanborn said she couldn’t recreate the federal data that showed a 36% increase in average residential rates. She said that her office’s data shows that from June 2024 to June 2025, there was a year-over-year bill increase for residential customers of: 20.7% in CMP territory, 11.9% in Versant Bangor Hydro territory and 15% in Versant Maine Public District.
Sanborn added that smaller, consumer-owned utilities aren’t tracked in the same way, but they also account for less customers, so they wouldn’t skew the data enough to bring it up to 36%. 
That data point also doesn’t seem to account for states procuring their energy rates on different schedules. Maine uses a 12-month cycle, but other states could be updating their rates more frequently.
Despite some data discrepancies, energy prices have been higher in recent years than they were 10 years ago. Though, they have been falling since a peak in 2023. And people are calling on lawmakers to do more to stem the cost of electricity at a time when it feels like everyday essentials just keep getting more expensive. 
So what can lawmakers do?

Electricity bills can be broken down into a few main cost components. While there is opportunity for the Legislature to address prices in each of these areas, some of that work is already underway but may take time for its impacts to be felt. 
Much attention has been given to stranded costs, which is the smallest slice of the price breakdown. Also called public policy costs, stranded costs is a catch-all category that can include the cost of storm recovery, solar incentives and a low-income assistance program. 
“If Republicans were in charge, we would start by ending the solar tax known as net energy billing that subsidizes solar panels for the wealthy on the backs of Maine ratepayers,” Faulkingham said.
During the last legislative session, there was a push to reform or even repeal the state’s solar incentive program, called net energy billing, which critics like Faulkingham said would reduce electricity bills for ratepayers. While there was broad consensus the program needed to be adjusted, some didn’t agree with making it a scapegoat for the cost hike people experienced. 
The average customer was paying about one cent per kilowatt-hour for policy costs over the past couple years, Bartlett said, with the typical Maine residence using about 550 kilowatt-hours each month. That jumped to 1.7 cents in 2025, which is a real increase, but not what’s driving the total people see on their bills, he added. 
“The suggestion that we’re seeing these wild increases because of those policy costs… just the math doesn’t work,” Bartlett said.  
In June, Gov. Janet Mills signed legislation into law to reform net energy billing and rein in future costs it could impose on ratepayers. While the cost of the program is expected to exceed $234 million this year alone, the new law is projected to save Maine electricity customers more than $1.2 billion over the next 16 years, according to a news release from the Maine Public Advocate’s Office after its passage.
Much more significant to one’s energy bill than those stranded costs is the supply rate, which reflects the cost of what actually generates the power. 
“New England has historically had higher electricity prices than the U.S. average, driven by the region’s heavy reliance on natural gas to produce electricity,” said Dan Burgess, director of the Governor’s Energy Office.
Especially in recent years, this has driven up costs for consumers because the cost of natural gas itself is subject to national and global events like Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. 
While Maine lawmakers can’t control those global market fluctuations, some believe that pursuing more sources of in-state and in-region renewable energy could offer more stable prices. 










The suggestion that we’re seeing these wild increases because of those policy costs… just the math doesn’t work.


– Phil Bartlett, Public Utilities Commission


Earlier this year, the governor signed legislation that will transition the current Governor’s Energy Office into the Department of Energy Resources. That new cabinet-level entity will have the authority to do clean energy procurements, which could help transition the state away from volatile natural gas and fossil fuel prices. 
A new study from Daymark Energy Advisors shows that electricity prices in New England could have been 11% lower last winter if contracted offshore wind projects had been operational. That would have translated to about $400 million in savings for ratepayers throughout New England, the study found. However, the Trump administration took action early on to pause the development of offshore wind projects, leaving plans to put turbines in the Gulf of Maine on pause.
The remainder of an electric bill is the cost to deliver the electricity to the end user. 
That can be broken down into transmission costs, which are regulated federally, and distribution costs, which is the price of taking energy from the bulk transmission system to the poles and wires that reach people’s homes. 
Transmission prices have increased over the past decade to cover the cost of system upgrades that are passed onto ratepayers. Because New England states share a regional grid called ISO-New England, those jumps have been seen across the region. 
Distribution costs are regulated by the Maine Public Utilities Commission and increases can reflect system upgrades like new poles or substations. 
Because of a law passed in 2022, utility companies are required to file a 10-year plan to determine what upgrades will be needed to improve grid reliability and resilience. The plans should also account for the state’s climate policy goals and cost-effectiveness for ratepayers. 
Greater attention has been paid to grid resilience after the state faced unprecedented winter storms in 2023 and 2024 that incurred significant costs to ratepayers. In the storms’ wake, Mills established the Infrastructure Rebuilding and Resilience Commission to find ways to shore up the state’s energy systems against future severe storms. The commission’s final report came out in May 2025, highlighting the need to improve the grid, especially as the state moves toward greater electrification of transportation and home heating and cooling systems.
“With more low-cost, local clean energy projects, nation-leading energy efficiency programs, and efforts to strengthen our electric grid against extreme storms, Maine continues to work to protect ratepayers and build a more affordable, resilient energy future,” Burgess said.

(Rebecca Rivas/Missouri Independent)Writing about children and families of late has felt a bit like watching that Philadelphia Phillies game where an enraged older woman snatched a home run ball from a 10-year-old boy’s father. One generation has been doing its best to wrest resources from another, damn the consequences and judgment from anyone else.
You could see lawmakers in Washington, D.C., behaving just like the silver-haired woman at LoanDepot Park. All but one member of the Kansas delegation voted for the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act, which targeted social safety net spending — Medicaid and SNAP most notably — to finance tax cuts for the richest Americans. For all of President Donald Trump’s bloviating about making our country great again, he seems most interested in strip-mining our (unvaccinated) children’s future.
In this moment, it can feel as though no one is paying attention.
Thankfully, new research shows otherwise. Folks included in a new survey from nonpartisan researchers PerryUndem agree overwhelmingly that our country makes raising a family too difficult, and the government needs to do more to help children and those who care for them. I spoke with Mike Perry from the firm and David Jordan from the United Methodist Health Ministry Fund (which co-sponsored the effort) to learn more.


Here are the five biggest takeaways.
 
1. People are paying attention
Perry told me the study was a special effort, gathering both national and statewide data. They also went beyond simple surveys.
“I got to talk to real Kansans across the state in focus groups and ask about their lives,” he said. “This study focused on families with young children and asked them about their lives. I think some of the big takeaways are pretty well known, which are that families are struggling with high cost of living, housing costs, food costs, they come up a lot. And there is this idea that these families are under lots of stress right now, and there is a desire to help them out.”
 
2. The numbers are overwhelming
In Kansas, 89% of respondents worry about the cost of living, 85% about the cost of food and groceries, 90% about the cost of health care and insurance, and 81% about the cost of housing or rent. Polling seldom shows such overwhelming numbers, and Perry agreed that they showed “people just have lots of clarity, these are problems.”
Jordan added: “There’s a lot of common ground and a shared interest in helping children and families thrive, and that Kansas families are experiencing this firsthand. So it’s tough to get platitudes from policymakers when they know there’s a high cost of living and that they know that policy can help be one part of improving their day-to-day lives.”
 
3. They want government action
Perry said the the folks he talked to didn’t necessarily want or love the idea of more government. But given the challenges faced by children and their families in Kansas and beyond, they simply didn’t see any other option.
“They’re backing into it because they don’t see any other way to make progress on these kind of problems facing families,” he said. “So yes, they want government to do more.”
 
4. Kansas, specifically, has fallen short
But that’s not all. The state of Kansas is seen as unsympathetic of those who need help. This, of course, was the whole point of former Gov. Sam Brownback’s HOPE Act, which radically reduced access to family support programs across the state. We’ve lived with this toxic legacy for far too long, but lawmakers in Topeka have only doubled down on failure.
Respondents “feel like it is really hard to get help in Kansas, that the income thresholds are just too low for programs, that they’re not realistic when the cost of living is so high, when food is so expensive, and people are getting turned away in Kansas from programs,” Perry said. “Even though they don’t think they’re doing very well financially, and even when they’re falling behind in bills, they think it’s too hard to qualify for things in Kansas.”
 
5. Fraud concerns are real
Yes, Kansans have paid attention to coverage of waste, fraud and abuse in government programs. But their reactions don’t stop there.
“In Kansas, you can be somebody who wants to reduce fraud and abuse in programs and at the very same time want to expand access to programs,” Perry said. “These don’t cancel each other out, right? And I think some policymakers, some elected officials, think they do, think it’s one or the other, and it’s not. It’s both.”
 
Going forward
These issues aren’t going away. Indeed, the passage of Trump’s signature legislation ensures that children and families will face uncertain times ahead. Cuts to Medicaid and SNAP will leave children hungry and sick. And lawmakers that Kansans sent to D.C. helped make it happen.
“We heard time and again that there’s families that are barely making it, and they may be getting help in the smallest of ways, but it’s making a huge difference,” Jordan told me as we wrapped up. “And maybe getting some food assistance, or they’re able to have their child enrolled in Medicaid. But some of these new changes have the potential of ripping away that help, and there’s a lot of fear and worry about that.”
I wish there was a simple answer. I our government could restrain its drive to pump dollars into the bloated ghouls of Wall Street.
Perhaps the best option we have was demonstrated by the Philly sports fans last week, as they drove the angry woman and her ill-gotten baseball out of the stadium with heckling. But that takes everyone paying attention and raising their voice.

In October 2023, a group calling itself Return to the Land established its first “Whites only community” in the Ozark Mountains of Arkansas. They followed that with a second enclave nearby in 2025.
The group, which describes itself as a “private membership association” that helps groups form “European heritage communities,” plans to build four more sites, including another location in the Ozarks and two in Appalachia.
Return to the Land believes that by calling themselves a private membership association they can create a white ethnostate – a type of state in which residence is limited to white people – and legally exclude people based on race, religion and sexual orientation.
If you read the words of Eric Orwoll, the group’s co-founder, its mission is clear: “You want a white nation? Build a white town … it can be done. We’re doing it.”
As a scholar of right-wing extremism, I have examined several groups calling for a white homeland in America. The creation of a white ethnostate is often seen as an ultimate goal of such white nationalism, which argues that white people form part of a genetically and culturally superior race deserving of protection and preservation. While Return to the Land doesn’t identify as white nationalists, their statements often align with the ideology.
 White ethnostates, big and small

One of the best-known plans for a white ethnostate is the Northwest Imperative, popularized by white nationalists during the 1970s and ’80s. The plan involved certain citizens taking 10% of the United States – the states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Wyoming and Montana – and excluding all nonwhite people from living there.
Proponents of the plan argued that these states were already majority white and contained large tracts of undeveloped land, making the territory ideal for white-only settlement. High-profile extremists of the time such as Richard Butler, Robert Mathews and David Lane supported the plan.
Still today, groups such as the Northwest Front, a white nationalist group founded in 2009 and located in the Pacific Northwest, continue to promote variations of this idea.
While the Pacific Northwest has a long history with right-wing extremist organizing, the proponents of whites-only communities have also targeted areas of the Northeast as possible locations for a white ethnostate.
In 2018, for example, Tom Kawczynski, town manager of Jackman, Maine, was fired when his views came to light, including views that have been characterized as “pro-white.”
More recently, in 2023, the People’s Initiative of New England, a splinter group of the neo-Nazi organization National Socialist Club-131, introduced themselves on the online platform Substack. There, the group laid out its goal of establishing the six states of New England – Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont – as white-only.
The goal of gaining control of multiple states is unrealistic, of course, at least peacefully. Therefore, a popular alternative, along the lines of Return to the Land’s actions, is to establish smaller all-white communities.
In 2013, media outlets reported that neo-Nazi Craig Cobb was buying land in the small town of Leith, North Dakota, to build a white nationalist community. The town rallied to oppose this attempt.
Later that year, Cobb was charged with seven felonies related to confronting residents with a gun. He was sentenced to probation for four years and deeded the property back to the town in 2014.
And in 2021, leaked Telegram chats revealed that Christopher Pohlhaus, a former U.S. Marine and founder of the neo-Nazi group Blood Tribe, wanted to establish a whites-only community in Springfield, Maine. Pohlhaus was developing a military training facility as part of these efforts when media coverage led him to sell the property and move out of state.
 The danger of a white ethnostate

These various attempts to develop a white ethnostate are not simply individual, isolated cases. They form part of a larger movement toward achieving white nationalism.
A major part of white nationalism today is focused on anti-immigrant hatred. That has spurred major acts of extreme violence such as the 2019 murders of 23 people in El Paso, Texas, the majority of whom were Hispanic.
The “great replacement theory,” a conspiracy theory popular among white nationalists, argues that various policies are leading to the destruction of the white race. This theory inspired the 2022 mass killing of 10 Black Americans in a supermarket in Buffalo, New York.
The shooter selected the supermarket because of its location in a predominantly Black neighborhood and left behind a white supremacy manifesto.
Communities across the U.S. have successfully resisted the establishment of white ethnostates.
The residents of Leith, North Dakota, did this by creating a website informing people about what was happening in their community. Public outcry also met Pohlhaus in Maine.
As for Return to the Land, Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin said in July 2025 that his office is reviewing the group’s actions and whether they violate the law.
“Racism has no place in a free society,” he said, “but from a legal perspective, we have not seen anything that would indicate any state or federal laws have been broken.”

(Getty Images)As the school year gets its legs, some might remember seeing double when the Nebraska Legislature passed LB 71 during its 2024 session. The law, a “parents rights” bill, gave moms, dads and legal guardians a number of “rights” regarding the education of their children. 
Included is access to information on curriculum matters — what Johnny and Jenny are learning, testing details and the option to excuse their children from instruction or activity without fear of repercussions, other than Johnny and Jenny missing whatever intrinsic educational value the lesson or activity held.
What many knew was that parents already had the “rights” spelled out in LB 71, hence the double vision. The law codified what school districts practiced.
The parents rights movement has been gaining steam in Nebraska and elsewhere, spurred often by requests for public school districts to ban books from their libraries and classrooms. This space has spent many column inches on the sorry and senseless phenomenon of book banning, including this one that appeared in the Nebraska Examiner more than three years ago. 
I refer to that commentary for a couple of reasons, not the least of which is that in it I suggest rather than banning a book — “The 1619 Project” for example — parents and children should read and discuss it together, perhaps finding in those conversations a deeper appreciation for the nation’s history.
Which brings us back to LB 71. Let’s recognize and champion parents rights. But let’s remember students, too, have the “right” to a complete education, one that gives them the entire story from “Captain Underpants” to “I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings” to the Harry Potter series to true American history.
Patrons of public school districts, too, have a stake in students getting a full-bodied, robust education. We’re building leaders, thinkers, artists … stewards of our democratic way of life. Why shortchange them? Or us?
To get there, public school districts should adopt policies, not simply to comply with LB 71’s requirements, which are spelled out in the law, but also to raise the bar for anyone who wants to alter pedagogy, ban a book or change a school’s curriculum. While the subjects of gender identity, sex, race and the history of slavery are the usual suspects, policies should up the ante for any challenge to books or lessons. 
Let’s give challengers demerits, too, for dismissing current curriculum that works just because it fails to fit a particular political, religious or cultural view … realizing, of course, that the country has no one identifiable culture but rather a wondrous mix of them. 
A starting point could be simple: Those challenging the inclusion of a book on a reading list or in a school library must first provide proof they have read the book, detailing exactly the offending themes and passages that demonstrate a grasp of the author’s intent. Further, they must also take into account how an experienced and skilled teacher might handle the subject.
None of which takes away the right of parents to exclude a title from their own children, but only those instances when they want to exclude the title from all students. 
As for history, use a policy with the same bone structure, requiring challenges to be underscored with some rationale and evidence, especially as they relate to a topic’s inclusion causing harm to students.
Surely some would cry foul, insisting that they know best what their children should be taught and how it should complement what they are teaching them in their own homes. All good. No argument.
But I would argue as I did in this space in 2022 that no scientific evidence exists that indicates reading books about LGBTQ kids “rewires biology.” And, as was said then, if knowing the facts about slavery makes students (or their parents) uncomfortable, good. That’s the perfect starting point for lessons that could trend toward empathy, compassion and discussions of how we can avoid repeating such horrid history.
Finally, beefing up the process of challenges to school subject matter, by its very nature, gives teachers, administrators, parents, students and even patrons the opportunity to work together to solidify, update, modify and do whatever is needed to add rigor and responsibility to curricula. What makes the news most often seems to be videos of school board meetings devolving into shouting matches when teachers, principals and superintendents sometimes face intimidation and threats.
In a world where children learn by watching, those are the least effective lesson plans we could draw up, rights or no rights.

Carlos Guillermo Smith stands near the crosswalk outside the Pulse memorial site in Orlando on Aug. 23, 2025. State workers had removed Gay Pride colors at the site, but activists used chalk to restore the colors. The state later repaved the site. (Via Smith's X feed)No doubt Gov. Ron DeSantis expects Floridians to be grateful for saving us from yet another woke attack on decency, probity, and speeding motorists.
I refer, of course, to colorful crosswalks.
Just as he has fought to expel books by Black and gay authors from our schools, the governor has ordered FDOT to paint over the flowers, the sunbursts, the fish, the musical notes, and the rainbows — especially the rainbows.
We want guns in our streets, not rainbows.
Speaking of guns, one of the first crosswalks to be destroyed was the one outside the Pulse Memorial.
You may recall that in 2016 a gunman murdered 49 people at an LGBTQ nightclub in Orlando.
The rainbow crosswalk was intended to honor them.
DeSantis, however, views it as some sort of personal insult.
His political future looks distinctly unpromising AND his wife’s gubernatorial campaign lies in ruins after the Hope Florida scandal. Environmental activists won a temporary shutdown of his Everglades gulag, though an appeals court is allowing it to stay open for now.
I mean, nobody likes the guy, but, by God, he can still teach crosswalks a sharp lesson.
“We will not allow our state roads to be commandeered for political purposes,” he said.
Except the crosswalks were not “commandeered.” Like most painted crosswalks in Florida, the Pulse rainbow was supported by the city government and the citizens.
FDOT itself had approved it.
But in late August, FDOT turned up in the dead of night and ground it off the road.
But this kind of pointless vandalism is happening across the state.
At least a dozen schools in Tampa will see their “Crosswalks to Classrooms” school crossings destroyed, including one painted to look like a shelf of books.
Florida’s government is particularly scared of books.
‘Political ideologies’
Hearts commemorating a young girl who died of a heart condition in Port St. Lucie; checkerboards in Daytona near the raceway; “Back the Blue” in Hillsborough County; bike lanes in Orange County, painted by kids who won an FDOT art contest to design them — all either already gone or about to be.
Florida Transportation Secretary Jared Perdue vows to “keep our transportation facilities free and clear of political ideologies.”
As if violating free expression in cities and towns across the state is not the product of a “political ideology.”
DeSantis says painted crosswalks promote “social, political, or ideological messages” and must be obliterated.
That’s one of his excuses. He’s got more.
The governor claims he has no choice but to enforce a new law — a law he signed — allowing FDOT to withhold funds for road projects and “traffic control” if cities and counties don’t follow orders.
Thing is, FDOT always had the power to forbid street art. That’s why communities wanting to paint a crosswalk sought and received permission — from FDOT.
Now, you could argue that the wrong kind of paint could create a slippery surface.
Crosswalk painters know this and generally use acrylic or other paints that bond to the asphalt.
You could argue brightly colored crosswalks give people trying to cross the street a false sense of security, leading them to just hop out into the road without looking to see what maniac in an F-150 is barreling toward them.
Except the data do not support that contention.
You could argue drivers encountering images of sunflowers or fish or “Black Lives Matter” on the road will be so discombobulated trying to read and interpret the art, they’ll become reckless.
Remember, FDOT said yes to those cheery, often clever, crosswalks.
Distracted drivers?
The crosswalks only got dangerous this spring.
Now, as the law says, “Non-standard surface markings, signage and signals that do not contribute directly to traffic safety or control can lead to distraction or misunderstandings, jeopardizing both driver and pedestrian safety.”
The state’s assumption that drivers aren’t already distracted is demonstrably false, as every human who has ever operated a car in this state knows.
Whether they’re behind the wheel of a beat-up Kia or 4,000-pound Mercedes SUV, people frequently struggle to heed FDOT’s “standard surface markings and signage,” including the scarlet octagon that says “STOP.”
Nevertheless, research indicates they are unlikely to lose control of the vehicle contemplating a pink, blue, and green-stiped crosswalk.
What they might do is slow the hell down. A national study shows street art has contributed to a 50% reduction in crashes involving vehicles and pedestrians.
In Leon County, the Knight Creative Communities Institute worked with Florida State University and local government to determine whether brightly painted crosswalks might get people to drive the speed limit near schools.
Sure enough, brightly painted crosswalks did indeed cause Tallahassee drivers — not noted for their adherence to posted speed limits — to ease up on the accelerator.
Unless you just moved to Florida from Inner Mongolia, you know what’s actually going on here.
Bike lanes and walkways designed and painted by school kids, and crosswalks celebrating a city’s history or its natural beauty or demonstrating its commitment to inclusivity, somehow threaten DeSantis’ commitment to Beijing-style state control.
Children must not grow up in the Free State Florida feeling free to create or express themselves or engage in their community.
‘Conform’
Asked during a press conference what he’d tell Florida children now watching grown people destroying their art, DeSantis said, “We have a representative system of government. People elect their representatives. They’re able to enact the legislation with the governor’s signature and then when that happens, obviously, people will conform their conduct accordingly.”
Hear that, kids? “Conform” your conduct and chant the mandated Pledge of Allegiance every morning.
DeSantis means to bully the people of this state from Perdido Bay to the Dry Tortugas: Expressions of dissent, assertions, of common humanity, civic pride, beauty, and joy will not be tolerated.
The people of Pensacola have been told the large “Black Lives Matter” painting on A Street, the words spelled out with flags of nations that have contributed to Florida culture, is verboten.
God forbid Black people think their lives matter.
This is not a popular decision: The mayor says Pensacola will comply, but city resources are stretched pretty thin, so if the state really wants to rid the place of a “Black Lives Matter” painting, FDOT might have to handle it themselves.
As for LGBTQ folks and their aggressive use of the color wheel, state policy is to erase both the pigmentation and the people.
Remove “gay” books from the library, pull courses out of college catalogs, and scrub rainbows off the streets.
Remember the great essay “The Cruelty is the Point” by Adam Serwer?
The Atlantic published it in the early days of Donald Trump’s first term, but it’s just as relevant now: insulting, attacking, undermining, performative hatred — this how the regimes in both Washington and Tallahassee rule us.
Resistance
Authoritarians want to control every aspect of our culture, no matter how seemingly inconsequential.
No shot is too cheap, no attack too petty: FDOT has just ripped out road signs on Longboat Key
The road signs identified Longboat Key’s main drag as “Gulf of Mexico Drive,” its name since 1957.
The regime wants it changed.
The entire world calls the body of water along Florida’s west coast the Gulf of Mexico.
However, I’m happy to report, not all Floridians acquiesce in this name-changing nonsense.
Some elderly residents of Tallahassee’s Westminster Oaks faced down a county road crew as it was scraping the paint off the yellow and green crosswalk by their retirement community.
Children at the nearby W.T. Moore Elementary School had painted it.
Around 30 seniors arrived on golf carts and walkers. An 85-year old lady lay down on the crosswalk and the road crew retreated.
But only temporarily.
Delray Beach and Key West are vigorously resisting DeSantis’ attempt to destroy their rainbow crosswalks, as is Fort Lauderdale, which is demanding an FDOT hearing.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-08 04:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,EPA’s reconsideration of the asbestos ban compromises CT veterans,Christina Johnson,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/08/epas-reconsideration-of-the-asbestos-ban-compromises-ct-veterans/,"One truth impossible to ignore: unless asbestos exposure is eliminated once and for all, the human cost —especially among veterans— will only escalate.","Asbestos is not just a relic of America’s industrial past —it is a continuing threat that has etched a deep and disconcerting mark on thousands of veterans across Connecticut and the country. 
Previously celebrated for its versatility, this natural mineral was widely incorporated into almost all military infrastructure during much of the 20th century. Likewise, ships constructed before 2002 were also packed with asbestos in their engine and boiler rooms and other areas that needed heat and chemical protection. This extensive use resulted in the asbestos exposure of shipyard workers involved in the construction and maintenance of these vessels. Similarly, Navy veterans’ asbestos exposure also occurred as they both lived and worked in an environment surrounded by asbestos products. 
It took a long time for science to discover that this mineral’s tiny fibers could cause lethal diseases, such as mesothelioma, asbestosis, and lung cancer.
Recognizing these dangers, federal regulators began moving toward restrictions as early as 1989, when the country’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) attempted to phase out most asbestos-containing goods. The last mining operation of this mineral also stopped eventually in 2002. Yet such efforts were only partially successful as chrysotile —the most commonly used form— remains legal, allowing various industries to import and use it in their products. That gap remained a glaring weakness in public health protection until 2024, when the EPA finally prohibited the use of this asbestos, closing one of the last cracks that allowed the material into the country.


But just as a significant stride was achieved, the agency shockingly announced in June 2025 that it would reconsider the chrysotile ban after several chemical manufacturers filed a petition questioning the rule. Rather than standing firm on this hard-won policy, authorities opted to reassess it —a process that could drag on for as long as 30 months. In a troubling twist, the agency also asked the court to pause ongoing litigation related to the matter. 
For veterans and their families already enduring the devastating health repercussions of asbestos exposure, these choices represent far more than a bureaucratic delay. Furthermore, the ban rollback also poses an alarming risk to public health and safety, potentially reintroducing this toxic mineral back into federal and military supply chains.
How asbestos exposure impacted veterans in Connecticut
Asbestos exposure has long been a troubling issue affecting all 50 states nationwide, including Connecticut. An updated interactive map showed that between 1999 and 2017, the Constitution State saw at least 3,865 related deaths, which emphasizes a devastating impact on a coastal state that hosts over 131,600 veterans. Of these, 2,860 were attributed to lung cancer, while asbestosis and mesothelioma, respectively, accounted for 314 and 715 cases. Among the hardest hit regions was Hartford County—which reported about 804 fatalities —followed closely by New Haven County with an alarming 802 deaths.
A large share of these victims were former service members who spent an extended period in contaminated bases like Naval Submarine Base New London in Groton. Nationally, veterans make up about a third of the 3,000 mesothelioma diagnoses logged annually, despite representing only 6.1% of the entire adult population. This disproportionate burden makes one truth impossible to ignore: unless asbestos exposure is eliminated once and for all, the human cost—especially among veterans—will only escalate.
Protecting the veterans means upholding the asbestos ban
The federal government has made meaningful progress in acknowledging toxic exposure in military service. One result is the ratification of the Honoring Our PACT Act of 2022, which expanded healthcare and disability benefits for veterans suffering from service-connected conditions, including those caused by asbestos. Yet the logic of such reforms sadly becomes meaningless if, at the same time, policymakers allow the hazardous mineral to creep back into supply chains.
The 2024 chrysotile asbestos ban was the product of decades of science and public pressure converging on a single conclusion —that this natural mineral is dangerous. As such, reconsidering that decision not only undermines trust in public health protections but also places veterans and their families back in harm’s way. And for those already fighting asbestos-related illnesses, the mere possibility of weakening the rule already feels like a profound betrayal.  
Moreover, future service members deserve the assurance that they will be shielded from what’s supposed to be a preventable danger. With this, maintaining the asbestos ban is even more essential to ensuring that the invaluable contributions of those who sacrifice so much for our country are not only remembered, but actively honored.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa Sen. Sarah Trone Garriott, D-West Des Moines, criticized U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn, at a campaign event for her 3rd Congressional District run Sunday, for not holding public town halls.
Trone Garriott held a town hall event at Big Grove Brewery in Des Moines, where she answered questions from the crowd about issues like cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, made through the GOP-backed budget reconciliation bill. She also spoke about nitrate levels in Iowa waters, voting rights and immigration law enforcement.
Trone Garriott, who is running for the 3rd Congressional District in the 2026 election, said the district needs a representative who will listen to these concerns and engage constituents who have differing views.

“Our congressman, Zach Nunn, has not been showing up for people,” Trone Garriott said. “Since he started four years ago, he has not held a single open town hall. Responding to concerns that he wasn’t holding town halls, he said that it would be a waste of taxpayer money to do so — that it would be a ‘taxpayer-funded protest.’ Now, if people are showing up angry, it’s even more important that their voices are heard, because there’s a problem.”
Trone Garriott had referenced a Des Moines Register interview with Nunn in August, where the representative said he regularly holds public events, but that “we’re not going to do what the Democratic groups want us to do and just host a taxpayer-funded protest event.”
Holding public town halls has been a point of contention for Republicans as they face backlash from some constituents regarding controversial decisions made by Republicans in Congress, and the Trump administration, such as cuts to Medicaid, SNAP and to the U.S. Departments of Veteran Affairs and Education.
Nunn’s campaign manager, Brendan Duffy, said in a statement to the Iowa Capital Dispatch that the representative is “consistently accessible to Iowans, holding hundreds of events in all 21 counties and hosting real listening sessions that deliver real results.”






“Congressman Nunn isn’t going to take advice on meeting with his constituents from far-left activists who are out of touch with Iowa values,” Duffy said. “Zach Nunn has delivered $11,000 in tax cuts for Iowa families, $60 billion in direct assistance for farmers, and $50 billion for rural hospitals. While Democrat activists lie to Iowans, Congressman Nunn will continue delivering for them.”






The Iowa Republican’s congressional website states he has held 129 mobile office hours, 304 events with Iowans and provided 120,676 answers to Iowans.
Trone Garriott said that during her time as a state legislator, she has made an effort to reach out to voters of all backgrounds through public events and efforts to engage the community. She said “that’s why I am a Democratic senator representing a Republican district — because people appreciate someone who’s going to work hard for them, care about them, show up for them.”
The Democratic state senator was first elected in 2020, defeating Republican Scott Cirksena. In 2022, she won against then-Senate President Jake Chapman to represent Senate District 14 after redistricting, and won a close reelection race in 2024. Trone Garriott said she would bring her experience from these elections to the race against Nunn, and continue that work in Washington.
“We’re not getting the results we need, we’re not getting the decisions that we need, and we’re not getting our voices represented in Washington,” Trone Garriott said. “We need elected leaders who will show up. We need folks who aren’t afraid to come gather with the community and show up and listen and learn from what is on the minds and hearts of our members of the community, and so that’s why I’m running for Congress.”
Former Iowa House Minority Leader Jennifer Konfrst is also running to become the Democratic nominee for the seat.
In an interview with reporters following the event, Trone Garriott said if elected, she would have office hours or other time scheduled where constituents can come in to speak about their concerns with her or staff members.
“I think that’s incredibly important for any community leader to make sure getting your time in with your constituents — and not just the ones that you’re seeking out, but the ones who won’t come to you,” Trone Garriott said.

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)RAPID CITY — Jerry Schmitz is rarely at a loss for words about soybeans.
But when asked if farmers have faith in a good outcome from the Trump administration’s trade standoff with China, his gaze shifted and his brow creased momentarily as he thought about the best way to answer.
“Hope might be the better word over faith,” he said.
Schmitz, of rural Vermillion, is the executive director of the South Dakota Soybean Association and the South Dakota Soybean Checkoff. A checkoff is a fee that’s collected from soybean sales and used for research and promotion of the crop.
South Dakota governor’s economic advisers bemoan Trump’s tariff policy

During and after a roundtable discussion Saturday at the Central States Fairgrounds hosted by a nonprofit called Farmers for Free Trade, Schmitz expressed concerns about the effects of trade disputes on farmers.
About 60% of soybeans grown in South Dakota are exported, with China formerly buying about 30%, Schmitz said. China imports soybeans largely for livestock feed to meet the growing demand for meat among its 1.4 billion people.
Now the country is boycotting purchases of U.S. soybeans in retaliation for tariffs on Chinese goods imposed recently by Republican President Donald Trump.
“There is not a bushel sold to China right now, and we’re about to harvest,” Schmitz said.
Trump has said he’s wielding tariffs — taxes on imported goods — as a negotiating tool to correct trade imbalances with other countries.
The Chinese boycott has reduced demand for U.S. soybeans, which has influenced prices. Soybeans sold for about $10.50 per bushel one year ago in South Dakota, but are now $1 to $1.50 lower, and there are fears of further declines without a China trade deal.
Another participant in Saturday’s roundtable, South Dakota Republican Congressman Dusty Johnson, put the impact of lower prices in perspective. Noting that South Dakota farmers raise nearly 250 million bushels of soybeans annually, he said a price drop of $2 per bushel translates to a loss of $500 million.

Johnson said he’s spoken with the Trump administration’s U.S. trade representative about the importance of resolving the China trade dispute quickly.
“We need a deal sooner rather than later,” Johnson said, “because there is not an unlimited ability in farm country to be able to weather the storm.”
Johnson and Schmitz said farmers are planning to store some of the soybeans they’ll harvest this fall, in hopes of selling later at a higher price. Schmitz said grain elevators and soybean processors lacking buyers might have to store excess beans on the ground outside their facilities.
Both also stressed the long-term importance of finding additional buyers for U.S. soybeans. That could include developing better trade relationships with countries that have large populations and growing economies, such as India.
It could also include capitalizing on new domestic markets, such as the possibility of converting soybean oil into sustainable aviation fuel. A $500 million processing plant that will open this fall in Mitchell, for example, will process soybeans and other oilseed crops for uses in renewable fuel, food, livestock feed, lubricants and more.
Those efforts could reduce dependence on Chinese demand but aren’t likely to wholly replace it.
“Although we want to diversify away from China, you simply can’t ignore China,” Johnson said.

The congressman said many of the farmers he meets are “still backing the president’s play” to use tariffs in negotiations that could benefit agriculture in the future, but he said high tariffs “cannot be business as usual on a go-forward basis.”
“The president’s trying to use them as a tool to get better deals,” Johnson said. “I understand that approach, but we do not want to just end with high tariffs.”
The roundtable organizer, Farmers for Free Trade, is on a 14-state tour in an RV wrapped with pro-trade messaging. The group advocates for open markets and reduced trade barriers, said its executive director, Brian Kuehl, of Wyoming.
He referenced a statistic indicating exports account for 20% of the value of U.S. agricultural production.
“So if you were to lose all your exports, you’re going to lose farms, and you’re going to lose farmers. You’re going to lose rural America and rural communities,” Kuehl said.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_2788-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-07 15:56:30.893626

Wes Moore was back on a national Sunday talk show -- his third in as many weeks -- again denying that he is running for president and pushing back against President Donald Trump's threat to send federal troops into Baltimore to fight crime.,"Gov. Wes Moore on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday, when he talked about the economy, the president's threat to send federal troops into Baltimore and -- again -- his electoral plans. (Screengrab of NBC video)For a man who’s not running for president, Gov. Wes Moore sure has been making the rounds of the national Sunday talk shows recently. But there’s also been plenty to talk about, from vaccines to federal troop deployments.
Moore, appearing Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” would not say he would “completely rule it out,” when asked about a presidential bit, but he did repeat his oft-stated assertion that he is not running for president in 2028, and is focused instead on seeking reelection next year as governor of Maryland.
“I’ll be serving a full term. I’m excited about reelection. I’m excited about what I’m going to be able to do for the people of Maryland,” he said in response to a question from moderator Kristen Welker, before reciting a list of his administration’s accomplishments..
It was similar to the discussion he had two weeks earlier on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” when he volunteered that he is not running for president during a discussion of President Donald Trump saying Moore is not “presidential timber.” Moore’s residential aspirations did not come up on last week’s “This Week” on ABC — but he wasn’t directly asked about it.
What Moore has been asked about in each appearance was the president’s threat to send troops into Baltimore, among other cities, to respond to crime there.
Moore orders state police to assist Baltimore cops in crime reduction efforts

Moore — who on Friday announced a surge of Maryland State Police into the city to help further bring down crime rates — repeated his charge that Trump’s proposal would be “performative” and ineffective. He said Guard members are not trained for law enforcement and noted that those deployed last month to Washington, D.C., have been reduced in some instances to raking mulch and picking up trash, at what he said is an estimated cost of $1 million a day.
“You know, the president’s proposed budget actually cuts supports for the FBI and ATF [Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives] bureaus, which are things we actually could use,” Moore said. “When you’re looking at the Big Beautiful Bill, it actually cuts $30 million of funding for violence prevention programs that are happening in the city of Baltimore and across the state of Maryland.”
Trump has said that the presence of federal troops has led to a drop in crimes that have made the District a “safe zone.” D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has said that crime was already at historic lows already, but she recently credited the presence of federal troops with a further drop in crimes.
Moore acknowledged that crime is down in D.C., but said it has fallen just as fast, or faster, in Baltimore during the same time frame without federal intervention.
“If you’re looking at the same time period of this D.C. occupation … if you look at assaults with a deadly weapon, they’ve actually increased in D.C. by 8%; in Baltimore, have decreased by 10%,” he said. “And on every other major indicator, from homicide, to carjacking, you could say that Baltimore has actually had the same type of drop as Washington D.C. has had during this period. And we didn’t mobilize the National Guard for it.”
What Moore did do was announce plans Friday for a “renewed collaboration” between the Baltimore City Police Department and the Maryland State Police.
“We are proud of the progress that we’ve been able to make, and we’re all very, very concerned about how much work still needs to happen,” Moore said at the time, flanked by Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott and city and state police officials. “If one person does not feel safe in their neighborhood, that is one too many.”

(Photo by Dan Gross/Courtesy Miranda Spivack)Miranda Spivack is a familiar name in these parts. She’s a former Washington Post editor and reporter who covered Maryland politics, personalities, planning and perfidy, particularly in the Washington, D.C., suburbs, for 20 years. She was a top editor at the late, lamented Gazette Newspapers during its heady heyday in the 1990s, as it expanded from Montgomery County into Frederick, Prince George’s, and eventually, Southern Maryland.
She had a distinguished career as a national political and legal reporter before that. More recently, she has become a fierce advocate for open government and has mentored young journalists both internationally and in the U.S.
And – point of personal privilege – Miranda is the person who brought me to Maryland, hiring me in late 1995 to cover the State House for the Gazette. It’s fair to say that she’s had a lot to do with my own career trajectory over the past three decades.
Miranda recently published a book that is both fascinating and utterly sobering. It serves as a pointed reminder that while we’re forced to digest a firehose of crazy and unsettling news from the federal government, every single hour of every day, we cannot lose sight of what our state and local governments are doing – and what they’re not doing.

Miranda and I will be discussing her book, “Backroom Deals in Our Backyards: How Government Secrecy Harms Our Communities and the Local Heroes Fighting Back,” (published by The New Press), at 6 p.m. Tuesday, Sept. 9, at the invaluable People’s Book in Takoma Park. It’s one of many appearances she’s making around the country since her book was published in late spring – with more on tap.
“Backroom Deals in Our Backyards” is a look at the efforts of local and state governments to suppress vital information about public health and public safety, often in cahoots with big corporations – and the homegrown, accidental whistleblowers who strived to expose them and sound the alarm for their neighbors.
These are heroes in every sense of the word. Miranda tells five stories: One is about “forever chemicals” poisoning the water supply in Hoosick Falls, N.Y. Another is about a perpetually faulty sewer system in the “Black Belt” of Alabama. Another describes the protective uniforms coated by toxic chemicals that firefighters often wear. Another – the most chilling, in certain ways – reveals the secret algorithms that states often use to determine which incarcerated individuals can receive parole.
And Miranda recounts an episode that received a fair amount of attention in Maryland a few years ago, when parents at a high school in Bethesda tried desperately to pry safety studies from state officials about a dangerous intersection near the school on River Road. Only after a fatal crash at the intersection did the state begin to make data available and respond to residents’ cries for a traffic light.
The resistance these citizen activists encountered was sometimes bureaucratic and sometimes political – or a combination of the two. But the information they eventually were able to publicize was essential to the well-being of their communities, and brought about meaningful change.
In addition to these compelling stories, Miranda in the book lays out tips and resources for community activists looking for help in unearthing documents and other information that the government is withholding. It’s a valuable primer because so often whistleblowers are everyday citizens who don’t really know how to become activists and take on powerful interests.
Miranda and I will be talking about all her great reporting on Sept. 9. And because we’ve both spent a lot of time thinking about – and fighting against – the sharp decline in local news, I suspect that will be a topic as well. Chances are, some of these local governments wouldn’t have been able to suppress information from their citizenry if there had been robust media coverage of their day-to-day activities.
So come join Miranda and me for what is sure to be a lively and revealing conversation. People’s Book is at 7014-A Westmoreland Ave. in Takoma Park. If you can’t catch us there on Tuesday, Miranda will also be discussing her book on Sept. 10, at 7 p.m., at Redeemer Church in Bethesda.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)ST PETERSBURG- A crowd of around 75 people gathered in St. Petersburg on Saturday to strategize ways to persuade the police chiefs of Tampa and St. Petersburg to void partnership agreements with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) that they entered into earlier this year.
Legislation signed into law by Gov. Ron DeSantis requires that sheriffs or chief correctional officers operating a county detention facility must enter into a 287(g) agreement with ICE. That means that every county sheriff in the state needed to sign such an agreement this year, which they all have.
There is no requirement for municipalities to do the same, yet hundreds of police departments throughout the state have done so anyway. In the cases of Tampa and St. Petersburg, two of the largest cities in the state, those agreements were reached quietly earlier this year, without fanfare.
Now activists in the area say that they intend to persuade Tampa Police Chief Lee Bercaw and St. Petersburg Police Chief Anthony Holloway to cancel such agreements.
“In order to foster public trust and a positive relationship with the community, we ask you to cancel this heartless, inefficient 287(g) agreement before further harm is done,” read the form letters that attendees at the Allendale United Methodist Church in St. Petersburg were asked to send on Saturday to Bercaw and Holloway, as well as Tampa Mayor Jane Castor and St. Petersburg Mayor Ken Welch. The letters were accessed through a QR code listed on pamphlets distributed by organizers at the event.
Threats to be removed from office
Addressing the crowd, activist Karla Correa showed a picture of Florida Attorney James Uthmeier, who has threatened to remove city council members who have shown inclination not to sign such agreements.

“He’s saying, no, you have to do it or else I’m going to remove you from office,” said Correa, with the Tampa Bay area chapter of the Party of Socialism and Liberation.
“He is the attorney general for the state of Florida. He has a lot of power. And he’s going along with Ron DeSantis’ agenda, and we see whenever anyone tries to fight against it, again, they threaten to remove them from office. That’s what happened in Orlando. That’s what happened in Key West. That’s what happened in Fort Myers.”
The Key West City Commission voided its police department’s 287(g) after learning that their police chief had signed such an agreement without commissioners’ knowledge. After they did that, Uthmeier publicly declared that the action had made Key West a “sanctuary city,” which is banned in Florida law. Shortly thereafter, the commission reconvened and approved a new 287(g) agreement on a 4-2 vote.
A similar situation happened with the Pinellas County School District earlier this year, with the school superintendent and the school board apparently unaware that their chief of police had signed an agreement. Once that news was made public, the district backed away from the agreement.
“Did anyone know that Pinellas County schools signed a 287(g) agreement for a second?” Correa asked members of the crowd. “Because ICE shouldn’t be in schools. But you know what happened right after? There was a huge public outcry, right? Parents came out. Teachers came out. Community members who don’t even have kids came out to fight against this and to oppose it. And you know what they did? And you won’t hear DeSantis talk about this. They voided that agreement,” she said to cheers in the audience.
In addition to asking the mayors and police chiefs of the two cities to use their authority to cancel the agreements, the activists are calling on the St. Petersburg and Tampa city councils to pass resolutions condemning the 287(g) agreements. And they want the Tampa Human Rights Board to “begin an immediate and thorough investigation of Tampa PD’s 287(g) partnership.”
SPPD responds
St. Petersburg Police Chief Anthony Holloway provided a written statement to the Phoenix later on Saturday.
“To clarify, our department is not part of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE),” he said. “We assist ICE only when, during the course of a lawful encounter, an individual is identified as a suspect or subject in a criminal investigation. If it is determined that the individual has an active warrant, we are legally obligated to execute that warrant, whether it’s ICE-related or not, fairly and consistently. We are not seeking, nor do we receive, funding to support ICE operations.”

Oct. 5, 2023. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — A Nebraska state senator is taking the first steps toward pursuing impeachment proceedings against a University of Nebraska regent charged with driving drunk in a crash that caused serious injuries.
State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of Omaha confirmed Examiner reporting that she is exploring what the Nebraska Legislature needs to do to consider articles of impeachment against NU Regent Elizabeth O’Connor of Omaha.
Kauth confirmed Saturday that she has discussed her plans with the Governor’s Office and top legislative leadership.
“This is such a grotesque abuse of public trust that it needs to be addressed,” Kauth told the Nebraska Examiner on Saturday.

Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, who served as an NU regent between 2013 and 2023, including four years with O’Connor, told the Examiner that the charges against her are “extremely serious” while noting she remains innocent until proven guilty.
“If she knows the allegations against her to be true, I urge her to reflect on whether she should remain in a position of public trust,” Pillen said in a statement. “In any event, the question of impeachment is entrusted by our Constitution to the Legislature, and I respect the judgment of that body on this matter.”
‘Willing to start the proceedings’
Kauth is expected to announce her plans Sunday in her regular email to her constituents and supporters. Kauth is an influential lawmaker and committee chair, and her push marks the first legislative move toward removing O’Connor from office. Only the Legislature can do so if O’Connor doesn’t resign.
Authorities allege that O’Connor had a blood alcohol concentration of four times the legal limit, or 0.321%, at the time of a May 21 crash in Omaha’s Benson neighborhood in O’Connor’s district.

Kauth noted that a criminal trial could take time to resolve and said the Legislature should act now because lawmakers do not condone what O’Connor’s alleged actions. Kauth said no one is above the law and that elected officials must be held to the highest standards.
Kauth added she is “appalled” that O’Connor has not resigned or made any indication she would resign for allegations Kauth called “absolutely inexcusable.” The senator called resigning the “honorable choice.”
“I’m willing to start the proceedings so we can make sure that at some point in time she is no longer representing the university,” Kauth said.
Impact of a felony charge
O’Connor, reelected in November to a second six-year term, has pleaded not guilty. Neither O’Connor nor her attorney had an immediate comment Saturday.
“My attorney has advised me of my rights, including the right to a jury trial; my right to confront accusers; to subpoena witnesses; to remain silent; to counsel; … and my right to be presumed innocent unless proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt,” O’Connor said in a May 28 filing in Douglas County District Court.
NU regent faces felony DUI charge from crash that could jeopardize her office

O’Connor, 35, is charged with one Class IIIA felony alleging that she drove under the influence and caused serious injury. A passenger in the opposing car suffered a broken back and pelvis, according to police and court records. Four others were in that car, including three young children. Both cars were totaled.
The father of the children injured in the crash started an online petition in recent weeks calling for O’Connor to lose her law license and resign as a regent after details of the case became public. As of Saturday, the petition had gathered nearly 800 signatures.
“These actions will not only hold her accountable but also serve as a firm reminder that such behavior is unacceptable for someone in her position,” the petition states.
Prosecutors filed charges against O’Connor July 30. Investigators transferred the case from the Douglas County Attorney’s Office, which normally handles felony charges, to the Omaha City Prosecutor’s Office because O’Connor, until early August, had worked as a deputy county attorney.
Impact of a felony
O’Connor and her attorney have yet to publicly discuss her fate as a regent. She has continued attending board meetings, including in June to approve the university’s budget. 
NU campuses are considering more than $40 million in cuts. Regents are set to vote on the reductions package by the end of the year.

Under the Nebraska Constitution, someone convicted of a felony cannot hold public office. Constitutional officers can only be removed from office via legislative impeachment if they don’t resign.
If the Legislature impeaches O’Connor or she resigns, Pillen would choose her successor.
Speaker John Arch of La Vista had no immediate comment.
Impeachment steps
The Legislature can impeach an officeholder via a legislative resolution, which can be brought during a regular or special session. In the past, such resolutions have always followed a legislative investigation.
Past investigations have followed the formation of a special investigatory committee, a designated group of lawmakers who would investigate the incident and recommend whether to impeach a state official. Legislative rules require such a committee to be established during a legislative session, yet the committee could work only while lawmakers are out of session.
Lawmakers adjourned in June for the year and are not set to return until January.

Another option: An existing legislative committee with jurisdiction — possibly the Government, Military and Veterans Affairs Committee — could hold a public hearing on whether to pursue a legislative investigation. Both approaches could have subpoena power.
It would take 25 legislative votes to impeach, a simple majority. Nothing would prevent Kauth or another lawmaker from pursuing a vote for impeachment without first pursuing an investigation, but the Nebraska Supreme Court requires “clear and convincing” legislative evidence to convict on articles of impeachment.
Nebraska’s 49-member Legislature, which is officially nonpartisan, has 33 registered Republicans, 15 Democrats and one nonpartisan progressive.
If the Legislature impeaches a state official, that person is barred from performing official duties until the state’s high court weighs in. At least five of seven justices would need to agree.
The Nebraska Legislature last impeached a state official in 2006. Lawmakers passed 10 articles of impeachment against then-NU Regent C. David Hergert related to alleged campaign finance violations by a 25-22 vote. Six Supreme Court justices convicted Hergert, removing and disqualifying him from public office.
‘Second chances’
O’Connor was elected in 2018 as the youngest regent ever, at 28 years old, and as one of just a handful of women to serve. She is a former University of Nebraska at Omaha student regent.
Regent Barbara Weitz of Omaha has defended O’Connor, saying the regent “takes responsibility for making a bad choice, but she’s also doing everything she can to make it right.” Weitz has described O’Connor as an “outstanding” regent who has NU’s best interests in mind.
“Of all the people I know who deserve second chances, she tops the list,” Weitz said previously.

The NU Board of Regents is officially nonpartisan but consists of 6 registered Republicans and 2 Democrats. Weitz and O’Connor are Democrats. Kauth and Pillen are Republicans.
Regents most often vote as one, and over the past seven years, across hundreds of votes, the board split 6-2 along party lines once. That was in April, when the regents amended NU bylaws to try to comply with an order from President Donald Trump’s administration against higher education diversity, equity and inclusion policies. Weitz and O’Connor opposed the changes.
Message of continued service
Kauth said O’Connor’s continued service risks an appearance that elected officials get a “free pass.” She said she is also concerned about the message to college students, that if they get drunk, “blitzed out of your mind and nearly kill someone” it could be seen as “no big deal.”
She said no state lawmaker believes a drunken driver should have more rights than injured victims facing a “cascading effect” of trauma, Kauth said. The senator said she would call for a Republican to resign if facing similar charges.
“Everyone has hard times,” Kauth said. “It does not excuse anyone from drinking and getting in a car, period.”

ONEONTA — The names echoed down the halls of the Blount County courthouse Thursday morning like a child’s game of telephone.
“Darlene?”
One of the county commissioners was reading from a list of those who’d asked to speak at a public meeting concerning the potential approval of a medical waste treatment facility in nearby Remlap.
“Darlene,” a resident at the back of the room repeated to those outside. Community members opposed to the new facility, proposed by Harvest Med Waste Disposal, wouldn’t all fit in the boardroom where commission meetings are typically held. They also lined the hallways of the courthouse nearly to the building’s exit. One court employee said they’d never seen the facility packed with as many citizens. The woman’s name continued down the line.

“Darlene,” someone further outside repeated. “Darlene,” a final resident echoed.
One by one, community members from all walks of life—business owners, environmentalists, nurses, college professors, healthcare experts and retirees—made their way to the podium to tell their local elected officials in no uncertain terms: Remlap, Alabama, population 2,500, isn’t a dumping ground.
Those living and working in and around Remlap, about 20 miles northeast of Birmingham, have rallied in opposition to Harvest Med Waste Disposal’s proposed medical waste processing facility on Highway 75, a stone’s throw from the Jefferson County line. The enterprise, to be housed in a former tire shop, would sit just feet from Gurley Creek, part of the Black Warrior River watershed, and is located within a FEMA-designated flood zone, according to government documents.

Residents have been vocal in opposing the facility opening in Remlap, citing environmental and safety concerns. David Dyer, owner of Harvest Med Waste, has said many community members’ concerns are unwarranted. His company, he argued at Thursday’s commission meeting, will provide needed jobs in Blount County and bring a safe, environmentally friendly technology—ozone sterilization of medical waste—to Alabama for the first time.
While supporters at Thursday’s meeting included only Dyer’s lawyers, friends and business associates, Blount County residents have found themselves the targets of paid social media advertising in support of Harvest Med Waste, though it’s unclear who is behind the online campaign.
Both Dyer and a representative of Clean Waste Systems, a national company responsible for the sterilization technology Dyer’s facility plans to use, denied involvement with the advertising to an Inside Climate News reporter on Thursday.
“I’m not even on social media,” Dyer said.

Mountains of medical waste

Medical waste management is a more than $2 billion industry in the U.S., according to market analysts, and is projected to grow to over $3 billion by 2030. The Centers for Disease Control estimated that U.S. health care providers generate more than 3 million tons of such waste each year, including everything from used syringes and gauze to contaminated gloves and other personal protective equipment.
All that waste must go somewhere. Historically, incineration has been the primary method of disposal. More than 90 percent of potentially infectious medical waste was incinerated before 1997, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
Since that time, other technologies have helped fill the need for medical waste disposal, including the use of autoclaves—machines that use pressurized steam to treat waste—and other sterilization technologies.
In the last decade, ozone sterilization has also become a growing technology, with proponents arguing that the method provides an environmentally friendly alternative to incineration, for example.
Clean Waste Systems, based in Maple Lake, Minnesota, is slated to provide the ozone sterilization technology for Dyer’s Remlap facility, pending its approval. The company uses a technology called “humidizone” to sterilize shredded medical waste, which can then be trucked to a run-of-the-mill landfill for disposal.
Kelly Prchal, CEO of Clean Waste Systems, was one of the handful of supporters of the project to speak during Thursday’s meeting.
“I want to clarify some misinformation,” Prchal told commissioners. Residents in the audience groaned. “Our system is fully enclosed, contained and designed to meet and exceed all federal and state environmental standards,” she said.
Many of the concerns expressed on Thursday weren’t about the sterilization process itself, but instead involved the location of the facility and the risks imposed by trucking of medical waste material into and out of Remlap.

Warren Allworth, a nearby resident who moved to the area from South Africa, cited frequent traffic accidents in the area as a concern.
“Anyone who’s ever driven in Alabama knows that people don’t know how to drive,” he said. The audience laughed. “I love y’all, but it’s the truth.”
When there was a recent traffic accident at the Dollar General across from the proposed site, he said, the truck involved remained in the ditch for days before it was removed.
“I dread the day it’s one of his trucks,” Allworth said, referring to Dyer.
Dale Spain, another resident, lives a few hundred yards from the development site along Gurley Creek. He’s now retired, having worked for UPS for more than 40 years. During that time, he said, he witnessed many, large scale accidents that left hazardous materials scattered along roadways.
“If there is an accident, which there will be, you’re putting all of the first responders at risk, all of the bystanders, all of the people trying to help. And if it’s a bad wreck, this stuff will be scattered everywhere, and they’ll have no clue how to deal with it. Bringing that in and through Blount County isn’t the right place to go.”
Paul Gilbert, who serves as chief of Remlap Fire and EMS, would be one of the first to respond if an accident involving a truck with medical waste were to occur. He said his greatest concern is the sheer amount of potentially hazardous material involved.
“They can do 400 pounds of medical waste an hour,” he said. “If you work an eight-hour shift, that’s 3,200 pounds of biohazardous medical waste. If you work a 40-hour week, that’s 16,000 pounds of biohazardous medical waste.”
Jim Braziel, an associate professor of English at the University of Alabama at Birmingham who lives in Remlap, put it simply: “We don’t want to be a dump for the surrounding counties,” he said. “We don’t want to be the processor for these materials for the surrounding counties or the state of Alabama or the world.”
Braziel and his wife, Tina Mozelle Braziel, a renowned poet who also spoke at Thursday’s meeting, built a glass cabin in Blount County by hand and wrote a book about the process.
At the end of his comments Thursday, Braziel addressed Dyer directly.
“We don’t want your facility here,” he said. “So why do you want to come here? Go somewhere else.”
Residents and environmental groups have also said that the facility’s location aside Gurley Creek, in a flood zone, poses unnecessary risks.
“An individual from Birmingham is planning to put a medical waste processing facility in South Blount County,” an environmental nonprofit, Friends of the Locust Fork River, said in a statement ahead of Thursday’s meeting. “The waste is billed as non-hazardous in the application for permit, but FLFR believes that medical waste picked up at hospitals, doctor’s offices, etc. and transported to Remlap is hazardous waste…a bio-hazard.”
Locating the processing facility next to Gurley Creek, then, puts the watershed at risk, the nonprofit argued.
“If a catastrophic flood should occur affecting the facility, the endangered Flattened Musk Turtle and Black Warrior Waterdog habitat could be greatly altered in a negative way,” the nonprofit’s statement went on. “If toxic waste enters the creek, the threatened Gurley Darter found only in that creek would be wiped off the face of the earth forever. FLFR believes the facility location is a stage for an accident waiting to happen.”
In his comments during the meeting, Dyer dismissed concerns about potential harm to the environment.
“The creek’s a non-issue,” Dyer said. “Why in the world would I invest millions of dollars if I was worried about flooding a creek where I’d be sued to the end of time and probably put in prison if I was dumping into a creek?”

An online mystery

Thursday’s county commission meeting hasn’t been the only venue for debate over the Remlap facility. An online petition opposing the facility has garnered hundreds of signatures, and residents have said they’ve been subjected to constant online advertising advocating for the business.
A Facebook page called “Blount County for Safe Waste Solutions” has run multiple paid advertisements related to the project and the underlying technology, according to records reviewed by Inside Climate News.
The page, launched in August, has run at least three paid advertisements in the days leading up to Thursday’s meeting.
“Being a good neighbor always matters. That’s why Clean Waste Systems are small, safe, and designed to blend right in with the community or facility in which they’re located,” one paid post said, in part. “People living or working nearby ozone processing facilities often don’t even know the system is operating, but they feel the benefit of cleaner, safer, sustainable waste management through a smaller carbon footprint.”
According to Facebook records, the person or group responsible for the page hasn’t yet completed the company’s identity verification process. A message sent to the page by an Inside Climate News reporter went unanswered.
Both Dyer and Prchal denied any involvement with the online advertising on Thursday.

‘We will fight’

After Thursday’s meeting, Mike D’Angelo, a local business owner, sat outside his business, located just a few yards from Gurley Creek and the proposed facility. He’s lived in Remlap for more than 50 years. For him, preventing the new development is about protecting a waterway that’s been a part of his life for decades. He said he’s watched the area flood many times over the years, with Gurley Creek’s waters lapping at the walls of the proposed treatment facility, which is visible from his business’ front door.
“My grandchildren play in that creek,” he said Thursday morning. “I’d like to keep it clean so they can continue to.”
D’Angelo and other residents present at the meeting said they don’t plan to back down in their opposition to the project, regardless of the commission’s ultimate decision when they vote on Oct. 2.
“We’re not going anywhere,” he said, his eyes glancing over at Gurley Creek. “We will fight.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Blount-County-Commission-for-Sept-7-2025-story-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-07 08:57:22.504231

But still undercovered in the 20th anniversary saga of the storm that made landfall on Aug. 29, 2005, and caused unprecedented destruction is the role that a worm farmer from northeast Mississippi played in helping to revitalize the Coast.
House Speaker Billy McCoy, who died in 2019, was a worm farmer from the Prentiss, not Alcorn County, side of Rienzi — about as far away from the Gulf Coast as one could be in Mississippi.
McCoy grew other crops, but a staple of his operations was worm farming. 
Early after the storm, the House speaker made a point of touring the Coast and visiting as many of the House members who lived on the Coast as he could to check on them.
But it was his action in the forum he loved the most — the Mississippi House — that is credited with being key to the Coast’s recovery.
Gov. Haley Barbour had called a special session about a month after the storm to take up multiple issues related to Katrina and the Gulf Coast’s survival and revitalization. The issue that received the most attention was Barbour’s proposal to remove the requirement that the casinos on the Coast be floating in the Mississippi Sound.
Katrina wreaked havoc on the floating casinos, and many operators said they would not rebuild if their casinos had to be in the Gulf waters. That was a crucial issue since the casinos were a major economic engine on the Coast, employing an estimated 30,000 in direct and indirect jobs.
It is difficult to fathom now the controversy surrounding Barbour’s proposal to allow the casinos to locate on land next to the water. Mississippi’s casino industry that was birthed with the early 1990s legislation was still new and controversial.
Various religious groups and others had continued to fight and oppose the casino industry and had made opposition to the expansion of gambling a priority.
Opposition to casinos and expansion of casinos was believed to be especially strong in rural areas, like those found in McCoy’s beloved northeast Mississippi. It was many of those rural areas that were the homes to rural white Democrats — now all but extinct in the Legislature but at the time still a force in the House.
So, voting in favor of casino expansion had the potential of being costly for what was McCoy’s base of power: the rural white Democrats.
Couple that with the fact that the Democratic-controlled House had been at odds with the Republican Barbour on multiple issues ranging from education funding to health care since Barbour was inaugurated in January 2004.
Barbour set records for the number of special sessions called by the governor. Those special sessions often were called to try to force the Democratic-controlled House to pass legislation it killed during the regular session.
The September 2005 special session was Barbour’s fifth of the year. For context, current Gov. Tate Reeves has called four in his nearly six years as governor.
There was little reason to expect McCoy to do Barbour’s bidding and lead the effort in the Legislature to pass his most controversial proposal: expanding casino gambling.
But when Barbour ally Lt. Gov. Amy Tuck, who presided over the Senate, refused to take up the controversial bill, Barbour was forced to turn to McCoy.
The former governor wrote about the circumstances in an essay he penned on the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina for Mississippi Today Ideas.
“The Senate leadership, all Republicans, did not want to go first in passing the onshore casino law,” Barbour wrote. “So, I had to ask Speaker McCoy to allow it to come to the House floor and pass. He realized he should put the Coast and the state’s interests first. He did so, and the bill passed 61-53, with McCoy voting no.
“I will always admire Speaker McCoy, often my nemesis, for his integrity in putting the state first.”
Incidentally, former Rep. Bill Miles of Fulton, also in northeast Mississippi, was tasked by McCoy with counting, not whipping votes, to see if there was enough support in the House to pass the proposal. Not soon before the key vote, Miles said years later, he went to McCoy and told him there were more than enough votes to pass the legislation so he was voting no and broached the idea of the speaker also voting no.
It is likely that McCoy would have voted for the bill if his vote was needed.
Despite his no vote, the Biloxi Sun Herald newspaper ran a large photo of McCoy and hailed the Rienzi worm farmer as a hero for the Mississippi Gulf Coast.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/04132613/AP100118024007.jpg,,,2025-09-07 08:57:22.504231

To live in the moment — to use our senses to ingest our surroundings and find an appreciation for every small felicity, in spite of our challenges — can be, for many, the only worthy purpose of life. For others, fulfillment is found in the promise of posterity. And for a third type, such as this week’s featured writer, Oliver Ellis of Belmont, happiness comes from straddling the two worlds: Experiencing new emotions, discovering new convictions through the process of committing them to the eternal page.
A young poet’s manifesto
Oliver Ellis, 14, Belmont
Anyone
can be a poet.
Anyone
can use their gift.
Anyone
can take a handful of words 
and make someone laugh with them.
The pen is my trigger,
the words my recipe – 
for tears,
for smiles,
for love,
and               
for hate too.
A pen is a search engine
without a filter,
and somehow it seems to know
what your weak spots are.
And every day – every single day – 
I pick up that pen and write. I write all the time, because   
someday there will be nothing left.
I use my words as an
excuse.
An alibi.
It’s who I am.
A conscientious
objector to    
conforming
and
being just like
everyone else.
     I think we need more words. Because at the end of the day, what else will be left? Not our silly paper money, that’s for sure. Not our fancy cars, not our mansions. Not our strict laws or closed-minded biases. 
     But I have a notion that our words and our emotions will always be, as a reminder of what’s at stake in this world: nothing and everything.

Many Democrats are calling for a ban on assault rifles and high-capacity magazines, like those used by the shooter at Annunciation and in countless other mass shootings. These firearms, dubbed “assault weapons” for their military-style design and lethality, were banned federally from 1994 to 2004, but states have since been left to their own devices to figure out their own legislation on assault weapons.
Republican lawmakers have largely rejected the focus on guns, instead proposing increased funding for school security and mental health treatment.
Gov. Tim Walz, in announcing his intention to call a special session, said the public is with Democrats on gun control and Republicans risked public backlash by voting against it.
“If you ask the public about an assault weapon ban, it polls at about 80%. So if you want to go to the next election against the public here when we had an opportunity to do something about this, then I leave that to you,” Walz said.
Banning assault weapons only polls that high with Democrats, but past polls show it does have support from a majority of Minnesotans. So do other gun control policies like requirements for universal background checks, which passed in 2023, and, according to this year’s informal State Fair poll, banning guns in the Capitol with nearly 80% support.
Here’s what past opinion polls found about how Minnesotans and Americans overall feel about gun control.
54% of Minnesotans in 2022 strongly or somewhat favored banning assault weapons




Nearly half of surveyed Minnesotans strongly favored banning assault weapons in a 2022 MinnPost poll conducted with Change Research. An additional 7% said they somewhat favored banning assault weapons. That’s slightly less than the nation as a whole, according to a 2023 Pew Research poll.
That result is roughly in line with an older poll from the Star Tribune, which found that 58% of Minnesotans were in favor of banning assault weapons in 2019.
The MinnPost poll responses varied widely by party affiliation, with 86% of Democrats saying they strongly favored a ban compared to 11% of Republicans. Opinions on high-capacity magazines were similar.


In the same poll, a majority of Minnesotans said that they thought gun laws should be stricter, while only 16% said that gun laws should be less strict.
The 2022 poll had 1,551 respondents and was weighted to better reflect Minnesota’s demographics in age, gender, ethnicity, 2020 vote and region, according to the MinnPost article reporting the results.
The same percentage of Minnesotans in 2023 supported changes to statewide gun safety laws
A different poll in 2023 found that over half of Minnesotans supported changes to gun safety laws. The poll was published by two gun violence prevention nonprofits, Giffords and Protect Minnesota, and executed by Expedition Strategies, an opinion research company.
That poll of 1,300 respondents also showed that the majority of Minnesotans across political affiliations supported the red flag law and universal background check requirement that were  passed in Minnesota in 2023.
None of these Minnesota-specific polls in recent years asked voters their thoughts on firearm safe storage laws, which were passed in the House but never came up for vote in the Senate. A nationwide poll by APM Research Lab found that nearly 8 in 10 Americans supported mandating locked gun storage in 2019, which included 68% of Republicans and 88% of Democrats polled.
(Last year’s State Fair poll found that nearly 7 in 10 respondents supported mandating locked and unloaded gun storage.)
A majority of Americans in 2023 thought it was too easy to obtain a gun


A notebook in a YouTube video believed to be made by the Annunciation Church shooter said it was “shockingly easy” to buy a gun, the Star Tribune reported.
The majority of Americans agree. In a 2023 Pew Research poll, around 6 in 10 Americans said that it’s too easy to legally purchase a gun.
The answer varies widely by party affiliation, with 86% of Democrats and Democrat-leaning respondents saying it’s too easy to purchase a gun. Only 34% of Republicans and Republican-leaning respondents agreed.

Mike Rounds, R-South Dakota, speaks at Dakotafest in Mitchell on Aug. 20, 2025. (Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)On July 21, President Donald Trump wholeheartedly endorsed South Dakota’s junior Republican senator, Mike Rounds, in the lawmaker’s quest for a third term in 2026.
But at what cost for Rounds?
Despite calling the senator a “jerk” some years ago and vowing never to support him (because he called the 2020 election “fair”), the president in July praised Rounds, in a 180-degree turnaround, as an “incredibly strong advocate for the wonderful people of South Dakota” and said he was giving Rounds a “complete and total endorsement for re-election—HE WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN!”
What a difference several years can make.
For Rounds’ reelection campaign, the direct support of the authoritarian-minded leader of his party and the nation, and of the free world, was extremely valuable — even critical.
“With Trump’s endorsement, Rounds will be a clear favorite to win reelection next year in the solidly conservative-leaning state,” according to The Hill, a leading political news source in the U.S. capital.
Rounds wins Trump endorsement after playing deal-making role in rescinding public media funds

However, as with many interactions with Trump, it was more transactional than genuinely moral or fairly reciprocal. A deal, in other words. But a very bad deal for rural Americans, it turns out.
For the president’s end of the deal, he wanted Rounds to vote “yes” in the Senate on a bill to cut $9 billion in previously congressionally approved funding that included $1.1 billion for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The bill, which ultimately passed with Rounds’ support, removed all federal financial support for NPR, PBS and their member stations — and roughly $8 billion in foreign aid.
Trump signed an executive order in May demanding the cuts to the corporation, whose PBS and NPR outlets he has for years controversially complained have been spreading political and cultural views he disagrees with. Congress approved the cuts in July, and the corporation — “a cornerstone of American culture for three generations,” PBS fairly noted — was thus forced to shutter.
Initially, Rounds had expressed reservations concerning Trump’s desire to cancel the funding, but decided to support the executive action after announcing that he’d negotiated a deal with the administration to transfer $9.4 million of federal funding to some two dozen Native American radio stations in several states that depend on the subsidies for their survival. Indigenous South Dakotans are a key Rounds political constituency, comprising 78,000 people, about 9% of the state’s approximately 900,000 residents, many of them members of nine federally recognized tribes.
On his website, Rounds explained: “In order for me to support this legislation, we had to find a way to continue support for these radio stations which offer potentially life-saving information in some of the most rural parts of our nation. These stations play a vital role in South Dakota, delivering critical emergency alerts and public safety information, and they needed to be protected.
“… With nearly $37 trillion in federal debt, we must preserve essential services but also take meaningful steps to reduce wasteful spending. As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I will continue working to both rescind unnecessary spending and preserve funding for tribal radio in future appropriations bills.”

All well and good. But what about all the other Native (and non-Native) citizens throughout rural America? What about their public TV/radio stations — hundreds of them — that are presumably as critical for their communities and as deserving of federal support as those serving Indigenous South Dakotans?
Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who voted against the cuts, stressed that “more targeted” means exist to address any alleged bias at PBS and NPR other than cutting all funding, in effect throwing the baby out with the bathwater. It could also be fairly argued that PBS and NPR have long been renowned for fair, balanced reporting and programming, though they arguably lean liberal.
In a perfect world, Rounds would have ultimately voted “no” to the cuts, thus tanking Trump’s biased, mean-spirited executive order that will disadvantage millions of rural Americans. As it was, Vice President J.D. Vance had to deliver the tie-breaking vote to begin debate on the bill when Sens. Collins, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky each voted “no.”
If Rounds had joined those colleagues on their moral high ground, now-doomed PBS and NPR stations might have survived to serve the underserved another day.
But he regrettably chose self-interest over self-respect — reelection over uprightness.

THE PRIMARY CARE CRISIS in Massachusetts and the nation is omnipresent. Primary care providers—physicians, nurse practitioners, physician associates—are burning out in record numbers. According to the Massachusetts Health Policy Commission, lower-income residents “are most likely to have no primary care use” because of staff shortages and other barriers. Ad[...]","THE PRIMARY CARE CRISIS in Massachusetts and the nation is omnipresent. Primary care providers—physicians, nurse practitioners, physician associates—are burning out in record numbers. According to the Massachusetts Health Policy Commission, lower-income residents “are most likely to have no primary care use” because of staff shortages and other barriers. Administrative burdens plague primary care practice, and pay is much lower compared with specialty providers. These obstacles discourage current clinicians from staying and new ones from joining. Community health centers, the respected bastion of primary care, experience these trends at even worse rates.  
The crisis caught the attention of Gov. Maura Healey in her January State of the State address, in which she called out the issue for special attention. “I am directing my administration to shift health care resources to the front lines. And by that I mean primary care,” she said. “We’ll drive career training pipelines to grow the workforce. I want a whole army of primary care providers out there, so when you call for an appointment, you’ll get one. You’ll get the affordable care you need, where and when you need it.”  
Just weeks before her speech, the governor signed a health market reform bill that established a 25-member Primary Care Access, Delivery and Payment Task Force to recommend steps to stabilize and strengthen primary care statewide, with a September deadline for their initial recommendations. 
Given these challenges, one might expect that a new plan from CVS Health and Mass General Brigham to launch expanded primary care services at 37 CVS “Minute Clinics” across the state might help. In early June, each filed similar and separate applications for plan approval from the Health Policy Commission to launch the initiative. 
At this point, essential details are too sketchy to endorse or reject the proposal. While the need is too great to dismiss the idea out of hand, their plan is missing answers to key finance, operational, and workforce questions. One thing is certain — the CVS-MGB plan needs close scrutiny.
The plan must be considered in the context of the state’s primary care task force and its emerging vision for a reformed primary care system. We hope that the Health Policy Commission digs deeply into key questions and votes to perform a detailed cost and market impact review, which could happen as soon as later this month, with a finalized report to follow before the year’s end or more likely early 2026.
Mass General Brigham, the state’s leading mega-medical care provider, has a disappointing recent history in primary care. This past May, MGB leaders announced a $400 million five-year non-specific investment to bolster their own primary care system. Without details, it stands as a guilty plea to their underinvestment. What is the connection between this “investment” and the CVS-MGB plan? Your guess is as good as ours. 
More evidence of neglect came from MGB’s primary care physicians who voted 183-26 in late May to unionize. Certification of their election has been delayed by President Trump and Senate Republicans’ slow-walking appointments to fill vacancies on the National Labor Relations Board. Absent new appointees, no union elections can be certified. MGB also has filed election challenges that are familiar tactics of union busters.
More than MGB, CVS Health appears to be the lead driver here, seeking to re-energize their 20-year lackluster urgent care business named “MinuteClinics.” Competitors Walmart and Walgreens abandoned or scaled back their own failed retail clinic operations. 
CVS is now pushing a national corporate turnaround strategy by establishing hospital/medical center affiliations with their clinics in 26 states plus rolling out an enhanced MGB-style primary care model in nine of them, now including Massachusetts. CVS Health, also owner of insurer giant Aetna, fired its CEO, Karen Lynch, in 2024 for unsatisfactory profits and briefly considered splitting the company apart. The MGB affiliation is but one part of their aggressive strategy to regain high profits for their disappointed shareholders.
While nurse practitioners are a huge and growing part of the primary care workforce, the most successful primary care models use them as part of onsite teams that includes physicians. The CVS-MGB plan would keep them solo, with broader clinical duties and physician support only on call. Primary care physicians with whom we spoke see this primarily as a recipe for unneeded specialty and ancillary service referrals to MGB along with nurse practitioner burnout. 
Also concerning are financial implications of this plan. Nurse practitioners would join the CVS-MGB network in CVS facilities as MinuteClinic employees. They will make referrals to MGB providers for specialty care, labs, and imaging plus hospital services.
MGB intends to include these clinics in their managed care contracts as part of its Accountable Care Organization.  While their hope will be to reduce emergency department utilization and costs, those savings could be swamped by new revenues resulting from high priced referrals to MGB specialists and facilities for additional care and ancillary services. 
On its face, this seems to be a high-priced money winner for both CVS Health and MGB.  
The Health Policy Commission should explore the spending implications for 120,000 patients projected in this new arrangement. Should reimbursement rates for commercially insured patients referred by CVS be capped to mitigate pressures to raise premiums that will result as MGB gains market share from this new partnership. Would this scheme weaken MGB competitors who rely on these referrals and will lose market share?
On the flip side, while members of the state’s primary care task force are exploring big systemic changes to set a new long-term future for primary care in Massachusetts, their model likely will require legislative action that could take years to enact and to implement. Meanwhile, too many patients are desperate for primary care services now. The CVS-MGB initiative, while not close to an overall solution, might help some patients who feel the full brunt of the primary care crisis. 
Much more needs to be revealed in the Health Policy Commission review process. Marginal, short-term gains in primary care access should not come at the expense of making the whole system more expensive and less stable. Yet, a long-term solution should not halt viable incremental improvements that may improve care for patients and consumers badly served by today’s structure. Since most observers agree that primary care suffers from severe underinvestment, should we reject a proposal that would make such an investment? A seemingly simple proposal quickly becomes much more complicated.
As so often is the case in Massachusetts health policy, the wisest voice in the room is that of Sen. Cindy Friedman, co-chair of the Legislature’s Joint Committee on Health Care Financing as well as a member of the primary care task force. She told us: “The notion that this is primary care is disturbing to me because primary care is comprehensive and collaborative. … How do you do that in a MinuteClinic in a CVS? … It presents a false narrative of what primary care needs to be.” Referring to MGB, she added, “If you have $400 million to spend, how about scholarships or loan forgiveness or expanding residency programs triple fold?”
Meanwhile, if MGB president and CEO Anne Klibanski wants to demonstrate interest in improving and upgrading primary care in her own system, she could begin tomorrow morning by recognizing the union that 88% of her primary care physicians voted for last May. That would be a solid signal and a good step forward. How about it, Anne?

The community oven was first lit in late October 2017, built in an effort led by former legislator and selectboard member Mark Woodward and librarian Jen Burton.

This story by Aaron Calvin was first published in the News & Citizen on Sept. 4
On the Thursday before Labor Day, the town of Johnson gathered around its community oven.
This has been a regular occurrence at Legion Field on School Street for nearly eight years and has expanded to include Halloween bakes and “skate and bakes” in the winter, when an ice rink is set up in the park. Members of the town’s community oven committee, many of whom have been involved since the oven’s inception, pull a pie out of the stone column’s fiery maw — sometimes it’s a classic cheese pie, sometimes a custom creation — and place it before a crowd that devours each slice.
Thursday’s affair was like many of the bakes that had gone before it, but more so. There were the usual pickup soccer games, but this time they were led by athletes from Vermont State University’s Johnson campus. Hardwick’s Kingdom Creamery was selling ice cream and a raffle raised $268 for the Johnson Food Shelf. There were Charcuterie boards adorned with meat and cheese from the Johnson General Store. At a set of grills next to the oven, Jesse Whitworth grilled hamburgers and portobello mushrooms, the fragrance of which mingled with the sound of live music; all 90 burgers were gone by the end of the night.
The community oven was first lit in late October 2017, built in an effort led by former legislator and selectboard member Mark Woodward and librarian Jen Burton. Jasmine Yuris, who now chairs the community oven committee, was there at the beginning, as was Sophia Berard, who was shaping the dough before handing it to her husband, Luke Gellatly, who knows the temperament of the oven well enough to produce pies consistently with a chewy, char-kissed crust.
Yuris remembered the early conversations around building a community oven, following the example of other towns in Vermont.
“How can we make food access something that everyone experiences, rather than this idea of charity, which is just for people who need it? We all need it and deserve it,” she said.
The oven cost $8,000 to build eight years ago and has likely produced well over that amount in free meals since then. In classic Vermont fashion, it’s built upon remnants of the past — some of its stones were once part of a former talc mill in the town, according to Seven Days.
Even as the work of the oven appears straightforward, the labor and logistics required to put on the community bakes is challenging. Yuris made the dough used in the bakes in her own home the first few years before securing dough from Elmore Mountain Bread — Berard worked there as a baker before becoming a therapist. This year, for the first time in the oven’s history, they’ve used actual pizza dough. Gellatly makes the sauce with water from Johnson’s cold spring. Toppings and salad ingredients are sourced from Morrisville nonprofit Salvation Farms or purchased locally at Foote Brook Farm.
Other than the occasional repair to its stone edifice, the oven has not changed much since it was built, but the oven committee mission has evolved over the years. In the early phase of social distancing during the Covid pandemic, volunteers donned masks and gloves, and the oven became a takeout spot.
After the flood of July 2023, the oven provided free food to the community in the wake of the devastation, while pizzas were packed up and sent to the selectboard as it worked through the response. When a less damaging flood hit a year later, the committee considered calling off the bake scheduled for that week, but pressed ahead.
“I remember that was more of a question of, like, we’ve all been through this before. Is this too traumatic for us to still hold this thing and continue?” Yuris recalled. “But it all comes back to everybody’s got to eat, and it’s better to eat together, especially on a day like that, so we just continued and did the thing.”
The expanded bake night held last week was a combined effort between the oven committee and the nascent food access task force, one of several ad hoc groups formed in the wake of last year’s “Reimagine Johnson” effort, coordinated by the Vermont Council on Rural Development in effort to address the challenges the town faced after repeated flooding.

After a successful community dinner hosted at the Vermont Studio Center, the task force looked to hold an August event to benefit the Johnson food shelf, which has seen increased need over the summer after serving over 300 people in July alone, according to board member Diane Suter. Hampered by the fact that, unlike the oven committee, the task force is not an entity formally associated with the municipal government, the decision was made to expand the final bake of the summer for the benefit of the food shelf.
“We’re trying to be additive,” Whitworth said.
The task force and oven committee already share members and have similar missions. Yuris, who serves on both, said that, amid the town’s effort to consolidate the groups, she hopes to see a new food access committee take over and expand the oven’s efforts.
The oven, after all, has become more than a way to feed everyone. It’s grown into a symbol of what can be achieved through collective work, much like its new neighbor at Legion Field, the Johnson Public Library, which was moved from its flood-prone former home on Railroad Street earlier this year. When selectboard member Adrienne Parker and her partner Blake moved to Johnson from Rhode Island during the pandemic, volunteering for the oven committee was what she described as the “gateway drug” to getting more involved in the community.
“After the flood, we liked Johnson almost more because we saw how the community responded to each other. Everyone was thinking about each other,” Blake said. “In the places we’ve lived before, it’s kind of like, you’re on your own. Here, everyone’s thinking about everyone else and being strong for each other, thinking of how you can help your community members, even if you’re not affected, and I don’t know, that’s just really beautiful.”

Those whose drinking water comes from the lake are at risk of exposure to PFAS and other harmful chemicals from a variety of sources. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Peggy Stevens: Protecting Lake Memphremagog from PFAS must be a priority.","Dear Editor,
I was fortunate to attend a presentation on the geology and hydrogeology of the Memphremagog region sponsored by Memphremagog Watershed Association on Aug. 13. 
I learned so much from Vermont geologists Steven Wright and Jonathan Kim, who is also a geologist with the Vermont Geological Survey. 
It was a great opportunity to learn how our region was formed by glacial advance and retreat over many millennia, how rivers and lakes were formed and how this affects our watershed today. Of the many facts provided, it was fascinating to learn how the Clyde River, Lake Willoughby and Crystal Lake all contributed their north-flowing waters to what became the Lake Memphremagog we know today.
Another point of interest to me is that Kim emphasized that the groundwater and surface water in our watershed are a system, meaning the ground and surface waters are interconnected and constantly cycle, with groundwater becoming surface water and vice versa. Whatever enters the groundwater drains to surface waters, including rivers and other tributaries of the South Bay and Lake Memphremagog. 
This is an important consideration given the location of the state’s only landfill in Coventry, sited in the drainage basin of the lake. Harmful, even hazardous, “forever” PFAS chemicals have been measured in the groundwater wells and underdrains around and beneath the landfill for years. 
This is evidence that PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, and other contaminants escape the landfill, enter groundwater and inevitably drain into the surface waters of Lake Memphremagog, accumulating over time. 
Those whose drinking water comes from the lake, including well over 175,000 Quebec neighbors, are at risk of exposure to PFAS and other harmful chemicals from a variety of sources. 
This is a fact that must not be taken lightly. 
Protecting our lake’s water — and all who depend on it for survival, including fish and wildlife — from chemical contamination from any source must be a priority. 
The state Agency of Natural Resources — regulators of waste management in Vermont — bears responsibility to prevent discharge of PFAS and other chemicals into our environment. 
Residents on both sides of our Vermont-Canadian border deserve the strictest regulation, the safest and most effective waste management technologies and practices to ensure the health and safety of the public and the environment.

Former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean has heard all the talk about Democrats hemorrhaging voters because of unaddressed economic fears. But the onetime physician, presidential candidate and national party chair has a different diagnosis.
“It’s true the Democrats forgot the working class, but we are not appealing to the next generation,” he began a recent interview. “Younger people don’t like longwinded mealy-mouthing, which is a problem in our party. Washington has never had a clue, but it’s particularly out of touch with a bunch of old folks running everything.” 
Dean was 22 when he earned a political science degree, 29 when he graduated from medical school, 33 when he won election as a state representative and 37 when he became lieutenant governor — only to turn 40 and skyrocket into the political stratosphere.
As governor from 1991 to 2003, Dean pushed to expand health care, starting with Dr. Dynasaur coverage for children and teenagers. As a presidential contender in 2004, he plugged into student support by pioneering online organizing, spurring Politico to deem him “the father of all web campaigns.” As head of the Democratic National Committee from 2005 to 2011, he popularized a “50-state strategy” in hopes of growing the grassroots.
Then hitting 75 last year, Dean toyed with another run for governor, only to ultimately stay on the sidelines.
“I didn’t talk to anybody who I trusted who thought it was a good idea, and I don’t really know how to negotiate this world anymore,” he recalled. “I do my banking at the counter, where they say, ‘You could save yourself a lot of trouble if you just go online.’ I won’t because of the security problems. And I’ve never used Amazon. I want to keep my money in Vermont.”
And so the grandfather of three is aiming to embolden a new generation.
“People in their 70s and 80s need to understand our place and get the hell out of the way,” Dean said. “I’m not saying we ought to kick old people to the side or turn everything over to 20-year-olds, although we need a society where they feel they fit in. But I think leadership has to be between 35 and 50.”
Dean admits that can be a challenge in the Green Mountain State, where the median age is the third highest in the nation, the U.S. census reports. The number of older Vermonters has risen by 80% since 2000 — about one in every three residents is now over 60 — while figures for youth under age 20 have dropped by almost 20%.
Dean adds it’s not always easy to hand over the remote when you’ve long held the control.
“As a parent, there’s a role for you as your kids get older, but it’s not what it was.”
That said, Dean isn’t ready to go quietly.

‘The nurse knocks’
Two decades ago, most 20-year-olds knew everything about Dean, the original Vermont youth magnet before U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders ran for president in 2016 and 2020. But today’s students either weren’t born or in school when the doctor unintentionally made history on Jan. 19, 2004, with his TikTok-enduring “Dean Scream.”
Born in New York City in 1948, the son of a stockbroker graduated from Yale University in 1971, then tried his hand pouring concrete, washing dishes and finally attending the Bronx’s Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Meeting and marrying fellow student Judith Steinberg, he was rejected by his top three hospital choices before winning acceptance at his fourth — the University of Vermont Medical Center in Burlington.
Juggling jobs as a physician and part-time lieutenant governor, Dean chose not to run for the state’s top spot when it came open in 1990. Then Gov. Richard Snelling died of a heart attack a year later.
“I was seeing a patient and the nurse knocks,” recalled Dean, who finished the checkup (“I knew the patient wouldn’t be able to get another appointment for quite some time”) before his emergency swearing-in on Aug. 14, 1991.
Serving as governor through 2002, Dean proved hard to pigeonhole. On one hand, he was a fiscal conservative who cut income taxes while balancing the state budget 11 years in a row — all while receiving an “A” rating from the National Rifle Association. Then again, he signed a landmark 2000 law creating same-sex civil unions after the Vermont Supreme Court ruled that all couples have the right to marriage benefits.
The separate-but-equal compromise forged by the Legislature angered both voters wanting no distinction (same-sex marriage wouldn’t come until 2009) and those who opposed any deal. Dean faced so many threats, he had to wear a bulletproof vest when he ran for his fifth and final term.
Amid it all, Dean helped lead the National Governors Association and hinted at higher aspirations by hosting his 49 peers and then-President Bill Clinton at the group’s 1995 conference in Burlington. But everyone was still surprised when he entered the 2004 race for the White House.

‘The Darkest Horse’
The press soon introduced Dean to the nation, but not necessarily in the way he had hoped.
The cover of The New Republic of July 1, 2002, carried the headline, “Invisible Man:  The most intriguing presidential candidate you’ve never seen.” The American Prospect of July 15, 2002, presented a profile titled “The Darkest Horse.” The New York Times of Dec. 18, 2002, summed up its story: “The governor of Vermont will battle the ‘Who’s he?’ factor.”
Dean told the Times he wanted to follow in the footsteps of President Jimmy Carter, a onetime little-known governor who the Vermonter supported as a 1980 delegate to the Democratic National Convention. But Dean was polling far behind a slew of his party’s members of Congress, all of whom supported then Republican President George W. Bush’s invasion of Iraq.
That’s when Dean spoke out.
“’What I want to know is why in the world the Democratic Party leadership is supporting the president’s unilateral attack on Iraq?” he was quoted at the national committee’s 2003 winter meeting. “I’m Howard Dean, and I’m here to represent the Democratic wing of the Democratic Party.”
By summer, Dean was deemed a “maverick” by USA Today, an “insurgent” by the Los Angeles Times and worthy of a cover story by Time magazine.
“Today he has a shot at winning his party’s nomination,” Time wrote in its Aug. 11, 2003 issue. “What’s unclear is whether he has surged because contributors and poll respondents think he is a new kind of Old Democrat — a candidate who will finally revive the left — or because those contributors and respondents know the truth — he is a rock-ribbed budget hawk, a moderate on gays and guns, and a true lefty on only a few issues, primarily the use of U.S. military power, which Dean seems to regard with a mixture of contempt and suspicion.”
Whatever Dean was, “he’s all that and a stick of gum,” political strategist Donna Brazile told the magazine. “He’s that hot. The flavor has not left him.”

‘Nothing to do with it’
By the beginning of 2004, more than 500,000 supporters had signed up on deanforamerica.com, each contributing an average of $77 for a collective total of $50 million, according to finance records.
“I get all this credit for the campaign,” Dean recently recalled. “I had absolutely nothing to do with it.”
The candidate instead points to tech-savvy youth who, in a first, harnessed the web for organizing and fundraising. But they knew more about programming a computer than working the political machine. Dean placed third in Iowa on Jan. 19 (the scream wasn’t the cause, but instead came in response), second in New Hampshire on Jan. 27 and third in Wisconsin on Feb. 17 before withdrawing from the race.
“Dean looked for a moment as if he might shake the political universe with a blunt-spoken, nontraditional style,” the Washington Post reported in a postmortem. “He found the same freewheeling approach that drew such fanfare was an engine of his demise.”
“His vaunted decentralized movement of political newcomers lacked experience and agility,” the Times added, “failing to quickly make or clearly communicate critical decisions.”
Dean went on to head the Democratic National Committee, offer commentary on MSNBC and teach as a senior fellow at Yale’s Jackson School of Global Affairs. Since retiring from those posts, he’s now chair of the Democratic Data Exchange, which collects and shares voter contact information.
“Really smart young people are running it — all I do is keep order,” he said. “The only reason I’m chair is because somebody decided I was the only one who could get along with all the people in the Democratic Party who hated each other.” 
When Dean ran to lead the Democratic National Committee in 2005, Republicans held the presidency and both chambers of Congress. Two decades later, the Vermonter says the situation is similar “but the generation gap is bigger than it’s ever been.”
Dean recalls when Americans received their news from the same national television networks, state newspapers and local radio stations.
“Today you have 10 different versions of everything,” he said. “It’s going to be a big problem for this new generation, which is going to be separated from each other by which TikTok influencers they watch, and for the world in terms of how you establish any kind of notion of what’s true and what’s not.”

‘What’s new about that?’
Dean is a strong proponent of shared context. When his children were in elementary school, he read them an unusual bedtime story: David McCullough’s 1,120-page biography of President Harry Truman.
“They still laugh about it,” he said. “They didn’t feel like it was being abusive.”
For adults, Dean suggests two books: “Thomas Chittenden: Vermont’s First Statesman,” a 1997 history by Frank Smallwood about the state’s founding governor; and “Philip Hoff: How Red Turned Blue in the Green Mountain State,” a 2011 account by Samuel Hand, Anthony Marro and Stephen Terry of the 20th-century leader who ushered in a shift from Republican to Democratic rule.
“All this shapes who we are and why we’re different,” he said.
For Dean, the books also shed light on the present disconnect between state and national politics — and why he sees hope.
“Yeah, you’ve got a neofascist government, but I’m an optimist, and I’ll tell you why,” he said. “When I went to college, I had two Black roommates. They had never been to school with a white person and I had never been to school with a Black person. My junior year was the first time women were permitted to enroll in the Ivy League. And I don’t know a single person in my class who dared to say they were gay.”
That was then.
“The amount of change that’s happened over my generation has just been staggering, and I have hope the new generation isn’t going to like authoritarian rule,” he said. “I see my role is to coach young people — and offer an occasional intervention when Democrats in Washington get particularly stupid.”
Dean is repeating his longtime calls for the national party to seed and feed the grassroots by coordinating and contributing to local and state organizing. He’s also offering his support to self-described democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani in his current bid for New York City mayor.
“Republicans are playing by a new set of rules now, and I think Democrats have got to toughen up,” Dean said. “We don’t have to give up our ideals, but we do have to talk differently.”
More plain spoken, he explained, and less politically correct.
“I just say what I want,” Dean concluded. “What’s new about that?”

What’s different now […]","U.S. Rep. Clay Higgins, R-La., speaks during the U.S. House Oversight and Government Reform Committee meeting at the U.S. Capitol on March 25, 2025 in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)For at least a moment earlier this year, U.S. Rep. Clay Higgins was willing to depart from his typical far-right, far-fetched stances to take a position most would label liberal – on a criminal justice matter, of all things. 
Yet just months later, the Lafayette Republican is back to his extremist ways. What’s different now is that he appears rudderless, permanently veering to the right to the point where it could be argued he’s merely spinning  in political circles. 
Heads turned during the spring session of the Louisiana Legislature when Higgins, a former policeman, gave his support to a proposal that would have let people put in Louisiana prisons by non-unanimous juries seek reviews of their cases. The lawman-turned-lawmaker urged the “swift passage” of the bill by state Sen. Royce Duplessis, D-New Orleans, arguing it preserved the U.S. Constitution’s rights to due process and a fair trial.  
“You could not have told me in my 42 years on this earth that I would have a letter from Congressman Clay Higgins supporting a bill that I brought,” Duplessis told colleagues on the Senate floor before they resoundingly rejected the measure. Opponents in the Republican supermajority said the policy change would overload prosecutors and court staff. 
In recent days, Higgins has come out firing on all cylinders but with no clear direction ascertainable. 
On Aug. 29, he sent a letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson saying that he was stepping down from the House Homeland Security Committee after Rep. Andrew Garabino, R-N.Y., was named its new chairman. Higgins, a candidate for the post, appeared dejected after the vote.  
“My Republican colleagues have chosen an alternate path for the Committee that I helped to build,” he wrote to Johnson, “a path more in alignment with the less conservative factions of our Conference, factions whose core principles are quite variant from my own conservative perspective on key issues like amnesty, ICE operations, and opposition to the surveillance state.”
That’s the Higgins we’ve come to know – bitter, self-righteous and steered by conspiracy theories. As he still sits on the House Armed Services and the Oversight and Government Reform committees (chairing the latter’s law enforcement subcommittee), there will be ample chances for him to make bluster’s last stand. 
And by no means will Higgins limit himself to those matters. A week ago, he urged the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services to withhold federal funding from “organizations that push COVID vaccines on young children.” 
It followed his pledge on social media to “defund” the New Orleans Health Department for promoting the American Academy of Pediatrics’ guidance on COVID-19 vaccines for children from 6 months to 2 years old. 
“State sponsored weakening of the citizenry, absolute injury to our children and calculated decline of fertility,” Higgins wrote in an Aug. 20 X post.
Call me a skeptic, but if there’s a group out there that’s least likely to be anti-fertility, it’s probably pediatricians. It’s not good for their business model.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Higgins’ latest play for political relevance came Thursday when he joined forces with Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., Oversight and Government Reform chairman, to investigate allegations that pharmacy chain CVS Health used “confidential patient information” to lobby the Louisiana Legislature.  
Caremark, a CVS subsidiary, is the prescription benefit manager for the health insurance plan that covers state employees in Louisiana. Attorney General Liz Murrill is suing the company, saying it used information gained through that contract to send text messages to state employees asking them to oppose proposed legislation. The bill in question would have prohibited prescription benefit managers from co-owning pharmacies. Ultimately, lawmakers opted for a less aggressive, transparency measure with the support of independent pharmacies.
Critics consider the co-ownership arrangement self-serving, as the management entities have a direct say in how their affiliated pharmacies price – and profit from – prescription drugs.
Comer and Higgins have requested CVS Health president and CEO David Joyner provide a slate of records to aid in their investigation. 
David Whitrap, who handles external relations for CVS, said in an email the company plans to respond to Comer and Higgins. With regards to the text messages, its communication with customers, patients and the community “was consistent with the law,” he said. 
As much as he wants to position himself to the far right, Higgins’ involvement in accountability efforts such as this makes him a centrist – at least on this issue. The battle against pharmacy benefit managers is a bipartisan one, with both sides looking to claim the win for bringing down prescription drug and health insurance costs.
Regardless, it’s a welcome moment of lucidity from Higgins, much like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s demand for the U.S. Department of Justice to produce all its files on Jeffrey Epstein. 
No one expects it, but it’s certainly welcomed.   
For Higgins, more frequent stances like this could help him emerge from the shadow of Louisiana’s more prominent Republicans in the House – Speaker Johnson, Majority Leader Steve Scalise and Rep. Julia Letlow, a member of the powerful House Appropriations Committee.
But if history portends what lies ahead from Higgins, expect him to once again find his comfort zone on the fringes.

Tamara Taylor has played softball, volleyball and basketball, but tackle football hits different — literally.

This report was originally published by The 19th. The Illuminator is a founding member of the 19th News Network.

“I just like to hit people and have fun,” said Taylor, 31, defensive lineman for Denver’s Mile High Blaze women’s tackle football team. “When I moved to Denver, that’s when I found out about football in general … I wouldn’t change it for the world.”
Taylor and players like her are punting football’s traditional gender norms — tackle is for boys and men, flag is for girls and women — with a growing fan base across the country. And the sports world is taking notice: The Women’s Football Alliance (WFA) — home to the Blaze — became the first women’s tackle football league to secure a multiyear network deal with ESPN2, and the league’s national championship has been broadcast on the sports network for the last three years.
This year’s national championship brought in 969,000 total live viewers, making it the most-watched game on ESPN2 that day. The WFA’s St. Louis Slam took home the win against the DC Divas with a final score of 26-14.
The WFA has also announced expansion into Canada this year. The women’s tackle league has partnered with Cosmos Sports & Entertainment, a sports marketing firm based in Ontario, to identify cities in Canada that could host a team.

Lisa King, a former semi-professional soccer player, founded the WFA in 2009. The alliance is the oldest and largest women’s tackle football league in the world. With 60 teams across three divisions, the league has 12 professional teams.
King was interested in playing football throughout her childhood, but her parents denied her opportunity. After graduating from college, she jumped at the chance to play for a women’s tackle football team in Los Angeles. In founding the league, she wanted to use a similar structure as the soccer teams she had excelled in and bring it to women’s tackle football.
Ten years later, in 2019, Odessa Jenkins, a former player for the WFA, expanded opportunities by creating the Women’s National Football Conference (WNFC). Made up of 17 teams, the WNFC may be smaller in size, but has made an impact on the future of women in football by having a robust branding infrastructure in place to amplify the sport, including creative direction. Jenkins, who played and coached for the WFA’s Dallas Elite, aims to expand opportunities for women football players so that they get the level of recognition they deserve.
For the WNFC, this year marks the first time they have broadcast their national championship game on ESPN2. The matchup between the Texas Elite Spartans and Washington Prodigy came with a new high in digital engagement. The broadcast gained 150,000 championship viewers and more than 150,000 followers on Instagram, a 61% increase since 2024. The league’s TikTok account also doubled since last year, with over 46,000 followers.
And ideally, that recognition will come with pay for players — in the WNFC and the WFA. While neither league provides a salary for players, the WNFC does offer prize money to championship teams. With help from sponsorships by brands like Adidas, Dove and Riddell, the WNFC provided players on the championship team with $20,000. The WFA did not provide a monetary prize for the championship, but was able to cover some costs for players.
“It’s truly a pay-to-play type of situation because we’re not paying these wonderful athletes,” said Rob Sandlin, head coach of the Mile High Blaze, who noted that the financial strain and dedication required can be the biggest challenges for players new to the sport. “We try to be as brutally honest as possible when it comes to what to expect. The one thing that most rookies don’t quite understand is the level of dedication that’s required.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Players must pay dues to remain part of the team, but payment doesn’t guarantee they’ll see time on the field.
“The physical aspects we can explain. The mental parts of the competition can be explained. The idea of how much work you have to put into it is probably the one thing that I get back from people that decide, ‘Yeah, I can’t do this,’ more than anything,” he said.
According to sports news site Marca, the average NFL salary in 2024 was about $3.2 million. While women don’t play for NFL teams, there has been growth in opportunities for women to be on staff. The NFL now has the most full-time women coaches of any professional men’s sports league, with 15 women holding coaching positions across departments.
While girls have access to flag football, a low-contact variant of tackle football, the sport traditionally separates based on gender as young athletes get older. Youth flag football has co-ed opportunities for players ranging from 5 to 17 years old. Tackle football more commonly has restrictions on girls and women playing, both during adolescence and adulthood.
Women’s flag football is seeing growth of its own, with the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics announcing that they will have women’s flag football teams competing for the first time. The NFL has also received bids for future investments in women’s professional flag football leagues this year.
Challenges aside, being in a high-contact sport as a woman has proven to be a unique and rewarding experience for these football players, whether they started playing as children with their siblings or discovered tackle as adults.
For Yolanda “YoYo” Searcy, football was etched in her life at a young age. Breaking with tradition, her Florida high school offered her a spot on the all-boys football team.
“The head coach coached all my siblings and was like, ‘I know what you can do,’” she said.
She declined and joined a school-sanctioned flag football team instead. Years later, she got her chance to play with other tackle-loving women as a linebacker with the Mile High Blaze.
Rosa Climaco, who has been an offensive lineman for the WNFC’s Washington Prodigy for three years, feels she could have benefited from finding football earlier. As someone interested in incorporating fitness into her lifestyle, Climaco finds football to be the perfect choice.
“One night scrolling on Instagram at 3 a.m., I found [WFA player] Lois Cook’s Instagram and just started going down the rabbit hole. I’m like, ‘Whoa, there is a legitimate football league that exists for women,’ and really the only regret I have is that I found it when I was 31,” she said.
Some players find that they have to balance the societal expectation for women to curb aggression with the demand for them to play rough to win.
“I personally think there’s caution tape around aggression even still in women’s football,” said Kourtney “KP” Purham, offensive lineman for the Washington Prodigy. “The idea for men obviously is to be aggressive at its most violent level. One of the things our coach says this year is ‘I support organized violence,’ but it’s like him selling that to us because women are taught not to be that way.”
“So, you’re now trying to navigate through what violence looks like in a sport that was designed for men to be violent and still how to be a lady in a violent sport,” Purham said.

Tapping into aggression comes more naturally to some of these athletes than others. While some players found tackle football to be a place where they could release that side of their personalities, others have had to embrace their aggressive side for the first time.
“A lot of the time for me, it was always, ‘You’re too loud, you’re too rough, you’re too this, you’re too that,’” said Washington Prodigy linebacker and captain Ramzeh Deen-sie.“I was still seeking a way to get out my aggression and just be who I am in my true, natural self.”
Deen-sie describes her transition from playing offense to playing defense as a perfect fit for her personality.
“It was just like, ‘OK, you want me to tackle whoever got the ball. You want me to put my shoulder pads through their chest and make sure they cannot come get you the next play,’” she said. “‘I can do that cause I’m already aggressive, I like to fight, I’m always on 10. I can do this.’”
Tonique’a Jackson, offensive lineman for the Washington Prodigy, has a much different relationship with aggression. For her, focusing on protecting her teammates has allowed her to move with more force on the field.
“I think trying to find that aggressive part of me, it took a really really long time. If it wasn’t being knocked over, if it wasn’t being tripped up, if it wasn’t being yelled at, it’s like you have to tap into the dog inside of you ’cause it’s either beat or be beaten, and that’s where my aggression comes from,” she said.
Outside of pushing her to explore her self-expression, playing football has also allowed Jackson to carry on a family legacy.
“In 2021, I lost my son to gun violence. He was very big in football, and [it was] something that was really, really important to him,” she said. “I wanted to find a way to not only stay connected to him but to also keep his dream alive because I felt like it was taken from him at such a short time in his life.”
Players say they’re satisfied with the growing recognition for their sport — and their representation in it.
“Just to see now with the progression of us being kind of everywhere, involved in coaching at the high school level, too, we’re getting a lot more fans out,” said Mile High Blaze quarterback Kimberly Santistevan. “Whether they know us directly or they’ve heard of us and they want to see us and check us out … the stands are getting fuller and fuller every year.”

The state Fish & Wildlife Department is leading a study to find out. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Why is Vermont’s bear population booming?.","Vermont Fish & Wildlife staff measure a black bear as part of a newly launched survey this summer. Photo courtesy of Vermont Fish & Wildlife Department.  
For the fourth year in a row, Vermont’s black bear population size far outpaced what the state projected. 
Last year, the state had an estimated 6,800 to 8,000 bears, nearly double the objective of 3,500 to 5,500 bears, outlined by a Vermont Fish and Wildlife Department population model.
Why is the population doing so well? There are two big factors that determine population size, said Jaclyn Comeau, the Black Bear Project leader at the state Fish & Wildlife Department: mortality rates and reproduction rates.
The state has a pretty good sense of what is influencing bear mortality, she said. Hunters are responsible for most premature bear deaths, followed by vehicle collisions. Freak accidents, like a bear chewing an electrical wire, can also cause a bear’s early death. Still, populations are continuing to “grow and grow,” Comeau said. 
Looking at reproduction is “kind of that missing piece of information that we don’t have” when it comes to understanding what drives that trend, according to Comeau. A new study launched this summer aims to tackle that question and better pinpoint what type of habitat and food availability supports healthy bear birth rates.
Since the 1980s, the “backbone” to steady population growth has been the wider recovery of suitable habitat for bears, Comeau said, as forest grew back across a landscape previously dominated by deforestation and farm land. The agricultural Vermont of the 1940s and 1950s left bears confined to the spine of the Green Mountains, she said. In those days, killing bears was far more common, without the hunting regulations and restricted season Vermont has today.
Still, the Fish & Wildlife Department would like to better understand how availability of different food sources might influence where the bears go and how successful they are in reproduction, especially as they spread down from the mountains. 
In the mountains, beechnuts are bears’ primary fall food source, but the trees’ nut production pulses every two or three years. Historically, bear populations have risen and fallen with these cycles.  
In the valleys, oak trees — and thus, acorns — are more abundant and more consistent.
“We’re wondering if now that the bear population has moved out of the mountains, if they’re accessing higher-quality habitat where food is more consistent,” Comeau said. “Now that they’re in the valleys, potentially, the habitat might be more productive and allowing their populations to grow.” 
To answer that, the department’s study follows 18 adult female bears fitted with GPS tracking collars that allow biologists to see where the bears are, presumably getting food. The study aims to isolate these two distinct habitat areas by looking at nine bears in the Connecticut River Valley and nine others in the southern Green Mountains. In the winter, the scientists will visit the bears’ dens to confirm how many cubs the mother has, with the intent of following the family and cub survival through their first year of life. Fish & Wildlife anticipates letting the survey run for six years in order to collect enough data to draw conclusions.
Better understanding the conditions in which bears are thriving will allow the department to better protect and manage their habitat, Comeau said. 
The prosperity of Vermont’s black bears is a rare success, as many species decline due to habitat loss, changes in food availability and environmental shifts, among a range of other environmental shifts brought on by climate change. 
Black bears are especially flexible when it comes to habitat and food. As omnivores, they can survive off multiple food sources, and their wide range, from Florida and Mexico to Canada, shows they can adapt to a variety of habitats and temperatures.
Still it does not mean that a changing climate will leave the bears unaffected, Comeau said. 
Comeau worries what the encroachment of beech leaf disease in Vermont’s forests will mean for the bear population over the next decade. 
And as Vermont’s winter season shrinks, people should expect bears to enter hibernation later in the year and emerge earlier in the spring. That, plus a growing population spreading beyond the mountains, makes bears more likely to encounter humans. For Comeau, this underscores a need to figure out how to foster the best coexistence.
The department added that Vermont’s bear hunting season started Monday and runs through Nov. 14. Hunters are allowed to kill collared bears, but Fish & Wildlife asks that they avoid killing bears accompanied by cubs and that they return any collars.

Officials are trying to fill the gaps.","Lisa Balzano’s recent visit to a Fairfield high school left her floored by one sight in particular: a supply room stocked with almost anything a teacher would need. 
“She opened this room with supplies, and I almost fell over,” Balzano recalled. “I said, ‘What’s this?’”
Balzano is a special education teacher at Bridgeport Military Academy, where she buys her own tissues, pens, pencils, markers and more. Anything she needs, she purchases — except for paper. Teachers are allocated two reams a month. 
“That was a year or two ago, and it’s still embedded in my brain how it was just Fairfield,” Balzano said. “It’s 10 minutes from where I live, and it’s just completely different.”
As a Bridgeport educator working in special education for nearly 20 years, Balzano is no stranger to shortages. A position went unfilled last school year, and Balzano’s caseload jumped from 25 students to around 40 students. While it was normal for her, Balzano said she’s heard that other towns consider a caseload of 25 students high.
Special education programs across the state have been historically underfunded, and some urban districts like Bridgeport and New Britain — as well as smaller rural districts, like Thompson — have struggled especially to support their special education students because of lower teacher pay or limited access to resources.
Statewide, special education accounts for a large portion of district budgets. From 2023 to 2024, districts in the state spent, on average, almost a quarter of their total expenditures on special education.
Earlier this year, in a move many educators said was long overdue, Gov. Ned Lamont and the state legislature injected an additional $70 million into special education. Of that, $40 million was allocated as an emergency grant for the fiscal year that ended June 30 and $30 million went toward a new grant for fiscal year 2026. But this money still isn’t nearly enough to meet the needs in many districts, and officials are working to fill in the gaps.
Spending is high, but students are struggling
Some districts spend over 30% of their annual budgets on special education. But such high levels of spending don’t necessarily mean students are getting what they need. 
When a district can’t meet a student’s level of need, that student may be sent to a school in another district or placed in a private school or facility. But this has historically been very costly for districts.
The costs are due to a variety of factors, said Michael Morton, deputy executive director of operations and communications for the School and State Finance Project, a nonpartisan, nonprofit policy organization.
“When you have historically underfunded districts, they’re not going to have the resources to build in-district programming,” Morton said. “As a result of that, you are going to have a lot more students being sent out of district, which results in increased costs.”
And that raises other costs, Morton said. “You’re also paying for transportation to make sure those students get to a place where they can get the services that they deserve and are legally entitled to.”
Districts statewide spent around $268 million on transportation for all special education students in the 2023-24 school year and just under $700 million on tuition.
Michele McKinley, who heads up special education for Bridgeport schools, said the district outplaces anywhere between 250 and 300 students — which comes with a high cost.
“Out-of-district placement may cost $200,000, and that’s on the low end. Well, we don’t get $200,000 per student,” McKinley said, referring to state funding. “So then that’s additional funds that we have to go into the general budget to pull to ensure that we are meeting that student’s needs. Because ultimately, we have to meet the individual student’s needs.”
“There just aren’t the funds to support the legal requirements. And that’s a real problem.”Andrew Feinstein, attorney
Bridgeport faced significant teacher shortages last year, with 24 special education teacher vacancies and 46 paraeducator vacancies, according to a complaint filed in June by the Center for Children’s Advocacy. The complaint detailed allegations from families who said their children regressed due to inadequate staffing of educators with no special education training. 
One student was allowed, on multiple occasions, to hit their head against a wall hundreds of times, according to the complaint. 
McKinley said the district has already begun addressing issues in the complaint.
Bridgeport is in a better position this upcoming school year, with only three special education teacher vacancies as of Aug. 15, according to Bridgeport Public Schools. McKinley said “a lot of intentional work” went into recruiting and retention initiatives.
But funding disparities mean some districts face steeper challenges than others. Districts in Connecticut get around 57% of their education funding from local property taxes, according to the School and State Finance Project. That means more affluent towns tend to have more money to spend on education. 
Both New Britain and Greenwich put around 27% of their total education expenditures towards special education in 2023-24, a bit above the state-wide average of 23.7%. But taking into account each town’s tax revenues, and the number of students they serve, there was a more-than $20,000 disparity between New Britain and Greenwich in per-pupil expenditures for students in special education. 
Greenwich spent over $50,800 per special education student, while New Britain spent $25,686 per special education student.
In Bridgeport, where Balzano works, nearly 30% of all education expenditures went towards special education; That amounted to $28,081 per pupil in special education. 
Some less affluent districts — that can’t provide the qualified staff or infrastructure required by law for special education students — spend millions of dollars to send students to schools outside the district.
Outplacements strain Bridgeport’s budget significantly, McKinley said. But the district is currently building a new facility for students with “complex learning needs” that would house around 260 students. She said she hopes this will save the district money and provide students with the services they need.
 If special education costs exceed what the district has budgeted, McKinley said they have to tap into funds that are intended to cover other things. 
“That’s the importance of the new facility that we’re building, it’s to provide some of those services where we have had to send students out of district — to provide those services in district.” McKinley said.

Like most things, special education has gotten more expensive
Special education costs have risen steeply in recent years for districts across the country. In Connecticut, the number of special education students has steadily increased despite an overall decline in statewide enrollment.
Andrew Feinstein, a special education attorney, said districts statewide are struggling to hire educators. The state Department of Education has also highlighted the problem. This shortage is exacerbated in districts that offer less-competitive salaries, typically lower-income districts.
“Cost, of course, escalated enormously in special ed,” Feinstein said. “We are reaching the real area of scarcity, where there just aren’t the funds to support the legal requirements. And that’s a real problem.”
Six years ago, districts were putting a smaller portion — closer to 20% — of education expenditures towards special education. Districts now are dishing out over 25%. And students are still struggling.

Naomi Nova is involved in the special education system as a parent, special education attorney and as the vice president of Special Education Equity for Kids of Connecticut, or SEEK. Nova came face-to-face with the impacts of staff shortages after a recent planning and placement team meeting. (Nova wanted to clarify that at this meeting, the board was not represented by an attorney.)
In the parking lot, as she was leaving, Nova was approached by one of the evaluators.
“It wasn’t a confrontational meeting at all, but she came up to me in tears after the meeting, grabbed me in the parking lot and told me that there were so many more assessments and things that she wanted to recommend and do to help students, and that she couldn’t do it because her number of evaluations that she was now expected to do was so high that there just weren’t enough hours in the day,” Nova said.
Nova said families sometimes seek supplemental support for their children outside of the school system, but that can present financial challenges.
“These are huge expenses, and they’re huge expenses for any family,” Nova said. “But for people who can’t afford it, it’s truly devastating.”
What’s the state doing?
The Connecticut General Assembly passed legislation creating additional grants to fund special education during the 2025 legislative session in an effort to help districts, their students and staff.
The bill passed in June included the creation of the Special Education Expansion and Development (SEED) grant that will allocate $60 million over the next two fiscal years, or $30 million a year. The general assembly also approved a High Quality Special Education Incentives grant to allocate $9.9 million in FY 2027 among other initiatives targeted at managing costs in special education.
If the grant were fully funded — which it is not — it would allocate over $190 million across the state. Under the current allocation, it provides a few less-populated towns with just a few hundred dollars for the year. 
“I don’t think anyone would say it is [a magical solution],” Morton, of the School and State Finance Project, said. “But it is a step in the right direction to hopefully making sure that we have a special education system that is not only well funded but is making sure that every student is getting the services that they are legally entitled to.”
Before the creation of the SEED grant, state special education funding was primarily distributed through two grants: the Excess Cost grant and the Education Cost Sharing grant. The Excess Cost grant is a high-cost service funding grant that partially reimburses districts for the cost of some special education students. To cover additional special education costs, districts pull money from the state’s general education funding, distributed under the Education Cost Sharing grant. 
[RELATED: How are CT schools funded? What to know about the ECS formula]
Connecticut is one of the only states in the nation that did not distribute state funding for special education through a dedicated formula prior to FY 2026.
Districts can request reimbursement through the Excess Cost grant for the cost of students exceeding the basic contribution, or when a student’s education costs over 4.5 times the district’s average expenditure per student from the prior year.
The grant also fully reimburses districts for students requiring special education services placed by the state. This includes students who may be attending an out-of-district school because of a foster care placement. 

But these grants don’t typically meet districts’ needs, leaving local school systems to pay the difference. For districts, this creates what Kate Dias, president of the Connecticut Education Association, calls a “disaster in local budgeting.”
“You’re talking about some districts having to make up three, four, five million dollars because the Excess Cost grants were only funded to 60%,” Dias said. “You had the federal government not meeting its obligation, the state not meeting its obligation, but the services have to be provided and then paid for at the local level, causing these incredible pressures.” 
That’s led districts like Bridgeport to place special education students in costly private schools. A federal report from 2023 found that Connecticut outplaced 6.3% of all special education students — the highest rate in the nation.
Some students require district outplacement for their learning needs, but many need mid-tier interventions they can’t get in their districts. With the newly approved SEED grant, and additional future funding, Dias is hopeful districts can create collaborative centers for students to receive “the lowest level of intervention with the highest level of impact.” 
“These ideas of regional centers are going to have to take root in some capacity,” Dias said. “We can’t afford to continuously outsource special education. We’re going to have to figure out, how do we create something different?” 
A new approach
That “something different” may look unconventional on the outside — like the Farmington Valley Diagnostic Center. 
The center, directed by Sara Steinberg, is a temporary school for 6th through 12th graders located in a small one-story building in Simsbury. The goal of the school isn’t to keep students enrolled — rather, it seeks to send them back to their home districts.
Overseen by the Capitol Region Education Council, the FVDC allows member districts to purchase a certain number of seats at the beginning of the school year at a much lower cost than conventional private outplacements. 
Steinberg said memberships cost “far less” than what a conventional outplacement would cost since the center is not looking to make a profit.
Steinberg said FVDC is “scrappy,” transforming closets into reboot rooms with pillows and calming lights for students and bringing in community members with service dogs to interact with students weekly — for free. The school, which has been open since 1998, recently purchased new furniture for the first time in the history of the center.
Around half of the students at FVDC have reached a point where they are refusing to attend school in their home district, and many have undergone severe trauma, Steinberg said. The goal of the center is to realign and reset students in a standard 8- to 12-week period placement. Steinberg has seen countless success stories from students who leave the center and return to their home districts.
“Our systems are not always set up for early intervention, unfortunately, but this is actually an example of earlier intervention,” Steinberg said. “It’s an opportunity to do something in a supportive, proactive way and seeing then what the next step is.” 
Sometimes, students are still sent to outplacement programs if they can’t return to their district. But the program offers a step before outplacement that many districts, especially smaller districts, don’t have the bandwidth to offer, Steinberg said.
“I do think if we can create these smaller settings within larger settings, there’s a place for that,” Steinberg said, adding that SEED grant funding could bolster that effort. 
We can’t afford to continuously outsource special education. We’re going to have to figure out, how do we create something different?”Kate Dias, Connecticut Education Association
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, co-sponsored the bill that provided for SEED grants during this year’s legislative session, and he said it’s a good opportunity to fund intervention to support students with lower-levels of need.
“So this is hopefully an incentive for communities to come together and say, ‘Can we pool our resources and educate some of these kids instead of sending them to other places where it’s more expensive?’” Ritter said. 
In addition to Bridgeport’s announcement of its new school tailored to special education students, Shelton Mayor Mark Lauretti has said he wants to open a regional special education school. 
Morton said he believes the special education bills passed may allow districts to consider expanding resources. “People are more likely to consider — because of the additional funds that are being provided and the additional incentives — [creating] in-district or multidistrict programming, rather than relying on outplacing students,” Morton said.
The SEED grant won’t solve all the problems in special education in Connecticut, but, Ritter said, “You’ve got to take a step to walk a mile.”
Not a ‘magical fix’
As the staffing shortage continues, educators like Balzano see the impacts of underfunding each day. Statewide teacher shortages are exacerbated in less affluent districts because of lower incomes, fewer resources and larger class sizes and caseloads.
When Balzano had around 40 students on her caseload, she not only had to fill out paperwork for each of the students, she also had to teach them.
“I was spread very, very thin,” she said. “And I heard some teachers stay at school till 8:00 at night. I just can’t do that. I can’t and I won’t do that.”
Balzano was able to get her work done and not stay late because of an agreement established through the Bridgeport Education Association and the Bridgeport Board of Education that allowed educators to get coverage for classes if they needed additional time to finish paperwork. Even though the vacant position is now filled, Balzano said there is still a lot of teacher turnover in the district, and people often leave for higher paying positions in the state.
But Balzano said she’s dedicated to her Bridgeport school. 
“The students need somebody that they know will stay, because I think they’re so used to a transient teacher and staff population. I think there’s a comfort to know that that teacher or staff member will always be there,” she said. 
Balzano, who only had one other job before working in Bridgeport, said this is “it” for her.
“I can’t really imagine doing anything else, and I just love working with the kids and their families,” she said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025_0820_SR_SpecialEd_048-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-07 05:57:07.636046

(Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)As the end of summer approaches the grass in the front yard has gone to seed. The flowery heads sag with the promise of new life and sway like a murmur in the evening breeze. It won’t be long before some city fire department employee comes along in a little white pickup, hops out, and measures the grass with a ruler to find that some patches are above the 8-inch legal maximum.
Then a wooden stake will be pounded into the yard with a cardstock notice written in Sharpie giving me a few days in which to cut the grass or face fines and the threat that the city will cut it for me and bill me for the bother.
But the grass is hardly a nuisance, not yet, so it remains uncut, at least for today. Lawns are also environmental disasters. They limit biodiversity, take too much watering, and are generally made of nonnative grass. They’re also an indicator of class status, a signal that you have the leisure time to care for a lawn or the means to have somebody do it for you. And yes, the grass can be a fire hazard if it’s too tall and close to a building. That’s why the fire department measures it with rulers.
I’m tempted to replace the lawn with native plants.
But there’s been too much activity on Constitution Street in the past month with little time for lawn care or native landscaping. Empty paint cans are piled like empty beer cans on the porch and the tracks from a bucket truck are still visible in the damp yard. My guy doing the painting used the bucket to reach some of the highest peaks of the many gabled roof, part of the design of a house that was built before the phrase “world war” was in our vocabulary. It is an elaborate roof for such a small home, with some of the extant gingerbread between the gables reminding me more of a steamboat than a house. The water has been deep enough in the front yard during the rains of the past month that the old house has seemed like a ship laid up in strange waters. This port of call has been the summer of 2025.
The end of summer always finds me in a reflective mood. There’s just over two weeks left before autumn arrives — it officially begins at 1:19 p.m. Sept. 22 — so I have an urge to get things done. The painting will be finished in a week, if it doesn’t rain too much, but there’s still some carpentry work to do. I’ll tackle that myself, and will be glad to use some of the skills passed down by my father. I’ll leave the plumbing repairs to a professional, although I’ll hear my amateur handyman father whispering behind me that I should be doing it myself. He’s been dead 27 years, but he comes to me in my dreams, never speaking but always with a red metal toolbox and the need to repair something — a car, a door, a water heater.
I know that repairs aren’t really about fixing objects. What my subconscious is manifesting, other than a longing for a dead parent, is a desire to confront challenges, to bring order to chaos, to heal the tribulation of the summer nearly past and the years immediately preceding it.
Sometimes I’ll wake with a start before dawn, my T-shirt soaked with sweat, staring into the darkness and pondering the latest home repair dream. When I can’t get back to sleep, I’ll come downstairs in the quiet house and turn on the lamp behind my writing desk and pull down a volume from the bookshelf. This last episode of unscheduled nocturnal reading happened a couple of nights ago, and the book I reached for was published in 1940. “Rascals in Democracy” was written by W.G. Clugston, a newspaper reporter whose beat was the Kansas Statehouse. While it is ostensibly about politics in the Sunflower State, it’s really about politics everywhere.
Clugston was 50 years old when the book was published and was the kind of reporter Hecht and MacArthur wrote plays about. He was cynical, somebody who saw how the sausage was made, and didn’t shy from telling others the stomach-turning details. He didn’t have much regard for William Allen White, the legendary newspaper editor from Emporia, saying that White could have become a great literary figure if he had not soiled his talents in the “dirty sewer lines of politics.”
Other figures, from Gov. Harry H. Woodring to 1936 presidential hopeful Alf Landon, were similarly dismissed as opportunists. About the only Kansas politician Clugston seemed to like was Arthur Capper, and even then the approval was qualified. Capper, he says, built his publishing empire through classified advertisements in his magazines hawking hoax remedies for impotence to his predominately rural readership.
Clugston was born in Lexington, Kentucky, and graduated with a law degree from the university there. But instead of practicing law he pursued journalism, working for United Press International and the Democratic-leaning Kansas City Post. Once, while covering the Kansas Statehouse for the Post, he was locked in a room and held incommunicado.
At 3:30 a.m. March 17, 1921, officials discovered him hiding in the secretary of state’s office, adjacent to the Senate, while lawmakers met in closed session to debate appointments to a variety of state offices, including bank examiner.
“He was asked (after being hauled before the Senate) to give his promise to refrain from disclosing anything he had heard of the debate on the appointments,” the Wichita Beacon reported. “He refused. As a result he was ordered imprisoned in one of the adjacent committee rooms, where he will remain under the eye of a sergeant-at-arms until the session ends.”
Clugston’s detention lasted until sine die adjournment, 11 hours later.
His first-hand observation of Statehouse politics persuaded him that most politicians were “rascals.” He may have settled on the word because it was a colorful and relatively safe description that did not make an accusation he would have to defend in court.
But Clugston knew how to make a point with humor.
“Scientists have never established, with any degree of accuracy, just how long it takes to produce an outstanding rascal under any form of government,” he wrote. “Nor does history provide much basis for computing the length of time it takes for an individual, or a succession of individuals, to corrupt a state. But Kansas has produced some factual material which might prove useful to statisticians interested in trying to calculate the time elements likely to be involved in such undertakings.”
The ingredients included social snobbery, rampant ambition, the shameless exploitation of family connections, and wrapping oneself in a hypocritical cloak of patriotism and purity. Clugston seems to have envisioned the era of Trump even before our current rascal-in-chief was born.
Clugston believed the long-term fix for the dismal state of politics was education, and for education to be effective teachers had to be liberated from political dogma and be adequately paid. Teachers, he said, were “terrorized” into teaching what benefited the ruling elite instead of spreading enlightenment. Trump? Check.
“The teachers are not to blame for anything except their very human yielding to the urge to keep body and soul together by earning their daily bread through their chosen profession,” Clugston wrote. “But until we really have an educational system that educates, and until the teachers are emancipated and freed from the economic straight-jackets which they are now required to wear, democracy will always be weak in one of its most important understructures.”
Clugston had an unshakeable belief that the people were, if not smarter than their politicians, at least motivated by a desire to express their collective will for good. This seems old-fashioned now, but when “Rascals in Democracy” was released, Britain was already at war with Nazi Germany over the invasion of Poland. The storm clouds were hard to miss, even from across the Atlantic.
This belief in the essential good of the populace was as American as Norman Rockwell, and perhaps as naïve. But Clugston believed in it earnestly, just as he did in a particular form of Christianity, one rooted in civic service. Clugston was also a joiner of things, including a Topeka club founded by Karl Menninger called “The Naked and Unashamed Club.” No, it wasn’t that kind of group. Dedicated to philosophical discussion, the members put their inhibitions aside for open and freewheeling debate.
The book I now hold in my hand is personally signed by Clugston, in the flowing script of a fountain pen. “To my good Irish friend Ed Rooney, whom I love but with whom I can’t agree about anything.” It’s dated June 5, 1940, at Topeka.
Rooney was a Topeka lawyer, a professor at the Washburn University School of Law, and a fellow member of the Naked and Unashamed. In 1942, he and Clugston debated “campaign issues” at Kansas State University at Manhattan, at the invitation of the college’s department of journalism. If there remains a transcript of that debate I would pay cash money for it.
Clugston died in 1963. He was 78. The Associated Press attributed his death to cancer. His literary death, precipitated by a decline in his influence after World War II, was due to neglect. The kind of radicals that flourished in Kansas during the 1920s, including the entire “Appeal to Reason” socialist contingent out of Girard, were crushed by the post-war Red Scare.
If Clugston is remembered at all now, it is as a footnote in a dissertation.
I first came across Clugston years ago while examining some “Little Blue Books” published by Emanuel Haldeman-Julius at the Appeal offices in Girard. Clugston’s “Facts You Should Know About Kansas” came out in 1946.
While I don’t agree with Clugston on everything — his assessment of White was wrong, if only because he was Mary White’s father — I am richer for having read his contrarian view of Kansas politics. There are more things in heaven and Topeka than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
As we near the end of summer, things become clearer on reflection. Our political summer has lasted for some eight decades, a period when those Americans who had fought the rise of fascism endeavored to make a better world using the tools they had. The result wasn’t perfect, especially in an age when a phrase like “world war” was needed, but it was progress.
Now we face a domestic threat to democracy.
One of the tools missing from our citizen toolbox is the ability to have rational and deep debates on the challenges inherent in democracy. Can we recover from a misstep when nobody has yet emerged to galvanize the resistance? How do we engage with our countrymen who reject constitutional democracy in favor of theocracy, oligarchy, or outright dictatorship?
Protest is important. Many thousands have taken to the streets in Topeka and across the county to decry the growing police state and other presidential abuses of power. Their signs and voices express the desire for change. We need protest, but we also need reasoned dissent.
Instead of engaging in informed conversations we hide behind memes, buzzwords, and taunts. So do our politicians. We reject the principled argument in favor of the endorphin rush of manufactured outrage. So do our politicians. This is not righteous outrage, not the kind of outrage over real events that drives movements, but the gossamer constructs of online manipulation.
If there is one lesson I’ve taken from Clugston the forgotten, it’s this:
Thank God for dissent. It is the seed from which democracy grows.
He didn’t say that, but he lived it. And his dissent was informed, insightful, and hurled like a spitball at his targets. He wrote books and signed them to friends who disagreed. He was cranky and colorful and even a bit reckless — can you imagine what the current Kansas Senate would do to a reporter who hid himself to hear a closed-door discussion? — but Clug, as his friends called him, was the genuine article.
This is the kind of thing I ponder when I wake before dawn, with just a couple of weeks of summer left, and reach for an old book on the shelf. In the dreams with my father we never really finish our repairs. The tasks change, but we’re always in the midst of it, using the tools we have. It is the nature of maintenance, whether for a car or a hot water heater or the house of democracy.

Traffic deaths down slightly: On a hopeful note, only 143 highway deaths have been tallied in our state as of mid-August… hopeful, compared to 196 deaths by the same time last year. Credit should go to the state and local police departments for cracking down on reckless drivers and speeders. But of some concern, there’s been an increase in fatalities and injuries involving e-bikes as new laws regarding their operation take effect Oct. 1.
Using A.I. to keep highways safe: It’s been a while since we’ve had a wrong-way crash on our interstates and parkways, thanks in part to artificial intelligence (A.I.). The Connecticut Department of Transportation has installed tech at 150 on- and off-ramps looking for people as they enter the highway in the wrong direction, setting off flashing lights and alerting the State Police.
Higher fares on trains: As predicted, fares on all of our trains went up 5% as of Sept. 1. What a nice way to welcome back commuters! And another 5% jump is coming next July. Bus fares were not affected.
Work from home: Higher rail fares (with the same slow service) and unending traffic are other reasons more than 17% of Connecticut residents chose to work remotely. In some towns the numbers are much higher: 39% of Weston residents and 36% in Westport.
Nextgen Acela: Years late, the nifty new Acela trains started running between Boston and Washington on Aug. 28. Train fan that I am, I saw it run past on it’s debut run… already 12 minutes late. Though they’re capable of 160 mph, they run no faster (and sometimes slower) than Metro-North. Congestion and delays affect even Amtrak’s flagship trainsets. Kind of like putting a Maserati on I-95 at rush hour.
Back in the Metroliner days, Amtrak offered partial fare refunds if your train was 15 minutes late. Last Tuesday’s Next-Gen Acela train (9-2-25) was 30 minutes late into Stamford and 45 minutes late into Washington D.C. If your train is two-plus hours late you have to contact customer relations to plead your case.

Amazingly, local laws call this only a misdemeanor with a $1,000 fine. But the captain undoubtedly faces severe consequences. The ship continued its journey without him.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wrong-way-driving-hero.jpg,,,2025-09-07 04:56:49.078106

(Photo by Steven Garcia/Investigate Midwest)CEDAR RAPIDS – Few people outside Quaker Oats know exactly what the Cedar Rapids factory is making when a sweet, wholesome smell wafts from the plant north of downtown.
Locals call it a Crunch Berry day because Quaker – the world’s largest cereal plant – makes Cap’n Crunch’s Crunch Berries, but the aroma could also be oats roasting for Oatmeal Squares or maple-flavored instant oatmeal.
The oats fueling that sweet-smelling goodness come not from the rich Iowa soil near the plant, but from up to 1,000 miles away in Canada. For decades, the plumpest, most consistent oats came from the northern plains, but new field trials show food-grade oats can be grown in Iowa and Minnesota by farmers eager for an alternative to corn and soybeans.
Buying domestic oats would help Quaker save freight costs and avoid threatened tariffs on Canadian goods. It could also improve Midwest water quality and soil health ravaged by an endless corn/soy rotation. Expanding Midwest oat production offers economic and environmental benefits for farmers and local communities, advocates say.

But agricultural companies and commodity groups don’t have financial incentives tied to oats because oats don’t require hybrid seeds, crop insurance or as much fertilizer. These big players aren’t opposing oats, but they aren’t cheerleading either.
The lack of support has left oat growers to be their own hype machines.
“We can actually pick our varieties and our production practices to provide a better product than Canada, not only on a protein level, but on an environmental impact level,” said Landon Plagge, a Latimer farmer and oat advocate.
In May, Plagge and other oat farmers in Iowa and Minnesota loaded 100,000 bushels of their oats into a rail car bound for Quaker’s factory in Cedar Rapids. Three months later, they’re still waiting to hear what the grain giant thought of the domestic product.
Iowa is a ‘donut hole’ for oat research
Baby boomers who grew up on Iowa farms remember growing oats to feed horses and other livestock. Iowans harvested more than 6 million acres of oats a year until the 1950s, according to Matt Liebman, an emeritus Iowa State University agronomy professor.
But as Americans started eating more meat, demand increased for corn to feed the cattle, hogs and chickens. When ethanol was approved as a fuel additive in the 1970s, corn demand rose again. Now, about 45% of corn nationwide becomes ethanol.
Like kernels around a cob, industries popped up to serve King Corn. Specialty seed breeders, co-ops that sell fertilizer and consultants who tell farmers how much corn to feed their hogs all benefit from expansion of corn acres.
Still, Iowans harvested nearly 40,000 acres of oats for grain in 2022, putting it eighth in the nation behind North Dakota, Minnesota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Texas, Pennsylvania and New York, according to the Census of Agriculture. Oats harvested to feed animals and humans increased 12.6% in Iowa between 2017 and 2022.


Iowa State University, a land-grant school with a powerhouse agriculture college, once had a distinguished oat breeding program. Kenneth Frey and J. Artie Browning developed a crown rust-resistant oat cultivar they shared with farmers as certified seed in 1968, according to the Agronomy Department’s 125th Points of Pride.
But Iowa State hasn’t had an oat breeder since 2007 and doesn’t do its own oat trials. The university did partner with Practical Farmers of Iowa, a sustainable agriculture nonprofit based in Des Moines, to hold oat trials at four ISU research farms.
“Iowa is the donut hole,” Liebman said, referring to oat research in neighboring states of Minnesota, South Dakota, Wisconsin and Illinois.
Liebman, who retired in 2021, understands university budgets are tight and there’s no corporate constituency clamoring for oat research.
“There’s more money to be made in selling corn and soybeans,” he said, referring to ag companies. “With oats, you don’t have to keep buying seed every year because it’s not hybrid and it’s not transgenic. It’s much less lucrative.”
He’d like to see ISU prioritize research of oats and other small grains because of the benefits to soil health and water quality.
Glen Ritchie, who started as ISU’s Agronomy Department chair in July, said he knows there is renewed interest in oats among Iowa farmers and that might affect research priorities.
“We’re always looking for opportunities to provide the best value we can to the agricultural community in Iowa,” he said. “Oats are part of the discussions we’re having on that.”

He’s seen it happen 
Martin Larsen dipped his toe into small-grains farming in 2018, planting oats on a small swath of his farm near Byron, Minnesota. He was curious. Would his combine work for oat harvest? Could he get at least 38 pounds per bushel – the minimum threshold for food-grade oats?
The answers were yes and yes.
“I ramped up from there to the point I have a full three-crop rotation on 1,400 acres,” he said.
Larsen has even invested in specialized equipment, including a header for his combine that strips the seeds from the top of the oat plant rather than running the whole stalk through the machine. This speeds harvest and keeps the stalk in place to reduce erosion.
Other farmers want to know whether Larsen is making money from oats.
“It’s always the thing we hear,” he said. “Soybeans, especially, can see an up to 10% yield bump because you’ve broken up the crop rotation.”
Glyphosate-resistant water hemp vexes every Midwest corn farmer. When the weed wants to make its move in late spring, oats already have a lush green cover and the water hemp can’t compete. That means less weed pressure during the next corn round and less pesticide he has to apply, Larsen said.
By planting red clover with the oats, the clover provides nitrogen to the soil, which feeds future corn crops with reduced fertilizer costs, he said.
“So you really start to put all this together and it’s looking like the right thing for my farm,” he said.
It’s also the right thing for protecting water quality, said Larsen, who is a conservation and feed lot technician for the Olmsted County Soil and Water Conservation District. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has asked Minnesota to develop a plan for reducing nitrate pollution to groundwater in southeastern Minnesota’s Driftless region.
Nitrate in drinking water not only can cause blue baby syndrome, but studies – including some done in Iowa – show a link between ingesting nitrate from drinking water and cancers including colorectal, thyroid, bladder and ovarian.
“We have to raise something different than corn and soybeans or raise corn and soybeans differently if we’re going to affect nitrates,” Larsen said. “We have hundreds and hundreds of data points of groundwater samples below oats compared to corn and soybeans, and it’s black and white that oats will reduce nitrates in groundwater.”
Tests of groundwater under Larsen’s oat acres show up to 60% less nitrate than under corn acres.

Farmers band together
While running a grocery store in Latimer for eight years, Anne and Landon Plagge were always thinking about what customers wanted to buy.
“We were on vacation in Europe and we saw the proliferation of oat products on the shelves there,” Landon Plagge said. “Our (U.S.) consumer patterns tend to mirror that.”
The global market for oat milk was valued at more than $2 billion in 2020 and is projected to climb through at least 2028, especially with new shelf-stable milk. Beyond oat milk, there is oat flour for people trying to avoid gluten, and oatmeal boosted with flax and chia for people trying to get more protein.
Plagge decided he wanted to grow oats for the segment of the U.S. population that wants an allergen-free, pesticide-free product. Grain Millers processes oats in St. Ansgar, near the Minnesota border, but they grind wheat and barley, too, so the oats can’t be completely free of allergens, Plagge said.
He recruited about 70 farmers, mostly from Iowa and Minnesota, to invest in Green Acres Milling, a $55 million oat-processing plant in Albert Lea, Minnesota. The plant, scheduled to open next year, eventually will process 3 million bushels of oats a year. This equates to about 60,000 acres of oats within three years, Plagge said.
“They put their own cash into making the mill a reality,” Plagge said of the investors – including Larsen – who will get a premium price for the oats they sell to Green Acres. The mill requires oat growers to use a cover crop and to grow oats as part of a rotation with other crops.
“That gives us the control of the raw materials supply coming in so we can provide a sustainably-produced oat with a cover crop for our brands and a diverse rotation for our brands,” Plagge said.

Who’s buying?
While Quaker is several generations removed from its 1870’s origin in Ravenna, Ohio, Seven Sundays founders Hannah and Brady Barnstable sold their first bag of muesli – like granola, but healthier – at a Minneapolis farmers market in 2011.
“We love oats,” Brady Barnstable said. “We think they are a huge unlock to change the agricultural landscape in the Midwest.”
Seven Sundays makes cereal and granola without dyes, artificial colors, allergens or refined sugars. They also buy only non-GMO crops grown without glyphosate. Their products, like Wildberry Protein Oats, have muscled their way onto grocery shelves, including at Midwest Costco stores.
“We’ve been invited to the Costco Midwest managers meetings in the Chicago area to give presentations on what we’re doing in our supply chain to benefit soil health,” Barnstable said. But Costco wouldn’t stock Seven Sundays just for environmental brownie points, he said. “The decisions are driven by sales. Is it resonating with their shoppers? For Seven Sundays, it is.”
Seven Sundays originally bought all its oats from Whole Grain Milling, in Welcome, Minnesota, but as they sold more muesli and cereal, Seven Sundays needed more suppliers, including some from Canada. By purchasing American oats, the company could avoid increased freight costs and skip tariff fears.
“Our goal is to source as close to home as possible for all our ingredients,” Barnstable said. “I have heard that this new mill will have the capacity to provide us and many other customers with the oats we need to fill our full demand.”

Public push for sustainable products
But what about Quaker? The company and its parent, PepsiCo Inc., did not respond to several attempts to seek comment for this story. Just like Quaker doesn’t advertise what makes that sweet smell in Cedar Rapids, the firm isn’t saying exactly what factors into their oat sourcing.
But we know price and availability of supplies are key drivers, according to PepsiCo’s 2024 Annual Report.
“Risk to our supply of certain raw materials is mitigated through purchases from multiple geographies and suppliers,” the report stated.
Companies face pressure from consumers – particularly Millennials and Gen Z – who increasingly want to buy products that are good for people and the planet. A 2024 survey by PwC showed consumers are willing to spend almost 10% more for sustainably-sourced or produced goods.
PepsiCo and Cargill announced in July they will partner with Practical Farmers of Iowa to advance regenerative farming practices across 240,000 acres in Iowa. Farmers who sell their corn to Cargill – which produces ingredients for PepsiCo’s family of companies – will have access to advice, technical resources and incentive payments to “support their transition to regenerative practices,” the companies said in a joint news release.
Cargill and PepsiCo want to drive adoption of regenerative practices on 10 million acres by 2030, the news release said.
News like this brings equal parts frustration and hope for Larsen, the Minnesota oat farmer waiting to hear back from Quaker about the May oat shipment. “It seems like buying oats from their backyard would fit their narrative.”

(Provided by American Prairie)American Prairie announced this week it has acquired the Anchor Ranch, its second-largest land purchase to date, and it has reopened access to nearly 50,000 acres of public land in “a special area of the Breaks.”
“This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to secure an important piece of ecologically and culturally significant land,” said American Prairie CEO Alison Fox in a statement. “But this acquisition is equally important as a way to return public access to the people so they can explore, hunt and recreate on land that’s been off limits for many years.”
American Prairie launched in 2001 with a mission to ensure 3.2 million acres of prairie are protected, including roughly half that are already part of the Charlie M. Russell National Wildlife Refuge and the Upper Missouri River Breaks National Monument.
“But it’s important to point out that the majority of that would be — is — public land,” said American Prairie public relations manager Beth Saboe.

The new land comprises the Anchor Ranch and two additional properties in Blaine County, and it puts the total acreage American Prairie manages at 600,000, according to a news release announcing the acquisitions.
Anchor Ranch is 69 miles southwest of Havre and totals 67,960 acres, including 22,837 acres of deeded land and 45,123 of leased acres, “significantly advancing the organization’s mission of prairie ecosystem conservation,” American Prairie said.
It also opens up access to land previously tied up in a legal dispute along with Bullwhacker Road, which the Public Land Water Access Association described as “the only reasonable access” to acreage in the Breaks.
But a judge found the road was private in 2011.
In 2012, the billionaire Wilks brothers, among the largest land owners in Montana, bought the ranch. It was caught up in a controversial negotiation with the Bureau of Land Management, then put on the market again in 2022, according to a timeline from Lee Enterprises.
In its announcement about the new properties, American Prairie said a 3.8 mile section of Bullwhacker Road will be open to the public, providing access to nearly 50,000 acres of public land that have been a point of dispute and embroiled in lawsuits for years.
In a statement, Fox said the organization is proud to provide more permanent access to “this special area of the Breaks.”
“While we will take some time to develop a comprehensive public access plan for this new property, the previously private stretch of Bullwhacker Road is now officially open to the public,” Fox said.
Randy Newberg, founder of Fresh Tracks and Hunt Talk media, also praised the acquisition, especially for hunters.
“This is a win for anyone who cares about public access to our shared lands,” said Newberg in a statement provided by American Prairie. “Our audience cares deeply about the Bullwhacker Allotment as it touts exceptional habitat and opportunities to hunt. It’s an area that’s both important to protect and for the public to access.”
American Prairie has been controversial in Montana.
Some farmers and ranchers have opposed its purchases of land as detrimental to agriculture and beef production. Political leaders, including Gov. Greg Gianforte and Attorney General Austin Knudsen, have opposed grazing by bison, reintroduced there in 2020 after being gone for 120 years, according to American Prairie.
But some former critics have started coming around, Saboe said. She pointed to an online forum where hunters are active, and one poster recently said they used to be on the “Save the Cowboy” side but appreciate the public access from American Prairie — and time will tell.
American Prairie broke a visitation record in 2024 for the seventh year in a row, the news release said. It saw 6,600 overnight visitors and more than 5,000 at its National Discovery Center in Lewistown.
In 2024, 56.6% of the bookings were from Montanans, but people from every state besides five — Hawaii, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Louisiana and West Virginia — were in the books, Saboe said.
One group came from Germany, many come from Washington and California, and many also visit from the Midwest, Saboe said.
Prairie land takes a long time to restore, but American Prairie sees signs of ecological hardiness, Saboe said.
The bison herd is healthy; cameras have caught images of rarely seen animals, such as badgers; and swift foxes, reintroduced on the bordering Fort Belknap Indian Community, are migrating onto American Prairie public lands, Saboe said.
Next month, American Prairie marks its 20th year of having bison, and Saboe said it’s a big milestone. She also said the animals are doing their jobs, living their lives in a way that supports other creatures.
They graze at varying levels, giving the prairie “a bad haircut,” but one that allows a large variety of birds to nest and find protection, Saboe said. She said migrating birds can spend as much as a month on a prairie stopover in the midst of their long trips.
The bison also wallow, or roll around in the dirt, and the depressions they create often fill with water and help insects, frogs and other amphibians thrive and reproduce, Saboe said. They also offer drinking water for birds.
The news release said American Prairie acquired 1,888 deeded acres adjacent to the south side of Anchor ranch. And in a third and separate transaction in the Cow Creek basin of Blaine County, the organization acquired an additional 5,401 acres.
“This property is located in the northern portion of the Breaks and extends American Prairie’s shared fenceline with the Fort Belknap Indian Community,” the news release said.
These three acquisitions bring American Prairie’s total habitat base to 603,657 acres, which comprises 167,070 deeded acres and 436,587 leased public acres.
In the news release, American Prairie said the new properties offer important wildlife habitat for elk, deer, pronghorn and upland birds, and they provide connectivity through the Monument to the CMR and north to the Bears Paw and Little Rockies ranges.
American Prairie said it intends to share a more detailed public access plan in the future to detail recreational uses on the new deeded acres, although it will first take time to familiarize itself with the land.
On both the Anchor Ranch and the 5,401-acre property with public grazing leases, the ranching families who lease the properties will remain in place, and the land will continue to be used for agricultural production, the news release said.
“We are really pleased to have the existing lessees stay on the ground where their cattle have been grazing, and we look forward to working with these ranching families,” Fox said in a statement.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP-1024x692.jpg,,,2025-09-06 13:57:28.740802

Transgender people incarcerated in Georgia prisons can once again receive some gender-affirming care, at least temporarily, following a judge’s order.
A federal judge ruled Thursday that a ban on using public funds for gender-affirming care in state prisons likely violates constitutional protections against cruel and unusual punishment.
According to court documents, there are about 340 people in the custody of the Georgia Department of Corrections who have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria, of whom 107 were receiving hormone replacement therapy as of the end of June. The system’s inmate population is more than 50,000.
Gov. Brian Kemp, who is a Republican, signed Senate Bill 185 into law in May, putting the ban into place. Attorneys for the state argued that Georgians’ tax dollars should not be spent on the controversial procedures.
“But ‘controversy’ does not take a medical question and turn it into a policy question,” U.S. District Court Judge Victoria Calvert wrote in her opinion pausing enforcement of the law while a legal challenge against it moves forward.
“An Eighth Amendment exception for political controversy could end up swallowing the rule that inmates are entitled to a baseline of medical care bearing some relationship to the standard of care provided to the public at large. If it were otherwise, prison officials could deny inmates the COVID-19 vaccine or treat a measles outbreak with chicken soup.”
Also on Thursday, the Georgia Board of Corrections voted to approve a rule change to comply with the law, specifying that no state funds may be used for surgical, hormone or cosmetic procedures to treat gender dysphoria. It allows for people already receiving treatment to have their dosage tapered to transition off the medication.
Calvert’s ruling directs the agency to stop tapering hormone medication and resume treatments for people who were previously receiving care and to consider new requests for gender-affirming treatments without taking the new state law  into account.
Emily Early, an attorney with the Center for Constitutional Rights, which challenged the state law on behalf of five transgender people incarcerated in Georgia prisons, said the judge’s decision is in line with rulings from other states and established precedent.
“We’re not carving out any sort of new standard,” she said. “The Eighth Amendment standard is that you cannot take away care from an individual when that care has been deemed medically necessary without any sort of medical judgment. And that’s exactly what the state of Georgia has done here, in violation of the Eighth Amendment and the court at the district court level has agreed with our clients’ position.”
A Department of Corrections spokesperson declined to comment citing pending litigation.
The defendants, who include Georgia Department of Corrections Commissioner Tyrone Oliver, have filed an appeal with the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta.
The bill’s author, Cataula Republican state Sen. Randy Robertson, expressed confidence that the law will eventually be upheld.
“I’m very comfortable with this,” he said in a phone call. “We knew that things like this were going to happen. Anytime you pass a controversial piece of legislation, you’re going to have individuals come out and challenge it, and that’s exactly what’s supposed to happen. Every piece of legislation that we pass out of the Capitol is subject to scrutiny by men and women who wear black robes, and that’s what we pay them for, and that’s their job. So this is just part of the process. I’m very confident that once everything is hashed out in the courtrooms, that the law will go into effect and will accomplish exactly what we need to accomplish for Georgia taxpayers.”
The bill was among the most controversial of the session as it worked its way through the Capitol this year. Four Senate Democrats broke ranks with their party to support it in that chamber, and four more did not vote. In the House, nearly the entire Democratic caucus walked out when it came up for a vote, a protest of a series of bills targeting the rights of transgender Georgians.
Transgender advocates worry that policies like Georgia’s are part of a cultural backlash against increased acceptance of transgender rights.

Now, a new firm is planning to pick up where Shell left off. (State of Alaska map)Last year, one of the world’s biggest oil companies walked away from a handful of promising leases in shallow waters just off the coast of Alaska’s North Slope.
The move by Shell, which some observers attributed to pressure from the company’s climate-conscious investors, raised questions about the future of oil development in the Arctic, particularly in more expensive and technically challenging areas offshore.
Companies can drill wells more cheaply, and with less environmental opposition, in parts of the Lower 48. If a deep-pocketed player like Shell wasn’t going to invest the hundreds of millions of dollars needed to search for oil on remote North Slope oil prospects, who would?
The answer, it now appears, is a company that’s nothing like Shell: Narwhal Exploration, a small, Texas-based firm.
Narwhal, whose officials did not respond to requests for comment, has been quietly gearing up for what industry observers describe as one of the industry’s most intriguing drilling efforts in recent years.
This winter, the company plans to sink as many as five exploration wells into state land beneath West Harrison Bay — a shallow inlet of the Beaufort Sea.
The effort targets an oil-rich geologic formation, the Nanushuk, that had been mostly disregarded by the industry until a decade ago. That’s the same oil deposit being tapped by two huge onshore oil fields already under construction: ConocoPhillips’ Willow project and Santos’ Pikka project.
The closest community to Narwhal’s leases, the Iñupiaq village of Nuiqsut, is some 30 miles south.
Narwhal’s plans signal a notable step toward development in a remote area that geologists have long thought could hold huge reserves, but that has seen little exploration. It would be the first company ever to drill in West Harrison Bay.
A discovery there could be “sizable,” said Pete Stokes, an Anchorage-based, private sector petroleum engineer and consultant who spent years evaluating oil prospects on the North Slope — including, at one point, West Harrison Bay.
“I think there’s probably something there,” said Stokes. “The question would be how big a discovery it is and whether it can be economically developed.”
Narwhal’s search for oil could cost some $150 million, according to the website of a Florida-based private equity group that’s helping the company raise money.
West Harrison Bay has garnered interest from the oil industry for more than a decade. Shell acquired its leases there in 2012, while Narwhal — whose exploration manager and chief operating officer used to work for Shell — purchased neighboring leases in 2016.
“It’s an area that we’ve been real eager to see somebody do some exploration on,” said Derek Nottingham, director of the Alaska Division of Oil and Gas.
Despite reports of favorable geologic data, including promising results from decades-old wells drilled nearby, Shell never conducted any major exploration work in West Harrison Bay. The company cited an inability to find a suitable co-owner to share some of the costs.
Narwhal told state regulators in 2022 that it had made several offers to buy Shell’s leases, or to form a drilling partnership. But the energy giant never agreed.
Narwhal officials grew impatient: During a state legislative hearing last year they publicly criticized the commissioner of the state natural resources department for being “unwilling to hold Shell accountable” for not drilling on its leases or selling them.
A few weeks after the hearing, Shell announced that it was relinquishing its leases.
In a state auction last fall, a Narwhal affiliate called EE Partners and another privately owned company, Juneau Oil and Gas, collectively spent almost $9 million buying up the remaining tracts in West Harrison Bay — including Shell’s former holdings.

Juneau Oil and Gas, which outbid EE Partners on a number of parcels, has not informed the state oil and gas division of any plans to drill wells on its leases this winter, said Sean Clifton, an agency spokesperson.
The company, which didn’t respond to a request for comment, mainly focuses on prospects in the Gulf of Mexico, according to its website. But its manager, Brad Juneau, has ties to Alaska: He helped co-found Contango Ore, which holds several mining prospects in the state and owns a stake in the large-scale Manh Choh gold mine, near the Interior town of Tok.
Even if a company made a big discovery in West Harrison Bay, the infrastructure needed to start producing oil would take years to develop, given the logistical hurdles involved with getting it to market.
The leases in the bay are on submerged lands owned by the state of Alaska, whose more flexible permitting regime could allow development to move more quickly than in nearby federally managed areas like the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, according to industry observers. Development on state land also would give Alaska a greater share of royalty payments.
Drilling in West Harrison Bay would be closer to shore and shallower than at the far offshore prospect that Shell unsuccessfully drilled in the Chukchi Sea a decade ago. Other companies have successfully developed near-shore prospects on the North Slope.
Still, West Harrison Bay is “really remote,” said Nottingham. “There are some distinct logistical challenges in exploring, developing and producing that area.”
Building an oil field there could cost more than $8 billion, according to an estimate cited by Narwhal in a 2024 filing with state regulators. That’s roughly the amount ConocoPhillips is spending to develop Willow and more than double Santos’ construction costs at Pikka.
Narwhal has so far released few details about this winter’s drilling plans to regulators or the public. In various state and federal permit applications, it has outlined plans for summer field work, including sonar studies to help determine precise drilling locations.
The Center for Biological Diversity, a conservation group, raised several concerns about the impacts of oil exploration in West Harrison Bay in a June letter responding to Narwhal’s application for a permit under the federal Marine Mammal Protection Act.
The project “threatens the survival of threatened and endangered ice seals, bowhead whales, and other Arctic wildlife,” the group said in that 10-page letter.
The permit, which federal regulators ultimately granted, allows Narwhal to disturb 20 bowhead whales and more than 2,000 seals.

BEAR — Caravel quarterback Matthew Rice settled under center with just under 10 minutes to
play in the third quarter, positioned slightly across midfield. Rice took the third down snap,
rolled out to his right and zipped a pass to his senior receiver Tisyn Witcher along the right
sideline.
Witcher evaded a string of defenders in his path to score the Buccaneer’s first of five touchdowns
in the second half, defeating Red Lion Christian Academy, 42-18, Friday night.
The Buccaneer’s win was their first of the season and the first for the program as the newest
member of the 3A class.
Caravel was moved up to class 3A in December as part of a football realignment that moved
eight schools to new levels. Caravel won back to back 2A state championships the prior two
seasons and were runner up in 2022 before making the jump to 3A this season.
Caravel’s offense certainly looked the part of a 3A offense scoring touchdowns on all five of its
second half offensive possessions.
Witcher scored two of the five adding a pair of touchdown receptions to his rushing touchdown
that opened the scoring in the first quarter. Senior running back Joshua Roy carried Caravel’s
other three scores through the endzone accumulating over 200 yards on the ground for the
Buccaneer offense.
Red Lion strung together a trio of touchdown drives in the second half to try and chip away at
the Caravel lead, starting with a scoring drive that consisted of a single play.
Following a Caravel touchdown, Lion’s senior quarterback Evan Budinger lined up at his own 37
yard line in the shotgun formation with two receivers on his left and a running back behind him.
Budinger faked the hand off, took a small step back and lofted the ball to junior receiver Raheem
Spencer Jr. just as he crossed the Buccaneer’s 35 yard line. The ball fell majestically into his
hands and Spencer Jr. finished the play by sprinting through the left side of the endzone scoring
the Lion’s first touchdown.
Budinger scored the final two Red Lion touchdowns in the final six minutes of fourth quarter
with a pair of short runs near the goal line. Despite their tremendous effort, the Lions remain
winless through a difficult portion of their season facing two 3A teams in Salesianum and
Caravel right at the start.
Red Lion’s next game will be at home against Delaware County Christian School located in
Pennsylvania.
Caravel’s next game is a home matchup against undefeated St. Georges Technical High School.
This will be the Buccaneer’s first in class game this season.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Picture4.png,,,2025-09-06 08:56:18.289386

Another said the decision should be left to local school districts, while a potential candidate is seeking local input on the issue.
Most school districts in South Dakota already have a policy in place that doesn’t allow cellphones in classrooms. About one-third of school districts take the further step of removing or locking away cellphones during class or school hours, based on a South Dakota Searchlight survey of superintendents and analysis of published school policies.
South Dakota’s lone U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, a Republican, announced three days after the publication of Searchlight’s story that, if elected governor next year, he would seek a statewide prohibition on student cellphone access during class time.
One-third of SD school districts remove or lock away student phones

“The state constitution makes it clear that kids should have quality education,” Johnson told Searchlight. “The state government setting a broad-stroke policy and then having the execution of that strategy and management done at the local level will give us the best of both worlds.”
South Dakota is one of 24 states to not implement a statewide policy or law to ban or limit cellphone use in classrooms. State lawmakers considered a statewide effort last legislative session, but held off after school administrators said they’d prefer to determine policies at the local level. The Legislature instead passed a resolution encouraging school boards to implement such policies.
According to a 2024 Pew Research Center survey, 72% of U.S. high school teachers say cellphone distraction is a major problem in the classroom. Some research suggests student performance improves after schools ban cellphones.
Other candidates weigh in
Two other announced candidates for governor said they support efforts to establish a statewide law or policy removing cellphones from classrooms.
South Dakota House Speaker Jon Hansen, R-Dell Rapids, would support a statewide policy to ensure students focus “on learning, not on distractions” and foster healthier social interactions.

Democrat Robert Arnold, a 20-year-old college student who said he plans to run for governor, said a statewide policy or law would benefit students, but added that other efforts would be more impactful on student wellbeing, including providing universal free lunch and ensuring the federal Department of Education remains intact. Arnold said Johnson should support those efforts.
“Not a peep from him about policies that will have a real impact on our people, but he’ll of course propose legislation that at least makes it look like he cares about our children’s education,” Arnold said in an emailed statement.
Aberdeen businessman and Republican Toby Doeden said phones in classrooms are “roadblocks” to education and a “breeding ground” for negative influences and distractions. But he said school boards should address the issue.
“Allowing state leaders to mandate individual policy changes at the local level would set a terrible precedent and is an obvious constitutional overreach,” Doeden said in a text message. “As governor, I would absolutely lean on our local school boards to ban cellphones from the classrooms.”

Current Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden has not announced his intention to run, but is expected to enter the race. The Rhoden administration is asking school leaders if they prefer cellphone policies that come from the local or state level, spokesperson Josie Harms said in an emailed statement.
First Lady Sandy Rhoden spent the first few months of the Rhoden administration visiting schools to talk about the consequences of using cellphones during school hours.
Students at Platte-Geddes School District, the first in the state to lock away student cellphones during the school day three years ago, said the restriction improved relationships and academics, the first lady said in a statement. The students started to spend less time on their phones outside of school, too, leading to better self-discipline.
“Our students have so much to gain, and the constant distraction impedes their ability to learn,” she said.
School administrator representative encourages local control
Rob Monson, executive director of School Administrators of South Dakota, said school administrators prefer to handle the issue themselves. He surveyed members of his organization last year, when legislators considered introducing a bill.
“I think most school districts are doing what they feel they should and what’s best for their school districts and patrons,” Monson said.
Monson added that if a bill is introduced this legislative session, his organization will likely oppose it. 
Johnson hopes the Legislature passes a bill this winter setting a statewide standard, saying it’s a “no-brainer.”
“Once you identify an approach that clearly increases educational outcomes,” Johnson said, “that’s when it’s time to come together as a state and make sure every student is able to benefit from that policy.”

“We’re looking at a framework that responds to the budget realities while also keeping student needs at the forefront,” Yazmin Carretero, the board’s government relations and policy analyst, told members in their August meeting. 
The legislative platform communicates the board’s top priorities to the Legislature and will guide the legislative committee’s advocacy efforts during the 2026 legislative session. 
State lawmakers grappled this past session with a projected budget shortfall of more than $12 billion over four years.
They largely preserved funding for K-12 education in the 2025-27 budget, even increasing funding for special education programs and removing the artificial cap on state funding for students with disabilities. 
While that investment was a historic win for special education, there were reductions in other areas for elementary and secondary schools, and colleges. 
The 2025-27 budget reduced funding for college financial aid, and pared support for numerous grant-funded offerings such the Outdoor Learning Grants program.
Lawmakers and Gov. Bob Ferguson will write a supplemental budget during the 60-day  session that starts in January.
Superintendent of Public Instruction Chris Reykdal said Wednesday that his biggest supplemental budget request will be for $110 million per year to address inflation impacts on schools. 
“That’s a necessary thing,” Reykdal said, adding that he will wait to make his “big requests” in the 2027 long session when a new two-year budget is written. 
Last year, Reykdal sought $350.7 million in the two-year budget to cover inflationary costs of materials and supplies. The request was partially granted, with the budget including a $213,832 inflation adjustment.  
Meanwhile, the legislative platform of the Board of Education also avoids big asks and focuses instead on safeguarding what it considers essential elements for Washington public schools. 
The platform, which will be finalized in October, will stress the importance of maintaining civil rights protections, student supports and oversight and accountability systems. 
The board will advocate for the restoration of funding for alternative and nontraditional learning models, and for additional student supports like the High School and Beyond Plan. 
“We’re moving away from really just asking for a lot of new things and instead focusing on protecting the gains that we’ve made and the progress that we’ve made … and just restoring a few things that we’ve lost,” Carretero told the board in August.
She said the legislative team is “taking a thoughtful approach in investing in what works” to meet the most urgent needs. 
“These are decisions that are not to be made lightly or easily,” she said. 
There will be some minimal budget requests: a new contract for small agency IT services and a new administrator to handle an increasing volume of public records requests. 
“We are spending a lot of time and energy on this, and we don’t have dedicated staff,” Randy Spaulding, Board of Education executive director, told the board Thursday.

It’s the latest project from Renewablade, a company in Bondurant that has found a way to use the materials and, in turn, alleviate the issue of what to do with the massive hunks of fiberglass and resin. 
Brian Meng with Renewablade said the company is finally in production after several years of research and development to figure out the best way to grind up the blades and incorporate them into the concrete.

Right now, Renewablade makes three main products: the retaining wall blocks, like those used at the Premier Credit Union project, commercial highway barriers, and larger barriers used to bunker agricultural materials. 
“We’re not going to be building any superhighways with it — yet. We’re not going to be building skyscrapers with it. But certainly non-structural, free-cast concrete, I think it’s a great situation,” Meng said.
Premier Credit Union CEO Megan Tjernagel said the decision to use the recycled-blade blocks shows how the company cares for its environment. 
“By incorporating recycled wind turbine blades into this project, we’re showing that financial institutions can lead with purpose, embrace sustainable solutions, and make investments that benefit both our members and the communities we serve,” Tjernagel said in a press release. 
Building a blade recycling program
Meng has spent his career in the recycling industry and several years ago started to notice the need for recycling the blades, which by nature must be replaced about every 20 years. 
One study estimated by 2050 there would be more than 2 million tons of retired wind turbine blades in the U.S. 
Lawsuits cropped up in Iowa and other states as officials took notice of areas where the blades were being dumped and abandoned. It turned out the parties dumping the blades had been paid to recycle them but weren’t doing so.
“There’s a lot of people that have said they were going to be able to do that,” Meng said. “We’re one of the rare companies that actually recycles them into a product.” 
Another Iowa-based company, REGEN Fiber, processes the blades into a grind that can be added to various types of concrete. A company in Boone has focused on the turbine generators and recycles rare earth materials from decommissioned wind turbines. 
Meng said Renewablade collects the blades from Iowa turbines, which are easier to transport to the company’s processing facility in Earlham, and from as far as Seattle and Maine. 
Meng said it “works well” when the decommissioned blades are close to home. For example, Renewablade recycled some of the blades that were damaged in a tornado near Greenfield in 2024. The blades can be around 200 feet long, or about the wingspan of a Boeing 747 jet, which makes transportation difficult and expensive. 
The scale also means these blades take up a lot of space in a landfill. And yet, once ground up into concrete blocks, Renewablade was able to repurpose the blades from one whole turbine in just one small parking lot wall. 
“The size reduction is a big part of it,” Meng said. 
Despite early pushback in Earlham towards the business, Meng said the company is fully operational this year with big plans to expand. Meng said the company is eying expansions into the UK and Texas. 
“Now it really is just a matter of being able to have more customers come in and want to take the products,” Meng said.

(Sirisak Boakaew/Getty Images)Ada County’s commissioners will soon decide zoning code changes that will impact the price we pay for electricity and the quality of the air we breathe. 
Because some have argued that large solar projects endanger farmland in Ada County, the commission is considering a recommendation by the Planning and Zoning Commission to effectively ban large-scale solar development on most land in Ada County, even if it has never been in agricultural production. That is an extreme approach that will saddle Idaho Power ratepayers with higher energy prices while increasing our reliance on more polluting energy resources.
Idaho Power’s 20-year energy plan predicts large increase in customer growth and peak energy load

We face explosive growth in electricity demand and prices. Idaho Power has already proposed a $199 million dollar rate increase to the Idaho Public Utilities Commission that will significantly increase our monthly electricity bills. To supply the future electricity we need at a price that we can afford, Idaho Power’s 2025 Integrated Resource Plan contends that we should build 1,445 MW of new solar capacity between 2026 and 2033 … along with 700 MW of wind and 450 MW of gas generation. Their analysis argues that solar is the cheapest new energy capacity and our best energy choice. 
Unfortunately, the recommended ordinance by the Planning and Zoning Commission would subject proposed solar projects to vague, undefined standards while sharply limiting the land available to them. Doing so would effectively ban large scale solar in Ada County and hamstring Idaho Power’s efforts to supply additional electricity at reasonable cost. 
Moreover, telling landowners that they cannot lease their land to a solar developer for a 30-year period is also an assault on private property rights and a case of clear government overreach. 
The threat to farmland is not solar; the threat to farmland is rising farm production costs, uncertain commodity prices, markets roiled by trade disputes, labor shortages, and the ever-present pressure to subdivide and develop. 
Solar can help keep land in the hands of farm families since the land can be leased for energy production rather than sold for strip malls and housing developments. Solar installations can even be compatible with agricultural uses as seen in a new trend called Agrivoltaics, the practice of combining solar panel installations with agricultural land use. 
For example, some farmers in the Midwest are raising livestock or cool weather crops in pastures with solar panels to provide shade and preserve soil moisture— a new concept with the potential to achieve synergies between food and energy production. It may be that combining solar with agriculture will enhance agricultural yields, reduce water consumption, increase land use efficiency, and raise farm incomes. 
This proposed ordinance will drive Idaho energy prices even higher than they are already poised to go, and it will take what is arguably our cleanest and cheapest energy option off the table in Ada County. It would be a grave mistake for the commissioners to adopt it.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, long considered the nation’s — if not the world’s — premier public health organization, is mired in a crisis that not only threatens Americans’ health but also its very survival as a leading public health institution.
The degree of this crisis was on full display during Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s Sept. 4, 2025, testimony before the U.S. Senate.
In the hearing, Kennedy openly criticized CDC professionals’ response to the COVID-19 pandemic, saying “the people at CDC who oversaw that process, who put masks on our children, who closed our schools, are the people who will be leaving.”
Kennedy’s hearing came on the heels of a contentious week in which Kennedy fired the CDC’s director, Susan Monarez, spurring 12 members of the Senate Finance Committee — including 11 Democrats and independent Bernie Sanders — to call on Kennedy to resign from his position.
At least four top CDC leaders resigned following Monarez’s ouster, citing pressure from Kennedy to depart from recommendations based on sound scientific evidence.
I am a teaching professor and public health professional. Like many of my colleagues, the disruption happening at the CDC in recent months has left me scrambling to find alternate credible sources of health information and feeling deeply concerned for the future of public health.
 
The CDC’s unraveling
These leadership shakeups come on the heels of months of targeted actions aimed at unraveling the CDC’s structure, function and leadership as it has existed for decades.
The turmoil began almost as soon as President Donald Trump took office in January 2025, when his administration enacted sweeping cuts to the CDC’s workforce that health experts broadly agree jeopardized its ability to respond to emerging health threats.
Trump used executive orders to limit CDC employees’ communication with the public and other external agencies, like the World Health Organization.
Within weeks, he ordered as much as 10% of the overall workforce to be cut.
Soon after, Kennedy — who was newly appointed by Trump — began undoing long-standing CDC institutions, like the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, replacing all 17 of its members in a move that was widely denounced by health experts.
Critics pointed to a lack of qualifications for the new committee members, with more than half never having published research on vaccinations and many having predetermined hostility toward vaccines.
In June, more than 20 authoritative organizations, including the National Medical Association and American Academy of Pediatrics, expressed serious concerns for the health impacts of overhauling the advisory committee.
 
How Monarez’s removal spurred the crisis

	Public health leaders had cheered the July confirmation of Monarez as the CDC’s new director, seeing her nomination as a welcome relief to those who value evidence-based practice in public health. Monarez is an accomplished scientist and career public servant.
Many viewed her as a potential voice of scientific wisdom amid untrained officials appointed by Trump, who has a track record of policies that undermine public health and science.
In her role as acting director, to which she was appointed in January, Monarez had quietly presided over the wave of cuts to the CDC workforce and other moves that drastically reshaped the agency and weakened the country’s capacity to steward the nation’s health.
Yet Monarez had “red lines” that she would not cross: She would not fire CDC leadership, and she would not endorse vaccine policies that ran contrary to scientifically supported recommendations.
According to Monarez, Kennedy asked her to do both in an Aug. 27 meeting. When she refused, he asked her to resign.
Her lawyers pushed back, arguing that only the president had the authority to remove her, stating: “When CDC Director Susan Monarez refused to rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives and fire dedicated health experts, she chose protecting the public over serving a political agenda. For that, she has been targeted.”
Ultimately, the White House made her dismissal official later that evening.
 
An agency in turmoil

	Further exemplifying and deepening the crisis at the agency, on Aug. 8, a gunman who had expressed anger over COVID-19 vaccinations opened fire on CDC headquarters, killing a police officer.
Many health workers attributed this directly to misinformation spread by Kennedy. The shooting amplified tensions and made tangible the sense of threat under which the CDC has been operating over the tumultuous months since Trump’s second term began. One employee stated that “the CDC is crumbling.”
Public health experts, including former CDC directors, are sounding the alarm, speaking out about the precariousness of the agency’s position. Some are questioning whether the CDC can even survive.
 
A crisis of trust

	Even before the most recent shock waves, Americans said they were losing trust and confidence in CDC guidance: In April, 44% of U.S. adults polled said that they will place less trust in CDC recommendations under the new leadership. This would undoubtedly undermine the U.S. response if the country faces another public health challenge requiring a rapid, coordinated response, like COVID-19.
In addition to installing new members on the vaccine advisory committee, Kennedy abruptly changed the recommendations for flu and COVID-19 vaccines without input from the CDC or the vaccine advisory committee, and contrary to data presented by CDC scientists.
Public health professionals and advocates are now warning the public that vaccine recommendations coming from the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices may not be trustworthy. They point to the lack of credibility in the review process for the new committee, the fact that members have made statements contrary to scientific evidence in the past, and failure to apply an evidence-to-recommendations framework as compromising factors. Critics of the committee even describe a lack of basic understanding of the science behind vaccines.
Health impacts are being felt in real time, with health care providers reporting confusion among parents as a result of the conflicting vaccine recommendations. Now, those who want to be vaccinated are facing barriers to access, with major retailers placing new limits on vaccine access in the face of federal pressure. This as vaccination rates were already declining, largely due to misinformation.
The end result is an environment in which the credibility of the CDC is in question because people are unsure whether recommendations made in the CDC’s name are coming from the science and scientists or from the politicians who are in charge.
 
Filling the gaps

	Reputable organizations are working to fill the void created by the CDC’s precariousness and the fact that recommendations are now being made based on political will, rather than scientific evidence.
The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Gynecology have both released recommended vaccination schedules that, for the first time, diverge from CDC recommendations.
And medical organizations are discussing strategies that include giving more weight to their recommendations than the CDC’s and creating pathways for clinicians to obtain vaccines directly from manufacturers. These measures would create workarounds to compensate for CDC leadership voids.
Some states, including California, Oregon, Washington and New Mexico, are establishing their own guidance regarding vaccinations. Public health scientists and physicians are attempting to preserve data and surveillance systems that the Trump administration has been removing. But independent organizations may not be able to sustain this work without federal funding.
 
What’s at stake

	As part of its crucial work in every facet of public health, the CDC oversees larger-scale operations, both nationally and globally, that cannot simply be handed off to states or individual organizations. Some public health responses — such as to infectious diseases and foodborne illnesses — must be coordinated at the national level in order to be effective, since health risks are shared across state borders.
In a health information space that is awash with misinformation, having accurate, reliable health statistics and evidence-based guidelines is essential for public health educators like me to know what information to share and how to design effective health programs. Doctors and other clinicians rely on disease tracking to know how best to approach treating patients presenting with infections. The COVID-19 pandemic made clear the importance of laboratory science, a unified emergency response and rapid distribution of effective vaccines to the public.
One of the strengths of the American system of governance is its ability to approach challenges — including public health — in a coordinated way, having a federal level of cooperation that unifies state-level efforts.
The CDC has been the nation’s preeminent public health institution for more than eight decades as a result of its vast reach and unparalleled expertise. Right now, it’s all sitting at a precarious edge.

One has to wonder what drives people like Ron DeSantis and so-called conservatives who take every opportunity to disparage Florida’s diverse and vibrant LGBTQ community.
Why are they so insecure? What are they so afraid of?
Since he came into office, the governor has shown disdain to this maligned community, used disparaging language and, most of all, misused his political muscle in attempts to scare and bully.
Everything DeSantis does is contaminated by ideology. His actions are aimed at rendering invisible gays, queer, and trans people, plus Black and Brown people and other marginalized groups. That’s never gonna happen, but that’s not stopping him and his allies from doing everything they can to make people’s lives miserable.
Last month, DeSantis and various parts of his state apparatus, in concert with U.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, continued their harassment when the Florida Department of Transportation sent letters to at least 14 Florida cities, demanding that they remove rainbow and other painted crosswalks or lose millions in state and federal funding.
The issue has been simmering since a July 1 directive from Duffy, who gave U.S. governors 60 days to identify “safety improvements.”
“Roads are for safety, not political messages or artwork,” Duffy said in a statement at the time. He later elaborated: “Taxpayers expect their dollars to fund safe streets, not rainbow crosswalks. Political banners have no place on public roads. I’m reminding recipients of @USDOT roadway funding that it’s limited to features advancing safety, and nothing else. It’s that simple.”
A spokesperson for the Florida DOT told NBC News via email that the department has a duty to “ensure the safety and consistency of public roadways and transportation systems” and therefore ensure “roadways are not utilized for social, political, or ideological interests.”
‘Political purposes’
DeSantis echoed Duffy.
“We will not allow our state roads to be commandeered for political purposes,” he said on X.
One of the most egregious consequences to come out of DeSantis’ action was the recent dead-of-night painting over of the rainbow sidewalk by Florida transportation workers at a memorial set up at what used to be the Pulse nightclub. The memorial honors the 49 people fatally shot there in 2016 in what was the largest mass shooting in the country at the time.
Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer castigated the action on social media.
“We are devastated to learn that overnight the state painted over the Pulse Memorial crosswalk on Orange Avenue,” Dyer wrote. “This crosswalk not only enhanced safety and visibility for the large number of pedestrians visiting the memorial, it also served as a visual reminder of Orlando’s commitment to honor the 49 lives taken.”
Dyer asserted that the crosswalk, installed by the state in 2017, adheres to safety standards. Brandon Wolf, one of the Pulse shooting’s survivors, described the removal as a desecration of the deceased victims’ memories.
“In the dark of night, they came to erase our show of solidarity, our declaration that we will never forget,” he wrote on X. “The cowards who feel threatened by our lives should feel lucky they didn’t have to bury the ones they love — then watch the state come & desecrate their memory.”
One weird justification transportation officials offered is that the rainbow artwork on Ocean Drive and 12th Street in Miami Beach poses a risk for drivers and pedestrians.
Statistics reflect otherwise.
According to crash data, the intersection at 12th and Ocean has had just 15 accidents since the artwork was installed in 2018 — fewer than neighboring intersections at 10th Street (37 crashes) and 13th Street (23 crashes).
Erasure
The Rev. Susan Gage, an Episcopal priest who ministers to a number of LGPTQ people and members, told me she is troubled but unsurprised by the DeSantis administration’s attempts as erasure.
“I found out about it probably the same way everybody else did. People in Orlando woke up and found out the crosswalk at Pulse was removed overnight,” she said. “Here in Tallahassee, some kids painted crosswalks that were colorful with stars, music, stuff that made it look pretty. Some of that was all done with private money including the Knight Foundation as a part of a private-public partnership with the city.”
That’s gone now, too.
Gage, like other critics, sees what DeSantis is doing as narrow-mindedness bathed in petty grievance and the desire to punish.
“I wonder, is this really the best use of public money?” she asked. “Like the tearing up of Black Lives Matter Plaza in D.C., this shows that they are going to try to erase: Blacks, queers, everything that isn’t the standard of the white male. It was all cool until Ron DeSantis said it wasn’t.”
The Rev. Terrence Taylor, who has led the Church of the Transfiguration in Miami Gardens for 15 years, said he’s at a loss to explain the DeSantis foolishness.
“It’s upsetting,” he said. “Why, with all the priorities you say you have, are you’re doing this? He’s playing to the base and there’s an appetite for it, playing to people’s fears, resurrecting things I thought was settled. Why are we on this now? What is your point other than to harass people? Why would you do this.? It has to feed a base or something. It doesn’t feed me but it feeds someone.”
‘Deeply offensive’
Those most affected aren’t taking this lying down. There have been protests across South Florida and in Orlando, where demonstrators replaced the rainbow colors in chalk while DeSantis sent minions to repaint the space and posted state troopers. Taxpayers’ money at work!
The anger is widespread and palpable.
State Sen. Shevrin Jones wrote an op-ed describing DeSantis’s actions at the Pulse nightclub as “a deeply offensive decision.”
“DeSantis’ erasure of the memorial is not merely a disregard for a physical space, but a profound desecration of sacred ground and a grievous affront to the memory of the 49 lives lost and the countless others impacted by the horrific mass shooting targeting the LGBTQ community,” he wrote.
“Erasing the rainbow crosswalk was not a neutral act of urban planning, but a calculated move that disregards the sanctity of a site forever marked by unimaginable pain and loss.”
Jones argues this serves “as chilling reminders of the ongoing struggle against those who seek to deny history and diminish the suffering of marginalized communities. It signals a deeply troubling lack of respect for the victims and survivors, as well as for the broader LGBTQ community and its allies who have found solace and strength in this sacred space.”
Fort Lauderdale Mayor Dean Trantalis concurred.
“It’s an attempt to try to erase the presence of anything to do with the LGBTQ community,” Trantalis said. “… It could be the gay community this year — who knows what’s going to be next year. We don’t know where they are going to keep trying to eliminate the diversity of what represents Florida.”
Gage, Trantalis, and Taylor said state politicians should be concentrating on Florida’s many more pressing priorities.
“Honestly, I wish the state would focus more on affordable insurance, homelessness, and finding affordable housing,” said Trantalis.
Orange County Democratic state Sen. Carlos Guillermo Smith complained the city of Orlando never had an opportunity to appeal.
“The DeSantis administration is resorting to deliberate lies to justify their indefensible, state-sponsored vandalism at the Pulse nightclub site, done without notice or consent from the City of Orlando,” Smith said. “This crosswalk was not only a tribute to those murdered in 2016, it was also an FDOT-approved installation designed to enhance pedestrian safety for the countless people who come here to pay their respects year after year.”
DeSantis didn’t enforce a rule or new law, Smith asserted.
“He invented an excuse to punish LGBTQ visibility and draw attention to himself. Nothing in Florida law requires the state to act with such callousness and cruelty. Even the first FDOT’s memo stated that they used their discretion to grant exceptions. The state cannot revoke the legal rights of municipalities to administrative appeal and review. That’s why cities and residents are fighting back,” he added.
Smith said cities “are exploring legal options against the State, and Floridians are responding back with new murals and art installations that are bigger, queerer, and more colorful than Ron ever imagined. They are sending a clear message: we will not be erased, and love always wins.

Wes Moore, Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott, Baltimore Police Commissioner Rich Worley, Maryland State Police Superintendent Col. Roland L. Butler Jr. and Maryland Transportation Authority Police Chief Joseph Scott. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Gov. Wes Moore (D) is ordering a surge in law enforcement presence in Baltimore, following weeks of sparring with President Donald Trump (R) and his threat to deploy troops to deal with crime in the city.
Neither Moore nor Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott (D) mentioned Trump by name Friday as they announced plans for a “renewed collaboration” between the Baltimore City Police Department and the Maryland State Police. But many of their remarks responded to charges by Trump, who recently called Baltimore a crime “hellhole.”
Moore said violent crime has been dropping over the last few years in Baltimore, and that the increased police resources will continue efforts to bring down violent crime even further.
“We are proud of the progress that we’ve been able to make, and we’re all very, very concerned about how much work still needs to happen,” Moore said. “If one person does not feel safe in their neighborhood, that is one too many.”
The announcement came at a news conference outside St. John’s Evangelical Lutheran Church, after a brief walk through the Park Heights neighborhood by officials. Despite his high-profile public feud with the president, Moore insisted that Friday’s announcement was not “inspired” by recent comments by Trump.
“Nothing we do is inspired by the president,” he said, in response to a reporters’ questions.
While it may not have been inspired by Trump, Friday’s announcement included repeated references to the president’s continued threats to deploy the National Guard to Baltimore and other large cities, as he has done in Washington, D.C. over the last month.
Moore welcomes help from FBI, other agencies, but says National Guard should stay home

Moore has repeatedly pushed back on the use of National Guard troops for crime prevention, arguing that Guard members are not trained for policing and that such a deployment would be disrespectful to them and of little benefit to residents.
“We do not need an occupation. We do not need people putting in performative and theatrical resources because they do not care about the actual results,” Moore said.
Trump, who deployed Guard members and active-duty Marines to Los Angeles in June to quell immigration protests, followed up last month by sending the National Guard into Washington, D.C. The D.C. Guard members, along with Guard units from six Republican states, have been backing up local police, but have also been involved in removing homeless encampments and aiding with immigration arrests.
In recent weeks, Trump has dangled the possibility of entering other cities, like Baltimore and Chicago, that he said were “so far gone” in terms of  violent crime. The list has continued to grow, with New Orleans and Portland, Oregon, the most recent potential targets.
Moore shot back on Aug. 21 at the president’s suggestion that troops should be deployed to Baltimore, telling Trump to “keep our names out of your mouth.” Moore also invited the president Trump to come walk the streets of Baltimore to get a firsthand look at the city’s crime prevention efforts.
The back-and-forth has continued since, with Trump again disparaging Baltimore earlier this week, saying that Moore needs to “get rid of the criminals” in the city.
“These are hard-core criminals,” Trump said at a Tuesday press conference. “They’re not going to be good in 10 years, in five years, in 20 years, in two years they’re going to be criminals. They were born to be criminals.”
Scott also did not name the president in his Friday comments but clearly referenced those comments and pushed back against Trump’s threat to deploy the National Guard in Baltimore.
“We do not need troops on our streets,” Scott said. “We do need folks who want to be at the table to recognize that the people of Baltimore are humans — that our young people are not born to be criminals. They’re resources to invest in, not problems to be solved.”
Scott has a personal connection to the area where the press conference took place: He grew up in the Park Heights neighborhood, and said that he witnessed a shooting in the area growing up.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“None of us are celebrating, saying that we have solved gun violence,” Scott said, adding that the use of the Maryland State Police will help provide more government resources and allow the use of evidence-based policies targeted to a continued reduction in crime.
Maryland State Police Superintendent Col. Roland L. Butler Jr. said with the renewed partnership, “there will be no daylight” between the state police department and the city police.
“We intend to go out and provide the services that you need to feel safe,” Butler said, “and enhance the safety you already feel.”
Baltimore City Police Commissioner Rich Worley agreed.
“Adding additional resources to our neighborhoods is one important step towards creating safer communities and improving the quality of life in our city,” he said. “We have work to do, especially in communities like park heights.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025_sept5_moorescottcops-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-06 01:56:32.993791

Dozier-Williams, who says that's where Maryland needs to lead.","A former federal worker who has lost his job at the Department of Education walks out of the building with boxes of belongings in Washington, D.C. on March 28, 2025. (Photo by Jess Daninhirsch/Capital News Service)I’m a Marylander, a former federal employee and a father raising my family here. Watching federal troops roll into Washington, D.C., on the theory that force can stand in for safety, I keep returning to a simpler truth Maryland has proven: Durable public safety rests on economic security. Caring about well-being starts with protecting work, wages and the least-advantaged Marylanders when Washington pulls back on jobs.
In June, Maryland lost an estimated 3,500 federal jobs — the largest one-month drop in nearly 30 years. Since January, the state has shed 12,700 federal positions — the most of any state. This is not to imply that laid-off public servants will commit offenses; it does mean income shocks ripple through rents, small-business cash flow, and youth opportunity — the very neighborhood conditions that drive welfare concerns.
The consequences of Washington’s job policy are arriving here first and hardest.
The exposure to such losses is structural, as roughly 229,000 Marylanders draw a federal paycheck, and federal activity pours well over $100 billion into our economy each year. When that machine slows or shifts, Main Streets from Suitland to Bethesda feel it acutely.
To his credit, Gov. Wes Moore moved to create a one-stop portal, fast-tracking state hiring and launching fairs and pipelines so displaced federal workers can land on their feet quickly. That instinct was right, though a temporary hiring freeze later paused the effort. With jobs already slipping and more losses possible, Annapolis should build a permanent jobs shock-absorber for Maryland’s labor market. An automatic stabilizer that snaps on whether the trigger is federal layoffs, AI-driven displacement, or the next sectoral shake-out.

Picture the Friday when a paycheck stops: the car note comes due, a shift gets cut at the corner shop, a teenager skips summer work to watch siblings. None of that makes headlines, but it’s where safety is won or lost.
A jobs stabilizer isn’t a campaign slogan; it’s a short bridge between one employer and the next, so families don’t fall and main streets don’t hollow. In Maryland, we know how to build bridges. Let’s build this one — quietly, quickly and on purpose so a job loss becomes a landing, not a spiral.
Consider three ways Maryland can meet this moment for displaced federal workers and the communities that depend on their paychecks:
Guarantee 60- to 90-day reemployment for displaced feds and contractors. Stand up a permanent “Feds to Maryland” program that (a) preclears skills into state and local classifications, (b) funds short, paid “bridge” upskilling sprints, and (c) offers time-limited wage insurance when workers take a lower-paid role to stay employed. This complements the administration’s earlier state-hiring push by turning a one-off response into lasting, economic development infrastructure.
Make our workforce innovation-ready. Use Maryland’s AI Subcabinet to identify occupations most exposed to automation (admin, compliance, customer support) and bolt them into registered apprenticeships and short-cycle credentials under the RAISE framework. Implement a public AI risk map by county and agency to ensure training dollars align with actual exposure. The goal isn’t to fear AI or technological innovation; it’s to ensure workers can move up the value chain and leverage it to their advantage before disruption lands.
Stabilize neighborhoods when incomes dip. Establish a Prompt Pay Guarantee and a Family Bridge. Pay small and minority-owned contractors on time, every time; help families cover a month or two of basics during a layoff; and work with community banks to keep borrowing costs down by placing a slice of state cash with community banks in the hardest-hit corridors so they can lend more cheaply. That’s economic justice in practice.
Again, federal layoffs are not a direct, one-way road to violent crimes. I’m arguing that income shocks, not ideology, turn ordinary stresses into hard choices. The evidence is clearest for property crime when unemployment rises; violence is more complex.
Baltimore’s progress shows that prevention plus opportunity tracks with safety. Which is why, if Washington retrenches while projecting force, Maryland should double down on the basics: Keep paychecks coming and cash moving so strain doesn’t become desperation.
We can’t steer Washington, but we can steady Maryland. In a state that has chosen “work, wages, and wealth” as its north star, the task now is simple and serious: Create a safety net that employs workers and deploys funds to families so shocks become transitions, not crises. Measure success by this: the least-advantaged households stay housed, small firms keep hours posted, and workers step into the next job before the last one is gone.

CVS confirmed the Nevada Board of Pharmacy issued new guidance Friday and as a result the vaccines will be made available, though they offered no timeline on when people can expect to receive them.
“Following today’s regulatory action by the Nevada Board of Pharmacy, CVS Pharmacy will ensure COVID-19 vaccinations are available as soon as possible at our pharmacies throughout the state,” a company spokesperson said in an emailed statement Friday.
CVS previously announced it would not offer the updated COVID vaccine in Nevada and two other states because they only allow pharmacists to administer drugs that have been approved by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. That panel has not approved this season’s COVID vaccine and now includes vaccine skeptics appointed by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
According to The Nevada Independent, which first reported the new guidance, the Board of Pharmacy’s position is that pharmacists are allowed to widely administer vaccines approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
Nevada has a COVID vaccine access problem; legislative leader calls for state action

The Board of Pharmacy did not immediately respond to the Current Friday afternoon. The board’s website, which typically lists regulations and announcements, is currently offline because it was impacted by the recent ransomware attack on the state’s information technology.
A spokesperson for Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro, who on Thursday called the state to take action as soon as possible to address vaccine access, said the legislative leader plans to review the new guidance “to determine whether this is a sufficient long-term fix or whether it’s just a temporary solution and further action may be needed.”

The donations come from federal workers, and support charities they choose, around the country and the world. (Photo by Senior Airman Matthew Gilmore/U.S. Air Force)Mary Helfrich said that St. Vincent de Paul of Baltimore is “grateful for every dollar that we get” to support its charitable work — which is why the federal government’s decision to put the annual Combined Federal Campaign on hold is concerning.
Like officials at a number of charities around the state, Helfrich said a pause in the CFC won’t be catastrophic for her organization. But it’s not good news either, and she said it could be particularly hard on smaller charities.
“We’re grateful for every dollar that we get, but there’s other organizations that work with all volunteers,” said Helfrich, St. Vincent de Paul’s chief advancement officer. “If they’re working with very limited resources, it [the CFC pause] will affect them … It hurts all organizations, but it’s particularly going to hurt small organizations that depend on those dollars to operate completely.”
The Combined Federal Campaign facilitates donations by federal workers around the nation to thousands of charities, through regular payroll deductions or volunteer hours. Workers choose the charity they want their money to support: In Maryland, hundreds of charities receive funding from the CFC, supporting causes that include education, health, museums, the environment and more.
The CFC solicitation period, when employees can make pledges and donations to charities, typically begins in early September. But this year, the Office of Personnel Management asked agencies to pause all support to the CFC while it decides whether or not to continue the 64-year-old program.
No reason was given for the pause, and OPM said in a statement that “no final decision has been made on the program.”

The CFC has raised more than $9 billion since it was established in 1961, and more than $70 million in 2023 alone, according to the program’s website.
St. Vincent de Paul, which supports people facing poverty in Baltimore and surrounding counties, gets about $20,000 a year toward its $32 million budget, so the pause is not fatal, Helfrich said. But it does make for an “uncertain future” for some of their programs, and comes at a time when federal funding cuts, firings and forced retirements will affect the number of donors, she said.
Laura Osuri, the executive director of Homes Not Borders, described the CFC pause as a “death by 1,000 cuts,” as it comes on top of recent federal funding and grant cuts.
Homes Not Borders helps refugees and forced migrants in the Washington, D.C., area navigate life in the U.S. by assisting them with home set-ups, income opportunities and career training. The organization operates on about $800,000 per year, with about $15,000 of that coming from the CFC, Osuri said.
“I don’t think we’re going to be cutting programs or staff because of it [the CFC pause], but it’s just another burden to try and raise more funds for us,” she said. “Even though it [the CFC check] is not much, it is steady, and we know it’s coming.”
That was echoed by Elise Krikau, chief philanthropy officer at the Maryland Food Bank, who said it has seen struggles with its “diversity of funding.”
The organization recently faced cuts to its funding from two government programs: The Emergency Food Assistance Program and the Local Food Purchase Agreement. Krikau said the food bank typically gets about $225,000 per year from the CFC, which she called a small part of its budget, but a large amount of money when thinking about overall funding cuts.
“This is one piece — but it’s a piece in a big puzzle,” Krikau said. “If everything gets stilted and there’s impacts from every direction, that can cumulatively impact our bottom line.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The Arc Maryland, which supports people with developmental disabilities, gets a couple thousand dollars a year from the CFC, said Ande Kolp, the organization’s executive director. It’s not a large sum of money compared to the overall budget, but it is yet another source of funding that has “dried up,” she said.
Historically, The Arc Maryland has been able to rely on grants, she said, but it has recently faced struggles.
“There might have been 100 people going after the same grant before — now there’s 1,000 people going after the same grant,” Kolp said. “I think the competition has certainly grown and made it very difficult to access sources of funding we didn’t have difficulty accessing in the past.”
The organization will have to cut back on specific assistance programs, like transportation assistance and informative classes for parents on  IEPs — individualized educational plans for students — if they continue to lose funding, she said.
“There’s so much uncertainty out there, and it’s really impacting our ability to function as a business,” Kolp said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/4821013-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-05 20:57:09.221154

Sept. 5, 2025 | ScreenshotU.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin on Friday laid out a national security and foreign policy vision rooted in the economic concerns of middle-class Americans, as the Democrat from Holly called for sweeping reforms to address emerging global threats and technological competition with China.
In remarks made at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York City, Slotkin said her approach was forged out of the input she gathered during town halls held in Troy and Benton Harbor, where constituents linked national security to day-to-day economic stress. 
“A national security strategy worth its salt must do two things,” Slotkin said. “First, protect U.S. citizens, the homeland, and our way of life. And second, advance American prosperity. That’s it.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Slotkin said many Americans have lost confidence that the United States has a coherent foreign policy that truly advanced the nation’s priorities. 
“And they have good reason to feel uneasy,” she said. “Informed by them, I’m going to focus on the three big things that, if we get right, will define American security for the next 50 years.”
Slotkin said those three priorities included treating economic security as national security, which required leaders to be “ruthless about growing the middle class.” Secondly, she said the U.S. had to treat the tech race like it did the nuclear and space races and ensure the nation dominates in that sector. Finally, Slotkin said the government needs to rethink how it protects Americans in a rapidly changing threat landscape.

Slotkin proposed a series of policy initiatives she said were aimed at reshaping how the U.S. approaches global competition. 
Among them: creating a Cyber National Guard that would be focused on defending against digital threats, a Manhattan Project-style effort to win the AI race against China, and a Sovereign Wealth Fund that would invest in high-risk, high-reward technologies.
Slotkin warned that China has weaponized global supply chains and called for stronger domestic production of critical items.
“While some items, like Rubik’s Cubes and ladies’ razors, will never again be made in the U.S., critical items like pharmaceuticals, chips, and autos should be made, at least in part, in the U.S.,” she said. “China has weaponized these supply chains, giving them a veto on our economy that we should not accept.”
Slotkin, a former CIA analyst and Pentagon official, painted a stark picture of technological rivalry with Beijing.
“We are in a tech race with China right now,” she said. “And there’s no area more important to win than on artificial intelligence. The last time we were in a race like this, we won by setting up the Manhattan Project … We need the same level of ambition now, updated for the modern age.”
Amidst that national security focus, she also urged policies that would also improve middle-class livelihoods.
“Smart industrial policy also means prosperity for the middle class,” Slotkin said. “New manufacturing, engineering, and construction jobs. And critically, it means spreading the wealth across America, not just enriching 18 tech executives in Silicon Valley.”
Slotkin’s remarks came amid a broader debate in Washington over how to confront China’s global influence, secure domestic supply chains, and ensure U.S. leadership in critical technologies.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-05-124328-1024x586.png,,,2025-09-05 20:57:09.221154

Senate Joint Resolution 8201, if passed in November, would amend the state constitution to allow assets of the program, known as the WA Cares Fund, to be handled similarly to pension and retirement accounts. 
That would lead to larger returns in the long run, ensuring premiums stay low and the program is sustainable, advocates said in a call with reporters Friday.
“I think this is just a no-brainer,” said Greg Markley, secretary treasurer of the Washington State Association of Firefighters. He’s also chair of the Washington State Investment Board, whose fiduciary responsibility is to manage retirement and public fund investments. He was not representing the board Friday.
A state lawmaker opposing the ballot measure says it amounts to “gambling in the stock market” with taxpayers’ dollars.
The state constitution generally bars investing public money in the stock of private companies and private equity firms. That means state and local governments are limited to fixed-income securities like government bonds and certificates of deposit that are less risky but with lower rates of returns. 
Pension and retirement accounts are exempt from that prohibition. The resolution, if approved by voters, would add the Long-Term Services and Supports Trust account to the list of exempt funds.
Voters defeated a similar measure in 2020 by a margin of 54.4% to 45.6%. 
WA Cares is funded with a 0.58% tax on the paychecks of most workers in Washington. Beginning in July 2026, those who qualify can begin accessing the program’s benefit, a lifetime amount of $36,500 — a sum that is set to rise in future years to account for inflation.
Collections by the state began in July 2023. A person pays as long as they are working in the state. Deductions stop if they retire, become unemployed or leave the workforce, and resume if the person returns to work. As of March, $2 billion in tax collections had been banked in the program’s trust fund.
Backers say the public better understands the long-term care program than it did five years ago.
And they hope in the coming weeks to make them aware that the Washington State Investment Board has been earning 7% or more on pension funds, a  couple percentage points higher than its investments in government bonds. That difference will translate to a lot more dollars in the trust account for the program, they said.
Four state lawmakers — a Democrat and three Republicans — are leading the opposition. They’ve signed the opposition statement in the voter’s pamphlet that will be sent out statewide in October. It is online now.
They argue it would be “financial roulette” to put the money in “an unstable market.” Right now, “it’s safeguarded in secured investments like federal, state and municipal bonds which support our communities.”
Sen. Bob Hasegawa, D-Seattle, fought the measure five years ago. He’s doing it again now.
“It’s gambling in the stock market. It’s a breach of fiduciary responsibility when you put taxpayer dollars at risk,” he said Friday. 
Hasegawa said investing in municipal bonds may earn a little less but it provides a broad public benefit by helping local governments carry out projects. “I have faith in the voters that they will make the right decision,” he said.
Gary Bruebaker, who served as the state’s chief investment officer for 19 years, said this debate “has gone on for decades, and will continue to go on. There are some people that are extremely conservative and they don’t want to take any risk at all.”
By not investing in equities, he said, you’re accepting a lower return than what that the taxpayers and the stakeholders in Washington deserve. While there is risk on a year to year basis, there’s less risk over a longer term with the state’s diversified portfolio, he said.
Approve 8201, the political committee campaigning for passage, had reported raising $220,476 as of Friday. All of it is from the Service Employees International Union 775 which represents 55,000 long-term care workers in Washington, Montana and Alaska.
There was no campaign committee raising money to oppose the measure as of Friday.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)LONDON — The city council in this small Eastern Kentucky town ousted embattled Mayor Randall Weddle after an hours-long hearing at the local courthouse Friday. 
Heading into the hearing, Weddle faced nearly a dozen charges of misconduct and willful neglect of duty, but the six London City Council members ultimately agreed to remove him from office on only three of the charges. 
The council approved charges that alleged Weddle refused to publish an enacted ordinance and then delayed its timely publication, did not fill vacancies on the city’s ethics commission in a timely manner and signed a $5 million mortgage without council approval. 
Nevertheless, Weddle told reporters after the meeting he plans to appeal the removal in circuit court. He also pointed to the hundreds of citizens in the city and county who signed petitions in favor of keeping him in office as a sign that residents were against the council’s decision. London, a town of about 7,500 people, is the Laurel County seat. 
“They don’t care. They have an agenda,” Weddle said of the city council.

Weddle had previously contended that the votes were stacked against him, as the council appointed a new member to fill a vacancy earlier this week.  
After voting, the city council appointed a new London mayor — Tracie Handley. According to her social media accounts online, she is a local artist. 
Friday’s removal of Weddle is the latest in a months-long brawl between London City Council members and Weddle. City Council meetings became public spectacles as the former mayor and the council members argued back and forth about the allegations. Plus, citizens packed meeting rooms to show their support for or opposition to the mayor. 
The clashes have also spilled over onto social media. Facebook livestreams for recent city council meetings have gained hundreds of comments. Weddle has also posted Facebook statuses about city meetings, such as uploading a circus flyer for one meeting, complete with city council members’ faces superimposed on clowns. 
After a council meeting earlier this week, Weddle vowed to run for reelection in 2026 and: “We’re going to give ’em hell.”

The courthouse hearing was no quiet affair. Most of the audience members inside the room were supporters of Weddle who clapped for him whenever he entered the room and donned t-shirts that said, “I stand with Mayor Weddle.”
The audience was mostly quiet as witnesses testified but emotions erupted between council member Kelly Smith Greene and one of the witnesses, Phil Smith, her cousin and the chair of the London Tourism Commission, as she spoke near the end of the hearing during the council’s deliberations. Bailiffs removed Smith, who had earlier defended the $5 million mortgage, which had been sought to support the tourism commission. Weddle supporters cheered him on. 
“You neglected to ever communicate with council members. You came in like a bull in a china shop,” Greene said to Weddle. “You were the boss and you didn’t get our opinion.” 
Other witnesses included Weddle himself, the acting city clerk, a former city clerk, local Housing Authority workers and Chief of Police Bobby Day. Much of the testimony included questions about if Weddle acted appropriately in various situations. 
Some of the charges that fell short of the necessary unanimous approval from  council members alleged that Weddle had erroneously removed members of the London Housing Authority board and had directed the authority’s employees to not follow laws and regulations. 
While on the stand, Weddle expressed concern about another appointment to an office — this time the mayor’s office — that is typically on the ballot. At present, three of the council members have been appointed instead of being elected by citizens.
“People see the chaos in London and I think that both branches (of government) are to blame for some things and we both have to take blame for where it belongs, but one of the biggest chaoses in this city is that people’s voices are not being heard,” Weddle said. 
Former Kentucky Supreme Court Chief Justice Joseph Lambert presided as the hearing officer for Friday’s city council meeting. 
Cameron’s office asks FBI to investigate $202K refunds from Beshear’s campaign, Kentucky Dems

Weddle also has made headlines for his political contributions in support of Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear during the 2023 race for governor. The Kentucky Lantern reported in April 2023 that Weddle’s family and associates in the reverse logistics industry had given more than $300,000 to support Beshear, including large contributions from people who had never before made a political donation. The Beshear campaign later returned $202,000 in donations that Weddle had put on his  credit card and that had been made in the names of other people, a violation of campaign finance laws.
The state Registry of Election Finance continues to investigate the donations. The registry staff earlier this year recommended that the board find Weddle unknowingly violated the law. In February, the board unanimously deferred action on that recommendation and asked the registry staff to provide additional information, including about actions of the Beshear campaign and Kentucky Democratic Party.
When Weddle’s excessive contributions came to light during the 2023 primary campaign, then-Attorney Daniel Cameron, who was a Republican candidate for governor, asked the FBI to investigate.
In Laurel County, Weddle has been criticized for his response to a local police shooting in December. London police shot and killed Doug Harless, 63, in his home while serving a warrant for stolen property at the wrong house.

(U.S. Coast Guard Courtesy Photo)The U.S. Coast Guard shadowed two Chinese research ships operating in disputed waters within the Arctic Ocean this week, the Coast Guard announced Wednesday.
The icebreakers Ji Di and Zhong Shan Da Xue Ji Di were traveling more than 200 miles offshore of Utqiagvik, America’s northernmost town, in what’s known as the “extended continental shelf” under the International Law of the Sea Treaty.
Ordinarily, international law restricts a nation’s fishing, oil drilling and scientific exploration to within 200 nautical miles of its coast, in what’s known as its “exclusive economic zone.” Under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, a nation can extend that exclusive limit if the continental shelf — a place of generally shallower water — stretches beyond 200 miles.
More than 160 countries and the European Union have ratified the Law of the Sea agreement, but the United States has not, despite the urging of members of Alaska’s congressional delegation.
The agreement says foreign vessels may pass through extended continental shelf waters, but they must have the owner’s consent in order to perform scientific studies or seafloor mapping there.
The United States claims the extended continental shelf near its shorelines and in 2023 began the international process to have its claims recognized, but the United Nations committee that regulates the agreement has not finalized the American claims, a process that could take decades because the United States is not a party to the agreement.
Meanwhile, despite the lack of international recognition, the United States has continued to claim sovereignty over the extended continental shelf in the Arctic Ocean.
In late April, the Trump administration announced that it was beginning to plan oil and gas lease sales in the disputed area. 
China, which operates more Arctic icebreakers than does the United States, has contended that the Arctic Ocean should remain open to free navigation.
This week, when the two Chinese research icebreakers crossed into the disputed area, the Coast Guard dispatched the icebreaker Healy, which was already operating in the Arctic Ocean under a different mission.
“They were pretty close to the standard 200 nautical mile EEZ boundary. They were outside of that by a few miles, which is directly over that portion that is being claimed right now … by the United States,” said Troy Bouffard, director of the Center for Arctic Security and Resilience at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.
“It’s deliberate in several ways,” he said of the Chinese action. “It’s meant to get attention but not go over the line.”
He said some of China’s actions in the Arctic have been to “promote it as a global commons that belongs to everybody, and to minimize sovereign rights as much as possible. So that’s a pretty obvious reason why they would have done this at the location they did.”
Chief Petty Officer Travis Magee, assistant public affairs officer for the U.S. Coast Guard’s Arctic District, said that in cases like the ones that occurred this week, the typical response is to “monitor, and query the vessels” over the radio, frequently using a pre-prepared script.
The script he said, often goes like this:
“You are currently operating over the United States Extended Continental Shelf (ECS). Under international law, the United States has rights to conserve and manage the living and non-living natural resources of its ECS as well as to regulate marine scientific research by foreign scientists relating to its ECS. In all cases where marine scientific research is pursued on the Extended Continental Shelf, appropriate official channels must be used to obtain U.S. consent.”
The Coast Guard also flew a long-range patrol aircraft from Kodiak to shadow the two ships.
Rear Adm. Bob Little, commander of the Arctic District, said in a prepared statement that “the U.S. Coast Guard is controlling, securing and defending the northern U.S. border and maritime approaches in the Arctic to protect U.S. sovereignty, and Healy’s operations demonstrate the critical need for more Coast Guard icebreakers to achieve that.”
While the U.S. Navy frequently operates submarines in the Arctic Ocean, it does not have any icebreakers; the Coast Guard operates the federal government’s only icebreaking ships.
The recently approved Republican budget package known as the “Big Beautiful Bill Act” included billions of dollars for the Coast Guard to construct new heavy icebreakers. 
The first of those ships is expected to enter service in 2030, though some medium-weight icebreakers are being planned and could arrive sooner.
As an interim measure, the Coast Guard purchased and commissioned an icebreaking oilfield services ship, renaming it the Storis. 
At the time of the Healy’s intercept in the Arctic Ocean, the Storis was conducting training operations in the Bering Sea.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/250902-G-G0200-1001-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-05 20:57:09.221154

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The U.S. House of Representatives voted mostly along party lines Wednesday night to repeal development restrictions in large areas of Alaska, Montana and North Dakota.
The House’s vote, which must be duplicated by the Senate before becoming effective, seeks to reverse land management plans adopted in the final days of the Biden administration.
In Alaska, the Central Yukon Resource Management Plan was seen as an obstacle to the proposed 211-mile Ambler Road and the planned trans-Alaska natural gas pipeline.
Rep. Nick Begich, R-Alaska, proposed the elimination of the plan via the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to repeal regulations under certain circumstances.
“Why is this CRA so important? Revoking Public Land Order 5150 is the first step in allowing the State of Alaska to acquire lands that are critical to two essential projects: Ambler Road and the Alaska LNG pipeline,” said Rep. Bruce Westerman, R-Arkansas and chair of the House Committee on Natural Resources.
Speaking on the House floor, Begich said he believes the Biden administration’s plan doesn’t represent a balanced approach and would restrict projects that could benefit Alaskans.
“It is federal overreach that is ensuring that Alaska’s wealth stays in the ground, unavailable to the people of one of America’s most impoverished regions,” he said of the portion of Interior Alaska affected by the order.
Doyon Inc., the regional Alaska Native corporation for Interior Alaska, wrote a letter of support for the repeal. Environmental groups and some Alaska Native tribal groups opposed it.
The Bering Sea-Interior Tribal Commission asked Congress to preserve the management plan, as did Protect the Kobuk, an organization opposing Ambler Road.
In a written statement, China Kantner of Protect the Kobuk noted that if federal lands are transferred to the state of Alaska, local hunters will lose subsistence hunting preferences because those are not allowed under the Alaska Constitution.

(Courtesy of MMI)  LINCOLN —  At least 135 Nebraska youths challenged by autism have suffered interrupted services as a result of cuts the state made in August to Medicaid reimbursement rates, according to preliminary findings of a survey by national advocates.
Mariel Fernandez of the Council of Autism Service Providers offered an early peek at the survey during an interim legislative hearing Friday to hear about possible fallout and benefits of the reductions.
Speaking to the Legislature’s Health and Human Services Committee, Fernandez was clear that she does not oppose an adjustment.  Indeed, she said she was shocked to learn how high some of Nebraska’s treatment reimbursements had gotten relative to surrounding states.
Mariel Fernandez of the Council of Autism Service Providers is among speakers who were invited to speak during an interim study hearing before the Legislature’s Health and Human Services Committee. (Screenshot of hearing)
However, Fernandez said that the council members believe the changes DHHS adopted amount to an “overcorrection” and requested that the department conduct further study to prevent negative impacts on access to care or an exacerbation of a worker shortage. 
She said she knows of a couple of service providers already exiting the state. 
Fernandez suggested the state implement an accreditation process to get rid of providers trying to “make a buck because rates are favorable.” Other speakers Friday also suggested better vetting to assist in achieving the committee’s goal: long-term sustainability and elimination of exploitative practices.
 Interim study 

The three-hour hearing at the Capitol was part of an interim study to inform lawmakers how they might help ensure the viability of the state’s Medicaid-funded Applied Behavior Analysis services. Also known as ABA, the therapy and support helps people with autism spectrum disorder and other developmental and social communication delays function better in society.
The Council of Autism Service Providers has said the Nebraska cuts to Medicaid reimbursement rates range from 28% to 79%, depending on the service or therapy.
Only invited guests only spoke during Friday hearing , which was open to the public. 
State Sen. Brian Hardin of Gering, the HHS committee chair who said he raised a child with an autism disorder, scheduled the hearing following concerns lawmakers fielded from families and others about the impact of the reimbursement rate changes that went into effect Aug. 1.
State Sen. Brian Hardin of Gering. Jan. 9, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
DHHS said its review showed Nebraska had the highest reimbursement rates of any state ABA program — leading to an increase in state expenses of more than 2,000% since 2020. Five years ago, Nebraska paid about $4.6 million for ABA services. Last year, the amount soared to $85.6 million.
It was an increase HHS’s Matthew Ahern described as the fastest he’s seen in any single program. 
Medicaid-eligible youths served in Nebraska grew from about 169 in 2020 to about 1,150 three years later, DHHS has said. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one in 31 children is affected by autism spectrum disorder, a developmental disability with challenges ranging from social communication to repetitive behaviors.
Hardin said his concerns included “middle men” organizations, which employ people who directly work with the youths, “taking a significant” chunk of the reimbursements. He alleged that some moved to or expanded in Nebraska after seeing a potential for profit-making, fueled by the Legislature’s approval in 2023 of a 17% hike for behavioral health services. 
He referred also to a “troubling absence of background checks” for “registered behavior technicians” who work directly with children. 
“Shall we say … we didn’t exactly mind the farm?” Hardin said. He later added: “How do responsible adults in the room make decisions that are wise without continuing to pay for bad acting and not face a clawback?”
 ‘Blistering’ report

State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston, another member of the committee, expressed concern about a possible federal clawback of funds, as has happened to a few states whose ABA programs were investigated.
Ahern, the DHHS deputy director, said the “risk is certainly there,” adding that is why the agency tightened its program.

Another speaker, Addie Angelov, CEO of the Indiana-based nonprofit Paramount Health Data Project, spoke about a “blistering” 2024 report of Indiana’s growing ABA program by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Inspector General.
The report outlined “audacious” fiscal improprieties, she said, and alleged at least $56 million in improper fee-for-service Medicaid payments. The OIG in that case recommended Indiana refund nearly $40 million to the federal government.
A similar OIG probe of Wisconsin found that the state made at least $18.5 million in improper fee-for-service Medicaid payments for ABA services to youths. Among the OIG’s recommendations was a $12 million refund to the federal government.
Angelov noted that Indiana’s governor established a commission this year to find ways to reduce the rising costs identified in the audit while  maintaining care. She encouraged Nebraska’s HHS legislative committee to consider changes, including holding all entities that serve students with an autism disorder to national standards of best practices, evaluation and auditing. 
She said pediatricians, insurance companies and schools must meet accreditation standards.
“Currently standalone ABA therapy providers are the only entity that does not have a checks and balances in place,” Angelov said. “Vetting these organizations that serve them should be a top priority.”
 ‘All very new’ 

Amy Nordness of the University of Nebraska Medical Center’s Monroe-Meyer Institute said Medicaid rate reductions won’t stop MMI from providing services to youths on the autism spectrum. 
But, she said services likely would “look different” as a result.
State Sen. John Fredrickson of Omaha. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Asked by State Sen. John Fredrickson of Omaha to elaborate, she said it likely could mean increasing caseload size for supervisors who oversee techs that work directly with the youths.  It also could prompt more diversification of the client base at some clinics to include more non-Medicaid patients.
“What I’m hearing is there might be reduced availability to provide services to folks on Medicaid,” Fredrickson said.
Nordness said that is a possibility, adding that “this is all very new.”
She said the nonprofit MMI — which she described as one of the biggest and oldest developmental disability centers in the world — is not about turning a profit. But it needs to cover costs, she said.
“We have to find the right balance,” said Nordness. Of quality of treatment, she said: “That’s not something we’ll skimp on.”

In front of the Tetons, public land advocates support the Great American Outdoors Act that provides money for public-lands maintenance and permanently funds acquisition of parks and access.
The post Congressional panel hears call for national park funding, restoration of staff appeared first on WyoFile .","With the Tetons as a backdrop, a congressional panel heard testimony Friday in support of reauthorizing the Great American Outdoors Act, which was passed in 2020 to address $12.7 billion in backlogged maintenance on public lands.
Members of the panel, including U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman, supported continued funding for the act’s Legacy Restoration Fund that expires this year. But officials need to better distribute the money and also use it to modernize infrastructure in national parks, Hageman said.
“The next iteration of GAOA should concentrate on projects that modernize our parks, enhance public access, improve infrastructure and create new outdoor recreation opportunities,” she said in front of an outdoor audience of about 100 at Grand Teton National Park’s Jenny Lake Plaza.
To date, the act has not “adequately address[ed] some of our smaller parks and the needs that they have, and it disproportionately prioritized urban cities over our rural crown jewels, such as … Grand Teton and Yellowstone national park[s],” she said.
“There’s magic in this place because of these people.” Chip Jenkins
While the committee focused on the Act’s Legacy Restoration Fund, one witness said the act’s good work could not properly continue without restoring drastic staffing cuts to the National Park Service that have occurred since President Donald Trump took office.
“I also came here to warn you that we won’t be able to continue this success without the planners, engineers, compliance officers, budget experts, landscape architects, maintenance staff, carpenters and so many more Park Service staff who make it possible for the Great American Outdoors Act to fund the work on the ground,” said Kristen Brengel, a senior vice president with the National Parks Conservation Association. “The Park Service has lost 24% of its permanent workforce since January.”
The committee should advocate for restoring Park Service staff and prohibiting further cuts, she said.
‘Magic in this place’
Grand Teton Superintendent Chip Jenkins drew applause after he choked up while testifying about the partnerships that enabled the park to undertake numerous projects that benefit visitors. Those range from construction of a modern visitors’ center to upgraded trailhead parking lots and entrance stations and preservation of more than 1,200 acres of parkland once owned by Wyoming.
“There’s magic in this place because of these people,” he said, referring to local residents, politicians and nonprofit groups who work with park staff. “I think there’s something the committee can learn about the way we work together to be stewards of this place.”
Grand Teton needs help, he said.
“Our infrastructure is not always adequate for current visitation numbers, let alone for increasing future levels,” he said. Grand Teton sorely needs to upgrade Colter Bay Village on the shores of Jackson Lake, a place that attracts up to 11,000 people a day.

“The infrastructure is suffering from over 75 years of wear and tear, and is not meeting our visitors’ needs nor matching the beauty that is Colter Bay,” Jenkins said. “We need to make sure the toilets flush,” he said, calling for “wholesale rejuvenation” of cabins, a restaurant, marina and campground.
With GAOA modernization funds, Grand Teton also would improve pullouts near the Oxbow Bend of the Snake River, haunt of the late world-famous mother grizzly 399. The park would build a bicycle path to connect the park’s largest campground — the Gros Ventre Campground — to the valley’s bicycle trail network.
“The park welcomes close to 4 million visitors annually,” Jenkins said, “and this year, we’re on track to have our second busiest year on record.”
On a post-Labor Day Friday, 157 vehicles overflowed from the Jenny Lake parking area and parked on the sides of the highway to the south. Perhaps a similar number overflowed to the north. Eighty-eight vehicles were queued up at the Moose entrance station at noon, their drivers waiting to show passes or pay fees.
World-class plaza
Reauthorizing the Great American Outdoors Act “can sharpen” an existing partnership between the Grand Teton National Park Foundation and the park, foundation president Leslie Mattson told the panel. About $15 million in private funds augmented $6 million from the feds to upgrade the park’s spotlight draw, where the hearing took place.
Jenny Lake was once a dusty crossroads of trails and desultory log buildings, “marked by congestion and confusion,” Mattson said. “The most commonly asked questions were ‘where is the lake?’ and ‘where is the bathroom?’”
The upgrade created “a world-class, accessible visitor plaza and a sustainable network of backcountry trails that welcomes millions each year,” she said.
Drawing people to Grand Teton and Jackson Hole only to disappoint them with a shabby experience is counterproductive, said Julie Calder, chair of the Jackson Hole Travel and Tourism Board. A vice president at the Jackson Hole Mountain Resort, she advocated for renewal of the act.
Members of the Travel and Tourism Board often say they are in “the dreaming phase,” of visitors’ journeys, she said. “We create a lot of content to make people dream about coming here. We want to ensure that when they arrive, they get the experience that they had hoped for when they dream[ed].”
A wildlife guide who built a small business told the panel how companies like his rely on park infrastructure. Taylor Phillips started Jackson Hole EcoTour Adventures in 2008 and now has 40 employees and a payroll approaching $2 million, he said. His company is one of 70 that last year introduced more than 81,000 visitors to the park, he said.
He pointed to GAOA funds that improved the rural Moose-Wilson road as a worthy investment. Before the improvement, a 260-mile round trip to Yellowstone ended over 10 miles of jarring potholes — “not a lasting impression you want to leave with our guests.”
Brengel, the National Parks Conservation Association representative, reiterated the need for a restored park service staff nationwide.
“It takes people to run the park,” she said. The parks “won’t be protected and preserved without the dedicated staff who honor and care for them.”

(Photo by Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)The Trump administration is moving to partially lift a blanket federal prohibition on cellphone jamming, FCC Chair Brendan Carr said Friday — a move in line with efforts led by Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton to allow the practice via legislation.
Cotton, Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin and Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in an afternoon press conference they are primarily interested in targeting prison inmates who use contraband cellphones to commit crimes. Carr said he’s ready to oblige via a rule change.
Federal law prohibits states or individuals from “willfully or maliciously” interfering with “licensed or authorized” radio communications — such as a cellphone.
“Over the years the FCC has authorized various different technologies to try to identify contraband cell phones and shut them down,” Carr said at the press conference. “They’ve worked in some cases, they have not worked in other cases. Other countries — and the federal government — have authority to jam within their facilities, but state and local officials have been denied that ability.
Carr said the long-standing federal ban was due to a “misreading” of law. The FCC will vote on a proposed rule at the end of the month that would change this.

“What we can do at the federal level is we authorize communications or we don’t authorize communications, and so what we’re going to do is we’re going to deauthorize the lawful use of contraband cell phones within the confines of prisons,” Carr said. “So once contraband cellphone use is not an authorized communication, then the federal law is no longer a prohibition to jamming it.”
The work-around, Griffin said, will allow prison officials to target illicit cellphone use that “kill[s] and endanger[s]” people.
“It may not be a silver bullet, it may not be the right fit for every facility, but there are certainly lots and lots of facilities around this country where this type of solution will and can make a significant difference,” Carr said.
Cellphones are typically considered contraband in state prison systems, and Arkansas officials and Carr said they are being used by violent criminals to order hits and other crimes against people on the outside. A memo addressed to Arkansas Division of Correction Director Dexter Payne provided to the Advocate by both the Department of Corrections and the attorney general’s office outlined how illicit cellphones contribute to gang violence inside and outside state prisons.
According to the memo written by Maj. Randy Shores of the division’s Office of Emergency Services, Arkansas prisons currently incarcerate 230 “Serious Threat Group leaders” who have been found with a cellphone 308 times.
“These 230 inmates are from all the known threat groups housed in the department including Bloods, Crips, Aryan Circle, White Aryan Resistance along with our largest group Gangster Disciples,” Shores wrote in the undated memo. “Further investigation led us to several incidents involving confiscated cellphones where these same inmates’ information was found … showing evidence of conducting illegal activities such as drug movement, drone activities, the movement of money and gang activities throughout not only the state of Arkansas but across the United States.”
Rand Champion, a corrections department spokesperson, confirmed that the state had observed a trend between cellphone confiscations and increased gang violence within the prisons.
A photo shown by Griffin that he said was taken at the Arkansas Department of Corrections’ Varner Unit showed dozens of cellphones, which he said had been confiscated from inmates.
Griffin said incarcerated people will have the devices smuggled to them via drone drops and that there have been numerous instances of inmates extorting Arkansans using illicit phones.
“I recall telling the story of an inmate who was contacting another inmate’s mother on the phone and saying, ‘If you don’t get us this money, we’re going to kill your son,’” Griffin said. “No credible person disputes the heinous crimes that are being committed with these cellphones.”
Cotton has been pushing legislation to allow cellphone jamming within corrections facilities and is the lead sponsor for the proposed Cellphone Jamming Reform Act. He has introduced the bill on at least two occasions, including once this past March, but it has never moved out of a Senate committee.
The proposed rule, Cotton said, will make it so that “contraband cellphones will be nothing more than dead paperweights inside our prisons.”

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum issued an order guiding the allocation of more than $430 million from the Land and Water Conservation Fund to projects that would “benefit wildlife habitat, improve water quality and provide flood protection while creating new recreational opportunities.”
“The Land and Water Conservation Fund continues to deliver on its promise to connect Americans to the outdoors while protecting the landscapes that make our nation special,” said Burgum in a statement.
But local conservation groups say the changes threaten to undermine the bipartisan Great American Outdoors Act (GAOA) that President Donald Trump signed into law in 2020, which contributes hundreds of millions of dollars to the development and rehabilitation of parks, conservation areas and outdoor recreation facilities across the nation.
Conservation groups said language in the order restricts the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) from using the fund to acquire additional land that could be used to expand recreation and conservation. 
Those restrictions could effectively prevent the expansion of National Monuments, National Conservation Areas, Wild and Scenic Rivers, and National Scenic and Historic Trails administered by the BLM. 
“Nevada is approximately 86% public land, of which 67% is managed by the Bureau of Land Management. If you have enjoyed some form of outdoor recreation in Nevada, there is a good chance it was on BLM managed land. If you have camped, hiked, OHV’ed or hunted in Nevada, it was likely in or near a National Conservation Area or National Monument,” said Russell Kuhlman, executive director of the Nevada Wildlife Federation.
The order would also allow states to use the conservation fund to buy federal property, including protected federal conservation land. Those changes could open the door to land transfers that shift public land to private ownership, said the Nevada Conservation League.
“Nevadans overwhelmingly support protecting these places, and we cannot afford to roll back decades of progress in opening and protecting access to the great outdoors,” said Kristee Watson, Executive Director of the Nevada Conservation League.
The Land and Water Conservation Fund has pumped more than $175 million into acquiring and improving public land at Red Rock Canyon and Lake Tahoe, according to the Nevada Conservation League.
The order also “increased bureaucratic red tape” by requiring both state governors and local county officials to approve land acquisitions purchased using the fund, said the Nevada Wildlife Federation. 
Local conservation groups warned the restrictions could prevent new investments in the outdoor recreation economy and halt pending land deals and projects.
In 2023, Nevada’s outdoor recreation industry accounted for $8.1 billion in value-added (GDP) annually, ranking the state 10th in the nation, according to the Nevada Division of Outdoor Recreation. 
The Department of the Interior did, however, back away from earlier plans to include language that would siphon money away from conservation land purchases to pay for maintenance projects on federal property.
“Fortunately,” the order does not include one of the administration’s worst ideas, leaving out its prior proposal to divert LWCF funding for unauthorized purposes,” said Amy Lindholm, a spokesperson for the Land and Water Conservation Fund Coalition.
Lindholm continued, “Unfortunately, Secretarial Order 3442 still does real damage.  It hinders critical conservation and public access by reviving previously rejected ideas.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Avi-Kwa-Ame-National-Monument-1024x658.jpeg,,,2025-09-05 19:57:34.168804

The change comes as insurers grapple with the costs of drugs like Ozempic, which are part of a class of drugs called GLP-1s. That drug class is one of Idaho’s fastest-growing expenses for the state insurance plan, officials say.
“Current evidence does not justify continued coverage of these medications at current usage levels and pricing,” officials wrote.
Almost 27,000 people are enrolled in Idaho’s state government health insurance plans. 
Examples of medications that won’t be covered for weight-loss in Idaho include Wegovy, Saxenda and Zepbound. The policy applies for any GLP-1 medication prescribed mainly for weight loss. But coverage will not be affected for drugs in that class that are prescribed to treat diabetes.
Earlier this year, Idaho’s health insurance premiums for state employees rose sharply, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. Officials said the rise was largely driven by rising health care costs and the types of services people seek.

Like Portland, voters in those cities skew heavily toward Democratic candidates.A television report Thursday night alerted him to supposed rampant violence in Portland, he said. He also possibly alluded to weeks-long protests in the city after the police murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020. Those protests, which sometimes included clashes with police, ended in 2020.“I didn't know that was continuing to go on, but Portland is unbelievable,” he said. “The destruction of the city. Well, I'm going to look at it now, because I didn't know that was still going on. This has been going on for years. So we'll be able to stop that very easily.”Trump, without offering evidence, described the city as beset by “paid terrorists” who smokebomb stores.“And when we go there, if we go to Portland, we're going to wipe them out,” he said. “They're going to be gone, and they're going to be gone bad. They won't even stand the fight. They will not stay there. They're ruined. They've ruined that city.“What they’ve done to that city, it’s like living in hell,” he added.Another National Guard deployment comingTrump’s opining on the state of Oregon’s largest city was part of his answer to a reporter’s question about if he had chosen the next city where he would send National Guard troops.The president said he would send troops to another city and had decided which one, but was not ready to announce it.“I'm not going to say it now, but yeah, I have” decided, he said. “We're going to go into another place and straighten it out.”Trump has said the deployment to Los Angeles was meant to subdue protests over the administration’s immigration crackdown, while the troops in the District of Columbia were there to control crime, despite a 30-year-low violent crime rate in the nation’s capital.California Gov. Gavin Newsom and District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb have sued Trump over the deployments.Newsom won a decision Tuesday, with U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer ruling that Trump used military personnel as law enforcement in violation of an 18th-century law banning military personnel from conducting law enforcement, as well as a more fundamental principle of U.S. democracy.The administration has not responded to Schwalb’s suit, which was filed Thursday.",,,,2025-09-05 19:57:34.168804

The monument — titled the Snow Country Prison Japanese American Internment Memorial — displays the names of the 1,850 Japanese Americans who were detained on the property.
It’s named after a haiku written by Itaru Ina, who was held prisoner there from 1945 to 1946.
Before the tribal college in Bismarck existed, the property was known as the Fort Lincoln military post. It was used as a prison camp for Japanese Americans and German nationals during World War II.

Many of the Japanese Americans who were sent to Fort Lincoln were community leaders who had spoken out against their imprisonment and were pressured to renounce their citizenship. 
The effort to create a memorial on the campus was spearheaded by Itaru Ina’s daughter, Satsuki Ina, who is also a survivor of the incarceration program. She was born at Tule Lake, a detention camp in California, in 1944.
Satsuki Ina said the monument is a commitment to remember the unconstitutional detention of Japanese Americans, even when their stories went untold for decades.
“It’s an act of dissidence,” she said.
There is little public recognition about what the prisoners had suffered, speakers at the dedication noted.
“It’s a story that very few people in our own community knew very much about,” said Barbara Takei, another Japanese American activist who spoke during the dedication. “In the broader community, even fewer people know about it.”

The Revs. Ronald Kobata and Duncan Ryūken Williams led attendees in a Buddhist ritual to honor the Fort Lincoln prisoners, especially those who died during their incarceration. 
“A memorial like the Snow Country Prison Japanese American Internment Memorial helps us to feel the presence of all those who experienced wartime incarceration,” Williams said during the dedication.
Williams created a book containing the names of all 125,284 people of Japanese ancestry incarcerated in the United States during the war. The book, called the Ireichō, was part of the dedication ceremony and is on display at United Tribes Technical College Friday and Saturday.
New monument honors Japanese Americans incarcerated in North Dakota during World War II

Several speakers drew parallels between the experience of Japanese Americans during World War II and the U.S. government’s persecution of Native nations.
“In both cases, U.S. authorities exercised a paternalistic rationale justifying forced relocation as protective or necessary,” United Tribes Technical College President Russ McDonald said.
Many also compared the imprisonment of Japanese Americans to the modern-day immigration policies of President Donald Trump’s administration.
The law used to justify their incarceration during World War II — the Alien Enemies Act — is the same one the Trump administration invoked to arrest and deport Venezuelan immigrants. (An appeals court on Tuesday ruled against Trump’s use of the law, though the matter is likely to also go before the U.S. Supreme Court.)
“To me, it just shows how vulnerable we are,” Kobata said in an interview before the ceremony. “Stop repeating history. We know that the Constitution isn’t this thing that’s so dependable.”

Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer.More than 1,400 service workers across the University of Minnesota’s five campuses could strike after they rejected the university’s “last, best and final” offer on a new labor contract.
The Teamsters Local 320, the union representing cooks, groundskeepers and other service workers, urged their members to vote down the offer which they said fell far short in raising wages and protecting benefits.
“A system-wide strike remains an option as we maneuver through the next several days and talk to members,” said Brian Aldes, secretary-treasurer of Teamsters Local 320, in a statement announcing the vote results Friday. “The ball is now in the university’s court to make this right or face a work stoppage.”
The university’s offer included $1,000 bonuses over the next two years; at least 3% wage increases in the first year and 2% in the second; and additional market adjustments ranging from 0.5% to 2% depending on the job and seniority. The proposal also included pay increases for shifts that begin early in the morning or end late at night.
The union said to avoid the strike the university must raise wages at least 3.5% a year.
The average unionized service worker makes $26.11 per hour, according to the union, which is about $11 per hour less than the median wage in Minnesota.
Federal budget cuts and rising costs have strained university budgets across the country, leading the University of Minnesota’s Board of Regents to approve the largest tuition hike in over a decade while cutting spending by 7% on academics, student services and research.
“Unlike many of our peer institutions, which are also facing financial challenges, the university has invested in our people and allocated a significant pool for salary increases for faculty and staff for the upcoming fiscal year. While we do not want a strike, we are prepared to continue vital services to our students, faculty, and staff if the Teamsters choose to strike,” Ken Horstman, vice president for human resources, said in a statement on Friday.
Service workers at the university also authorized a strike three years ago, but called it off after reaching an agreement that raised the minimum hourly wage from $15 to $20.
In announcing their intention to strike, the union boasted of its large strike fund that would allow its members — many living paycheck-to-paycheck — to forgo wages and walk the picket line in the event of a protracted strike. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters approved enhanced strike benefits for University of Minnesota members of $1,000 per week, which exceeds the weekly pay of many members, the union said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/P1116670-1024x718.jpg,,,2025-09-05 19:57:34.168804

(Pool photo by Trent Nelson/The Salt Lake Tribune) Attorneys for the Utah Legislature and plaintiffs in the redistricting lawsuit against the state have agreed on a timeline to redraw Utah’s congressional boundaries. 
Third District Judge Dianna Gibson tossed out Utah’s 2021 congressional map in a ruling she issued last week that determined the Utah Legislature unconstitutionally repealed and replaced Better Boundaries’ 2018 voter-approved ballot initiative that sought to create an independent redistricting commission. 
Attorneys for both the Legislature and the anti-gerrymandering lawsuit’s plaintiffs agreed on the following deadlines, according to a court filing submitted Thursday: 
GOP legislative leaders begrudgingly say they’ll redraw Utah’s congressional map, as court ordered


Sept. 25: The Utah Legislature will publish its new proposed map. 
Sept. 26 to Oct. 5: Lawmakers will hold a public comment period to take input on the map.
Oct. 6: The Legislature will take a final vote on the map and submit it to the court for consideration. Plaintiffs will also have the same deadline to submit any proposed maps to the judge. 
Oct. 17: The deadline for both parties to file briefs, expert reports, and other materials in support or opposition to map submissions, if necessary. 
Oct. 23 to Oct. 24: The court will hold an evidentiary hearing, if necessary. 
Oct. 28: The deadline for parties to file proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law with the court, if necessary. 
Nov. 10: The latest possible date for the court to select a final map, according to the lieutenant governor’s office. 

Previously, Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson’s office had told the judge the latest a new map could be adopted would be Nov. 1, in order to give county clerks enough time to finalize precincts before candidates can begin filing in January. 
However, earlier this week during a status conference, Gibson asked if there would be any flexibility — even if it’s a matter of days — to push back her previously proposed schedule to give lawmakers more time to submit their maps. In her initial order last week, the judge proposed that deadline to be Sept. 24. 
The lieutenant governor’s attorneys said in another court filing earlier this week that they could push the Nov. 1 deadline to Nov. 10. 
Additionally, Gibson had included in her initial order the opportunity for “third parties” — in addition to the Legislature and the lawsuit’s plaintiffs — to submit proposed maps. However, in their joint court filing, attorneys for both parties said they “agree that map submissions to the Court should be limited to the existing parties in this case.” 
“Third parties have the opportunity to submit proposed maps and comments during the legislative process,” they wrote in Thursday’s filing.

Jim Pillen has requested a major federal disaster declaration for 12 counties following early August storms with hurricane-force winds that damaged a state prison.
Pillen a couple of weeks ago declared a state disaster for the severe wind and thunderstorms Aug. 8-11 in 23 counties in eastern Nebraska. The federal declaration, based on state and local damage estimates, narrows the request to severe wind and flash flooding Aug. 8-10 in 12 of those counties.

Preliminary damage estimates in the federal request exceed $39 million. The state declaration for high winds, heavy rain and flooding had estimated losses at $24 million, though a Nebraska Emergency Management Agency spokesperson said the estimate was likely to grow.
The NEMA spokesperson said that after state and local officials conducted joint preliminary damage assessments with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the state was able to substantiate federal funding eligibility for the 12 counties. Those counties are: Burt, Douglas, Fillmore, Lancaster, Nemaha, Nuckolls, Saline, Saunders, Seward, Thayer, Washington and Webster.
The 11 counties covered only by the state disaster declaration are: Butler, Cass, Dodge, Gage, Harlan, Jefferson, Johnson, Otoe, Pawnee, Sarpy and York.
The August storms detailed in the federal request damaged schools, public facilities, businesses and power infrastructure, particularly hundreds of power poles, transformers and electrical lines.

Vermont’s independent health care regulator, the Green Mountain Care Board, is considering a set of recommendations that would place tighter guardrails on expenses run rampant across the University of Vermont Health Network. The board’s staff presented the recommendations at its Wednesday meeting, a precursor to the board’s annual hospital budget decisions due Sept. 15. 
New laws passed this legislative session bolstered the care board’s ability to specifically tackle compensation for health care executives and the structure of network health operations, like UVM Health Network. Gov. Phil Scott, who signed these laws, released a statement Thursday commending the care board’s efforts to lower the overall cost of health care in the state. 
“In recent years, GMCB regulatory review has identified concerns with University of Vermont Health Network operations, and lack of alignment between executive compensation and State healthcare goals,” board chair Owen Foster told VTDigger in a statement following the hearing.  “This budget cycle GMCB’s staff has accordingly conducted a deeper dive and analysis of these issues and yesterday made recommendations to the Board.” 
Specifically, during its Wednesday presentation the care board staff illustrated the extreme income disparities between the UVM Medical Center and other hospitals owned by its parent company, the UVM Health Network. The network owns three hospitals in Vermont (UVM, Porter, and Central Vermont Medical Centers), three in New York, and a number of additional health care facilities in the region. 
UVMMC is the largest hospital in the network. Its budgeted revenue for 2026 is $2.4 billion, while Central Vermont’s is $318 million and Porter’s $142 million. 
In 2020-24, losses across the UVM Network reached $12.8 million, according to the board staff’s presentation. Still, the UVM Medical Center alone contributed more than $138 million in profit to the network during this period, the report also showed. Two of the three  New York hospitals in the network operated at a deficit. Of its proposed budgets for next fiscal year, UVMMC accounts for nearly 95% of the systemwide operating income. 
“The Health Network has made excess revenue margin here in Vermont, and the Health Network has needed to contribute those dollars to the New York Hospitals. Vermonters are paying for keeping those New York hospitals afloat,” explained Mike Fisher, the state’s health care advocate, in an interview with VTDigger after the budget hearing.
Exactly what can the board do to curb that disparity? “I’m not exactly sure,” Fisher said, but he was heartened to see the board make strides to pull hospital costs down, to be closer in line with what insurers will be able to pay them. 
To understand the hospital budgets, it’s important to understand the insurance rate review. The two are deeply interconnected. In August, as part of this review process, the Green Mountain Care Board, approved moderate premium increases for health insurers selling plans on the state’s Affordable Care Act marketplace. These rates influence how much hospitals can bill insurers for their services. 
Insurance rate review and hospital budgets are two sides of one equation, Fisher explained. “Insurance rate review is ‘how much money do you have to spend?’ Hospital budget [review] is analogous to ‘Where are you going to spend those dollars?’” he said.
“In years past those two sides of the equation haven’t added up. The board has allowed for more spending than it raised (through insurance payments),” he added.
For the coming fiscal year, the board recommended a commercial reimbursement rate reduction of 7.3% for UVMMC, as well as reductions to net patient revenue and expenses. It also recommended rate increases for Porter and Central Vermont Medical Centers of 2.9% (down, for both, from a proposed 3%) and budget reductions commensurate with reductions in net patient revenue.
The staff recommendations came after Mike Smith, who leads an independent liaison team,  delivered a scathing letter to the UVMHN Board, UVMMC Board and Green Mountain Care Board on Aug. 29, calling out the network’s proposed budget narrative. He outlined that UVMNH’s claims that it is working to improve affordability grossly conflict with the numbers on the page. While the network put forth lower rates, it outlined increases in use and type of services that more than offset that reduction.
Because of this, commercial insurers will see a nearly $46 million increase in what they pay the UVMMC in 2026, Smith writes, despite the $76 million reduction in rates. 
Smith’s letter also raised the concern that the care board outlined, stating that the medical center “was paying more than its fair share of network costs,” especially by lending money to the network’s New York hospitals. The network has made a net $68.9 million in loans to the New York hospitals between 2015 and 2013, Smith cites, adding that UVMMC and UVMHN invested an additional $20 million as part of an affiliation agreement, population health initiatives and capital investments. 
In response to the letter, UVM Health Network spokesperson Annie Mackin wrote that the “University of Vermont Health Network worked hard to submit budgets for FY ’26 that complied with GMCB guidance, and which took into account the increasing need of our patients for health care services and the increased expenses involved in providing care. However, much work remains, and we and our partners will need to continue taking steps to improve affordability not just in this budget cycle, but in the months and years ahead. We look forward to further digging into the questions and ideas the liaison team have raised.”
Regarding the concerns about the cost burden of the network’s New York hospitals, she said, “Our health care partners in northern New York contribute real benefits to Vermonters – from the care they provide, to the positive economic impact when patients from Plattsburgh or Elizabethtown seek specialized treatment in Burlington,” adding that the two New York hospitals in the red are “making meaningful progress toward stability.”
The liaison’s letter and the care board staff both also looked critically at executive compensation in the UVM network. For 14 executive positions at the network, they budgeted an average 9% increase — nearly a $50,000 average increase from fiscal year 2025 to 2026, care board staff outlined. The liaison’s letter cited that rates of employee benefits have outpaced average cost growth in the past five years  across all three Vermont hospitals — nearly doubling at the medical center. In response, Mackin added that the health network compensates “all staff, regardless of their position, at market rates that help us recruit and retain the people we need to provide high quality care.”
Overall, expenses at the medical center have grown 9.8% annually between 2019 and 2024 — far outpacing the annual inflation rate for that same period.
“The UVMHN must focus on affordability both in its words and in its budget submissions.
Concrete steps must be taken to bring this budget and future ones in line with an agreed affordability metric that pertains to Vermont and Vermonters,” Smith wrote in the letter.
In the coming days the care board intends to deliberate and evaluate the proposed budgets and its staff recommendations, before beginning voting next week. The fiscal year for hospitals runs Oct. 1 through Sept. 30. The care board must establish a budget for each hospital by Sept. 15.

(Photo by Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)A Louisiana environmental group plans to file a citizen-led federal lawsuit against Smitty’s Supply for the contamination of land and waterways from recent explosions of petrochemical tanks at a Tangipahoa Parish industrial facility. 
The Louisiana Environmental Action Network, represented by the New Orleans-based Waltzer Wygul & Garside law firm, sent Smitty’s a 60-day notice to inform the company it intends to sue for violations of Clean Water Act. The federal law requires the advance notice so that the public is made aware of the legal action. 
The Aug. 22 explosion dispersed an oily residue onto neighboring homes, businesses and a nearby elementary school, and firefighting crews have battled flareups at the site for 15 days running. 
“The fire has been 98% (contained) for over a week,” Tangipahoa Parish President Robby Miller said in an email. “The reason for the 2% is there is still a possibility of small flare-ups as the burned building and remaining materials are manipulated to find all of the hot spots.”
Smitty’s Supply sells industrial oils and lubricants and employed over 400 people before the incident destroyed the facility. 
The cause of the explosion remains under investigation by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, whose crews continue to clean nearby contaminated land and waterways, including the Tangipahoa River that feeds into Lake Pontchartrain.  
The EPA reported Tuesday it had recovered more than 2.15 million gallons of petroleum material mixed with water. It also said contaminated materials had not reached Lake Pontchartrain.     
In a news release, LEAN executive director Marylee Orr described its lawsuit notice as a “first step designed to give the community a seat at the table, if they need it, when plans and decisions are being made to respond to the disaster.”
Smitty’s Supply did not respond to a request for comment Friday.
A Clean Water Act citizen lawsuit will not allow individuals affected by the explosion to obtain any monetary damages, Orr said. Rather, it provides them access to extensive information about the accident, and they can ask the court to force Smitty’s to fully clean up the contamination. 
EPA takes over hazardous material cleanup after Tangipahoa industrial fire

The lawsuit could also result in additional environmental projects to improve the quality of the Tangipahoa River, LEAN’s news release said. 
Orr said her organizations decided to take action after hearing from Amite-area residents who are unhappy about having to do some of the clean-up work themselves. 
As of Friday, 15 days after the incident, 24-hour cleanup and firefighting operations continue, though officials reported no flareups occurred overnight, suggesting the blaze may be close to being extinguished, according to a statement from the Tangipahoa Parish Government. 
Smitty’s Supply has been previously cited for Clean Water Act violations for releasing contaminants into public drainage areas, including oil, grease, fecal coliform and carbon compounds such as methane and ethanol. The company has been fined more than $161,000 since 2021, according to the EPA’s website. 
In June, Smitty’s was non-compliant under its operating permit for exceeding limits on grease, oil and other pollutants discharged into the Tangipahoa River, according to Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality records. The company had to block off the affected areas with containment boom and clean it up with vacuum trucks. 
On June 2, a resident who lives near Smitty’s called the state agency to report a strong gas smell and a loud machinery noise coming from the plant, records show. The caller said the odor filled his house as soon as he opened the door and lasted for a few days. The records indicate an LDEQ inspector traveled to the site on June 5 and again on June 17 but found nothing out of the ordinary.
When asked for comment Friday about the Smitty’s investigation, LDEQ referred questions to the EPA, which took over as the lead responding agency a day after the explosion.

That means Iowa’s 100th year of pheasant hunting could have harvest figures between 600,000 and 700,000, according to DNR Upland Wildlife Research Biologist Todd Bogenschutz. 
“Last year was a decent year for pheasant hunting,” Bogenschutz said in a press release from DNR. “2023 was a good year for pheasant hunting. This year could be excellent.”

2023 and 2024 were two of the best pheasant harvest seasons in the past two decades. Hunters bagged an estimated 460,000 roosters in 2024 and 590,000 roosters in 2023. The harvest figures were consistent with DNR’s observed population decline from 2023 to 2024. 
This year DNR staff reported 1,038 pheasant broods – 338 more than last year. 
Bogenschutz said there were fewer chicks-per-hen that survived this year, but the high number of nests “offset the drop.” 
He said the mild winter — according to the report the fourth-least-snowy winter in 138 years of records — was also helpful in preserving population this year.
“Our adult hen survival was excellent; our adult rooster survival was excellent,” Bogenschutz said in the release. “That really drove the population increase.”
DNR staff from across the state conduct the August roadside survey on more than 200 30-mile routes. Staff drive the gravel roads early in the morning and count the hens, or female pheasants, as they move their broods out of the dew. 
This year, staff observed a statewide average of 28 birds per route, which according to the press release, is the highest count since 2005. Last year’s average was about 20 per route. 
According to the report, the northern regions, central and southeast regions have the “best overall” population densities, but it said “hunters in all regions should see more birds in 2025.” 
In addition to ring-necked pheasant, DNR staff count bobwhite quail, gray partridge and cottontail rabbit while driving the gravel roads. 
The mild winter was also a benefit to these populations which all had population increases from last year. 
Quail populations more than doubled from last year, with a 123% statewide average increase. Partridge populations increased 19% statewide and rabbit populations increased 41%, according to DNR’s report. 
The report also notes the importance of acreage in the Conservation Reserve Program, or CRP, which gives landowners an incentive to establish and maintain perennial cover over part of their cropland. 
“The CRP has become critical for Iowa pheasant populations with the loss of small grains and hay lands to corn and soybean production,” the report said. 
CRP acres serve as habitat for the birds, and DNR records show enrollment in the program has impacted pheasant populations. 
According to the report, which cites USDA figures, the number of acres enrolled in CRP is the lowest in the program’s history. Iowa had more than 1.67 million acres enrolled as of June 2025, but 727,000 of those acres are set to expire by fall of 2027, according to the report. 
“Iowa will cease to be a major pheasant hunting state if the CRP is significantly diminished,” the report said. 
Pheasant season begins Oct. 25 and runs through Jan. 10, 2026, though those 15 and younger can start a weekend earlier during the youth season Oct. 18-19.
Last year, an estimated 77,400 hunters chased after pheasant in Iowa. That’s close to the number that partook in Iowa’s first-ever hunting season, Oct. 20-22 in 1925, when 75,000 hunters set out with a three-rooster limit for a half day of hunting.
DNR said in the release that 2025 hunters can expect a “banner year.”
Hunters can celebrate the centennial of the sport with commemorative apparel and license design available online.

((Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The New Mexico Department of Health on Friday announced residents will be able to more easily access COVID-19 vaccines at state pharmacies, following updated protocols from the state Board of Pharmacy.
Last week, DOH Secretary Gina DeBlassie issued a public health order directing the state health department to work with New Mexico’s Board of Pharmacy “to remove potential barriers and ensure access to COVID-19 vaccines at pharmacies across the state.”
That order stemmed from “some pharmacies announcing they cannot administer the vaccine in New Mexico unless recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), an advisory group to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which has yet to convene and act on the matter,” a news release noted.
NMDOH medical epidemiologist Dr. Chad Smelser told Source New Mexico earlier this week that many of the vaccines administered in the state are done so through its pharmacies, which are governed by a protocol established by the Pharmacy Board and others that essentially requires the pharmacies to follow the ACIP guidelines in order to have “prescriptive authority” and give vaccines. Lacking the ACIP guidelines, Smelser noted, the pharmacies’ parent companies “have determined that they require a prescription in order to get a vaccine.”
NM Board of Pharmacy expected to release new protocol for COVID-19 vaccines this week

The revised protocols, announced Friday, mean “pharmacists can prescribe and administer COVID-19 vaccines using state health department guidelines instead of waiting for federal recommendations,” a health department news release said.
“This action will ensure New Mexicans have access to the vaccine if they choose,” New Mexico Board of Pharmacy Executive Director and Chief Drug Inspector Cheranne McCracken said in a statement, adding the New Mexico Pharmacists Association played an important role in the protocol update. “It provides pharmacists statewide with the clarity and guidance to provide COVID-19 vaccines.”
A statement from Sid Tenneti, senior vice president of retail pharmacy CVS Health confirmed the new protocol will allow access.
“Following today’s regulatory action by the New Mexico Department of Health, CVS Pharmacy will ensure COVID-19 vaccinations are available as soon as possible at our pharmacies throughout the state,” Tenneti said in a statement. “Appointments can be scheduled online via CVS.com, through the CVS Health app, or patients can walk into our pharmacies and clinics.”
The New Mexico Department of Health recommends COVID-19 vaccination for:

Anyone 65 and older.
People ages 2–64 who are at high risk for severe COVID-19 illness.
Any New Mexico resident who wants to be vaccinated.

Read the complete guidelines here.
“We are committed to ensuring access for those who wish to be vaccinated and our collaborative work with the New Mexico Board of Pharmacy demonstrates a swift resolution to remove barriers,” DeBlassie said in a statement. “As the fall/winter respiratory virus season rapidly approaches, New Mexico cannot afford to wait for the federal government to act on this matter.”
Earlier this week, prior to the new protocols being released on Friday, several state medical systems confirmed to Source NM this week availability of the COVID-19 vaccine for patients
“At Presbyterian, we support efforts to provide vaccines to New Mexicans,” Presbyterian Healthcare Services VP and Chief Pharmacy Officer Erica Downing said in a statement. “We continue to work through state and federal requirements and expect to be able to prescribe COVID vaccines for our patients and administer COVID vaccines in our facilities.”

“CHRISTUS St. Vincent has received its first shipment of the Pfizer Comirnaty COVID-19 vaccines,” a statement provided to Source said. “The vaccines will initially be offered in our clinics and in our outpatient pharmacy to adults 65 and older, and individuals ages 5 through 64 who are at increased risk for severe COVID-19.”

“Generally speaking—If a patient asks for a COVID vaccine, we’ll provide it, assuming we have the supply,” a UNM Health spokesperson said.

According to Source’s analysis, more than half of the state’s food retailers, including 42 farmers markets, are at “high risk” of significant financial losses due to SNAP cuts.(Photo by Shaun Griswold / Source NM)More than half of New Mexico’s nearly 1,700 retailers that accept food stamps are at “high risk” of losing business or closing due to recent cuts to the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, according to a Source New Mexico review of an analysis by the Center for American Progress.
According to the latest figures from the United States Department of Agriculture, 1,687 retailers across the state accept SNAP. That includes 776 convenience stores, 101 grocery stores, 72 farmers markets and 91 supermarkets, along with other types of retailers. 
Of them, 898 are at “high risk” of facing financial difficulties, including closure, according to the Center for American Progress analysis, due to the cuts contained in a recent federal spending bill. 
The recently enacted “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” also known as H.R.1, cut federal SNAP benefits, imposed work requirements and passed certain costs on to states. While the cuts have not yet gone into effect, New Mexico officials predict that the state’s 450,000 SNAP recipients will lose at least some benefits and 40,000 people will lose benefits entirely.
New Mexico has the highest percentage of SNAP recipients in the country. 
U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez (D-N.M.) told Source New Mexico this week that the cuts to SNAP will have wide-ranging impacts on not just recipients, but also retailers and farmers, especially in rural areas. He said he knows of a couple of rural grocers that receive more than three-quarters of their income from customers who use SNAP. 
Vasquez warns Republican SNAP cuts will hit rural areas hardest

Back in May, Center for American Progress researchers sought to quantify how many retailers might be in trouble if SNAP cuts went into effect. They determined that more than 27,000 retailers nationwide were at “high risk” of losing significant revenue. 
The authors deemed a particular retailer “high risk” based on two factors: One, if it was in a county with SNAP participation rates in the top 10% of counties; and, two, whether the retailer was one of relatively few in that county. 
The New Mexico Health Care Authority does not maintain its own list of retailers that heavily rely on SNAP, according to spokesperson Marina Pina. Her office also did not immediately respond to Source’s request for comment on the Center for American Progress’ methodology.
However, authority officials recently told lawmakers that they predict retailers across the state will lose $1.3 billion in revenue as a result of the cuts.
According to the center’s data, the “high-risk” retailers lie in 18 counties, mostly in rural areas. The most “high-risk” retailers (154) operate in Doña Ana County, with 125 in San Juan County and 83 in Lea County. 
The “high risk” retailers include 445 convenience stores, 42 farmers markets and 51 grocery stores, along with 267 retailers classified as “other.”

Free.,Trump signs order to change name of Department of Defense to Department of War,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-signs-order-change-name-department-defense-department-war,,"President Donald Trump signed an executive order Friday to rename the Department of Defense as the Department of War.Just before Trump signed the order in the Oval Office late Friday afternoon, he and Pete Hegseth, the secretary in charge of the department, who stood next to Trump during the signing, said the renaming reflected their intention to return to a more aggressive mindset for the military.“It's restoring, as you've guided us to, Mr. President, restoring the warrior ethos,” Hegseth said. “The War Department is going to fight decisively, not endless conflicts. It's going to fight to win, not not to lose. We're going to go on offense, not just on defense. Maximum lethality, not tepid legality. Violent effect, not politically correct. We're going to raise up warriors, not just defenders.”A text of the order was not immediately available Friday.Defense Department historyThe Department of War and the Department of the Navy were Cabinet departments from the nation's founding until 1947, when Congress combined them, along with the Department of the Air Force, into a new National Military Establishment. Congress changed that name to the Defense Department two years later.Trump said Friday that renaming 76 years ago revealed a “political correctness” in the military that contributed to poorer results on the battlefield. The U.S. has not won a major war since the reorganization, he said.“We could have won every war, but we really chose to be very politically correct or wokey, and we just fight forever and then, we wouldn't lose, really, we just fight to sort of tie,” he said. “We never wanted to win wars that every one of them we would have won easily with just a couple of little changes or a couple of little edicts.”Congress to be asked to actBecause the department’s name came from an act of Congress, it’s unclear if Trump has the power to rename it with an executive order. The president said Friday he didn’t know if it would be necessary for Congress to be involved, but that he would ask lawmakers to approve the change.“I don't know, but we're going to find out,” he said when asked if Congress would codify the renaming. “But I'm not sure they have to … There's a question as to whether or not they have to, but we'll put it before Congress.”Trump added that the cost of replacing signage and other materials associated with the department would be minimal.Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the chair of the Appropriations subcommittee with jurisdiction over the department who has often clashed with Trump, including on defense spending, said on social media that the name change was not meaningful without greater financial investment. “If we call it the Dept. of War, we'd better equip the military to actually prevent and win wars,” the former Senate Republican leader wrote. “Can't preserve American primacy if we're unwilling to spend substantially more on our military than Carter or Biden. ‘Peace through strength’ requires investment, not just rebranding.”",,,,2025-09-05 18:57:24.019276

(Photo courtesy of the New Mexico Public Education Department)This school year, at least half of all meals served in public schools in New Mexico must be made from scratch using whole, fresh ingredients under a new state Public Education Department rule.
But an informal survey by the department suggests that most schools are not yet meeting the rule, according to an Aug. 6 report by the Legislative Finance Committee. Moving to scratch cooking often requires schools to completely overhaul their kitchens and hire enough staff to run them, the report states.
While New Mexico started offering free school meals to all public school students in fall 2023, those meals weren’t required to meet quality standards until the rule went into effect for this school year, LFC Program Evaluator Ryan Tolman told the interim Legislative Education Study Committee on Friday.
The state allocated $20 million in capital outlay funding for upgrading schools’ outdated kitchens in 2023, but only 14.6% of that money had been spent as of April, with only 10 of 87 projects completed, the report states.
Sen. Anthony Thornton (R-Sandia Park) asked Tolman why more projects haven’t been completed yet. Tolman said a large part of the problem is figuring out a district’s or school’s specific needs.
Meal service can come either from school-based kitchens; central or shared kitchens that deliver to multiple schools; or private food-service management contractors, Tolman said. The food itself can come from large suppliers, the USDA Foods program or local companies, he said.
If a school wasn’t originally built for scratch cooking, it can be difficult to retrofit it with new equipment because there may be a need for more space or other major renovations, Public Education Assistant Secretary Gregory Frostad told the committee.

The rule stems from New Mexico’s 2023 expansion of free, high-quality meals to all public K-12 and charter school students regardless of their families’ income. This year, New Mexico is one of eight states with universal school meal programs, along with California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota and Vermont, the LFC report states.
The department’s survey found that 57% of schools are expanding their training for scratch cooking in response to the new law, according to the report. However, schools tell LFC staff that keeping qualified kitchen staff is a major challenge, especially in rural areas, LFC Program Evaluator Josh Chaffin told the committee.
Staffing in school kitchens dropped as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and remains a challenge, Laura Henry-Hand, deputy director of the department’s Student Success and Wellness Bureau, told the committee.
LFC recommends the department expand technical assistance and training in scratch cooking, food safety and compliance; and develop a statewide monitoring system to track spending, food waste, local food sourcing, scratch cooking, participation rates and students’ academic and health outcomes.
In the year since the law was passed, student participation in free breakfast has risen by 8.3% and free lunch by 8.5%, the report states, especially among students from higher-income families who wouldn’t have previously qualified. The report states there were increases in 68 out of the state’s 89 school districts, including all 10 of the largest ones.
Overall spending on school food programs in the state increased from $165 million in the 2018 school year to $248 million last year, the report states. Most of that comes from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) program.
Almost every New Mexico school that is eligible for CEP is participating this school year because the new law requires schools to use as much federal money as possible before using state funding, according to the report.
However, the federal government’s changes to the program’s eligibility criteria could shift more costs to New Mexico, with 20 schools losing their status under the program and 60 additional schools losing the full federal reimbursement.
With those federal changes, even if participation rates stay the same, the state is facing a 4% increase in costs totaling $2 million, Henry-Hand said.
The department is asking the Legislature for $42.2 million in recurring funding for the universal school meals program in Fiscal Year 2027, the same amount that lawmakers budgeted this year, Frostad said.
However, the department is asking for $5 million in one-time funding for potential cost overruns, he said. The LFC report notes that Michigan, Colorado and Minnesota each encountered substantial gaps between their projected and actual costs in their first years offering universal school meals.

Until Thursday, ""Wyoming’s Doctor"" had been silent on the CDC’s implosion. 
The post Barrasso joins GOP critics, Democrats in pressing RFK Jr. on vaccines appeared first on WyoFile .","Until Thursday, Wyoming U.S. Sen. John Barrasso, a physician and the Senate’s second-ranking Republican, had been silent on the implosion at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
When CDC Director Susan Monarez was fired last week — less than a month after President Donald Trump had appointed her to lead the agency — and several CDC leaders subsequently resigned in protest, Barrasso remained mum. 
Meanwhile, Louisiana Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, also a physician and chair of the Senate’s health committee, quickly called for “oversight” of the  “high-profile departures.”
Then on Thursday, Barrasso joined the fray when the Senate’s Finance Committee grilled Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on his leadership and approach to vaccine policy. 
“Secretary Kennedy, in your confirmation hearings, you promised to uphold the highest standards for vaccines,” Barrasso said. 
“Since then, I’ve grown deeply concerned.”
The comment was notable, as Barrasso has, up until now, avoided criticizing Trump administration appointees and policies.
During a 24-year career as an orthopedic surgeon, Barrasso came to be known as “Wyoming’s Doctor,” often making guest appearances on one of Casper’s local TV news stations. And he’s offered his medical perspectives since becoming a senator, including advocating for use of COVID vaccines in 2020.
In a Wall Street Journal op-ed published Thursday, Monarez said Kennedy pressured her to resign or “face termination” after she refused to comply with “troubling directives” from Kennedy. That included rubber stamping recommendations of a “vaccine advisory panel newly filled with people who have publicly expressed antivaccine rhetoric,” Monarez wrote.
After Kennedy built his reputation and fortune advocating against vaccines, he reassured lawmakers during his confirmation hearings that he would not limit access to vaccines. 
Barrasso backed him at the time. At Thursday’s hearing, Barrasso backed vaccines. 
“Over the last 50 years, vaccines are estimated to have saved 154 million lives worldwide,” Barrasso said. “I support vaccines. I’m a doctor. Vaccines work.”
Barrasso also said the National Institute of Health’s questioning of the use of mRNA vaccines, a national measles outbreak and the loss of leadership at the CDC is eroding public trust. 
“Americans don’t know who to rely on,” Barrasso said. 
He also noted that later this month the CDC’s revamped vaccine panel will meet to discuss childhood recommendations.
“Parents and physicians depend upon this guidance to make decisions and to keep kids safe,” Barrasso said, adding that he’s concerned “safe, proven vaccines, like measles, like Hepatitis B and others, could be in jeopardy, and that would put Americans at risk and reverse decades of progress.”
Barrasso’s newfound criticism of a Trump appointee did little to impress the Wyoming Democratic Party, which released a statement Friday calling on the congressman to “shove it.”
“John Barrasso is craven, but he’s not stupid,” the party said in a statement. “After all, he is a doctor. He knew exactly who and what he was voting to confirm — he just values his political career more than the lives of his constituents.”
The three-hour-long hearing often grew combative, even boiling over at times into a shouting match between Kennedy and Democratic lawmakers. 
Kennedy told New Hampshire Democrat Sen. Maggie Hassan she was “just making stuff up,” accused Monarez of being a liar, defended his tenure and showed no sign of slowing down on his makeover of the country’s top health agency. 
“We are the sickest country in the world. That’s why we have to fire people at CDC. They did not do their job. This was their job to keep us healthy,” Kennedy said. “And I need to fire some of those people to make sure this doesn’t happen again.”
While pointed in their questions, GOP lawmakers stopped short of asking for Kennedy’s resignation. 
Following the hearing, Barrasso was asked by reporters twice if he supports Kennedy, according to the Wall Street Journal. 
“I support the president,” Barrasso responded.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Students across Minnesota walked out of classes Friday to demand greater gun control following the mass shooting at Annunciation Church in south Minneapolis that left two students dead and 21 other people injured.
The walkouts were part of a national demonstration coordinated by Students Demand Action, which formed after the 2018 mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida.
Rayah Tolles, a sophomore at Saint Paul Conservatory for Performing Arts, marched with dozens of her classmates to the Capitol for a rally calling for bans on assault-style weapons and high-capacity magazines.
“Sometimes I don’t even want to go to school because I’m afraid of what might happen,” Tolles said.
At Great River School in St. Paul, more than a hundred students filed out of class and into the parking lot carrying signs reading “Protect kids not guns” and “The scariest thing in school should be my grades not guns.”
Bella Carls-Rehovsky, a senior at Great River, said fear drove her to organize the demonstration with her fellow students after learning about the Annunciation shooting.
“Because coming to school every day with the risk of a shooting hanging over our heads is detrimental to everything,” Carls-Rehovsky said.

Carls-Rehovsky said she’s been participating in demonstrations and lobbying efforts for gun control since she was 10 years old, when her cousin died by gunfire. Firearms are now the leading cause of death for children and teens in the United States.
The student walk-outs add to the pressure on Minnesota lawmakers from gun control supporters, city leaders and the parents of victims of the Annunciation shooting to strengthen the state’s gun laws.
Gov. Tim Walz said earlier this week that he will call lawmakers back to St. Paul for a special session to consider gun control legislation including bans on assault-style rifles and high-capacity magazines. But the chances of such legislation passing seem dim in a closely divided Legislature.
Walz said he would release a package of policy proposals but has yet to do so.
House Republicans released a list of proposals on Thursday should there be a special session, but none involve guns. They include increased funding for school security and mental health treatment as well as reversing the state’s ban on youth conversion therapy, which aims to change a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity.
In 2023 and 2024, the Democratic-controlled Legislature passed a red flag law, which allows judges to confiscate firearms from people deemed dangerous to themselves or others, and a universal background check requirement. The Legislature also banned bump stocks, which allow semiautomatic guns to fire more rapidly like machine guns, and increased penalties for straw purchasers, or people who buy guns for someone who is prohibited from owning them.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MG_0479-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-05 17:57:27.028013

Individuals can upload their state-issued ID or driver's license to an Apple Wallet (left) or Google Wallet (right). The state of Montana has taken the next step in allowing technologically savvy residents to simplify their wallets — not only can you pay with a single tap, you can also verify your identity. 
Montana’s Motor Vehicle Division announced on Aug. 19 it was beginning to roll out Montana Mobile IDs, allowing Montanans with iPhones, Android devices and Apple watches to securely carry a state-issued ID or driver’s license on the device. Just over a dozen other states have adopted mobile ID technology. 
Columbia Falls Rep. Braxton Mitchell, one of the legislature’s youngest representatives, sponsored House Bill 519 in 2023 to authorize the use of digital driver’s licenses for drivers, to begin Sept. 1, 2025. 
“As a Gen Z lawmaker, I sponsored this bill to give Montanans the option to add their driver’s license to their digital wallet. Digital IDs are extremely secure, encrypted, and harder to fake than a traditional plastic ID,” Mitchell said in a statement. “This is a commonsense step to modernize services by adding IDs to the same place where you can already store your credit cards, insurance cards, flight tickets, and concert tickets, making life more convenient for those who choose to use it.”
Rep. Braxton Mitchell, R-Columbia Falls, speaks on the House floor on Feb. 3, 2025. (Micah Drew/ Daily Montanan)
Mitchell further bolstered the program during the most recent session with legislation that allows businesses to use digital IDs to verify an individual’s age for restricted sales such as alcohol and tobacco, or in gambling establishments. The new law also clarified that businesses cannot store data from an ID, or sell or transfer it to a third party. 
Mitchell told the Daily Montanan in a phone interview that while it’s taken two years for the MVD to get the program up and running, the uptake has been quick, and he’s heard positive feedback from constituents. 
“The first couple of days, they told me they had about 500 people enrolled, and I know they’re into the thousands now, if not the tens of thousands,” Mitchell said on Thursday. “It seems like it’s been a pretty good response without much media outreach about it.”
Representatives from MVD did not respond to requests for comment on the rollout or how many Montanans had verified their digital ID. 
“We have spent the last three years modernizing MVD and improving operating efficiencies and customer service,” MVD Administrator Laurie Bakri said in a press release. “Now that we have overhauled the basics, we are excited to embark on an era of innovation, starting with Montana Mobile IDs and the Montana Mobile ID Verifier for Android and iOS mobile devices.”
 Supporting businesses, ensuring privacy



How to add a Montana mobile ID 

Open your digital wallet (Apple or Google) and Add a new ID. 
Follow the prompts, which include scanning the hard copy of your ID or license.
Montana MVD will only receive the information it needs to approve or deny the request. 
For information on how to add and use an ID in Apple Wallet, including more information about security and privacy, click here.
For information on how to add and use a mobile ID on an Android mobile device click here.



Using the digital ID allows Montanans to provide age verification to participating businesses without sharing additional information such as names or addresses. They can also be used for online verification. 
While the process is in place for any individual to add a mobile ID to their mobile wallets, the uptake on the business side might take more time before becoming widespread. 
The state also launched its own verification app as a tool for businesses to accept mobile IDs and verify an individual’s age as 18+ or 21+, but there isn’t a requirement for businesses to utilize it. 
“The division has guided the alcohol and cannabis industries through our website, in-person meetings over the past few months, and direct push notifications to those who have signed up to receive updates from the department,” Cannabis & Alcohol Regulation Division Administrator Kristan Barbour told the Daily Montanan. 
Barbour said in the first few days of the roll out, the division had not received any feedback from businesses about the program. 
Establishments that sell age-restricted items, such as alcohol, can use the Montana Mobile ID Verifier app, or other approved electronic readers, but the decision to accept mobile IDs is on a business-by-business basis, so Montanans might not be able to use them at their local brewery or grocery store yet. 
The Montana Gambling Control Division also endorsed the state’s companion verification app for any gambling establishments.
“It’s secure and easy to use, which will make it a great addition to the services establishments already offer their customers,” Gambling Control Division Administrator Alex Sterhan said in a press release.
The Motor Vehicle Division said that Montanans should still carry a hard-copy of their ID or driver’s license with them for verification purposes, as adoption of the technology continues growing. 
The Montana Highway Patrol anticipates having the ability to verify mobile IDs before the end of the year, according to a press release, but representatives with MHP did not respond to questions from the Daily Montanan about a timeline for adoption. 
Mitchell said he and other colleagues in the Legislature who focus on digital privacy have continued to look at how to ensure Montanan’s are secure when using this new technology. 
One additional bill passed in 2025, Senate Bill 124, sponsored by Sen. Ken Bogner, R-Miles City, clarifies that if an individual hands a law enforcement officer their phone as their identification, that does not mean they consent to having their device searched. 
Bogner said in a press statement that digital IDs are a great tool for individuals worried about losing their physical ID. 
“If you are worried about losing your license or having it stolen and winding up in the wrong hands, this is for you,” Bogner said. “This gives Montanans the option to securely carry their encrypted ID on their devices, protecting personal information and limiting data exposure through lost or stolen physical credentials.”
 Montana to ‘set the tone for other states’

As mobile IDs become more widespread nationwide, the federal government is also transitioning various agencies to be able to utilize the technology. 
The TSA has announced it accepts digital IDs issued from 16 states and Puerto Rico, including Montana Mobile IDs in a Google or Apple wallet.
In Montana, mobile IDs can be used at the state’s largest airports — Billings, Bozeman, Glacier Park, Great Falls, Helena, and Missoula — but TSA states all passengers should also carry an acceptable physical ID.
Mitchell told the Daily Montanan that over the last week, he’s heard from businesses and individuals across the state curious how the program will work, but that “the vast majority is very excited about it.”
“You can’t fake this ID. You can’t use a screen shot. It’s a live, encoded verification process,” Mitchell said, pointing out that it could be particularly beneficial in college towns to verify the ages of younger adults. 
He added that he expects Montana to continue to be a leader on modernizing its code and integrating new technology. 
“We’re one of the first states to do the whole process of rolling this out,” Mitchell said. “I think we’re definitely going to set the tone for other states to follow.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-04-at-12.17.44 PM-1024x488.png,,,2025-09-05 17:57:27.028013

Burlington’s police union and the mayor signed a three-year contract this week expected to help address longstanding hiring and retention issues and make the city’s police department a more attractive place to work.
“I think we secured some benefits that are incredibly important, both for recruitment and retention,” said Joseph Corrow, president of the Burlington Police Officers’ Association.
The 76-page contract signed Wednesday increases the base salary over a 15-step salary scale that ranges from $88,400 to $114,979. It adds retention bonuses after 5, 10, 15 and 20 years of service and stipends for full time police officers who are on call.
It also increases benefits like life insurance, pensionable overtime, and allows up to eight years of pension buy-in for lateral hires.
These are big wins, Corrow said, because it will allow certified officers from other police departments to transfer more easily to Burlington, allow a portion of their overtime pay to go toward their pensions, and be able to buy back years in the pension system instead of having to start from scratch. For lateral hires, officers would be able to come into the department at the stepped salary depending on their years of experience.
Union members called it a strong contract that will help rebuild morale and staffing in the department, Corrow said.
“I am encouraged by the agreement, as it signals strong support for policing in Burlington and provides the salary and benefits package necessary to retain and recruit the best,” Interim Chief of Police Shawn Burke said in an emailed statement.
The department currently has 61 officers and eight vacancies, he said.
Policing Burlington is “both complex and demanding,” said Burke, who stepped in to fill the post vacated by Jon Murad in March. Murad led the department for five years and recently became the commissioner of the Vermont Department of Corrections.
An internal anonymous survey of rank-and-file officers conducted by the police union last summer showed a department struggling with both recruitment and retention issues, with 75% of officers surveyed calling morale “poor” or “terrible.”
This contract aims to fix some of those issues and positions Burlington as one of the most competitive police departments statewide, Corrow said. 
“It makes us stand out at the top,” he said.
The contract comes a week after the City Council passed measures pertaining to City Hall Park amid continued debate about public safety enforcement downtown. 
Contract negotiations ended in July and the terms were agreed upon and unanimously approved last month by the Burlington City Council.
The mayor and members of the council did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

It’s giving up after Newsom’s lawsuit,Marisa Kendall,,,,,https://calmatters.org/housing/homelessness/2025/09/nowalk-newsom-homeless-shelter/,Norwalk backed down from its ban on homeless shelters after Gov. Gavin Newsom sued the Southern California city. A Los Angeles judge must approve the settlement.,"In summary
Norwalk backed down from its ban on homeless shelters after Gov. Gavin Newsom sued the Southern California city. A Los Angeles judge must approve the settlement.


In a win for Gov. Gavin Newsom’s administration, a newly inked courtroom deal would force the Southern California city of Norwalk to reverse its citywide ban on homeless shelters.
The legal settlement marks the end of a year-long battle between the governor and the city in Los Angeles County. If a judge in Los Angeles Superior Court approves the deal, Norwalk also will have to put $250,000 toward the development of new affordable housing in the city.
The fight started when Norwalk approved a ban on emergency shelters, supportive housing and several businesses that predominantly serve low-income residents, such asg liquor stores, discount stores, laundromats and payday loan establishments. In response, Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta sued the city in November. 
Newsom today called the city’s refusal to support housing for its homeless residents “inexcusable.”
“No community should turn its back on its residents in need – especially while there are people in your community sleeping on the streets,” he said in a statement. “No city is exempt from doing their part to solve the homelessness crisis.”
A spokesperson for Norwalk did not provide a comment on the lawsuit by CalMatters’ deadline. 
In a memo to council members last year, city staff wrote that shelters and homeless housing could have “detrimental effects” on the community, potentially causing “over proliferation,” noise and economic impacts, and harming property maintenance and security. Then-Mayor Margarita Rios previously told CalMatters the city passed the moratorium after frustrations mounted over a state-funded Project Roomkey hotel that housed homeless residents during the pandemic. 
The ban also blocked Los Angeles County’s plans to turn a hotel in Norwalk into homeless housing.
Newsom’s administration has made a recent effort to ramp up enforcement against cities it says are not doing their share to combat the state’s affordable housing crisis. Last year, the administration settled a lawsuit against Elk Grove in Sacramento County over the city’s denial of a housing project and got a court order forcing Huntington Beach in Orange County to follow state housing law. Newsom launched a Housing Accountability Unit in 2021 to hold cities to goals mandated in state housing plans.
“If any city or county wants to test our resolve, today’s settlement is your answer,” Bonta said in a statement about the Norwalk case. “All of us have a legal and moral responsibility to help — not hurt — those struggling to keep a roof over their heads or lacking housing altogether.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/081425-Redistricting-Rally-TS-CM-04.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-05 17:57:27.028013

Sharice Davids, the only Democrat in Kansas' congressional delegation, objects to altering boundaries so GOP is more likely to beat her in 2026.","U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, a Democrat from Kansas shown here in Abilene in 2023, is opposed to the Kansas Legislature complying with President Donald Trump's request to redraw the state's four U.S. House districts to make it easier for a Republican candidate to win her seat in Congress in the 2026 election. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Democratic U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids objected Friday to being targeted by Republicans eager to adopt a new congressional map for Kansas that divided Johnson County and further gerrymandered the state’s four districts.
A special session of the Kansas Legislature to consider changes advocated by President Donald Trump could follow the playbook used in Texas and Missouri. In both states, the GOP has moved to undermine Democratic strongholds to bolster the Republican majority in the U.S. House. In response, California and other states have expressed interest in altering district boundaries to favor Democrats.
“Politicians are once again focused on political games to benefit themselves and their extreme agenda, not hardworking Kansans,” Davids said. “Voters should pick their representatives, not the other way around, and this unprecedented step would only further polarize this country and harm our democracy.”
Davids was elected to the 3rd District seat in 2018 and earned reelection three times. Ahead of the 2022 election, the Legislature removed the northern half of Wyandotte County from her district and added a cluster of rural counties to improve the odds for Republican candidates. For the second time, Davids defeated GOP nominee Amanda Adkins while increasing her margin of victory over the 2020 result.
“I ran for Congress to serve the people of Kansas, and if this moves forward, every option will remain on the table to make sure Kansans’ voices are heard,” Davids said.
Trump urged states to manipulate congressional boundaries ahead of the 2026 midterm in an attempt to pad the thin GOP majority in the U.S. House.
In Texas, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott signed a bill designed to create five additional right-leaning districts at the expense of Democrats. California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom is spearheading a plan to place five GOP districts in hands of Democrats. A map under review by Missouri lawmakers would shift a Kansas City area district to the right.
A comparable effort by legislative leaders in Kansas to weaken Davids’ prospects of winning in 2026 would likely involve undercutting the electoral influence of Johnson County voters. Splitting the county between two congressional districts and blending those areas with large contingents of Republicans would make it more difficult for Davids to prevail.
Johnson County has recently favored Democrats, including Davids and Gov. Laura Kelly. In 2022, Kelly won reelection with 49.5% of the statewide vote, but benefitted from a 59% margin in Johnson County. Secretary of state candidate Jeanna Repass and attorney general candidate Chris Mann, both Democrats, carried Johnson County in 2022, but lost those races when the statewide vote was tallied.
U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kansas, said gerrymandering had been a reality in politics throughout his life.
“Most of the blue states are gerrymandered to the point that … I don’t know what else they could do to change the ratio,” he said. “The Democrats have always led in this gerrymandering.”
 
The GOP quest in ’26
Former Kansas Gov. Jeff Colyer, who is seeking the GOP nomination for governor in 2026, said the Legislature ought to promptly redraw congressional boundaries to favor Republicans. It would demonstrate the state’s political support for Trump, he said.
“National Democrats have gerrymandered Congress to make it more liberal than the real America,” Colyer said. “Kansas needs to lead the way in restoring sanity to our federal government.”
Senate President Ty Masterson, an Andover Republican who is among more than a half dozen GOP candidates for governor, said a special session devoted to redistricting the state’s congressional districts was under discussion.

“I am actively engaged in the battle for the heart and soul of America, helping the president to Make America Great Again,” he said.
Three years ago, there was an effort by Masterson and other legislators to hold Johnson County together as a community of interest as Kansas last overhauled congressional maps based on 2020 Census data.
He said the obligation was to divide the state’s population into four equal quadrants. That was done, he said, ahead of the 2022 election in a way that maintained Johnson County as the core of the 3rd District.
“We don’t draw the maps on voters,” Masterson said at that time. “We draw the map on residents.”
Masterson also issued a statement that said the Legislature’s mapping resulted in “compact and contiguous districts,” and it “preserves existing district cores and groups together communities of interest.”
In 2022, Kelly vetoed the congressional map adopted by the Legislature because she disagreed with moving half of Wyandotte County out of Davids’ district. The Legislature voted to override her. Lawsuits were filed to prevent implementation of the new congressional map as plaintiffs argued racial gerrymandering was illegal.
A district court judge agreed with the plaintiffs, but the Kansas Supreme Court reversed the lower court and affirmed the constitutionality of the new congressional map.




 ‘Pandering to extremists’

House Minority Leader Brandon Woodard, a Lenexa Democrat, said interest among Republican candidates for governor to subvert the will of Kansas voters through redistricting was about landing Trump’s endorsement.
“The push for congressional redistricting is nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to gain Trump’s favor and advance personal political ambitions,” Woodard said. “With so many Republican candidates now vying for governor, it’s clear that the race has become a contest to win Donald Trump’s endorsement.”
He said supporters of redistricting in Kansas were “pandering to extremists in Washington, D.C.”
In Kansas, Republicans hold supermajorities over Democrats in the House and Senate. Redrawn maps targeting Davids would likely be vetoed by Kelly. The question would be whether GOP leadership in the House and Senate could control their partisan advantage to deliver two-thirds majorities to override the governor again.
Senate Minority Leader Dinah Sykes of Lenexa said Kansas traditionally reapportioned state and federal districts on a 10-year cycle. She said it was wrong to diverge from that principled process.
“When those in power, regardless of which side of the aisle they are on, use their position of power to silence others and only increase their own power, we all lose,” Sykes said.
Sykes said GOP changes to Kansas’ congressional map could mean the votes of thousands of people no longer had an influence on the outcome of U.S. House races.
“There is no wonder why so many Americans have lost faith in their government,” she said. “They lose faith when politicians use the power of an office to take power away from where it belongs — in the hands of the people.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Sharice-Davids-in-abilene-16x9-1-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-05 17:57:27.028013

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Memorial Blood Centers reported a 44% increase in blood donations in the week following the Aug. 27 mass shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church which left two children dead and 21 others injured.
Memorial Blood Centers, which services several local hospitals, provided over 250 units of blood platelets and plasma to Children’s Minnesota, M Health Fairview, Hennepin Healthcare, and North Memorial Health for treating victims from the Annunciation shooting and other shootings last week, according to spokesperson Corey Bianchi-Rossi.
Blood donations at this point may not go to the victims directly, but a constant supply of donations helps prepare for any future tragedies, as well as provide for the routine need for blood transfusions in surgeries or illnesses, the spokesperson said.
“The reason we were able to supply the hospitals that needed the blood to help their patients, the victims, is because of the people who donated the week prior,” Bianchi-Rossi said.
Before the Annunciation shooting, blood donation organizations had declared a “blood emergency”, when the state’s blood supply dropped to below a two-day inventory — far below the ideal seven-day inventory. A lower supply of blood is to be expected in the summer months, when accidents increase and regular donors might be traveling. As of Tuesday, the blood supply is back up to a four-day inventory, Bianchi-Rossi said, and will likely trend upward in the coming days.
Memorial Blood Centers has seen more than a 400% increase in appointments made since the shooting. Last week, that resulted in an additional 931 transfusable units over the average weekly donation of 2100 units. On Wednesday, spots were nearly filled at a blood drive held at Annunciation Church, which normally hosts a blood drive four times a year.
A larger than usual portion of the donations came from first-timer donors. Typically during this time of year, only 11% of donations are made by first-time donors, compared to 24% since the day of the Annunciation shooting.
The American Red Cross, which also has local blood donation centers, was not asked by the city or hospitals to provide blood in response to the shootings, said spokesperson Nate Russell.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/NN250903_0068-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-05 17:57:27.028013

Until now,” Chen said. TPS is granted when a national’s home country is deemed too dangerous to return to, for reasons such as violence, political instability or extreme natural disasters. The Trump administration has moved to end that status, which protects immigrants from deportation and grants work permits, as it aims to limit legal pathways in its immigration crackdown. Trump tried to end TPS for Haiti during his first term, but was blocked by the courts.“This case arose from action taken post haste by the current DHS Secretary, Kristi Noem, to revoke the legal status of Venezuelan and Haitian TPS holders, sending them back to conditions that are so dangerous that even the State Department advises against travel to their home countries,” said Chen, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama.900,000 people with legal protectionsMore than 600,000 Venezuelans have TPS after arriving in the United States in 2021 and 2023. More than 300,000 Haitians have TPS, which was granted after a catastrophic earthquake in 2010.Chen said that while the Supreme Court in May allowed the Trump administration to continue with removing protections for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans, he argued the justices did not make a decision on the merits of the case.“The Supreme Court’s order did not bar this Court from adjudicating the case on the merits and entering a final judgement issuing relief under… the (Administrative Procedure Act),” Chen wrote. An appeals court last week ruled in a separate but related case regarding TPS for Venezuelans that deemed the Trump administration likely acted unlawfully in ending the protected status for those immigrants.",,,,2025-09-05 17:57:27.028013

“We may need to ask policy committees to review existing programs to see if there are any that can be scaled back or may no longer be the priority they once were,” the House Appropriations Committee's bipartisan leaders wrote.

Leaders of Vermont’s House Appropriations Committee have warned colleagues that next year’s state budget-building process could be among the most difficult in recent memory — potentially forcing some existing programs onto the chopping block — as lawmakers grapple with sweeping federal funding cuts in President Donald Trump’s tax and spending law.
“We expect the upcoming state budget cycle to present a number of challenges that most of us have not experienced as legislators before due to uncertainty in the economic forecast and changes in the federal budget,” wrote Rep. Robin Scheu, D-Middlebury, and Rep. Jim Harrison, R-Chittenden, in a memo to the full House last month. Scheu is the committee’s chair; Harrison is its vice chair.
Moreover, the leaders of the powerful budget-writing panel wrote, “We may need to ask policy committees to review existing programs to see if there are any that can be scaled back or may no longer be the priority they once were.”
The House’s “policy committees” focus on specific areas of law, such as education, health care or transportation. The Appropriations Committee, which oversees state spending, and the House Ways and Means Committee, which writes tax policy, are known as the chamber’s two “money committees.”
The memo, which was shared with VTDigger, was part of an email House Speaker Jill Krowinski, D-Burlington, sent to all 150 House members on Aug. 11. Krowinski’s email included a handful of other summertime updates for her colleagues, who adjourned their 2025 session in mid-June and are slated to come back to the Statehouse for the 2026 session in January. 
Harrison described the intent of his and Scheu’s message during a panel of top Vermont Republican leaders Thursday night in Ludlow. 
“One, the message was, don’t think of new ways to spend the money, even though there are a lot of them,” he said. “And two, we need you to start thinking about, what are the programs that we have that may have been a good idea and served a good purpose 20 years ago, but maybe aren’t as important today as something else — like health care.”
Citing projections economists shared with legislative leaders and Gov. Phil Scott in late July, Scheu and Harrison wrote that state revenues are expected to increase by about $61 million during the state’s 2027 fiscal year. That’s the time period, running from July 2026 to June 2027, for which lawmakers will be creating a new state budget starting in January. 
While that revenue upgrade is good news, Scheu and Harrison wrote, it won’t be enough to cover projected increases in salaries and benefits for state employees and “a myriad of other fixed costs,” they wrote, meaning “we can probably expect some adjustments to programs and services” to make up the difference. 
The economists also cautioned that their projections could need to be revisited because of uncertainty over the impacts of both the GOP-led federal spending package and Trump’s tariffs. 
“Don’t get comfortable,” Tom Kavet, one of the state’s economists, said in July. 
It’s unlikely, however, that the full Legislature will need to meet again this year to respond to losses in federal funding, Scheu and Harrison wrote. That’s because many of the changes included in Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” do not take effect until 2026, or later, the legislators said. That includes certain cuts to Medicaid and access to federal nutritional assistance, among others. 
Lawmakers added several measures into the state budget bill for the current fiscal year, which they approved in May, that would trigger a special legislative session if federal funding cuts reached certain thresholds. But those thresholds are unlikely to be hit just yet, according to Scheu and Harrison.
Before legislators start work on the state budget next year, they will first get a proposed spending plan from the Scott administration. In an email Friday, Scott’s press secretary, Amanda Wheeler, said the administration was still too early in its budget development process to say whether any existing state programs might see significant cuts.
“We’ll review all funding impacts and deliver a balanced budget to the Legislature in January,” she said.

Youngblut’s appearance Friday afternoon was the first court hearing since prosecutors filed upgraded charges last month against the former Seattle resident, which carry the possibility of the death penalty.

BURLINGTON — Teresa Youngblut pleaded not guilty Friday to federal criminal charges that could carry the death penalty in the fatal shooting of a border patrol agent in northern Vermont. 
The hearing in federal court in Burlington was the first since prosecutors obtained an indictment with upgraded charges last month and filed notice that they will seek Youngblut’s execution, if convicted, of the capital crimes.  
Youngblut, a 21-year-old former Seattle resident, had initially been charged earlier this year with federal firearms and assault charges in connection with a traffic stop that led to the fatal shooting of U.S. Border Patrol Agent David Maland on Interstate 91 in Coventry on the afternoon of Jan. 20. 
The latest indictment charges Youngblut with murdering Maland’s and assaulting two other agents with a deadly weapon. 
Youngblut remains held without bail following Friday’s hearing.
Prosecutors alleged in charging documents that after the traffic stop on I-91, Youngblut exited the Toyota Prius that had been pulled over and opened fire, resulting in a shootout with law enforcement. 
Maland, 44, of Newport, was killed in the exchange of gunfire, court documents stated, as was Felix Bauckholt, a German national and a passenger in the vehicle Youngblut was driving.
Youngblut and Bauckholt had been linked to a loosely connected group of people known as the Zizians, whose members have been tied to at least six other homicides across the country, including a landlord in California and a couple in Pennsylvania.  
Federal capital charges were being considered by prosecutors in Youngblut’s case for some time, with U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi signaling shortly after taking office in February that she would be pushing for the charges as well.
President Donald Trump issued an executive order on his inauguration day Jan. 20 — the same day as Maland’s fatal shooting — lifting a moratorium on the federal death penalty that had been put in place during the Biden administration.
Bondi, in a later directive to federal prosecutors across the country, specifically cited Maland’s death as a case where capital charges would be warranted.
Vermont has not carried out an execution since 1954 and the state no longer has the death penalty, but Youngblut was charged in federal court, where capital punishment remains an option.

Hunger Mountain Co-op in Montpelier has purchased the neighboring property of rK Miles, a lumberyard that was damaged in a 2023 fire, as part of an expansion plan.  
The co-op purchased the 1.6-acre property for $487,500, according to a press release. Co-op leaders plan to use the lot to expand its capacity for parking, storage and other operational needs. 
“This purchase is a key part of our long-term vision to deepen the Co-op’s values of health, sustainability, and cooperation,” general manager Mary Mullally said in the press release. “Back in 2012, we anticipated a need for more parking and retail space. This agreement allows us to explore those options while continuing to serve our vibrant community.” 
The co-op sits along Stone Cutters Way, a one-way street parallel to the Winooski River. Its customer parking lot is located on the northwest side of the building, while the new purchase adjoins the co-op building to the southeast. 
The exterior of an 8,000-square foot building on the former rK Miles property still has fire damage that will need to be addressed before it can be used for storage, Mullally said in a phone interview. The property will allow the co-op to buy in larger quantities, and it should also be “relatively easy” to set up staff parking on the site as an initial goal, she said. 
But the press release and website for the project seem to anticipate concerns from members. In its “frequently asked questions” section, the co-op addressed the timing of the purchase with the recent ratification of a union contract with UE 255, the union that represents co-op employees. 
According to the website, the timing was a coincidence, and the purchase should not affect salaries because money used for the purchase is from reserve funds rather than the operating budget. The union did not respond to a request for comment before publication time. 
The FAQs also addressed why the purchase negotiation was not shared with members. It was instead left to a smaller council vote. 
“We began exploring the possibility seriously in the fall of 2024, after the property’s owner expressed interest in selling,” the co-op wrote on the website. “At that point, we followed standard fiduciary and governance practices by conducting due diligence in private. This included reviewing financial terms, legal considerations, environmental assessments, and potential risks.”
Mullally said the co-op published the FAQ section to “provide as much information as possible.” So far, the feedback received has been “extremely positive,” she said. 
The co-op has its annual meeting planned for Sept. 13. Members are welcome to bring their questions about the future of the property to the meeting, Mullally said. 
In the long term, the co-op has floated ideas for the property: Expanded retail space, community gardens, housing. But the co-op may need further assessments to determine if environmental remediation is needed, it wrote on the website. The co-op is also creating a flood risk management plan. 
Mullally said it has been “a long process,” but she’s happy it’s come to completion. 
“I’m so excited about what this means to the co-op’s future,” she said.

Advocates want CT to do the same.","Connected elected officials and disability rights organizations this week called on Gov. Ned Lamont to take action on the state’s vaccine eligibility guidelines amid uncertainty over federal vaccine policy under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s leadership.
Over the past week, some states have made early moves to take control of vaccine guidance.
In Massachusetts, Gov. Maura Healey this week directed the state Department of Public Health to authorize pharmacists to administer the new COVID vaccine to anyone 5 years of age or older, despite recent changes to eligibility from the FDA. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul on Friday issued a similar directive. 
In late August, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved new COVID-19 vaccines for the fall, but only for people 65 and older and those who are at high-risk for severe disease. Previously, the vaccines were available to anyone 6 months or older. The move was significant because federal vaccine guidelines determine both the availability of vaccines and coverage by insurers.
Attorneys with Disability Rights CT and the CT Council on Developmental Disabilities sent a letter to Lamont on Friday requesting that he issue state guidance with broader eligibility standards. 
“We urge you to follow the lead of Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey and adopt and publicize a broader standard eliminating the need to prove such a condition and requiring all insurance plans to continue to cover vaccinations outside of the [Centers for Disease Control] guidelines,” the attorneys stated in the letter. They also noted that the Association of Massachusetts Health Plans had agreed to continue providing coverage for the shots.
Rob Blanchard, a spokesperson for Lamont, said the state “will be preparing what we must to ensure no one’s health is jeopardized in Connecticut.” However, the statement did not address the request from the disabilities rights organizations or the current availability of vaccines for those younger than 65 without underlying health conditions. 
As of Friday morning, the availability of vaccines in Connecticut was still in flux. 
Western state governors are working regionally to issue public health guidance. On Wednesday, a handful of governors announced the creation of the West Coast Health Alliance “to uphold scientific integrity in public health as Trump destroys CDC’s credibility,” according to a statement from Gov. Gavin Newsom of California. Oregon, Washington and Hawaii are also part of the coalition.
In a statement issued the following day, Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, and Senate President Pro Tempore Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, called on northeastern states to follow suit, while acknowledging that some level of coordination is already happening. 
“The West Coast Health Alliance also comes amid reports that Connecticut was one of eight states to send public health officials to a recent meeting about forming their own regional alliance. Such an effort would allow states to make health recommendations and guidance directly to the public. Sens. Looney and Duff encouraged Connecticut officials to pursue these partnerships,” the statement read.
Brittany Schaefer, a spokesperson for the Connecticut Department of Public Health, confirmed that Commissioner Manisha Juthani and other staff attended a regional meeting of public health officials last month that allowed the states to share strategies “at a time of federal health restructuring and cuts.”
“CT has regularly collaborated with neighboring states as public health challenges extend beyond state lines and those conversations have ramped up in recent months following recent federal health changes,” Schaefer said when asked about the statement from Senators Duff and Looney.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25247536418606-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-05 16:57:26.565921

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)The four detainees who escaped an immigrant jail in Newark earlier this summer have been caught and now face up to a year imprisonment and $100,000 fines each, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for New Jersey announced Friday.
The last of the escapees, Andres Felipe Pineda Mogollon, 25, of Colombia, appeared in federal court on Aug. 18, the office announced.
Mogollon, along with Franklin Norberto Bautista Reyes, 20, of Honduras; Joan Sebastian Castaneda Lozada, 18, of Colombia; and Joel Enrrique Sandoval-Lopez, 22, of Honduras, escaped Delaney Hall in Newark on June 12 by busting through a second-story aluminum wall, dropping mattresses through the opening to soften their landing, and hurdling jail fences by using bed sheets to cover the barbed wire.
The four were apprehended within a week of their escape — Mogollon in Los Angeles on July 17, and the other three in New Jersey on June 15 and 16, according to the office.
The 1,100-bed immigrant jail — the first to open under President Donald Trump’s second term — is owned and operated by the private prison company Geo Group under a 15-year contract with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
It has drawn protests since it opened in May, with New Jersey’s two senators saying the escape proved the facility is in “shoddy” shape and should be evacuated.
It was also the site of a May 9 scuffle between visiting politicians and jail security that fueled complaints that acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba is using her position to attack political foes. During that fracas, officers arrested Newark Mayor Ras Baraka and Habba later secured an indictment of Rep. LaMonica McIver, after accusing her of assaulting officers outside the jail. Baraka and McIver are Democrats.
Baraka’s charges were quickly dropped, while McIver’s case remains ongoing.

SPRINGFIELD — The 36-year-old man who was shot to death by police last month appears to have gotten caught up in an operation that was targeting another man for arrest, according to people who were at the address when the shooting occurred.
Police claim that, on the evening of Aug. 21, James Crary was in a vehicle when he allegedly “accelerated toward officers” who were “outside their vehicles” during a police response at 78 Valley St. Officers then opened fire, striking Crary multiple times. He was pronounced dead at the scene, Vermont State Police said in a press release.
The circumstances of Crary’s death are now under investigation by the Vermont State Police, which was not involved in the “underlying operation” that led to the shooting. The two police officers who fired their weapons — Springfield police officer Vincent Franchi and Windsor County Sheriff’s deputy Bryan Jalava — have been placed on paid leave and are cooperating with the investigation, according to police.
In interviews, people who said they were present at the time of the shooting described the aftermath.
“The police said, ‘We weren’t even here for James Crary,’” said Khristal Blanchard, a resident at 78 Valley St., who witnessed part of the incident.
According to Blanchard, police told her they had come to apprehend a suspect in a “hostage and kidnapping situation” earlier that day in Springfield.
Springfield police and Windsor sheriff deputies — officials have not disclosed how many — responded to the Valley Street address shortly before 9:30 p.m. on Aug. 21 “as part of an open investigation,” Vermont State Police said in the release. When they arrived, “they encountered a man” — later identified as Crary — “in a vehicle outside the home.”
Police then opened fire at Crary. The Chief Medical Examiner’s Office in Burlington conducted an autopsy and concluded Crary died from “gunshot wounds to the head,” according to Vermont State Police.
Investigators are reviewing cruiser and body cam video footage of the incident, including “third party” video of the incident, said Vermont State Police spokesperson Adam Silverman.
Springfield Police Chief Jeffrey Burnham referred questions about the police operation and shooting to state police.

Windsor County Sheriff Ryan Palmer said his department’s deputies were at 78 Valley St. that evening to “help Springfield arrest a suspect on a pretty serious charge.” 
Following the shooting, police apprehended the suspect, who was inside the house, and charged him with assaulting and robbing $300 from a Springfield man whom police say held against his will at a nearby apartment, according to court documents. 
‘I didn’t even know the cops were here’
Crary most recently had been living in Newport, New Hampshire, and authorities have not said why he was in Springfield the night of the shooting. People who were at the address that evening said Crary had come to check up on a female friend who was there.
“It was a pop-in visit,” said Randi Sargent, who was among a group watching a movie in the garage space when Crary had appeared at the door.
He stayed for a little while and “had just said goodbye and left,” Sargent said. Shortly afterward she heard four gunshots.
“I thought it was someone shooting at the house,” she said.
Blanchard said she briefly chatted with Crary in the driveway and then went back up to her room on the second floor of the house.
“I didn’t even know the cops were here,” Blanchard said.
When she got to her room, she heard gunshots and looked outside the window over the driveway.
“I saw James’ head go down and hit the steering wheel,” Blanchard said. “The car started to roll back and was smoking.”
She said she started to scream, and two people with her in the room pulled her away from the window.
Both Sargent and Blanchard said they heard a total of four shots.

Sargent pointed out bullet holes in the wall of the converted garage used as a lounge space that she said came from the police gunfire.
Several people were sitting on the sofa watching the movie when bullets pierced the wall, which barely missed her boyfriend sitting at the end, Sargent said. When they heard the shots, one in the group shut the door to the room.
“We laid on the floor over here and we barricaded the door until (the police) told us to open it,” Sargent said.
Blanchard said after the shooting she heard police yelling to “come down with your hands up” and the people upstairs — including the intended suspect — all came down.
Blanchard said she remonstrated the officers over the shooting: “What was this all about? Like, are you serious? Was this really called for?”
Blanchard said one of the officers responded: “This was not what we meant to happen. We’re so sorry for your loss. We weren’t here for (Crary).” 
Crary’s body lay covered in the driveway for more than 12 hours before it was taken to the medical examiner’s office in Burlington, according to people at the house.
Shooting victim leaves behind a daughter
Kristin Crary said her brother grew up alternating between his mother’s in Claremont and at their father’s in Canaan. He attended Mascoma Valley High School and often had jobs waxing and stripping floors.
Julie Morse, who knew Crary when they grew up together in Claremont and had been his friend for 20 years, said he “would never purposefully been out to hurt anybody ever.”
Morse said Crary liked buffing the floors of Hannaford and Market Basket on the overnight shift because “he could be left alone independently.”
Crary left behind a 10-year-old daughter who “meant a lot to him,” Morse said.
The day after the shooting occurred, Morse went to 78 Valley St. to talk with neighbors and people there about how events had unfolded. She said she suspects that Crary was trying to pull out of the driveway when he became “startled” by the large police contingent that had come to arrest Hewitt.
“James was just in the wrong place at the wrong time,” she said.

The organization’s annual free dental clinic opens at 6 a.m., but people will line up early, waiting to receive cleanings, procedures and other services the volunteer clinicians and aids can provide.
This year, University of Iowa dental faculty and students will join Iowa Mission of Mercy (IMOM) volunteers to provide free dental care to anyone in need during the two-day clinic, which is coming to Coralville for the first time.
Brendan Young, a University of Iowa associate professor of dentistry and director of behavioral science who has volunteered with IMOM for four years, said he met one woman who said she relies on the annual clinic, which stops in a different area of Iowa each year, for all of her oral health care.
“I think the lines sort of indicate there is a real need, and people are really grateful for the opportunity to get that need met,” Young said. “And so, coming in, they’re in a pretty good mood, and certainly when they leave, there’s a great deal of relief and a great deal of gratitude.”

The 100-bed clinic will open at 6 a.m. on Sept. 19 and 20 at Hyatt Regency Coralville Hotel and Conference Center, according to a news release from Iowa Mission of Mercy, and will remain open each day until the clinic reaches capacity.
IMOM has been operating the free clinic since 2008, according to its website, and has served more than 18,000 patients. UI Clinical Associate Professor of Oral Pathology, Radiology, and Medicine Carrie McKnight said she’s volunteered with IMOM for nearly 10 years, and each clinic provides approximately $1 million in services for patients.
In Coralville, however, McKnight said she expects to surpass that number.
Anyone, regardless of their age, insurance, income or where they call home, is welcome to come by the clinic for oral health care, including cleaning, fillings, root canals, exams and more, McKnight said. Participants will also receive information and materials to address dental needs at home.
When it comes to dental care, Young said people can experience a variety of barriers to getting their needs met. A primary block is the cost of care, he said, but fear and shame can keep folks from visiting a dentist consistently, or at all. People often are afraid of pain, of needing their teeth pulled and of having visible dental issues like missing teeth or bleeding gums which are stigmatized in the U.S.
Young said oral health can even impact someone’s relationships, employability and other areas of life.

“People feel really self conscious about their teeth, and going to see a dentist when you’ve got poor oral health — it can really serve as a barrier,” Young said. “And so we make a real effort at IMOM to be super nonjudgmental. Come as you are — we will meet you where you are.”
Young said a lot of work goes into organizing the clinics, from finding the right space, to setting up equipment and ensuring the infrastructure is there to support it. In addition to dental clinicians and students volunteering to help run the event, he said other volunteers help with things like onsite child care and more. Local plumbers will even donate their time to install temporary water lines and ensure they run properly.
McKnight said a “contingent” of dental students are always on board to work the clinic, but this year there was an outpouring of support from students, faculty and community dentists. UI dental students get to work with real patients at the university during their education as well, she said, and showing them their ability to help those in need is a “key component” of their education.
While a more dour mood might be expected at a dental clinic, Young said participants are generally happy to have the resource available and grateful to receive expert care.
McKnight said the clinic can’t solve all of the problems some patients have, and staff often have to cut off the line when they reach capacity, but Young said many people leave the clinic in less pain than when they came in.
“There is a lot of gratitude for what we do,” McKnight said. “So it certainly fills our cup to be able to help them.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Well before he canceled and skipped meetings with the state’s top school board in recent weeks, state Superintendent Ryan Walters has been chronically absent from multiple state boards where he holds a seat, including one he’s supposed to lead.
Public meeting records show poor attendance from Walters, particularly this year, on various governing boards whose votes impact K-12 school funding, vocational learning centers, higher education and other state government matters.
This year, Walters has attended only one meeting of the state Board of Career and Technology Education despite being its chair, Oklahoma Voice found through an analysis of meeting minutes. He skipped the CareerTech board’s six other meetings in 2025, including three that took place in a room adjacent to his office at the Oklahoma State Department of Education. 
Oklahoma CareerTech Director Brent Haken, a non-voting member of the board, has led the meetings in Walters’ place. In 2024, Walters attended six meetings and missed four, and in 2023, he attended seven and was absent for four, meeting minutes show.
Haken said Walters’ presence, or lack thereof, has had no impact on the board and the CareerTech agency, which oversee vocational education centers across the state.
“Actually I enjoy the lack of attention so that we can get work done for the state of Oklahoma,” he said.

Walters also leads the Oklahoma State Board of Education, whose meetings have become a circus of protests, political conflict and media attention during his tenure in office.
After a month of heightened tensions with board members, Walters abruptly canceled the board’s regular Aug. 28 meeting with little explanation. It was the board’s second canceled meeting of 2025, the first happening after the Education Department posted an agenda too late to comply with the Oklahoma Open Meeting Act.
The August meeting cancellation prompted the board to take the extraordinary action of scheduling its own special meeting on Wednesday.
Walters did not attend. In his absence, the present board members voted to hire an attorney and started the process to find a new board secretary.
In a statement through a spokesperson, Walters declined to explain why he missed so many meetings of his various state boards. He also did not answer whether expects future state Board of Education meetings to convene as scheduled or whether he might miss more. 
“My focus has been, and will continue to be, on reforming Oklahoma’s education system to put families and students first,” he said in the statement. “We’ve implemented bold reforms across the state to raise academic outcomes, empower parents, and ensure taxpayer dollars are being used wisely in the classroom.”
Wednesday was far from the only state board meeting this year where Walters was marked absent.
He hasn’t shown up for a single board meeting in 2025 for the Commissioners of the Land Office, a board that oversees state-owned school lands and assets that benefit public education funding.

Gov. Kevin Stitt, Lt. Gov. Matt Pinnell, State Auditor and Inspector Cindy Byrd and Agriculture Secretary Blayne Arthur also sit on the board and regularly attend its meetings at the state Capitol, records show.
Walters also skipped the only two meetings the state Board of Equalization has held this year in February and June, according to the State Auditor and Inspector’s Office, which keeps the board’s meeting records. The board meets four times a year to review and certify tax revenue that funds all of state government. 
Walters has missed four of the board’s meetings since he took office in January 2023, according to the board minutes.
Meeting records show Walters’ predecessor, former state Superintendent Joy Hofmeister, was a regular attendee of CareerTech, Commissioners of the Land Office and state Board of Equalization meetings in 2022, a year she was running for governor while in her final year of statewide office. 
Hofmeister also frequently attended the Oklahoma Educational Television Authority’s meetings until 2022, when she appeared only once. 
Walters attended no OETA meetings in 2023 and 2024, records indicate. Meeting minutes from 2025 aren’t available on OETA’s website, and a request for them wasn’t immediately returned.
He’s never shown up for a meeting of his assigned higher education board, either.
Under state law, whoever is elected state superintendent automatically has a seat on the board of regents for the Regional University System of Oklahoma. The RUSO regents govern six public universities, the largest being the University of Central Oklahoma in Edmond.
Public records show Walters has never been marked present for a RUSO board meeting since he took office.
Hofmeister didn’t attend any RUSO meetings in 2022, either, but she attended one to two meetings each year over the three years prior, according to meeting minutes.
Chris Van Denhende served on the RUSO board from 2021 until February, when the governor appointed him to the state Board of Education.

He said Walters’ absence had no effect on the university system’s board or operations. A state superintendent’s attendance, though, could have given the regents an opportunity to question why so few Oklahoma high school students graduate ready for college-level academics.
“I find the bigger story is why our elected officials take so little interest in their responsibility,” Van Denhende said. “That said, we may be better off if they don’t attend at all. I’m so frustrated with the politics that go on.”
Van Denhende and three other Board of Education members leaned on Oklahoma City constitutional attorney Bob Burke and various state government officials to schedule and carry out their special meeting Wednesday. 
Burke, a historian and former state commerce secretary, said he hopes Walters will make a concerted effort to attend all future state Board of Education meetings. 
It’s important that he shows up for his other state boards too, Burke said, or that he chooses a designee to attend in his place, as state law allows.

Walters has chosen a designee for only two boards, the Statewide Charter School Board and the State Textbook Committee. His proxies on both boards have maintained regular attendance, meeting minutes show.
The multitude of boards that keep state government running are often made up of mostly unelected appointees.
That’s why it matters that elected officials show up, Burke said. If they don’t, the voters of Oklahoma don’t have their chosen representative present.
The state Board of Education is a prime example. Of its seven members, Walters is the only one whose name appears on a voting ballot. The governor appoints the rest.
“What the people lose is the vision of the (state) founders in holding all of our government accountable to the people,” Burke said.

(Courtesy of Lake Area Technical College)Leaders of the state’s technical college system plan to ask legislators for $11 million in one-time funds for renovation and building projects at two eastern South Dakota campuses.
Presidents from Lake Area Tech in Watertown and Southeast Tech in Sioux Falls shared their visions with the Board of Technical Education on Thursday during an online meeting. Executive Director Nick Wendell said the “timing feels appropriate” to pursue one-time state funding for the projects.
“I think, in both cases, they check some important boxes as we think about our strategic priorities and growing graduate capacity in the system between now and the middle part of the next decade,” Wendell said.
Technical college board endorses $49 million state budget request

Wendell will meet with Gov. Larry Rhoden and the Bureau of Finance and Management next week to discuss the one-time requests and board-approved $49 million ask in ongoing funding.
The board did not formally endorse or approve the one-time request, but Wendell said at the end of the meeting he sensed a “spirit of support” from members.
While state revenue projections for ongoing funding are tight, Wendell told South Dakota Searchlight after the meeting that his organization typically enters legislative sessions “assuming there would be some one-time funding for targeted projects.”
“We’re following the same ongoing revenue projections everyone else is, including the funding that might be challenging to come by,” Wendell said. “But if there are opportunities for one-time funds, we wanted to identify some of those targeted projects we think would be great priorities to invest in.”
Lake Area Tech student center renovation
Lake Area Tech plans to renovate 14,000 square feet of its student center to centralize its services, including counseling, testing and adult education learning centers. The adult learning center is currently in a building that is “beyond its useful life,” President Tiffany Sanderson told board members, and is expected to be replaced by a new public safety training center in the coming years.
The student center renovation would cost $4 million. Lake Area Tech would cover $1 million and ask the state for $3 million.
Sanderson said state funding for the project will spur industry partners to invest in academic changes and other parts of the college’s master plan.
“The total plan over the next 10 years is about $100 million in investment, so this is just 4% of that total project,” Sanderson said. “But it’s a really critical 4% to build early momentum.”
Wendell told board members that to increase graduate numbers in the technical education system, colleges such as Lake Area will have to recruit more non-traditional students.
“In many cases, those are students that will need access to student services to find success on our campuses,” Wendell said. “And as a board, we’ve sort of been committed to this notion that we don’t just want to recruit and enroll a broader swath of students, but we want to ensure that they have access to the tools they need to be successful.”
Southeast Tech plans new building and expansion
Southeast Tech plans to build a new center for advanced manufacturing, which would rehouse its advanced manufacturing programs in maintenance technology and mechanical engineering and add 34,000 square feet of lab and classroom space. President Cory Clasemann said the school also plans to expand and renovate its welding space, adding 12,000 square feet for a welding lab and shared fabrication space with the advanced manufacturing programs.
The college’s construction, HVAC, mechanical engineering, plumbing and welding programs are all at capacity with a waiting list for enrollment. Advanced manufacturing, Clasemann said, is a priority because it accounts for one out of 10 jobs in South Dakota and is expected to grow its workforce by 6% through 2032 in the state.
“This is really the linchpin of several other pieces,” Clasemann said.

The project will cost $24 million overall. About $16 million will be spent on the advanced manufacturing building and $7 million on the welding lab expansion, with about $1 million in design fees.
The school has raised $1.5 million in private funding with plans to fundraise another $8 million. The Board of Technical Education plans to request $8 million from the state. The school secured $6.5 million through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development for the project, which are funds that must be spent by 2031.
“We’re mindful of federal spending at the moment, so we’d rather spend them sooner rather than later,” Clasemann said. “We are aware that, just with recissions going on, that they could go away.”
The project will double enrollment capacity for the school’s mechanical engineering program and increase its maintenance technology capacity by 50%. The increase in capacity will free up space for other program expansions.
Clasemann said the technical college needs “a couple more million dollars” to move forward with the advanced manufacturing building, which can begin without funding for the welding expansion and renovation.

Act 72 applies to all grades K-12 and requires an appropriately trained education professional to provide remediation. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Dorrine Dorfman and Charlene Webster: Following up on Vermont’s Act 72.","This commentary is by Charlene Webster, of Arlington, and Dorinne Dorfman, of Plainfield. Charlene has taught grades 3-6, special education and structured literacy in southwestern Vermont over her 40-year career. Dorinne teaches reading to grades 5-8 at Barre Town Middle and Elementary School, and has served as principal of Leland and Gray Union High School in Townshend and Champlain Elementary School in Burlington.
It’s never too early to start reading instruction and intervention in our schools. The best time for students to obtain strong foundational reading skills is between prekindergarten and the second grade. During a child’s pre-K through kindergarten years, deficits in language, alphabetics and phonemic awareness that may develop are small. 
Effective intervention, especially at this early stage, can close these gaps. Unlike other developmental milestones (such as walking and talking), reading rarely develops without direct instruction. Consensus research has shown that literacy gaps in the earliest grades predict reading problems later. The longer schools wait to remediate, the greater the reading failure gap, the harder to correct and the less likely students will ever become proficient readers.
In the past, American schools have chosen to “wait and see” by giving students more time to develop reading skills. This approach has been renamed “wait to fail” because rarely did gaps close without evidence-aligned intervention. 
Vermont passed legislation in 2024, Act 139, which abandoned this approach. Parents/guardians can pay careful attention to see how their schools are providing effective intervention beginning at the youngest grades. 
Parents/guardians will know effective remediation is being delivered when they see their children’s growth by receiving detailed progress-monitoring assessments and hearing their children sound out new words and read aloud with fluency and accuracy. 
In fact, when students as early as pre-K and kindergarten demonstrate poor skills on these predictive assessments, schools should provide intervention right away to close existing gaps before these students fail to make reading progress. 
These assessments include:

The names and sounds of all letters in the alphabet
Rapid Automatized Naming, which are skills in retrieving the names of letters, numbers and objects accurately and automatically.
Oral language skills: speech articulation, vocabulary, grammar, understanding longer sentences, attention and following directions.

Act 139 requires all students in grades K-3 be assessed and receive classroom instruction in the five components of reading: phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary and comprehension. Assessments must be valid and reliable, and administered following the test’s technical specifications at least once a year. 
Schools must notify the parents/guardians of students found significantly below proficient. Some schools have chosen to report all their students’ progress on the five reading components. Parents may always request results from these screenings.
Although Act 139 has put an end to misguided instructional approaches that have harmed student reading, thousands of Vermont students today continue to struggle to learn to read and write. 
For this reason, Act 72 — which was formerly called H.480 and was passed in June 2025 — requires public and approved independent schools to provide effective intervention to students significantly below proficiency in reading or whose poor reading skills impede school progress. 
Act 72 applies to all grades K-12 and requires an appropriately trained education professional to provide remediation. Schools must notify, support and share information with parents/guardians of students found significantly below proficient. 
Carrying out Vermont’s reading laws provides every student the opportunity to learn to read well and succeed in school and adulthood.

(Photo by Rebecca Rivas/Missouri Independent)Plans to move forward with consolidating some local boards of Early Childhood Iowa were discussed at the ECI State Board Meeting Friday, though some members of the public brought up concerns about the loss of local control.
Consolidating the Early Childhood Iowa system came up earlier this year, when Gov. Kim Reynolds proposed legislation that would have shifted existing ECI funding, and federal Child Care and Development Fund Wrap Around Child Care funds, to create a new $16 million “continuum of care” competitive grant program for preschool and child care centers that offer full-day care for children.
The legislation ultimately did not pass in the 2025 legislative session, as multiple care providers and child care advocates brought up concerns that the measure would take 42% of current ECI funds, and serve a more limited group of child care providers. They also spoke in opposition to the potential regionalization of the ECI system, as Reynolds proposed aligning the boards that govern the program with the state’s Behavioral Health Services System regions.

This change would have consolidated the current 34 ECI area boards, which oversee funding for local initiatives and services for pre-kindergarten children, into seven boards.
Though this restructuring was not approved by the legislature, ECI state board members brought up the subject again at their Friday meeting. Some members of the board said having 34 local boards has made it difficult to gather data, manage contracts and perform oversight functions.
Emily Westergaard, the ECI state board chair, said that the discussion on restructuring was part of a larger conversation as the board weighs competing priorities while “recognizing that resources are finite and the needs are complex and interconnected.”
“This process calls for us to carefully consider data, diverse perspectives and potential trade offs, as well as have an understanding of how choices in one area may affect outcomes in another,” Westergaard said. “By approaching these decisions with transparency, fairness and a commitment to the greater good, I hope we can strengthen the Early Childhood Iowa network and make a lasting impact for our kids.”
But several advocates for local ECI boards, as well as other parties, asked for more time and deliberation on restructuring, and said the current structure does not have enough problems to justify the substantial changes.
Iowa Sens. Cindy Winckler, D-Davenport, and Mike Zimmer, D-Clinton, sent a letter to the state board Thursday asking the members to “exercise their autonomous oversight authority to cautiously consider any attempt to radically restructure ECI service areas.”
“We have seen no evidence that the current Early Childhood Iowa system is failing Iowans,” Winckler said in a statement. “Any attempt to massively overhaul the existing system without thoughtful, internal analysis could threaten the consistent local service on which our communities have come to rely.”
Kevin Grieme, the Health Director of the Siouxland District Health Department, cautioned ECI leaders to make sure the redistricting changes would be beneficial when considering the needs of different communities being served. He said the restructuring of public health boards brought up new concerns in terms of distributing funding or reaching agreements.
“When funding is given to us, we rightfully take a look at it and say, ‘what are our needs, (how do) we prioritize those?’ And I’m not sure you can reach that same sort of consensus and agreement and efficiencies related to that if your territory is too large,” Grieme said.
Grieme said “it’s going to be difficult to keep that local connection” if realignment means the districts move to mirror behavioral health districts.
“One of the things I strongly encourage you is to take the time and consideration and receive (feedback) from the local level to be able to basically justify whatever realignment configuration you develop,” Grieme said.
Unity Stevens, who led one of the work groups looking at restructuring, said it is important to note the new proposed ECI local boards structure “is not a mirror image of the behavioral health districts.”
“Those (behavioral health) districts were organized under a central provider of oversight with district advisory councils — ECI has historically been defined by a citizen-led forward structure, and that remains the intent going forward,” Stevens said.
She added that the new system, if changes are approved, would be “similar to our current setup, but it’s being shaped into a more streamlined structure.”
The next state board meeting is scheduled for Nov. 7, but members discussed the possibility of an earlier special meeting to discuss the restructuring.

“We had a car, table saw, boats, boat lifts, a lot of furniture,” said Lohry, the president of the McCook Lake Association. 
All of that junk and most of the sediment that washed into the lake have been removed, he said, now that the state’s $1 million cleanup is complete.

Following the June 2024 flood, surveys by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and state officials estimated there was more than 20,000 cubic yards of sediment and debris in the lake.
The state awarded a contract to Three Oaks Construction of North Sioux City after a competitive bidding process. Work began on May 15 and concluded on the Aug. 1 deadline. That’s according to Game, Fish and Parks fisheries staffer Kip Rounds, who gave the department’s oversight commission a status update during a meeting Thursday in Rapid City. 
Crews used both land-based and barge-mounted excavators. The project was funded by the South Dakota Department of Public Safety’s emergency and disaster budget. 
The McCook Lake Association plans to pump water from the Missouri River next spring to return the lake to recreational levels. At that time, North Sioux City will reopen its public boat ramp at the lake, and the Department of Game, Fish and Parks will lift the no-wake restriction that has been in place since the flood.
What happened?
Three days of rain June 20-22, 2024, in southeast South Dakota surpassed 17 inches in some locations. Local and state authorities implemented a half-century-old diversion plan to handle record-high water that was flowing down the Big Sioux River toward Sioux City. They built a temporary levee across Interstate 29 that tied in with permanent levees to divert water into McCook Lake.
The water was supposed to flow through the 270-acre oxbow lake and drain toward the nearby Missouri River. Instead, it overwhelmed the lake and inundated many of the homes around it.
More than 100 homes near the lake were damaged, and 20 were destroyed. Many residents said the flood surge came suddenly, after they’d received little to no warning.
McCook Lake’s north shore neighborhood is still working to return the area to its pre-flood look, with some damaged homes, property and infrastructure remaining unrepaired.

(Photo by S. Shepard/Getty Images)North Carolina will receive more than $1 million from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to improve forestland, the agency announced this week.
The money is just a portion of the $8 million the USDA is spending on five projects across the country aimed at decreasing wildfire risk, protecting water quality and strengthening forest health, according to the federal agency.
In North Carolina, $1,022,106 will go toward the Uwharries to Sandhills, Phase 2 project, covering Montgomery, Moore, Randolph, Richmond and Stanly counties. It will be used to restore and improve about 18,000 acres in the Uwharrie National Forest through prescribed fire and silvicultural treatments, according to USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS).
Wildfires are a growing concern in North Carolina, agriculture commissioner Steve Troxler said earlier this year while asking lawmakers for more funding to tackle the issue.
The risks from wildfires are “expected to get worse, not better” throughout the year, Troxler said in April, according to WRAL.
The $8 million investment across the U.S. is the latest portion of the Joint Chiefs’ Landscape Restoration Partnership Program, which is a collaboration between NRCS and Forest Service, to build public-private boundaries, according to the agency. The funding for new projects follows $32 million given to 24 existing 3-year-old Joint Chiefs’ projects.
“Wildfires have no boundaries, and neither should our prevention work,” USDA Forest Service Chief Tom Schultz said in a press release, announcing the funding. “We need everyone at the table to deliver the kind of active management that will return our forests to health and productivity.”
Other projects receiving funding are in Alabama, Montana and Oregon, and a joint project in Colorado and Wyoming.
“Providing technical and financial assistance to private forest landowners is key to supporting locally led conservation, especially in the wildland-urban interface,” NRCS Chief Aubrey Bettencourt said in the release. This allows us to address multiple challenges in one project, such as reducing the risk of catastrophic wildfire, protecting clean water, and improving wildlife habitat.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Uwharrie-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-09-05 16:57:26.565921

(Photo by Jay Biggerstaff/Getty Images)The LSU Board of Supervisors voted Friday to dramatically increase the salaries of two top members of its athletics department while the rest of campus faces new austerity measures. 
The board unanimously voted to increase LSU baseball coach Jay Johnson’s salary from $1.67 million to $3.05 million, following his program’s second national championship in the three years he’s been in charge. His pay will increase by $100,000 annually through the end of his contract in 2032. 
Board members also unanimously approved the contract of Julie Cromer, LSU’s new executive deputy athletics director and chief operating officer. Her annual compensation package increases the university’s spending for the position more than $150,000 a year. 
The pay increases were awarded as every other department on campus began returning 2% of the budgets they were allocated July 1 back to the university. The recoupment is in response to President Donald Trump’s slashing of federal research funding, which has dramatically impacted higher education finances nationwide. 
LSU had previously announced its athletics department would not be subject to the new money-saving measures. 
During difficult budget times in the recent past, LSU’s athletics department has provided money to the university. 
After Gov. Bobby Jindal made drastic cuts in the state budget, LSU athletics began making annual transfers to the school. It received tens of millions of dollars from its sports programs from 2012-19, spanning Gov. John Bel Edwards’ first term, until athletics director Scott Woodward ended the practice shortly after he took the job. 
Woodward declined to take questions Friday from reporters after the board meeting. 
Increasing athletics spending while academic departments tighten their belts has the potential to increase friction between the two. In a new survey, professors in Louisiana and across the South lamented the outsized focus on collegiate sports as higher education institutions struggle with shrinking budgets, loss of research funding and political attacks. 
LSU Board chairman Scott Ballard said tension between athletics and academics has always been there and always will. College sports bring value to the university from a marketing perspective, he said. 
“God knows I don’t create the market in athletics,” Ballard said. “If I did, these salaries would be far lower, but I can’t do anything about it.”
LSU Board vice chairman Lee Mallett pushed back on Deputy Athletics Director Lori Williams as she presented Johnson’s new contract, raising concerns about the financial impact of buying out poor-performing coaches. 
It is now industry standard that coaching contracts include a buyout clause, which require universities to pay out some or all of a coach’s promised compensation if they are fired without cause. Poor performance on the field is typically not considered a valid reason for a school to waive the buyout clause of a coach’s contract. 
LSU agreed to pay former head football coach Ed Orgeron $17 million when he was fired in 2021, though major donors are believed to have helped the athletics department cover the buyout. However, the university is legally on the hook for tens of millions of dollars in buyouts across all of its coaching contracts. 
Johnson’s buyout is 90% of his base and supplemental salary. 
Mallett said he doesn’t agree with the practice and LSU should be first to “break the mold.” 
Williams said without buyout clauses, LSU would not be able to attract top coaching talent. 
“We have to play the game with the rules that we’re given,” board members James Williams said.
Johnson is now the highest-paid college baseball coach in the country, surpassing Tony Vitello at the University of Tennessee at $3 million, according to The Advocate. 
The increase also edges Johnson closer to LSU women’s basketball coach Kim Mulkey, who will make $3.35 million this upcoming season as part of her record-setting contract. 
LSU football coach Brian Kelly is the program’s highest-paid employee at approximately $9.9 million a year in total compensation. His current buyout figure exceeds $60 million.  
Cromer will receive a base salary of $400,000 with additional funding from the Tiger Athletic Foundation. For the first two years of her contract, her supplemental pay will be $110,000. For the second two years, the supplement increases to $130,000, and she can also earn incentives of up to $166,200 for the first two years and up to $168,600 for the second two years. 
LSU’s pay package for Cromer is substantially higher than what it paid former deputy executive AD Keli Zinn, who left LSU to become athletics director at Rutgers University in New Jersey. Zinn’s contract at LSU provided her with a $425,000 salary and up to $90,000 in incentives.
Paying Cromer, formerly Ohio University’s athletics director, above market rate for the position might have been necessary to lure her to a position with a lower title, industry observers have speculated.

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)Is a party switch by a Bergen County Democrat a sign of doom for Dems in this year’s race for governor, or a desperate push by the Republican candidate to project bipartisan bona fides?
That’s the question from Thursday night, when Jack Ciattarelli, the GOP former assemblyman hoping to seize the governor’s mansion back from Democrats, touted an endorsement from Garfield Mayor Everett E. Garnto Jr., a Democrat who said he is changing his party registration to Republican and backing Ciattarelli over Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill.

New Jersey under Democrat Gov. Phil Murphy is broken, Garnto told reporters Thursday.
“Over the last seven and a half years, the policies that Murphy has put out, it’s ruining the state,” he said. “Mr. Ciattarelli is the guy to turn it around.”
Garfield, sandwiched between Routes 21 and 46 in southern Bergen County and home to about 6,300 registered voters, is not a purple city. After going for Republican George H.W. Bush over Democrat Michael Dukakis in the 1988 campaign for the White House, it voted for the Democrat in every subsequent presidential race — until 2024, when it voted for Donald Trump over Kamala Harris by about 1,000 votes. In governor’s races, Garfield voters also tend to stick with Democrats. In 2013, when Republican Gov. Chris Christie won statewide in a landslide over Democrat Barbara Buono, Christie’s margin of victory in Garfield was only about 100 votes. This is a Dem stronghold, one where Sherrill shouldn’t have to worry about a local Democrat campaigning against her.
Still, Garnto is no typical Democrat. Voter registration records indicate he was a Republican as recently as 2016, when he cast a ballot in that year’s GOP primary (when, of course, Trump ran his first campaign for the White House). He was a Democrat by 2020, though he does not appear to have participated in the June 2020 presidential primary.
A social media post from Garfield Mayor Everett Garnto showing off Trump-branded socks.
And he’s made no secret of his love for Trump. He posted on social media about going to Trump’s inauguration earlier this year, and in August 2023 he shared a close-up of Trump 2020 socks with the caption, “2024” followed by nine exclamation points. He told reporters on Thursday that he voted for Trump in November.
I asked Garnto about his back-and-forth party switches and he said local politics is what made him flip from Republican to Democrat years ago. Democrats dominate in Bergen County, and that’s the party with the money and the machine muscle.
“In 2016 is when I first ran for the board of education and people in Garfield basically said, ‘Hey, listen, you should join the Democratic Party.’ I was unaffiliated at that time, and I just did, and since then, I’ve voted for Democrats, Republicans,” he said.
Garfield’s local elections are nonpartisan, so Garnto’s political affiliation is largely irrelevant for his own campaigns. But merely the news that Ciattarelli has picked up an endorsement from a Democratic elected official in prized territory like Bergen County is good for Republicans, according to Dan Cassino, a pollster and government and politics professor at Fairleigh Dickinson University.
“Any Republican running statewide in New Jersey has to make themselves acceptable to moderate Democrats and independents, and pointing out support from Democrats is an easy way to do that. Chris Christie was very interested in getting Democratic endorsements for much the same reason. Saying that the Mayor of Garfield is on your side doesn’t help much, but saying that even Democrats in the state are backing the Republican does help,” Cassino told me.
Some Democrats may laugh at this idea, and cite public polling not just of the governor’s race but also of Trump’s job approval here in New Jersey. But my guess is they also would have laughed last October if someone told them Trump was going to win Passaic County.
To find out more about Garnto, I talked to someone who works with him and was once mayor of Garfield himself: Garfield Councilman Richard Rigoglioso, who goes by Richie Riggs. Rigoglioso, a Democrat, told me he respects Garnto’s decision to switch parties, but he hadn’t thought of the mayor as a Democrat.
“He’s more independent than Democrat,” Rigoglioso said.
Rigoglioso said he thinks Garfield swinging to Trump in 2024 was an aberration, the result of the last-minute switch at the top of the Dem ticket and not an indication that the town is lurching rightward.
“Is Ciattarelli going to win Garfield? Garfield’s still a blue city. It just happened to be that Trump was the better candidate that day. I don’t think our mayor is going to sway that pendulum one way or the other,” he said.

The state’s college governing board which oversees and selects the historically Black university’s leaders said Wednesday that the firm will help identify and recruit candidates for the search process. The news comes three weeks after officials made public plans to launch a search committee, where all 12 trustee members will serve. 
Marcus Thompson resigned as university president in May, the third person to depart from that post in seven years. The state’s college governing board did not explain why he or his two predecessors left the post nor has it shared with the public details about its next steps for picking a permanent leader for the school. 
Alumni and supporters of the historically Black university have raised questions to the board about its opaque process, calling for a fair, transparent national leadership search for the university.  
The IHL board’s formal request for proposals can be viewed on its website. The deadline for submission is Sept. 12. 
In 2023, IHL hired Academic Search, an executive headhunting firm, for $115,000 after Thomas Hudson, Thompson’s predecessor, resigned. The board also paid the firm $85,000 for the Delta State search. 
The initial contract with Academic Search for Delta State was $130,000, but it was amended after the board cut the search short and chose Daniel Ennis. The board also used the firm for University of Southern Mississippi search.

(Photo courtesy of Executive Office of the Maryland Governor)The Washington State Department of Health has issued a standing order for the COVID-19 vaccine, making it easier for Washington residents to get vaccinated.
The standing order, announced Friday, allows most Washington residents to go directly to a pharmacy or clinic and receive the COVID-19 vaccine without an individual prescription. 
“The barriers to COVID-19 vaccination are complex, and the standing order is just one part of the solution,” State Health Officer Dr. Tao Sheng Kwan-Gett said in a written statement. “We want to ensure all Washington residents have access to the protection these vaccines provide based on the best available science.”
His action comes after the state along with Oregon and California formed the West Coast Health Alliance earlier this week. Hawaii joined Thursday.
The alliance is a direct response to concerns that recent federal actions have undermined the independence of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and politicized the use of science in ways that will harm public health.
Alliance members will establish a process to provide evidence-based unified recommendations to their residents regarding who should receive immunizations and help ensure the public has access to credible information for confidence in vaccine safety and efficacy. 
“Washington State will not compromise when it comes to our values: science drives our public health policy,” said Secretary of Health Dennis Worsham. “Our commitment is to the health and safety of our communities, protecting lives through prevention, and not yielding to unsubstantiated theories that dismiss decades of proven public health practice.”
After Washington joined the alliance, the Department of Health reaffirmed its guidance that everyone 6 months and older, including pregnant people, should stay up to date on COVID-19 vaccinations to protect against severe illness, hospitalization, and death. 
This recommendation aligns with guidance from the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the American Academy of Family Physicians.
“COVID-19 vaccines are well-researched, well-tested, and have saved millions of lives around the world,” Kwan-Gett said. 
Washington’s standing order comes after the Food and Drug Administration last month approved updated COVID-19 vaccines for the fall and, under the recommendation of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., only recommended the vaccine to those over 65 and people with existing health problems. 
That approach severely limits access to COVID shots across the country. 
In Washington, the vaccine remains covered by most private insurers, Apple Health, and Washington’s Adult Vaccine and Childhood Vaccine programs. 
While some health care providers have already received this season’s COVID-19 vaccine, other providers are still waiting to receive supplies of the updated vaccine, which may limit appointments.
Supply through the Childhood and Adult Vaccine programs are not available yet, and may not be available until late September or October, according to the Department of Health. 
In its announcement Friday, the department urged residents to remain “patient but vigilant” in staying up to date on vaccinations.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/covid-vaccine-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-05 16:57:26.565921

This story was originally published in the Current. 
The raid on the Hyundai electric vehicle plant was part of a lengthy investigation into the unlawful hiring of illegal aliens at the site that Gov. Brian Kemp and local officials had promised would create thousands of jobs for Georgians, federal officials said Friday.
Operation Low Voltage resulted in more than 475 people detained — more than 300 of whom were Koreans — while federal agents used a criminal search warrant to gather evidence at the battery plant that is a joint venture of Hyundai and LG, two of South Korea’s largest companies.
Steven Schrank, the special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations for Georgia and Alabama, said the raid was the largest single site enforcement operation ever carried out by the Department of Homeland Security’s enforcement division.
Schrank told reporters that while some of the detained workers illegally crossed the U.S. border, others had entered the country legally but had expired visas or had entered on a visa waiver that prohibited them from working at the $7.6 billion site where Hyundai Motor Group and an interconnected group of suppliers are building vehicles.
Hyundai broke ground at the site two years ago after Georgia promised billions of dollars in tax credits and tax abatements if the world’s largest carmaker met its goals of creating more than 8,000 jobs at an average salary of approximately $58,000.
As of March, Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America, the legal entity that operates the site, reported that it had 1,200 people currently employed, not counting Koreans, and was operating one shift at the plant. At that time, the battery facility was not operational and remains under construction.
Federal officials said the majority of workers detained this week have been sent to Folkston, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency’s detention center in Charlton County.

The governor’s office responded to the raid by saying that state agencies remain committed to the rule of law. “All companies operating within the state must follow the laws of Georgia and our nation,” said spokesman Carter Chapman.
There was no immediate comment from Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr.
In addition to the large number of Korean nationals, those detained included people from Guatemala, Colombia, Chile, Mexico, Ecuador and Venezuela, according to Migrant Equity Southeast, a migrant worker advocacy group in Coastal Georgia.
The South Korean government expressed “concern and regret” over the operation.
“The business activities of our investors and the rights of our nationals must not be unjustly infringed in the process of U.S. law enforcement,” South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lee Jaewoong said in a televised statement from Seoul.
Thursday’s operation was more complex than other ICE enforcement actions that have occurred since President Donald Trump took office earlier this year.
The raid involved 10 federal agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Internal Revenue Service’s criminal investigation unit, according to Margaret Heap, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Georgia.
“This was not a immigration operation where agents went into the premises, rounded up folks, and put them on buses,” Schrank said. “This has been a multi-month criminal investigation where we have developed evidence and conducted interviews, gathered documents and presented that evidence to the court in order to obtain a judicial search warrant.”
Neither Heap nor Shranck identified which court had issued the warrant. They also did not indicate if or when Bryan County authorities or those from neighboring counties, or company officials were notified about the operation.

(Courtesy of Children Youth and Families Department)In an abrupt announcement Friday, New Mexico governor’s office announced the same-day retirement of Teresa Casados, the latest secretary of the state’s beleaguered Children Youth and Families Department.
Casados is the fifth secretary in the last six years to oversee New Mexico’s child welfare department – the third to be confirmed, while two others have been interim.  CYFD has faced increased scrutiny from lawmakers and advocates, who say the department has failed to address housing of children in offices and issues of child maltreatment in custody which has lead to rising costs of settlements. New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez in April announced an investigation into a 16-year old foster child’s suicide.
New Mexico child welfare systems haven’t improved in last half year, arbiter finds

Casados was formally appointed to the position in January 2024, after serving as the interim secretary starting in May 2023, when retired state Supreme Court justice Barbara Vigil stepped down.
The governor’s announcement highlighted Casados’ “complete transformation of the agency,” noting she had launched a public transparency dashboard; conducted rapid hire events; and ended the practice of the agency using Social Security benefits belonging to children in care.
“I am deeply grateful for the opportunity I’ve had to work alongside families across New Mexico during my tenure at CYFD,” Casados said. “The dedicated employees at CYFD do their challenging and important work with compassion and heart, and I hope they are given every opportunity to show what they are capable of accomplishing in the months and years ahead. While there is always more work to do, I am confident that the foundation we have built will continue to serve New Mexico’s children and families well into the future.”
CYFD Deputy Director of Communications Jessica Preston declined Source NM’s request to speak with Casados. 
The latest change in leadership at the agency also comes amid the creation of a new oversight agency.
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham thanked Casados for her work as a secretary and chief operating officer in the governor’s office prior to that, calling her a “trusted partner and valued leader,” in a statement.
“She stepped up to help manage our pandemic response and helped create the Early Childhood Education and Care Department. It’s fitting that she took on one of the toughest jobs in state government at CYFD in the last phase of her career in public service,” Lujan Grisham said.  “I am forever grateful to Teresa for hard work and dedication to the people of New Mexico. I wish her all the best in her retirement.”
The governor has designated CYFD Deputy Secretary Valerie Sandoval to lead the department. The governor’s office did not immediately respond to a Source NM inquiry on when Casados gave notice of her retirement.
State Sen. Nicole Tobiassen (R-Albuquerque) told Source NM in a phone call Friday that Casados’ departure “was long overdue,” and called for Lujan Grisham to put finding a replacement secretary on the agenda for the Oct. 1 special session instead of appointing a successor. 
“This is an emergency situation,” Tobiassen said. “We’re asking her to do the right thing and allow us to put together an immediately qualified commission that goes out and finds the replacement.”
Tobiassen said she was working to put forward legislation to remove the secretary’s position from the governor’s office and establish an independent hiring commission with experts who can “hire the best person, not just for child welfare, but budget-wise,” as well. 
Several pieces of similar legislation introduced in the session earlier this year failed to make it to the governor’s desk. 
Casados previously served as deputy secretary of the Department of Workforce Solutions under former Governor Bill Richardson, and also worked in his office.

(Courtesy of Children Youth and Families Department)In an abrupt announcement Friday, New Mexico governor’s office announced the same-day retirement of Teresa Casados, the latest secretary of the state’s beleaguered Children Youth and Families Department.
Casados is the third secretary in the last six years to oversee New Mexico’s child welfare department, which has faced increased scrutiny from lawmakers and advocates, who say the department has failed to address housing of children in offices and issues of child maltreatment in custody which has lead to rising costs of settlements. New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez in April announced an investigation into a 16-year old foster child’s suicide.

Casados was formally appointed to the position in January 2024, after serving as the interim secretary starting in May 2023, when retired state Supreme Court justice Barbara Vigil stepped down.
The governor’s announcement highlighted Casados’ “complete transformation of the agency,” noting she had launched a public transparency dashboard; conducted rapid hire events; and ended the practice of the agency using Social Security benefits belonging to children in care.
“I am deeply grateful for the opportunity I’ve had to work alongside families across New Mexico during my tenure at CYFD,” Casados said. “The dedicated employees at CYFD do their challenging and important work with compassion and heart, and I hope they are given every opportunity to show what they are capable of accomplishing in the months and years ahead. While there is always more work to do, I am confident that the foundation we have built will continue to serve New Mexico’s children and families well into the future.”
A CYFD spokesperson did not immediately return Source NM request to speak with Casados.
The latest change in leadership at the agency also comes amid the creation of a new oversight agency.
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham thanked Casados for her work as a secretary and chief operating officer in the governor’s office prior to that, calling her a “trusted partner and valued leader,” in a statement.
“She stepped up to help manage our pandemic response and helped create the Early Childhood Education and Care Department. It’s fitting that she took on one of the toughest jobs in state government at CYFD in the last phase of her career in public service,” Lujan Grisham said.  “I am forever grateful to Teresa for hard work and dedication to the people of New Mexico. I wish her all the best in her retirement.”
The governor has designated CYFD Deputy Secretary Valerie Sandoval to lead the department.
The governors’ office did not immediately respond to a Source NM inquiry on when Casados gave notice of her retirement.
Casados previously served as deputy secretary of the Department of Workforce Solutions under former Governor Bill Richardson, and also worked in his office.

(Photo by Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)Collaboration was key to providing affordable housing to around 300 people in west Fayetteville, according to community leaders who attended a ribbon cutting ceremony Friday for a new 89-unit development. 
The Cobblestone Farm community, which rents single-family homes, duplexes and triplexes for $373 to $753 per month, is one of the latest projects aimed at addressing the affordable housing crisis in a region of Arkansas where the population has rapidly expanded, boosting housing costs. 
Addressing housing affordability is a key priority for the region because the median home price in Northwest Arkansas has grown 240% over the last six or seven years, said Brad Sikorski, president and CEO of the Excellerate Foundation, one of the partners in the Cobblestone Farm project.
“It’s a huge challenge that we face as a community, and we need more projects like this,” Sikorski said.
In addition to the Cobblestone Farm community, the Excellerate Foundation, is working on an affordable housing development for Bentonville School District employees and a new housing project in Rogers.

The Cobblestone Farm community, which opened to renters earlier this year and is already at capacity, is the result of partnerships between multiple organizations, including Strategic Realty, which is led by Van Buren Republican state Sen. Jim Petty, and New Heights Church, which owns the land and is renting it for $1 per year for 99 years. 
The Fayetteville City Council annexed and rezoned 30 acres for the project in 2020, and officials broke ground in 2022, according to the Fayetteville Flyer. 
“We hope [this] will be a long-term, life-changing investment in affordable housing here in Fayetteville,” Petty said. 
The Arkansas Development Finance Authority provided more than 90% of resources used to finance the nearly $21 million project by accessing the federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program and the National Housing Trust Fund, ADFA Director of Tax Credits John Blackwell said. 
The Fayetteville development was also supported by an $850,000 Affordable Housing Program grant awarded by the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas through Arvest Bank for construction costs, according to a press release. 
A 2019 report brought Northwest Arkansas’ affordable housing issue into focus. A new study released in May that builds on that report found that housing priority needs identified five years ago — a lack of regional housing policies, need for diverse housing options, limited choices for low-income households and weak links between housing and transportation — remain “even more acute.”
Groups throughout the community have started tackling the issue through various strategies, including the creation of a workforce housing center that announced the creation of a 77-unit mixed-income apartment project in downtown Springdale in 2023. More recently, the University of Arkansas celebrated the dedication of a new timber-focused facility last week where students can work on affordable housing solutions.
‘Water, sewer building a hot subject around here,’ Northwest Arkansas consultant says

Efforts to construct more housing to meet the demands of the region’s growing population have been stymied in some cities due to a lack of wastewater infrastructure. The state appears to be taking steps to address that issue with the governor’s announcement last week of a comprehensive water reclamation study to inform the state’s water plan and guide future wastewater infrastructure projects in Northwest Arkansas. 
Meanwhile, discussions around the housing issue are expected to continue between lawmakers and the public. On Thursday, state and Northwest Arkansas elected officials discussed ways to address housing costs during a housing conference in Cave Springs, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported. Petty attended the summit and told the Advocate Friday that all meetings like that are productive, but it’s just the beginning because “there’s a lot of work to be done.” 
During the 2025 legislative session, Petty introduced a bill focused on the housing crisis that has since been sent to interim study. Officials won’t be able to spend their way out of this problem and instead will have to consider a combination of tactics, such as reforming building and zoning policies and providing better education on the topic, Petty said.
“There’s just a lot of things that need to happen, and I think the more we talk about it and the more that we do it in a way that is collaborative and we put our own personal preferences and our own egos out of the way, the sooner that we can get to solving the real problems,” he said. 
In another effort to keep the conversation going, the Northwest Arkansas Council announced Thursday an eight-day series of community meetings and events seeking input on the region’s growth. The Growing Home NWA Roadshow kicks off Sept. 17 in Centerton. A full schedule is available here.

(Courtesy of the Nebraska Supreme Court)LINCOLN — The Nebraska Supreme Court on Friday said a lawsuit from a La Vista mother whose son went missing from his elementary school in 2021 can proceed, at least for now.
Writing for a unanimous court, Justice Stephanie Stacy said a Sarpy County District Court judge prematurely dismissed a 2021 case from Tammi Larsen. Larsen alleges Papillion-La Vista Community Schools and three school employees were negligent in caring for her then-11-year-old son Ryan, who went missing in May 2021 and has not been seen since.
Larsen alleges the district’s negligent supervision of Ryan led to his disappearance. Ryan had a history of leaving or attempting to leave school and had been diagnosed with autism, Tourette’s Disorder and absence seizures.
Ryan had left school three times in the months before his May 17, 2021, disappearance. He was on an individualized education plan that was regularly updated and modified.
Attorney Justin Pritchett for the Larsen family said in a statement: “The Nebraska Supreme Court made the right and just decision today. The Larsen family will continue to seek answers to hold the school district accountable to obtain justice for Ryan.”
Papillon-La Vista and its attorneys did not immediately respond to requests Friday for comment.
Court documents say school officials allegedly left Ryan unsupervised, and three unnamed school employees watched as Ryan walked out of school on May 17, 2021, never to return.
“School district staff did not attempt to prevent Ryan from leaving the school grounds and made no immediate attempts to retrieve him and return him to school,” the opinion states.
Larsen alleges that the inaction inflicted emotional distress on her. Given district knowledge of Ryan’s age, disability and history of elopement, court documents state, “it was reckless, outrageous and intolerable to leave him alone and to permit him to leave the school building unattended,” which likely resulted in Ryan’s death or serious physical harm.
Sarpy County District Judge George Thompson dismissed Larsen’s case in May 2024, stating the school district couldn’t be sued under “sovereign immunity” protections, the concept that a government can’t be sued unless its immunity is waived or unless the law expressly allows such a lawsuit.
Thompson said Larsen’s allegation of negligent supervision was not allowed due to exemptions for “due care” or the “discretionary function” of government. As a result, the emotional distress claim was barred, too. The district court also said Larsen couldn’t allege “sufficient facts” to show she was “a seriously injured victim.”
But Stacy said it was too soon to make those determinations without at least letting the case proceed a little longer and determining whether there was “any plausible path” to proceed.
The lower court determined that the complaint’s reference to Ryan’s IEP concerned “legislative and administrative decisions grounded in social, economic and political policy.” So, it was a “matter of circumstances and choice” for the district to leave Ryan alone. It said the district’s supervision decisions were a matter of implementing Ryan’s IEP.
The Nebraska Supreme Court said Larsen’s complaint alleged no facts about Ryan’s IEP, nor did it even include it in the court file, and officials knew Ryan “had a propensity to wander off the school grounds if left alone.”
Stacy wrote that determining the applicability of the exemptions “must await a more developed factual record.”
In 2023, Larsen also filed a case seeking to declare Ryan legally deceased. Under state law, a missing person can be presumed dead after five years, “unless there is sufficient evidence” otherwise. A judge said Larsen had not met that burden.
Stacy cautioned that Larsen’s case is not built around whether Ryan is deceased and wrote that it is plausible Ryan has suffered a serious injury. Stacy wrote that it is reasonable that Larsen “suffered emotional distress that was medically diagnosable and so severe no reasonable person should be expected to endure it.”
The case will return to Sarpy County District Court and continue.

The students walked out during their study period to bring attention to the prevalence of school shootings in America. A number of student speakers took time to share their message in the stadium, speaking against deadly gun violence and calling for policies to strengthen gun safety in schools. Students returned to class by the start of their third period.
“Although the school division does not assist with the organization of events such as this, our staff does take steps to monitor students to ensure they remain safe at all times. While we always want students to remain in class, we acknowledge their right to speak up for their beliefs and appreciate the peaceful and respectful manner in which they did so,”  Hermitage High School principal Michael Jackson said in a statement.
The event, created by the advocacy group Students Demand Action, spurred walkouts in schools across the country. A map on the group’s website showed students in 27 schools in the commonwealth registered to officially participate in the protest, spanning Northern Virginia, the Richmond region and Hampton Roads. One school in Blacksburg was slated to have students participate.
Current students have been called the “school shooting generation,” according to Students Demand Action. Many schools across the nation have only been back in session for a couple weeks but there’s already been a mass shooting at a catholic school in Minneapolis, which claimed the lives of two children and injured dozens more in late August.
 In 2023, Virginia was rocked by a deadly shooting at Huguenot High School’s graduation ceremony in downtown Richmond, where 18-year-old graduate Shawn Jackson and his father were killed and several were wounded. Lawmakers and civil rights groups have since called for more resources to prevent gun violence in Virginia schools.
Students Demand Action advocates against policies they feel would lead to dangerous access to guns. They also push for more gun safety laws and protocols passed in state legislatures.

Greg Stanton, one of the co-sponsors. “This bill gives FEMA independence and tools it needs to respond to disaster.”Republican Reps. Tim Burchett of Tennessee, Eric Burlison of Missouri and Scott Perry of Pennsylvania voted against reporting the bill to the House floor. Their offices didn’t respond to requests for comment asking why they opposed the legislation.

The 207-page measure, formally called the Fixing Emergency Management for Americans (FEMA) Act of 2025, would remove FEMA from the Department of Homeland Security and make it a Cabinet-level agency.The legislation would create one application for federal natural disaster assistance from FEMA, the Department of Agriculture, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Small Business Administration. It would also give local and state governments more flexibility in deciding which types of emergency housing best meet the needs of their residents following different natural disasters. Republicans and Democrats on the committee praised the various changes the measure would make during a two-hour markup that offered an increasingly rare example of bipartisanship on Capitol Hill. Donations from charities and FEMANorth Carolina Republican Rep. David Rouzer and California Democratic Rep. Laura Friedman both spoke in support of a provision reversing a policy that they said penalized people who received assistance from charities following a natural disaster. “Too many families who accept a donation from a charity or take an SBA loan to keep the lights on find out later that accepting those essential resources prevents them from receiving other assistance later for which they otherwise would be eligible,” Rouzer said. “This bill makes clear that SBA loans and private charitable donations are not considered duplicative for FEMA individual assistance.”Friedman said she was shocked to learn that FEMA counted charitable donations against disaster survivors following the Los Angeles wildfiresThat led her to introduce the Don't Penalize Victims Act with Mississippi Republican Rep. Mike Ezell, which was rolled into the FEMA overhaul bill. “I want to thank all the members of this committee, and particularly Chair (Sam) Graves and ranking member (Rick) Larsen, for their understanding of the importance of this measure to victims, who were seeing the charity that their churches, that their friends are raising for them be counted as income and deducted from the amount they were getting from FEMA,” Friedman said. Oregon Democratic Rep. Val Hoyle spoke in support of making FEMA a Cabinet-level department, saying that it’s been bogged down in the Department of Homeland Security since just after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. “After being folded into the Department of Homeland Security, it became buried in layers of bureaucracy,” Hoyle said. “DHS's sprawling mission — cybersecurity, counterterrorism, immigration enforcement, transportation security and more — has left FEMA less able to act with the speed and agility disaster-stricken communities need.”Hoyle said the legislation restoring FEMA’s “independence will help insulate disaster relief from” the types of “political pressures” that exist throughout the Homeland Security Department.Permitting reformDespite the broadly bipartisan support for the legislation within the committee, it will likely undergo some changes in the weeks and months ahead. House Natural Resources Chairman Bruce Westerman, R-Ark., and ranking member Jared Huffman, D-Calif., who both sit on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, raised concerns with elements in the FEMA overhaul bill during the markup. Westerman said he voted for the bill but expected the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee’s leadership to work with him to address concerns over ""permitting reform issues"" that fall under his panel’s jurisdiction. “There is one provision on the Endangered Species Act that we have concerns with actually being executable the way it's written,” Westerman said. “Again, that's something that's fixable, and we look forward to working with you as we move forward on the bill.”Huffman said he had concerns about how the FEMA overhaul bill addresses “environmental review statutes,” which fall under the Natural Resources Committee’s purview. “I, of course, share the goal of cutting red tape. We want disaster-stricken families to be able to rebuild faster. There are ways to do that that also ensure that recovery is durable, resilient and sustainable. That we rebuild once. These are things that (the National Environmental Policy Act) helps to ensure. So I look forward to continuing to work with the committee on this as the bill advances. This is a problem that can be fixed, and I hope it will,” Huffman said. Potomac River water Transportation and Infrastructure Committee members offered just two amendments to the bill — one adopted by voice vote and one withdrawn. Indiana Democratic Rep. André Carson received broad support for his amendment to require FEMA to inform members of Congress about grants within their districts, a practice he said has changed during the Trump administration. “We should not need to mandate transparency and accountability, but if FEMA fails to provide this information, my amendment codifies the traditional notifications to Congress,” Carson said. Democratic Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, who represents the District of Columbia, offered and then withdrew an amendment that would have required FEMA “to submit to Congress a plan to supply emergency drinking water to the nation’s capital region during any period the Potomac River becomes unusable.”Offering and then withdrawing an amendment is a common way for members to highlight issues without forcing a vote. Norton said the Army Corps of Engineers, which is responsible for the city’s water supply, only has sufficient reserves for one day should something happen. “If the Potomac River becomes unusable, which could happen at any moment whether through manmade or natural events, it would pose a significant risk to the residents of the nation’s capital, the operations of the federal government, national security and the region’s economy,” Norton said. Congress has partially funded a study to identify a backup drinking water supply and additional water storage facilities. But, Norton said, “any solution is years away.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-09-05 15:58:29.370020

In a letter sent Thursday, a West Virginia official informed Horne LLP that her department’s proposed ban on the company would be “permanently withdrawn.”
The proposed ban, sent on July 22 and previously reported by NC Newsline, had cited a settlement Horne made with the federal government months earlier. Prosecutors had alleged that the Mississippi-based company created fictitious applicant information and failed fraudulent invoices during a disaster recovery program; Horne denied any wrongdoing and settled for $1.2 million.
Samantha Willis, who leads the state’s contracting agency, wrote to Horne officials that “having reviewed your response” to the proposed ban and “giving consideration to the facts and circumstances” of the situation, she would withdraw it.
In her original letter, Willis wrote that Horne had demonstrated a “‘wanton indifference’ to the interests of the public.” Horne “strongly disagreed” with the letter, and later sent a formal response.
“Today, we received confirmation that the proposed debarment notice from West Virginia has been permanently withdrawn,” Horne CEO and managing partner Rusty Butcher said in a statement to NC Newsline on Thursday evening. “While the initial notice was unexpected, we’ve remained transparent throughout and consistently demonstrated that no wrongdoing occurred.
“We’re pleased with the resolution and value our collaboration with the State of West Virginia,” Butcher added. “Our focus remains on making a positive impact in communities recovering from disaster — and doing so as the premier firm in the field.”
A spokesperson for Horne, Meg Annison, said the company cited “procedural concerns and a lack of substantiated legal grounds” in its response. The company did not provide a copy of its full response to West Virginia upon request by NC Newsline.
West Virginia’s Department of Administration, which includes the contracting division, did not respond to a request for comment.
Horne won an $81 million contract from North Carolina earlier this year to manage its western homebuilding program after Hurricane Helene.

At a Sept. 4, 2025, hearing before the Senate Finance Committee, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. faced heated questions from numerous senators about his vaccine policies, including his stance on COVID-19 vaccines and mRNA vaccine technology generally.
Although Kennedy agreed that Operation Warp Speed, President Donald Trump’s signature initiative to produce COVID-19 vaccines in nine months, was a tremendous achievement, he also maintained that COVID-19 vaccines cause widespread and serious harm, including death, particularly in young people – a claim for which there is no evidence.
Some especially pointed questions came from Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a physician who provided the final vote needed for Kennedy’s confirmation in February 2025 after Kennedy promised him that he would not change the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s process for recommending vaccines. Cassidy pointed out that with the limitations and confusion caused by the CDC’s new rules around COVID-19 vaccines, “I would say effectively we are denying people vaccines.” To which Kennedy replied, “Well, you’re wrong.”
At the hearing, Kennedy stood by his decision to cut US$500 million in HHS funding for 22 research contracts on mRNA vaccine technology. HHS has said it will instead pour these funds into research on a traditional approach to designing vaccines that was first used more than 200 years ago. With such vaccines, called whole-virus vaccines, a person’s immune system is presented with the whole virus, often in weakened or inactivated form. This switcheroo has puzzled many scientists.
A few days before the hearing, on Sept. 1, Trump demanded that pharmaceutical companies prove that COVID-19 mRNA vaccines work, saying that the CDC was “being ripped apart over this question.” It was his first public acknowledgment of the chaos roiling the CDC amid the firing of its director, Susan Monarez, and subsequent resignations of four high-level agency officials.
Meanwhile, public health experts and HHS staffers are calling for Kennedy to be fired, and several senators at the hearing echoed that call.
As a vaccinologist who has studied and developed vaccines for over 35 years, I see that the science behind mRNA vaccine technology is being widely misstated. This incorrect information is shaping long-term health policy in the U.S. – which makes it urgent to correct the record.
Are mRNA vaccines less safe than whole-virus vaccines?
HHS defended its cancellation of mRNA vaccine research based, in part, on a nonpeer-reviewed compilation of selected publications called the COVID-19 mRNA “vaccine” harms research collection. This document lists about 750 articles claimed to describe harms caused by mRNA vaccines against COVID-19. However, the vast majority of these articles aren’t about vaccines but about the harms of getting infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. And notably absent from it is the huge body of data showing mRNA vaccines actually prevent these harms.
Spike proteins on SARS-COV-2 can cause tissue damage – and although mRNA vaccines produce them in small amounts, they prevent the virus from replicating to produce them in large amounts.(Source: https://www.scientificanimations.com/wiki-images/, CC BY-SA)
For example, the document being used to justify RFK Jr.’s claims about mRNA vaccines highlights 375 studies reporting that the virus’s spike protein alone, which is produced when the virus replicates, can cause excessive inflammation and tissue damage. This is true. But the document marshals this evidence to support the claim that mRNA vaccines, which are designed to produce spike proteins, cause the same harm – which is not accurate.
While viral replication results in uncontrolled production of a large amounts of the protein, the way it’s produced by the mRNA vaccine is very different. The vaccine produces a small, controlled amount of spike protein inside a few cells – just enough to induce an immune response without causing damage. And by blocking the virus’s replication, it reduces the amount of spike protein in circulation, actually having the opposite effect.
What about side effects like myocarditis?
Early reports flagged a type of heart swelling called myocarditis as a rare side effect of the mRNA vaccine, particularly for young men ages 18 to 25 after a booster dose. A 2024 review identified about 20 cases out of 1 million people who received the vaccine. However, that same study found that unvaccinated people had an elevenfold higher risk of getting myocarditis after a COVID-19 infection than vaccinated people.
What’s more, another 2024 study showed that people who developed myocarditis after vaccination had fewer complications than those who developed the condition after getting infected with COVID-19.
Do mRNA vaccines make the SARS-CoV-2 virus resistant?
Another claim from the compilation of supposed mRNA vaccine harms that was cited as a reason for cutting funding for mRNA technology is that mRNA vaccines cause mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 virus that make them resistant or less susceptible to the vaccine.
When a virus replicates in its host, it produces millions of copies of its genetic material. Mutations are copying errors that occur naturally during the replication process. These acquired mutations produce new variants, which is why both the COVID-19 mRNA and the whole-virus flu vaccine get updated annually – to keep up with natural changes in the virus.
Slowing down viral replication decreases the rate at which a virus can acquire new mutations. Since both mRNA and whole-virus vaccines stop or slow the virus from replicating, both types of vaccines help reduce the emergence of resistant viruses.
Viruses can mutate to escape from antibodies, but the mRNA vaccines are not causing the emergence of more virulent strains, likely for at least two reasons. First, mRNA vaccines induce immune responses that can attack the virus at multiple spots, so it would have to come up with many mutations at once to escape the vaccine’s defenses. Second, even if the virus could acquire all these mutations, they would likely weaken it, making it unable to cause or even transmit disease.
mRNA vaccines versus new SARS-CoV-2 variants
Kennedy, in announcing cuts to mRNA vaccine research on Aug. 5, 2025, claimed that mRNA vaccines don’t work against respiratory viruses and that HHS was moving toward “safer, broader vaccine platforms that remain effective even as viruses mutate.”
Both whole-virus vaccines and mRNA vaccines protected against COVID-19 and prevented hospitalization and death for millions of people worldwide between 2020 and 2024, but there’s clear evidence that the mRNA-based vaccines provided significantly better protection than whole-virus vaccines. And for COVID-19, mRNA vaccines are more effective against new variants, which emerge as viruses mutate, than whole-virus vaccines.


 mRNA vaccines’ superpower is that they can be updated and manufactured very quickly, unlike traditional whole-virus vaccines.

The COVID-19 mRNA vaccines started with exceptionally high efficacy, exceeding 94%. When the SARS-CoV-2 delta and omicron variants emerged in the spring and fall of 2021, mRNA vaccines became less effective in preventing infections. However, they remained highly effective in preventing severe illness, whereas in unvaccinated people the rates of severe illness and hospitalization remained high.
This is because mRNA vaccines induce the immune system to make both antibodies and specialized immune cells called T cells. These elements can recognize multiple parts of the virus, including ones that don’t change, enabling significant protection against new variants.
What’s more, the mRNA vaccines have a superpower that no other type of vaccine can currently match: They can be quickly updated and manufactured within two to three months. To develop a whole-virus vaccine, researchers must first spend months isolating and propagating the virus. Conversely, making an mRNA vaccine requires just sequencing the virus’s genetic code – a process that today takes just hours.
If a new pandemic began today, mRNA vaccines are currently the only type of vaccine that could be developed quickly enough to disrupt its spread.
The future of mRNA vaccine technologies
Thirty years ago, when scientists first started developing mRNA vaccine technology, they recognized its potential to overcome major limitations of whole-virus vaccines – namely, slow production time and more limited ability to protect from new viral variants. Today, mRNA vaccines are also being developed to prevent or treat diseases including HIV and cancer, as well as autoimmune and genetic diseases.
Of course, this technology can be further improved. New mRNA vaccine technologies are aimed, among other things, at making mRNA vaccines easier to store to allow for faster distribution and reduce their short-term side effects, eliminate the rare risk of myocarditis and more quickly block a respiratory infection.
The National Institutes of Health is funneling money away from new mRNA technologies toward a single project developing universal vaccines based on traditional whole-virus vaccine technology. Universal vaccines are urgently needed to provide broader protection against ever-changing respiratory viruses, such as influenza, that are major pandemic threats.
A 2022 study in mice and ferrets showed that a universal flu vaccine NIH plans to support has promise. However, multiple studies of potential universal flu vaccines based on mRNA technology show even more potential. Such vaccines could induce broader immunity than whole-virus vaccines by eliciting antibody and T-cell responses that target an even wider range of flu viruses.
It’s hard to square those benefits with the fact that HHS and NIH have named the planned new universal vaccine platform “Generation Gold Standard,” insisting that it represents a new standard in science and transparency. The effort seems more akin to eliminating all e-bike technology and telling everyone who seeks one to get by with a single brand of a 10-speed bike: Getting to the intended destination may still be possible, but it will be slower and harder.
And in the case of abandoning mRNA vaccine research, it may lead to lives needlessly lost, whether due to potential medicines untapped or to pandemic unpreparedness.

Jason Prokop of Lincoln testifies before the Business and Labor Committee about an interim study he introduced examining the internNE program. (Erin Bamer/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A state-funded internship program that was slashed this year to balance Nebraska’s budget still has  a push behind it as a means of keeping young talent in the state. 
Earlier this year, State Sen. Jason Prokop of Lincoln filed an interim study to consider the internNE program’s impact on brain drain in Nebraska. The study led to a public hearing Friday before the Nebraska Legislature’s Business and Labor Committee. 
Prokop, who sits on the Appropriations Committee, is keenly aware of Nebraska’s ongoing financial constraints but said maintaining internNE would come with returns on investment that would help the state in the long run.

He and five other invited testifiers largely argued that every student who chooses to stay in Nebraska through the program increases revenues that will eventually come back to the state. 
“Every dollar we spend helping a student launch their career here multiplies through workforce retention, stronger businesses and stronger communities,” said one testifier Levi Thiele, career services director for University of Nebraska at Omaha. 
InternNE originated under former Gov. Dave Heineman, but was boosted in 2022 through a $20 million investment approved by the Legislature. Since then, Prokop said the program has aided more than 1,500 internships and distributed more than $8 million in grants. 
The roughly $11 million left in the program was reappropriated this year to help fill a fluctuating budget deficit that at one point grew as high as $432 million. It was part of more than $218 million in various transfers into the state’s general fund during fiscal year 2025-26. 
These budget struggles are likely to continue, as the state is once again facing a projected deficit of around $95 million. That figure is likely to increase over the coming months, due to the impacts from the federal budget reconciliation bill and economic factors. 
Even Prokop said it was too early to say if refunding internNE would be possible when lawmakers return for their 60-day session in 2026. 
“I want to see it funded, but I’m also a realist,” Prokop said. 
Nebraska has long struggled with a labor shortage, exacerbated by a trend of young people leaving the state after finishing their education. Prokop said between 2010-2020, Nebraska on average lost about 6,000 residents per year, with a particularly high amount of them being college-educated young people. 
“Nebraska faces a looming demographic cliff,” said another testifier Tyler White, political science professor at University of Nebraska-Lincoln. “We see it already in declining school enrollments, and soon we will feel it more acutely in our workforce.” 
There is evidence that internNE helped slow Nebraska’s brain drain, Prokop said. Citing data from UNO’s School of Public Affairs, he said 2022 — the same year the state boosted funding for the program — saw fewer young people leave Nebraska compared to neighboring years. 
Prokop also cited data from the Nebraska Statewide Workforce & Educational Reporting System claiming that paid internships create at least a 50% probability of talent retention. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Sen. Kathleen Kauth of Omaha, who chairs the Business and Labor Committee, questioned how many students who have participated in internNE choose to remain in Nebraska because of the program. She argued that the program doesn’t have as much benefit for students already planning to stay. 
Prokop wasn’t able to provide hard data to prove internNE keeps students in the state. However, Thiele said, she witnessed firsthand multiple students making that choice because of their internships. 
Kauth also asked whether it should be the business’ responsibility to fund their own internship programs and not the state’s. 
“I’m just wondering at what point profitable companies are asking taxpayers … to pay for their staff and pay for their growth and development,” Kauth said. 
Prokop countered that participating businesses must match some of the reimbursements they receive through the program. He also noted that internNE doesn’t fund interns’ compensation, but instead helps interns overcome other barriers to work, including housing and travel. 
Dawson Brunswick, president of the Columbus Area Chamber of Commerce and another testifier, said short-term housing for interns is effectively nonexistent in his area. It reached a point where the chamber itself funded two short-term housing complexes for interns in response to the demand for labor. 
Kauth then wondered if this approach may give students a false sense of what housing and travel costs would be once their internship ended. But White argued that interns often are paid fairly low wages, and if they secure a full-time position afterwards that would help make up the shifting costs. 
“I really feel like students today are struggling more with money than they have before,” White said. “And so if we can do things to lower those costs for them, I think you’re going to find that it can be that little hand-up that puts them on the pathway to (success).”
Prokop said internNE isn’t a “cure all” for Nebraska’s workforce challenges. He said he favors an “all-of-the-above approach” that would incorporate the program with several other initiatives to retain talent, including dual enrollment and apprenticeships. 
He also noted that many other states offer similar programs to internNE and argued that Nebraska must remain competitive if officials don’t want the problem to worsen. 
“If we aren’t recruiting them, we’ll lose them,” said another testifier Dan Curran, executive director of UNO’s Nebraska Business Development Center.

Scientists say the rise is tied to greenhouse gas emissions.,"Yes.


According to the World Meteorological Organization and NOAA, every year from 2015 to 2024 ranked among the 10 warmest years on record, making the past decade the hottest in the last roughly 175 years. In fact, WMO confirmed in January that 2024 was the hottest year ever recorded, beating the record set just one year prior.
Global temperatures in 2024 were about 2.3 degrees Fahrenheit higher than the 20th-century average. For 14 straight months, through July 2024, the world set new monthly heat records. Both land and ocean temperatures hit all-time highs, and ocean waters stored more heat than ever before.
Scientists say this ongoing rise is tied to greenhouse gas emissions, which trap heat in Earth’s atmosphere. The world is now dangerously close to passing the 1.5 degree Celsius global average temperature limit set in the Paris Agreement, a key target for avoiding the worst climate impacts.
