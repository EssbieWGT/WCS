(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Hours after Gov. Tim Walz said President Donald Trump was open to an independent state investigation into the fatal shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti by federal agents this month, Minnesota state and local lawyers told a federal judge Monday that they had reason to believe federal agencies wouldn’t follow through.
The hearing revealed an extraordinary conflict between Minnesota and the federal government over whether local authorities should have access to key evidence, which would help them deliberate about potential charges against federal officers in the Good and Pretti cases. 
Citing “serious irregularities in procedure” by agents on the ground and senior government officials in Washington in the aftermath of Pretti’s killing on Saturday, Minnesota Deputy Solicitor General Peter Farrell asked Judge Eric Tostrud to extend an emergency order barring federal law enforcement agencies from destroying or altering evidence in the case.
Tostrud, who President Trump appointed to the federal bench during his first term, issued the order late Saturday night. 
On Monday, Tostrud said he was swayed by a sworn statement from BCA Superintendent Drew Evans that the BCA had reason to believe federal personnel had already mishandled critical evidence, including Pretti’s alleged handgun. Within hours of the incident, the Department of Homeland Security shared photos of the handgun and a loaded magazine that had apparently been removed from the scene of the shooting and placed on a car seat.
“(We have) very serious concerns that Pretti’s alleged firearm was not handled properly,” Farrell said.
Farrell and Clare Diegel, his counterpart at the Office of Hennepin County Attorney, also asked Tostrud in the lawsuit filed Saturday afternoon to declare the federal agencies’ stonewalling “unconstitutional and unlawful” and require them to share evidence with state and county investigators as needed. 
Tostrud did not issue a ruling from the bench Monday but indicated he would do so soon. State and county investigators are pursuing independent investigations of the Good and Pretti shootings, though legal experts say they face long odds due to limited access to evidence and prejudicial statements by top federal officials. 
Farrell, who represents the BCA in Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension et al v. Noem et al, said DHS’ decision to share photos of Pretti’s alleged handgun was one of several questionable choices DHS and other federal agencies made after the shooting. The state was also troubled, he said, that federal personnel twice blocked BCA investigators from the scene of the shooting — even after the investigators returned with a signed judicial warrant.
At Tostrud’s prompting, Farrell allowed that the federal government might — hypothetically — have reason to restrict state investigators’ access to evidence in cases with significant national security implications. 
But “we are miles away from that here,” he said.
Farrell later told Tostrud that Evans could not recall a situation “in his experience” where federal investigators restricted their state counterparts’ access to evidence. Evans joined the BCA in 2005, according to his LinkedIn profile.
Farrell said that sworn affidavits from employees of two federal agencies, the Border Patrol and Homeland Security Investigations, were of limited value because neither appeared to have been present at the scene of the incident. 
In another sworn declaration, an FBI agent present at the scene said — without providing specifics — that protest activity prevented federal investigators from following “normal procedure” after the shooting near the intersection of Nicollet Avenue and 26th Street in south Minneapolis. 
Farrell highlighted two other irregularities in the case that he said made the extension of Tostrud’s initial order “a no-brainer.”
First, that Homeland Security Investigations is the lead investigative agency in the case rather than the FBI is highly unusual and perhaps unprecedented, Farrell said. Second, senior government officials’ “rush to judgment” — with Border Patrol commander Greg Bovino and others proclaiming or amplifying others’ claims that Pretti was a “domestic terrorist” intent on killing federal officers — leaves BCA skeptical that an impartial investigation is forthcoming, he said.
“BCA would never put (such) statements out into the world like that,” Farrell said.
Appearing alone and caveating that he was “local counsel” for the federal government rather than its lead attorney, Assistant U.S. Attorney Friedrich Siekert said Homeland Security Investigations and other agencies were following applicable law and would preserve evidence as long as required to support a multifaceted investigation that he suggested would continue for some time. He asked Tostrud to allow Saturday’s order to expire while the judge weighs the plaintiffs’ evidence-sharing request.
“I have not been told that what they are doing will cease,” Siekert said, referring to his clients’ ongoing examination of the evidence. But because “this whole event arose out of a federal immigration matter,” the state presently has no investigative role to play, he added.
“We don’t want the court to micromanage an ongoing federal matter at this point,” Siekert said.
Diegel disagreed, saying the local authorities “do have a sovereign interest” in investigating the fatal shooting of a Minneapolis resident. She said the unprecedented nature of Operation Metro Surge and Twin Cities residents’ pushback in the streets — not to mention senior officials’ statements suggesting they’d already come to a conclusion about what occurred — raised the possibility that federal investigators could quickly wrap up the investigation without informing their state counterparts. At that point, they may conclude that the evidence no longer merits preservation.
“Nothing about what is going on here is normal,” Diegel said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NN260124_0553-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-27 00:57:07.539826

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd)Last week we witnessed the fast-tracking of House Bill 312 — to allow 18 to 20 year-olds to concealed-carry firearms — when it was first heard in the Judiciary Committee on Wednesday morning and breezed right through the full House 48 hours later with a vote of 73-17.
One lawmaker, Rep.  T.J. Roberts, a Republican from Boone County, argued in favor of the bill on the House floor, saying “Every 18 to 20 year old who wants to carry a concealed firearm probably already does in this commonwealth. I’ll take the Fifth on if I was ever one of those 18 to 20 year olds, but that’s a point that we have to consider.”
There is nothing quite like a lawmaker arguing that young people are already committing a crime, and that he might have committed such a crime himself, so now that he is in a position to make laws, let’s all vote to make it legal?
People are already committing other crimes. Should our legislators change the laws to give them a pass, too?
What a stunning, boneheaded argument. And there was no response from fellow lawmakers or the House speaker as they passed the bill and moved right along to the next item on the agenda.
Headspinning.
Last year a similar measure, Senate Bill 75, made it through the Senate but not the House. So let’s see this year if the Senate — the alleged grown-up side of the chamber — has the integrity and wherewithal ignore HB 312 outright.
And because we do not live in a bubble, I would be remiss to write about gun bills without acknowledging Second Amendment rights and the terror of what is happening on the ground in Minneapolis after yet another person was gunned down by federal agents, seemingly without any apparent justification.
Even Maria Bartiromo of Fox News seemed completely exasperated with the false narratives being propagated by the Trump administration with regard to this incident. On her Sunday show, she said to Kentucky Congressman James Comer, “Another individual is dead at the hands of Border Patrol. Let’s be clear, we do not know if there was any pushback from this individual who was armed. We do not have evidence that he was waving a gun [or] doing anything to threaten Border Patrol.”
Comer did not respond to Bartiromo’s statements, pivoting to how great it was when federal law enforcement came to Washington D.C. and blaming Minnesota officials for their language.
The victim, Alex Pretti, had a legal permit to carry, according to local law enforcement.  There is no current, public video evidence to show he even touched his firearm before Border Patrol removed it and then proceeded to shoot him to death.
“I’ve watched that video dozens of times in slow motion. I’ve tried to determine whether he actually pulled a gun out or not,” Comer said. “I don’t know. I just know that the situation’s bad there.”
Grotesque. Inhumane. UnAmerican.
As reported by fellow States Newsroom outlet, the Minnesota Reformer, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said there are now 3,000 federal officers to Minnesota, or nearly five times the number of sworn Minneapolis police officers. “How many times must local and national leaders plead with you, Donald Trump, to end this operation and recognize that this is not creating safety in our city?” Frey said.
Why is the Minneapolis story important to Kentucky?
Because House Bill 47 — note the shamelessly pandering nod to the 47th President Trump — already has 18 sponsors and was assigned last week to Judiciary, the same committee that started the fastball rolling for HB 312.
HB 47 reads as follows:
“Create a new section of KRS Chapter 16 to define “Task Force Model Program”; require Kentucky State Police posts to enter into agreements with the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement to participate in the Task Force Model Program; require Kentucky State Police officers who participate in the Task Force Model Program to complete Immigration and Customs Enforcement training; amend KRS 15.404 to provide that any peace officer who completes Immigration and Customs Enforcement training will be deemed to have completed annual in-service training; require the Kentucky Law Enforcement Council to certify the Immigration Authority Delegation Program as an approved in-service training program.”
How can so many of our lawmakers — the people we elected to represent us — watch the absolute horror continuously unfolding in Minneapolis and say yes, with HB 47 we ask those same federal agents and their constant chaos, brazen cruelty and masked men shooting protestors for practicing their First and Second Amendment rights to come here.
No thank you.
Kentucky law enforcement does not need this headache.
Kentucky families don’t need it, either, anymore than they need to worry about 18 year old kids showing up at parties and sports fields and parks and bus stops with concealed, loaded guns in their backpacks.
Kentucky families need affordable housing, good public education, better access to healthcare that doesn’t bankrupt them, reliable transportation, and good paying jobs.
How about our lawmakers concentrate on that.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_1140-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-27 00:57:07.539826

Across the country, people exercising their constitutional rights to speak, protest, and record public activity are increasingly met with confusion, intimidation, and force.
Observing what the government is up to and peacefully protesting are among the most fundamental rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution. It protects people across the political spectrum and has powered movements that expanded Americans’ rights for generations.
These protections require officials at every level of government to respect the constitutional limits on their power. When people’s most basic rights are ignored, our government erodes public trust and sacrifices the civil liberties that form the foundation of our democracy. Understanding our rights and the limits of government officials is essential to protecting public safety.
Here are key rights every Connecticut resident should know, whether they are a U.S. citizen or not.  Although these rights are the law, policing and the prosecutorial system are biased, and everyone has their own risk calculus to weigh when stepping out of the house.  What the law is on paper is no substitute for a person’s own sense of safety.
Attending a protest

Your rights are strongest in what are known as “traditional public forums,” such as streets, sidewalks, and parks. You also likely have the right to speak out on other public property, like plazas in front of government buildings, as long as you are not blocking access to the government building or interfering with other purposes the property was designed for.
Private property owners can set rules for speech on their property. The government may not restrict your speech if it is taking place on your own property or with the consent of the property owner.
You don’t need a permit to march in the streets or on sidewalks, as long as marchers don’t obstruct car or pedestrian traffic. If you don’t have a permit, police officers can ask you to move to the side of a street or sidewalk to let others pass or for safety reasons.
Shutting down a protest through a dispersal order must be law enforcement’s last resort. Police may not break up a gathering unless there is a clear and present danger of riot, disorder, interference with traffic, or other immediate threat to public safety.
If officers issue a dispersal order, they must provide a reasonable opportunity to comply, including sufficient time and a clear, unobstructed exit path.
Individuals must receive clear and detailed notice of a dispersal order, including how much time they have to disperse, the consequences of failing to disperse, and what clear exit route they can follow, before they may be arrested or charged with any crime.
The First Amendment does not protect “true threats” or incitement. Incitement requires intent, imminence, and likelihood: You must intend to provoke another person to break the law immediately, and your speech must be likely to do so.

Recording in public 

When you are lawfully present in any public space, you have the right to photograph anything in plain view, including federal buildings, the police, and federal officials.
On private property, the owner may set rules about photography or video.
Police officers may not confiscate or demand to view your photographs or video without a warrant, nor may they delete data under any circumstances. However, they may order people to cease activities that are truly interfering with legitimate law enforcement operations.
Police should not order you to stop taking pictures or videos, and they may not demand that you delete your photographs or video.

If you are stopped by police 

Stay calm. Make sure to keep your hands visible. Don’t argue, resist, or obstruct the police, even if you believe they are violating your rights. Point out that you are not disrupting anyone else’s activity and that the First Amendment protects your actions.
Ask if you are free to leave. If the officer says yes, calmly walk away.
If you are under arrest, you have a right to ask why. Otherwise, say you wish to remain silent and ask for a lawyer immediately.
Don’t say anything or sign anything without a lawyer.
You have the right to make a local phone call. If you are calling your lawyer, police are not allowed to listen.
You never have to consent to a search of yourself or your belongings. If you do explicitly consent, it can affect you later in court.
Police may “pat down” your clothing if they suspect you have a weapon and may search you after an arrest.

You can find a comprehensive guide to protesters’ rights on the National ACLU website.
Protests are meant to disrupt complacency. They are how people force urgent issues into public view, especially when every other avenue has failed. When protests are met with excessive force, mass surveillance, vague dispersal orders, and worse, deadly violence, it sends a clear message: stay home, stay quiet, or risk harm. That is not public safety. It is repression. And it corrodes the foundation of our democracy.
Our government has a responsibility to ensure that people can exercise their constitutional rights without fear of retaliation. Knowing your rights is the first step.

For college students in particular, developing an authentic identity in a politically polarized environment is like trying to stand on shaky ground. Focusing on spirituality instead of politics is an alternative way for young adults with various religious beliefs to form an identity amidst political anxieties. 
By definition, spirituality is “the quality of being concerned with the human spirit or soul as opposed to material or physical things.” However, in practice, spirituality means different things to different people. For example, I developed my spiritual understanding of what Judaism means to me through Hillel.



Hillel is a nationally recognized secular Jewish organization for college students that fosters a sense of belonging among Jews who are often a minority on campus. While living on a liberal arts campus that I and some of my peers describe as politically divisive, Hillel helps me feel safe, grounded, and most importantly, like I belong.
Spirituality is not just an outlet for Jewish students. Spiritual Muslim, Buddhist, Christian, and atheist students alike are finding belonging by focusing their attention internally, which is eternally rewarding. A multireligious spiritual study concludes: “…as a core construct of identity, spirituality was an essential part of personal growth and integration as well as a foundation for approaching life challenges…”
At Northeastern University, spiritual organizations reported an increase in involvement which often led students, such as Lutheran Episcopal Church attendee Munin Mundt, to a spiritual awakening. Mundt explains, “I felt very comforted and it felt very familiar while also being different in needed ways.”

Julia Shulman

It’s important to note the differences between spiritual and religious. Spiritual college students are not necessarily becoming more religious. Religion is defined as the belief in and worship of a superhuman power(s), especially a God(s). According to the Pew Research Center, in 2023 41% of Americans agreed that they became more spiritual, compared to only 24% of respondents who became more religious.
As religion is becoming increasingly politicized, such as Christianity being affiliated with the Republican Party, some formerly religious individuals are wary of being associated with a political party. In response, while some citizens entirely replace religion with spirituality, most avoid political affiliations by modifying their religious beliefs to become more spiritually oriented.
Spirituality is comforting because it is more individualized than religion, allowing the picking and choosing of beliefs, like a spiritual salad bar. Various religious beliefs can be added, dropped, or refined to better fit individual spiritual practices. This year, at an Office of Religious and Spiritual Life (ORSP) event, I learned how to meditate. Even though this is not a Jewish custom, I found value in meditation, and now incorporate it into my Jewish spiritual practice.
My experience is not isolated. In A National Study of College Students’ Search for Meaning and Purpose, four out of five college first-year students reported “having an interest in spirituality.” The study also revealed that 55% of spiritual individuals are frequently able to find meaning during difficult times and 58% feel at peace and centered, compared to only 11% and 18%, respectively, of lower scorers on spirituality. It is comforting to know that my experience is neither unique nor concerning.
Modern day politics are failing to provide the sense of stabilization and security that young adults need during their pivotal time frame for development and self discovery. Instead, I believe that spirituality can be a needed outlet.
My confidence in my personal identity continues to solidify as I weave spirituality into my religious Jewish practice. As political polarization continues to grow, it is easy, especially for young people, to feel small and powerless. By turning inward and focusing on what I can control, on spirituality, the world looks more manageable – even more welcoming.
I therefore reject feeling flustered by a daunting world that seems impossible to change. Instead, I am among the growing number of college students who find strength, comfort, and control by nurturing spirituality.

In closing arguments, attorneys from both the Missouri Attorney General’s Office and Planned Parenthood brought the focus back to the crux of the case: are Missouri’s abortion regulations necessary safeguards for women or discriminatory road blocks for patients?
In a final attempt to cast doubt on the validity of the case, Peter Donohue, deputy solicitor general for Missouri, argued that Planned Parenthood had not met Missouri’s high legal burden needed to nullify state laws in total. 
Jackson County Circuit Judge Jerri Zhang gave both parties until April 10 to file post-trial briefs. She urged them to opine on the burden-of-proof argument, which was recently addressed by the Missouri Supreme Court in a separate constitutional case on the state’s gender-affirming care ban for minors. 
The outcome of this month’s trial will determine the accessibility of abortion across the state before Missourians are asked to vote on whether they want to again ban the procedure in November.
Donohue defended the regulations as protecting women from unsafe abortion providers, which he accused of having a history “fraught with harms to women.” 
Even if current Planned Parenthood clinics provided safe care, as they testified, he said the state must think about any provider who might provide abortion care in the future. 
Abortion rights returned to Missouri one year ago. Access never did

“If they’re safe,” he argued, “these requirements don’t burden them.” 
But attorneys for Planned Parenthood spent days of testimony laying out how each regulation left clinics hamstrung to provide abortions. These regulations, introduced over the past few decades, increasingly drove Missourians out of state to get abortions. 
Planned Parenthood providers and staff recounted the toll the regulations took on patients left unable to access abortion quickly and close to home. 
These few dozen targeted regulation of abortion, or TRAP, laws are currently in state statute. Planned Parenthood and the ACLU of Missouri filed a lawsuit asking a judge to deem the laws unconstitutional after voters approved the abortion rights amendment in November 2024. Some were temporarily enjoined last year, allowing procedural abortions to resume. 
“All these laws target abortion in a unique way,” Vanessa Pai-Thompson, an attorney with Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said in her closing argument. “And a unique way that is now also an unconstitutional way.”
These regulations include required distribution of Missouri’s informed consent booklet prior to an abortion; a 72-hour waiting period between an initial appointment and an abortion; abortion facility licensing requirements; a ban on prescribing medication abortion via telehealth, and mandatory pelvic exams prior to a medication abortion.
Pai-Thompson said although abortion is essential health care, it remains regulated by state laws that are now discriminatory under the new amendment. Pai-Thompson then pointed back to a timeline showing decades of Missouri’s restrictions that have limited access.
Binders full of exhibits are wheeled into the hallway of the Jackson County courthouse on Monday, Jan. 26, 2026, at the conclusion of a 10-day-long trial over Missouri’s abortion rights amendment (Kevin Hardy/Stateline).
Two decades ago, several thousands abortions were performed in Missouri annually, according to state health department data. By 2021, the year before abortion was outlawed in Missouri, there were only 151, as a result of the TRAP laws. But many women still have abortions. In 2024, nearly 12,000 women went to Kansas and Illinois to end their pregnancies.
The state was the only side to call women to testify about their abortions, most of whom said they went on to regret them. This included a woman on Monday who said she obtained two medication abortions from the Planned Parenthood clinic in Columbia in 2012 and 2015, the second of which was followed by an emergency surgery to remove fetal tissue. The exact details of her medical issue were not detailed during her brief testimony. 
Pai-Thompson in closings characterized the state’s expert witnesses — which included a parade of doctors who oppose abortion — as unreliable advocates. She underscored the medical consensus among leading medical organizations that abortion is safe, telling the judge that abortions pose less risk than pregnancy or childbirth. 
Testimony from Planned Parenthood earlier in the trial detailed that roughly 1% of the more than 53,000 Missourians who received abortions over the last 10 years in Illinois and Kansas experienced complications, ranging from infection to incomplete abortions to hemorrhaging. 
Planned Parenthood began the trial with Dr. Margaret Baum, chief medical officer with Planned Parenthood Great Rivers. She returned to the stand Monday to dispute the state’s characterization of women seeking abortions as being uncertain about their decision and easily coerced into abortion. 
“I find that infantilizing of my patients and of women in general,” Baum said. “Most of my patients who present for abortions already have been pregnant or already have children. They know exactly what it means to be pregnant.”
Baum also disagreed with assertions from state witnesses that women often regret their abortions. She said her patients most frequently express relief. And when she tells people about her work in social settings, she hears abortion stories from other women, who express gratitude. 
“The most common thing people have said to me is ‘thank you,’” Baum said. “‘My abortion saved my life.’”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_0818-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-26 22:57:30.458215

This latest venture will be told through the eyes of children.

Called “Little Hearts — Big Roots,” the binational initiative centers on students at Pine Elementary in Omaha’s Little Italy neighborhood and partner schools in Carlentini, one of Omaha’s official sister cities.
The local students were invited to create artwork related to a “My World, Your World” theme that reflects their everyday Nebraska lives with family, food, traditions, neighborhoods and other cultural identity. 
Winning entries will be used as the foundation for mural workshops in Carlentini, where Sicilian children and artists will come up with their own creations. The results will be installed as murals stretching through the halls of Carlentini schools: Pirandello Elementary and Carlos V Elementary.
De la Guardia says the effort stands out for its kid-centric, ancestry-driven flair.
“It helps them connect with their roots,” she said. “They get to share a part of their world — which will be shown in another part of the world.”
 Mixture of cultures

Monday, about 25 students from Pine Elementary presented their art pieces to de la Guardia, who will leave later this week for Carlentini to work on the venture from that end. Monday’s batch joins another 20 or so already submitted. Entries will be accepted through Feb. 10.

Many of the youths share Italian roots, but have never visited the country of their ancestors. Others may be of another heritage, but are growing up with influences of the Little Italy area.
One third-grader painted a Dia de Los Muertos image, representing the Day of the Dead celebrated especially in Mexico, and said it reminded her of her grandma.
The student’s description brought de la Guardia to tears.
“That’s her culture. I wanted them to share their world,” de la Guardia said. “We come from many different cultures, and descend from immigrants all over the world,” she said, noting that Omaha’s Little Italy neighborhood has evolved into a mixture of cultures and backgrounds. 
The names of Omaha students will appear in the final murals alongside their art — adding another lasting memento of the sister city partnership that became official in 2024, following a “friendship” pact.
 Longtime bond 

A park named Omaha, on Italian island of Sicily, signals revived partnership

To be sure, the bond began more than a century ago, when an emigration wave sent nearly half the population of Carlentini — about 3,500 people — across the Atlantic Ocean to America to work, with the biggest share settling in Omaha.
Omaha’s Little Italy neighborhood has existed since those early days, but the sister city connection ramped up in recent years, fueled by younger generations’ thirst to better know their motherland. 
De la Guardia, whose Omaha mom was born in Carlentini and who retains close ties there, has encouraged ongoing ties, with projects including a podcast and the mural she helped paint and organize on a wall of Little Italy icon Orsi’s Bakery and Pizzeria.
She said the latest children-focused mural project is designed as the first phase of a multi-year effort called “United in Our Roots: A Tale of Two Cities.”
That larger venture aims for six install sites across Carlentini, featuring murals, mosaics and public art created via a cultural exchange to be led by de la Guardia and a team of about eight American and Sicilian professional artists.

Underlying the project is years of community-based work in Omaha’s Little Italy and a desire to preserve and activate cultural identity through art while creating tangible connections for local families, said de la Guardia.
 Another goal: ‘creative district’ 

She said the project also will help build the case for establishing a “creative district” in Little Italy, a designation by the Nebraska Arts Council.
Such districts have been named across the state and, for example, in Omaha’s Benson and historic Dundee neighborhoods. Key benefits include access to dedicated development grants, official state branding and could trigger increased economic activity through perhaps art galleries and events.
Once the youth art submissions are selected, workshops are to be held in Carlentini. De la Guardia also is seeking sponsorships to help with materials, workshops and costs of mural installation in Carlentini. She said the budget for that first-phase mural project is $15,000. 
Remaining phases call for another $400,000, for which de la Guardia said she is seeking grants and a grant administrator.
De la Guardia says she’s motivated by pride and love for her heritage  and wants others to enjoy connections to their ancestral roots as well.
“Everything I’m doing is from my soul,” she said. “And these kids put their hearts into their artwork. It really filled my heart.”

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)The South Dakota House of Representatives rejected bills Monday that were meant to extend credits toward graduation to high school students who participate in sports or substitute agriculture classes for science classes.
House Bill 1078 aimed to extend a concept already applied to approved computer science courses to agriculture programming. High school students can earn one of their required science credits with a yearlong computer course.
The bill came from Rep. Kaley Nolz, R-Mitchell. It cleared the House Education Committee 11-3 last week, but some of its committee supporters switched sides on the House floor when the bill first appeared there on Friday and failed, before Tuesday’s reconsideration attempt.
Bills that could change high school PE and science requirements advance in Legislature

Rep. Nicole Uhre-Balk, D-Rapid City, said she learned that it’s possible for agriculture teachers to get a waiver that would get their students science credit under current Department of Education rules.
“It’s not as onerous a process” as she was led to believe in the committee hearing, Uhre-Balk said.
Nolz argued that some teachers are too overburdened to deal with waiver requirements or may, in some counties, be intimidated by state bureaucracy.
“Why are they having to jump through hoops to prove it’s a science credit?” Nolz asked during debate on Friday. “Why not have it in books for clarity, certainty and, really, less administrative paperwork?”
The bill garnered a 33-31 vote on Friday, but needed a majority of the House’s 70 members to pass. Half a dozen lawmakers were missing that afternoon, and Aberdeen Republican Rep. Logan Manhart signaled an intent to reconsider the vote.
On Monday, the House said no to Manhart, voting 33-34 on a motion to reopen the debate.
Credit for sports falls
House Bill 1008 sought to extend physical education credits to high school athletes. 
Unlike with ag science courses, Rep. Kathy Rice said, South Dakota doesn’t have a way for coaches to translate their athletes’ work into high school credit. 
When students devote hundreds of hours to their athletics, the Blackhawk Republican said, their academics suffer. 
“That’s what it takes to do varsity sports,” she said.
Track coach and state Rep. John Shubeck, R-Beresford, said some of his athletes “work harder than their parents do” and don’t need a semester of physical education to learn how to stay fit and healthy into adulthood.
“When I see my athletes and the work they put in, they need a break,” Shubeck said.
Opponents, like Doland Republican Lana Greenfield, worried about unintended consequences of removing PE credits from classrooms.
“PE is a graded course. It is a part of your GPA. If you don’t have a certified coach,” Doland said, referencing the common rural phenomenon of non-teacher coaches across South Dakota, “who’s going to give the grade?”
Rep. Will Mortenson, R-Fort Pierre, mentioned that esports are now an officially sanctioned extracurricular sport in South Dakota.
“Are we going to give high school credit for playing video games?” Mortenson said.
The House vote on the measure was 31-36.

(Doyon Drilling photo/Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation)A winter oil-drilling campaign planned by ConocoPhillips will proceed without interruption despite the dramatic wreck of an oil rig over the weekend.
Doyon 26, claimed to be the largest mobile oil drilling rig in the United States, toppled over while being transported along a gravel road on the North Slope on Friday afternoon. A video of the crash shows a small fire erupting as the structure tumbles onto the nearby tundra.
Eight people were treated for minor injuries, according to a Sunday report from the Alaska Department of Natural Resources, and up to 4,000 gallons of diesel fuel may have spilled.
The environmental effects of that spill, if any, are still being determined by that agency.
The rig, nicknamed “the Beast,” is owned by Doyon Drilling Inc. and was one of two that ConocoPhillips intended to use in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, located west of Prudhoe Bay, this winter.
ConocoPhillips is developing the vast Willow project in the reserve and intended to use both Doyon 26 and another rig as part of its winter development work, said Brandi Sellepack, manager of the company’s exploration program, in a court affidavit published Monday morning. Most new construction on the North Slope occurs during winter, when the ground is frozen and can be traversed with less harm to the environment.
The oil company’s drilling program has been legally challenged in court by several environmental and local groups, and its attorneys included details of the incident in a notice to the judge hearing that challenge.
“After assessing the impact of the unfortunate loss of Doyon 26, ConocoPhillips’s current plan is to proceed with the full four-well exploration drilling program utilizing a substitute drilling rig, Doyon 142, which is capable of completing all of the planned drilling scope that Doyon 26 was scheduled to complete,” Sellepack said in the affidavit. “As the drilling program proceeds, ConocoPhillips will evaluate whether aspects of the program must be shortened based on this change of plans, such as, for example, the extent of datagathering from the wells and the length of any production testing. This change of plans will not increase the scope of any aspects of the drilling program.”
The company said an underground seismic surveying program — intended to reveal the scope of oil pockets in the area — was unaffected by the rig’s accident and will proceed on schedule.
Development of Willow is seen as critical for the state treasury, according to current forecasts. Oil produced from the project will result in billions of dollars in tax revenue for the state treasury, local governments, and the U.S. government. 
At the same time, the project will have some effect on the local and global environment, both through construction and emissions that contribute to climate change.
Those side effects have been the topic of extended lawsuits, including one currently active in the U.S. District Court for the District of Alaska.
In its notice to the court, ConocoPhillips said it believes Friday’s accident is unrelated to the arguments raised in that case.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)PIERRE — South Dakota voters should determine whether legislators need tighter term limits, the state Senate decided Monday at the Capitol.
If the House agrees, the measure will be on the November general election ballot.
The Senate voted 20-14 in favor of sending the proposed state constitutional amendment to voters. It would cap state lawmakers at 16 consecutive years of service, which equates to eight consecutive two-year terms. That would be added to the current term limits of eight consecutive years in either chamber. Currently, without an overall limit, legislators can bounce back and forth between the chambers repeatedly.
Sen. Michael Rohl, R-Aberdeen, sponsors the bill. He said 16 consecutive years is a reasonable maximum that still allows for the retention of experience while ensuring turnover and opportunities for “leaders of tomorrow.”
Opponents, including Sen. Carl Perry, R-Aberdeen, called it a “solution looking for a problem.” They argued the system already turns over frequently, and warned that forced turnover could weaken institutional knowledge and shift influence to bureaucrats and lobbyists. Perry said term limits reduce voter choice because elections already allow constituents to remove lawmakers every two years.

Larry Rhoden on Monday asked the South Dakota Supreme Court for an advisory opinion on whether the lieutenant governor, while presiding as president of the state Senate, may cast a tiebreaking vote.
“This is a matter of great public importance, and of significant impact on state government. Judicial interpretation would bring clarity and certainty to this matter going forward,” Rhoden wrote. 
Rhoden’s request follows a dispute last week after the Senate deadlocked 17-17 on passage of a bill updating permitting provisions for energy and transmission facilities. Lt. Gov. Tony Venhuizen, presiding as president of the Senate, broke the tie with a “yes” vote, but Senate President Pro Tempore Chris Karr, R-Sioux Falls, challenged the action. The Senate voted to uphold the challenge, voiding the tiebreaker. 
The potential for a tie exists because Sen. Arch Beal, R-Sioux Falls, is on an extended absence due to illness. The absence leaves an even number of senators, at 34, when the chamber typically has 35.
After the earlier tiebreaker was deemed invalid, the Senate reconsidered the affected bill on Monday, adopted an amendment, and passed the legislation. But while the bill’s fate was decided, uncertainty remains about future tie votes.
“If a tiebreaking vote cannot be cast for final passage, it will be impossible for any such piece of legislation to pass the Legislature and be presented to the governor for signature or veto,” Rhoden wrote. “An advisory opinion from the court is the only realistic way to resolve this question.”

(Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Opponents far outnumbered supporters Monday of two legislative proposals seeking to throw out parts of a 20-year-old Nebraska law allowing certain undocumented immigrants who grew up and graduated in the state to pay in-state tuition at public colleges and universities.
In all, 13 Nebraskans testified against Legislative Bills 1061 and 870, introduced by State Sens. Dave Murman of Glenvil and Bob Andersen of western Sarpy County, respectively. The bills were aired Monday during a two-hour public hearing before the Legislature’s Education Committee.

In contrast, one person showed up to speak in favor.
A combined 215 people wrote to the committee to object to the two bills, and 32 submitted written support.
The committee took no immediate action on whether to advance either measure to the full Legislature.
As state law currently stands, students who graduate from Nebraska high schools after living here three years and who meet certain other criteria — regardless of immigration status — can continue their education in the state by paying the same tuition rates as local counterparts who are U.S. citizens.
 ‘Attack’ on immigrants 

In response to questions from committee members, neither Andersen nor Murman could say how many students might be affected. They said their concern was fairness to taxpayers, though they identified no specific cost savings.
State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln, a member of the committee, said the bills appear to be a tactic that perpetuates fear among immigrants. The proposed changes come as national and local protests have swelled over the Trump administration’s efforts to rid the country of undocumented immigrants.
State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln. Jan. 8, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Saturday in Minneapolis, the second U.S. citizen in three weeks was shot to death by federal agents while rallying against immigration enforcement in that city, which has escalated under the second Trump administration.
“I think that we have to put a name on the fact that this is really just another attack, I think, on immigrant neighbors in Nebraska and has very little, if anything, to do with budgetary savings,” said Conrad.
Andersen described his effort as “a simple bill to reimplement common sense and fiscal responsibility.”
“It’s a cost-saving effort and making sure people entitled to get the entitlement actually get it,” he said. Murman told the committee that he plans to withdraw his bill and support Andersen’s LB 870. 
The University of Nebraska doesn’t ask for documentation of a student’s immigration status and uses high school transcripts to verify whether the applicant is a Nebraska resident for tuition purposes, according to a legislative fiscal analysis for the Andersen bill. If the proposed changes pass, the analysis says, new verification procedures would need to be implemented at an estimated cost next fiscal year of about $372,400, and $383,572 the following year.
 ‘Magnet’ for illegal immigration

Doug Kagan, who leads Nebraska Taxpayers for Freedom, was the lone testifier in support of the bills. He said current in-state tuition provisions are a “magnet for further illegal immigration into Nebraska” and are “unfair” to American citizens.
Those testifying in support of the current law included university professors, immigration lawyers, a Douglas County commissioner speaking on his own and a veteran who described LBs 1061 and 870 as contrary to state efforts to strengthen the talent and workforce pipeline.

Crystal Garcia, a professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, said she wanted to appeal to lawmakers’ humanity.
“The proposed bills do not in any way improve the lives of Nebraskans,” she said. “(They) will also hurt Nebraska colleges and universities, as they will certainly lose students who will pursue education outside of Nebraska and critical revenue along with those students.”
When questioned by committee members — some of whom challenged the loose use of immigration terminology by the two bill sponsors — Murman and Andersen clarified that their goal is to repeal in-state tuition for students who do not have a lawful status in the country.
Murman said he wanted to comply with federal law and save Nebraska the cost of defending a lawsuit. 
Both proposals follow a push by the Trump administration to eliminate similar in-state tuition laws in other states. Under his leadership, the feds launched legal challenges in at least seven states with similar laws, including Texas, California, Illinois and Minnesota.
State Sen. Dave Murman of Glenvil. Aug. 7, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
The U.S. Justice Department has argued that in-state tuition laws give an unfair benefit to foreign-born students unavailable to U.S. citizens and legal residents living in different states.
State Sen. Jana Hughes of Seward asked if Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers had weighed in on the legality of the proposals, to which Murman said no.
 ‘Brain drain’ pain

Among those opposing the bills was Lina Traslaviña Stover, a sociologist whose research has focused on access to higher education and who is executive director of a statewide immigrant advocacy organization called Heartland Workers Center.
She called the legislation “shortsighted” and opposite the goal of reversing Nebraska’s brain drain, the exodus of young talent from the state.
“These bills send a harmful message to middle school students from immigrant families that they are not welcomed or valued in our education system,” Stover said. “When students believe college is unattainable because of cost, they are more likely to disengage from school and leave the college-pre track. This limits their options for years to come.”

She estimated that a “small number” of Nebraska immigrants tap into the current in-state tuition provisions.
Douglas County commissioner Roger Garcia told the committee his wife, Yanira, was assisted by in-state tuition rates that have been in effect since the Legislature in 2006 overrode a veto by then-Gov. Dave Heineman. 
Yanira is now a U.S. citizen, a professional in the banking industry and an elected member of the Regional Metropolitan Transit Board. 
Undocumented students typically are not eligible for federal student aid. But in-state tuition can be the key pathway for higher education to some undocumented students already being educated in Nebraska’s public school system, Garcia said. 
“This is not a scholarship. This is not a financial grant. There is no money going into a student account. They are paying tuition,” he said. Garcia said he doubted the number of recipients in Nebraska is remarkable but said they likely work multiple jobs to pay for tuition. 
“So these are actually pretty outstanding students and young individuals in our state,” he said.

House Bill 1015 came to the House of Representatives at the request of Steven Jensen, chief justice of the South Dakota Supreme Court. It would authorize a pilot program in Pennington County in which court service officers would watch people released on bond as they await trial to make sure they adhere to their release conditions and don’t miss court dates.
The state Unified Judicial System secured a $385,000 grant to pay for the yearlong experiment from the MacArthur Foundation, a Chicago-based nonprofit that focuses on criminal justice reform.

The foundation has extended grant funding to both Pennington and Minnehaha Counties in the past for programs aimed at reducing their jail populations and addressing racial and ethnic disparities in the justice system.
The House Judiciary Committee voted 10-3 last week to back the pilot program, but the bill authorizing it was met with a buzzsaw of opposition on the House floor. 
Nine of the 15 lawmakers who rose to speak on the idea urged a no vote, and six of the nine opponents lobbed criticism at the MacArthur Foundation for promoting policies they said make communities less safe and cost taxpayers money when grant dollars run out.
The House vote on the bill was 33-34.
Opponent calls grant money ‘woke’
“House Bill 1015 hands over control of our state policies to an unelected, unaccountable national foundation,” said Republican Rep. Mary Fitzgerald of St. Onge. “This organization answers to no one here, yet they want us to follow their agenda.”
Fitzgerald said the pilot program would heap extra burdens upon overworked court service officers in Pennington County, as the grant dollars don’t pay for additional staff. She argued that the pilot would lead to a “catch and release” justice system and turn South Dakota into San Francisco. 
“This bill may not say cashless bail, but it moves us squarely in that direction” she said. “The pilot program is funded by a group trying to eliminate cash bail across the country.”
Pretrial monitoring could reduce missed court appearances and improve outcomes, court officials say

The words “diversity, equity and inclusion” on the MacArthur Foundation’s website — listed as a core value on its “about” page — caught the eye of Aberdeen Republican Brandei Schaefbauer. 
“What are the strings attached” to work with the foundation, she asked lawmakers? She suggested that the foundation would push South Dakota to adopt permanent, further-reaching reforms that would cost taxpayers to maintain long-term.
“I do not think we will actually achieve our goals in reducing the recidivism,” she said, referencing a term for repeat offenses. “What we will achieve is bringing Marxist-communist propaganda to our state.”
Rep. Trish Ladner, R-Hot Springs, said she can’t trust that the pilot program would improve outcomes. Ladner noted that Pennington County had to expand its jail, even after accepting MacArthur Foundation money to implement alternatives to incarceration.
“The burden of the cost of the county government will ultimately result in an increase in the county’s property tax burden to its citizens,” Ladner said.
Republican Rep. Julie Auch of Yankton called MacArthur money “woke,” citing what she described as MacArthur’s “obsessive” focus on racial and ethnic disparities. 
“It’s unfortunate that a foundation of their stature is clearly engaging in politics,” Auch said.
Backers ask for deference to chief justice
Auch said she has “great respect” for Chief Justice Jensen, but that she sees the pilot program as potentially deleterious to public safety.
Rep. John Hughes, R-Sioux Falls, also referenced Jensen in his remarks, but did so to encourage colleagues to extend the chief justice respect and give a chance for the program he’d endorsed in his State of the Judiciary speech to prove itself.
The pilot program is paid for, Hughes said, will end in 2027, and “will produce data and information” that lawmakers can use to decide to move forward.

Many of those released on bond today struggle with addiction, Hughes said, and could use help staying on the right track while they await trial.
“We have to do better than we’re doing,” said Hughes. “So the goal of all of this is to connect individuals with people who are concerned, and who have some sensitivity toward addiction issues.”
Rep. Kadyn Wittman, D-Sioux Falls, pushed back on the notion that South Dakota has no business focusing its attention on racial and ethnic disparities. Wittman said she wanted “to remind this body that we do have racial disparities in our justice system.”
“In South Dakota, more than 50% of our incarcerated women are Indigenous and more than 30% of our incarcerated men are Indigenous, while they only make up 8% of our state’s population,” Wittman said.
Rep. Mike Stevens, R-Yankton, the bill’s prime sponsor, said he trusts that no one in the Legislature would allow a nonprofit organization to turn South Dakota into San Francisco. 
“This really isn’t supposed to be a vote on whether you like MacArthur Foundation or not,” Stevens said. “It’s really about ‘what are we going to do to help our state, our South Dakota.’” 
Stevens also said people are released on bond every day in South Dakota, and that judges don’t lose any of that authority under the bill. Most people released on bond are not monitored now, he said. 
The only place where they are is Minnehaha County, which has opted to do things like remind defendants of court appearances since 2018. Missed court appearances there have fallen 40%, Stevens said. 
Wittman announced her intent to seek reconsideration of the bill. If a majority opts to reopen debate, the bill could have another chance.

Escalation in Nebraska divide over state Brand Committee,Juan Salinas II,,,,,https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2026/01/26/branding-problem-escalation-in-nebraska-divide-over-state-brand-committee/,A bill to eliminate self-funded state agency comes after it explained why it hasn’t followed part of a state law since 2021.,"A feedlot in Grand Island on Dec. 30, 2025. (Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The Nebraska Brand Committee could be gone. 
A bill from State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair would eliminate the governor-appointed state branding committee and transfer its responsibilities to the Nebraska Department of Agriculture, which is run by a gubernatorial appointee. The proposal, Legislative Bill 1258, would make brand inspection voluntary, instead of required. 
Nebraska has a quirky branding law that applies only to cattle owners in the western two-thirds of the state, where the Brand Committee is responsible for investigating cattle theft and verifying ownership through branding when cattle are bought, sold or moved within or beyond the branding zone set in state law. Its services are funded entirely through fees, not by taxpayers. 
The proposal is the latest escalation in a divide over the future of the committee among rural and agricultural constituencies that flared up last legislative session. A  north-central rural lawmaker said the bill is “trying to create a mockery” out of one of the state’s most valuable industries.
State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair. April 17, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
It comes after the Brand Committee explained in a Jan. 15 social media statement that it hadn’t been following part of a state law change from 2021, following a complaint filed with Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers’s office. 
The Attorney General’s Office declined to provide more information on the complaint. 
Don Arp, the committee’s executive director, posted that the group had chosen to continue charging $20 per head of cattle inspection surcharge instead of calculating the state-required fee for the actual miles traveled by the inspectors to reach each inspection. The group’s post said the committee planned to start using the state-required system after the complaint.

Said Hansen: “The way we address branding in the state of Nebraska doesn’t seem like an efficient use of taxpayer dollars … or an efficient use of the producers’ time and their money.” 
Nebraska does it differently
Other cattle-feeding states, including Texas and Oklahoma, deal with cattle branding differently. Branding isn’t mandatory in those states but is encouraged to deter theft, while brand inspections are mandatory in Wyoming and Colorado. 
Nebraska’s livestock branding law was tweaked in 2021 to reduce inspection fees, provide advance notice of a branding inspection and transition from a flat surcharge to a charge for the miles traveled for each inspection, according to the Midwest Messenger. 
State Sen. Teresa Ibach of Sumner, of west-central Nebraska, proposed a bill last session that would exempt feedlots from branding and inspection fees under the state’s livestock branding law. Livestock brings in over $12 billion into the state’s economy annually, according to the state Ag Department.
State Sen. Teresa Ibach of Sumner, center, talks with State Sen. Steve Erdman of Bayard. State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln watches to Ibach’s left. July 29, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
The bill advanced to final reading after Ibach amended it to add a one-time $1,000 payment to apply for feedlots to obtain brand-exempt status, and to exempt dairy cattle. State Sen. Tanya Storer of Whitman, a rural lawmaker from north-central, expressed concerns about lawmakers making an uninformed decision about the future of the committee. 
Ibach told the Examiner she supports Hansen’s proposal, calling it a solution that “best serves Nebraska’s cattle producers.” She was “disappointed” that her bill didn’t pass last year, and still wants it to pass, but said “action this year is imperative.” 
“To remain competitive and sustainable in the future, the time has come to act to protect Nebraska’s cattle industry,” Ibach said. She said Hansen’s proposal “provides additional oversight to ensure proper enforcement of the law.”
Questions about need for change
Storer told KNEB in Scottsbluff-Gering that the cattle industry has to remain open-minded about changes, “but anything that degrades or erodes that basic provision for proof of ownership is not acceptable.”

“They’re not in the cattle business,” Storer told the Rural Radio Network about her legislative colleagues “They don’t understand the cattle business, but they’re willing to take a sledgehammer and try to destroy a system of proof of inspection.”
She said the Branding Committee is about preserving the integrity of a very valuable asset in the state, referring to cattle. 
Storer told the Examiner Monday that lawmakers who sponsored the bill probably “listened to a handful of feedlot owners who have hired a lobbyist to represent them” to paint a picture of the system they say is “out of date or unfair.”
“When four or five businesses come in and ask to be deregulated, that does not warrant grounds for deregulation,” Storer said. “I don’t feel like all segments of the industry have been fairly represented in this discussion.”
The Nebraska Cattlemen said it would meet later this week to decide its stance on the proposal. The Nebraska Farm Bureau is also currently reviewing the legislation. Last session, many urban lawmakers chose not to weigh in on the rural debate. Hansen said he expected another “spirited” debate. 
In a hint of how heated — Storer has filed an amendment to Hansen’s proposal that would change the bill’s name to the “Livestock Dead Capitol Act” from the “Livestock Protection Act.”

Jay Inslee announced her appointment in 2019. (Photo courtesy of the governor's office)State Supreme Court Justice Raquel Montoya-Lewis, the first Native American elected statewide in Washington’s history, won’t seek reelection for a second term on the high court. 
Montoya-Lewis has been on the court since 2020. She’ll serve out her term, which ends Dec. 31, leaving the seat open for election this year. 
It means there will be elections for at least two open state Supreme Court seats this fall, as Justice Charles Johnson is stepping aside.
Montoya-Lewis announced her decision to colleagues Thursday and publicly Monday. She didn’t give a clear reason why she was leaving, but said the role has been an “honor.”
“I am excited for the coming year on the court and then continuing my career answering the call to do justice, a call I have followed throughout my career,” Montoya-Lewis said in a statement. 
“While I will step away from my work as a justice at the end of 2026, I have no plans to retire,” she continued. “I look forward to writing books, teaching and mentoring law students, lawyers and judges, and building and learning new ways to create a more equitable world.”
Montoya-Lewis, 57, is a member of the Pueblo of Isleta tribe and a descendant of the Pueblo of Laguna tribe, both of which are in New Mexico. Upon her appointment by then-Gov. Jay Inslee, she was believed to be the second Native American state Supreme Court justice in the country. 
The state Supreme Court is going through a period of turnover. 
Last year, Justice Sal Mungia joined the bench after a tight election for the seat vacated by the retirement of the late Susan Owens. 
Justice Mary Yu retired last year, leaving a seat open for Gov. Bob Ferguson to appoint. He tapped Colleen Melody, who was the civil rights division chief at the attorney general’s office. In that role, she worked for years under Ferguson in his time as attorney general. She was sworn into the court last week, and will be up for election this year to serve the remainder of Yu’s term through 2028.
And Johnson, the court’s longest-serving active justice, is set to retire as he turns 75 this year. The state constitution requires justices to retire at the end of the calendar year in which they turn 75. Johnson has been on the court since 1991.
King County Superior Court Judge Sean O’Donnell and David Shelvey have filed for election to replace Johnson. Shelvey ran for the seat Mungia won in 2024 and finished a distant fourth in the primary.
On Monday, Division 1 Court of Appeals Judge J. Michael Diaz filed to run for Montoya-Lewis’ seat. Inslee appointed him to the appellate court in 2022. Before that, Diaz was a King County Superior Court judge. President Barack Obama had nominated him to the U.S. District Court bench in western Washington, but the nomination expired without U.S. Senate confirmation.
In 2022, Montoya-Lewis took medical leave from the court before later returning.
Before joining the Supreme Court, she served five years on the Whatcom County Superior Court. Inslee’s appointment of Montoya-Lewis to that position made her the only Native American judge serving on a superior court in Washington. And before that, she was a tribal court judge for multiple tribes in the region.
She also taught at Western Washington University’s Fairhaven College. She’s been a major advocate for implicit bias training among court officials.
While on the court, she authored notable opinions to keep children with Native American heritage with their families and expand protections to stave off racism in civil court cases.
Writing for Seattle Met in 2020, the justice recalled a reporter asking her what she would tell people who thought she got a leg up for her Supreme Court appointment due to her heritage.
“Every time I’ve done well in anything, people want to chalk it up to being given some kind of special treatment. And the reverse has been true,” Montoya-Lewis wrote. “In my experience, I have had to overcome other people’s views about my abilities rather than being given some sort of extra credit for being Native.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/montoyalewis-1024x819.jpg,,,2026-01-26 20:57:29.975893

The legislation’s aims are laudable. But several of its proposed restrictions on data collection and use are likely to hurt small businesses — which employ nearly 45 percent of the state’s workers and are critical to our economy.  
I’ve spent years studying information-privacy law and policy. Data privacy undoubtedly needs the Legislature’s attention: It would take months — literally — for consumers to read the privacy policies for all the websites they visit annually. But data-privacy regulations need to strike just the right balance — because in today’s digital economy, small businesses rely on data-powered tools to grow and succeed. 
Nearly two-thirds of small businesses, for instance, use data-powered ads to connect with customers. As an example, if you’ve been searching online for new hiking boots, you might get a digital ad from your local outdoors store. The store isn’t surveilling you; instead, its digital partners send the ads to devices where data indicates a good match for the store’s offerings.  
That highly precise advertising helps the store find likely customers without wasting money advertising to unlikely customers, allowing it to compete with big players like Dick’s Sporting Goods or REI, who can afford to run multimillion-dollar ad campaigns.  
Small businesses also benefit from insights provided by data-analytics tools. These tools identify trends in aggregated, non-personally identifiable data, helping business owners see things like how visitors arrive at their website — say, by clicking on an ad or social media post — and what regions customers come from.  
Those insights help business owners make smart decisions about everything from how to spend a limited marketing budget, to where to open a new brick-and-mortar location. Eighty-six percent of Massachusetts small businesses use data to enhance their marketing efforts. 
The data privacy legislation offers a number of sensible provisions, including strict rules for handling sensitive data, requirements for guarding against data breaches, and a prohibition on sending kids targeted ads. Here’s where it goes too far for small businesses: As currently written, the Mass. Data Privacy Act would limit businesses to collecting and processing only the minimum data necessary to deliver a specific, customer-requested product or service. That would dramatically reduce the data available for the advertising, marketing, and analysis purposes that are so valuable to small businesses. 
The bill’s proposed limitations would hit small businesses hard. With less data to inform ad placement, Massachusetts small businesses’ ads would become less effective. That means the businesses would have to spend more money on ads that would likely generate fewer sales — dealing a blow to their bottom line. Bay State small businesses would also struggle to compete against out-of-state rivals, who wouldn’t face the same restrictions, and would lose ground to deep-pocketed corporate competitors who could still afford to market and advertise their products. 
The proposed data privacy law would apply to companies that collect the data of 60,000 or more consumers. That threshold would be among the lowest in the nation, and far lower than the 100,000-consumer threshold that exists in half of the states that have passed consumer privacy laws, including Connecticut and California. In Europe, similar regulations led to disproportionately high compliance costs for small businesses, as compared to larger businesses. The bill pending in the Legislature would likely have the same impact on Massachusetts small businesses, overburdening the businesses least able to bear its costs — and who pose the least risk to consumers.  
I support lawmakers’ efforts to protect consumers’ privacy, but I urge them to reconsider the data privacy act’s application to small businesses. Other states have shown that it’s possible to safeguard consumer data while still allowing small businesses to grow, compete, and succeed. Massachusetts can do the same by crafting balanced rules that protect privacy without hurting businesses that form the lifeblood of our economy.

More than half of California’s Democratic legislative caucus called for a government shutdown and introduced bills to hold federal agents accountable


California legislative Democrats are urging their congressional colleagues to shut down the federal government and block further funding to immigration enforcement agencies after agents shot and killed another civilian in Minnesota over the weekend.
At least 50 Democratic state senators and assemblymembers — more than half the party’s caucus — on Monday decried the slaying of Alex Pretti, the Minneapolis resident and Veterans Affairs intensive care nurse who on Saturday was gunned down by federal immigration enforcement agents. 
The lawmakers proclaimed their solidarity with Minnesota and other cities and states that have been targeted by federal law enforcement agents. They railed against what they called the Trump administration’s militarization of American cities as some wiped away tears.
The previously bipartisan spending package, which would fund the departments of Defense, Labor, Health and Human Services and Homeland Security, awaits a vote in the U.S. Senate, where an increasing number of Democrats have vowed to filibuster it. 
But California lawmakers warned that Senate Democrats, many of whom represent battleground states, might cave and give Republicans the votes they need to push the measure to President Donald Trump’s desk.
“This message is for Sen. Chuck Schumer,” said Assemblymember Liz Ortega, Democrat of Hayward. “Do your job. Stand for something. Don’t fold again.”
Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas, Democrat of Salinas, called for Schumer to “step aside” if he couldn’t keep his caucus in lockstep.
Rivas and his colleagues also had a message for Republican lawmakers. 
“We need you to speak out. You cannot watch these videos coming out of Minneapolis, Minn. and think that this is acceptable,” Rivas said. “We need your voice, we need your solidarity, and standing up for American values.”
In reference to the fact that Pretti was apparently carrying a permitted weapon, Assemblymember Mark Gonzalez of Los Angeles quoted a 2018 tweet from the late Charlie Kirk, which stated that the Second Amendment wasn’t for hunting or self protection, but “to ensure that free people can defend themselves if, god forbid, government became tyrannical and turned against its citizens.”
“What do you call a masked agent killing people in the street? What do you call children being taken from families?” Gonzalez said. 
He noted that the National Rifle Association condemned premature conclusions about the shooting as “dangerous and wrong.”
“Even the NRA is calling out the dangerous ignorance of federal officials trying to excuse the killing of Alex Pretti,” Gonzalez said. “When even staunch defenders of the Second Amendment recognize the need for accountability, we must listen.”

So far, California Republicans have targeted their criticism mainly at Democrats. Republican legislative leadership deferred to other members of their caucus when asked for comment. 
Sen. Tony Strickland, Republican of Huntington Beach, said Democratic officials have created risky and unsafe conditions for both the agents and civilian onlookers through so-called “sanctuary” policies that limit local and state law enforcement from working with federal immigration agents. They argue that those policies create risky situations where civilians like Pretti feel they need to monitor and track officers. 
“Stop the rhetoric that ICE agents are Gestapo, that they’re secret police, that they’re Nazis,” said Assemblymember James Gallagher of Chico, the former Republican Assembly leader who recently announced his bid for the special election to fulfill the final months of the late Rep. Doug LaMalfa’s congressional term. “This type of rhetoric is helping to contribute to the chaotic environment in places like Minnesota.”
Gallagher called Pretti’s death a “terrible thing” and called for an independent investigation and accountability. 
Legislation calls for greater ICE oversight
Some lawmakers are committing to introduce new measures to curtail the power of federal agents. 
“Certainly this is a frustrating situation because so much of the power and the authority here is in the hands of the federal government in Washington, D.C., but that doesn’t mean that the answer for us is to do nothing,” said Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel, Democrat of Encino. 
Gabriel plans to introduce a bill that would require the California attorney general to conduct an independent investigation into any shooting by federal immigration enforcement agents in the state, an extension of an existing law that already requires such investigations for shootings by local and state law enforcement. He will also co-author a bill with Assemblymember Juan Carrillo that would ban federal immigration enforcement agencies from using state resources to facilitate their operations, such as staging equipment and personnel on state property.
“We have to use every tool at our disposal, every lawful opportunity that we have to use our power, our authority to think of all of the different ways that we can push back,” Gabriel said.
Also on deck for a vote in the California Senate this week is Senate Bill 747 co-authored by Sen. Aisha Wahab of Hayward and Sen. Scott Wiener, a San Francisco Democrat who is running to replace Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi in Congress, that would allow Californians to sue federal agents for civil rights violations. The bill builds upon Wiener’s measure from last year that banned federal immigration enforcement agents from wearing masks, which Gov. Gavin Newsom signed into law.
Wiener argued that the issue should not be partisan.
“This is really about everyone’s rights under any federal administration,” Wiener told CalMatters on Monday. “Local and state law enforcement are already subject to civil rights liability if they violate someone’s rights, and federal agents effectively are not,” he said. 
“This is simply seeking to apply the same standards for all law enforcement.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/012426_ICEProtestSF_JK_CM_12.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-26 20:57:29.975893

Roy Cooper called for “immediate reforms” before any additional funding for ICE and Border Patrol operations following the deaths of two Minneapolis activists during altercations with federal agents.
“The federal government should deport violent criminals, but instead they have killed American citizens,” Cooper said in a statement on social media Monday afternoon. “Americans deserve answers and any additional funding for these ICE operations must come with immediate reforms that stop this chaos and keep people safe.”
The call for reform comes two days after the two-term Democratic governor first condemned federal immigration enforcement for the fatal shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti. “These horrific shootings in Minnesota should not have happened,” he said. “American citizens should not be targeted and killed.”

The campaign of Michael Whatley, Cooper’s expected 2026 general election opponent, did not respond to a request for comment. His campaign had not addressed the Minnesota shootings on its social media as of Monday afternoon.
In November, Whatley lauded “strong, decisive action” from the Trump administration when Immigration and Custom Enforcement agents were operating in Charlotte, writing on social media, “The highest function of any government is to keep its citizens safe.”
The National Republican Senatorial Committee, responded to Cooper but did not address his call for reform, zeroing in on another part of his statement: “As attorney general and governor, I locked up violent criminals to keep people safe.”
“Tell us more about how you ‘locked up violent criminals to keep people safe,’” the NRSC responded on X.
The post included a still image from the surveillance footage of last year’s killing of Iryna Zarutska on Charlotte public transportation. Republicans have argued that although Cooper was not governor at the time, he bears the responsibility for the attack because the alleged assailant was released from state prison under his administration after serving his full sentence. The North Carolina Republican Party reposted the criticism.

In response, Cooper campaign spokesman Jordan Monaghan said the attack on the former governor’s record was a distraction.
“Roy Cooper is the only candidate who spent his career prosecuting violent criminals and keeping thousands of them behind bars as attorney general, and signing tough on crime laws and stricter pretrial release bail policy as governor,” Monaghan said.
Cooper’s call for conditions on funding echoes those of U.S. Senate Democrats, nearly all of whom oppose additional funding for Homeland Security without restrictions on immigration enforcement operations. That standoff could potentially lead to a partial government shutdown.
Some Republicans have also voiced concerns over the shootings. On Sunday, Sen. Thom Tillis, whose seat Cooper and Whatley are vying to fill, urged a “thorough and impartial investigation” into Pretti’s death. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) called on the heads of ICE, Border Patrol, and USCIS to testify before the Senate Homeland Security Committee on Monday afternoon.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_3632-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-26 20:57:29.975893

(Photo by Scott Housley/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)Young children would still be required to get vaccinated before entering a Florida school or day care, but it would be easier for parents and guardians to opt out of those vaccinations under a bill passed by the Senate Health Policy Committee Monday afternoon.
In addition to addressing school vaccine requirements, SB 1756 would allow Florida pharmacists to provide ivermectin to adults without a prescription as a behind-the counter medication until the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approves it for over-the-counter sale. Ivermectin has been approved by the FDA for certain parasitic infections but federal guidelines require a prescription.
SB 1756 cleared the Senate Health Policy Committee by a 6-4 vote with longtime Stuart Republican state Sen. Gayle Harrell joining Democrats to oppose the measure. But at least two other senators — Health Policy Committee Chair Colleen Burton, a Winter Haven Republican, and Inverness Republican Sen. Ralph Masullo, a dermatologist — said the bill needed to change for them to support it in the future.
“As we know, this is a step in the process, and I’d like to see it much better going forward,” Massullo told the sponsor, Jacksonville Republican Sen. Clay Yarborough.
Specifically, the bill would allow parents to opt out of vaccines based on their conscience. Today, parents are allowed to opt out for medical or religious reasons.
Gov. Ron DeSantis and State Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo made national headlines in September when they announced they’d like to eliminate all vaccine mandates from Florida statutes and regulations, a move that could affect schoolchildren but also college students and even nursing home residents.
Ladapo said at the time that mandates drip “with disdain and slavery” and that legislators would have to “pick a side” in the vaccine debate.
DeSantis administration pushes to eliminate all vaccine mandates in Florida

Florida law requires immunization for poliomyelitis, diphtheria, rubeola, rubella, pertussis, mumps, and tetanus for entry and attendance in Florida schools, childcare facilities, and family daycare homes.
Yarborough’s s bill wouldn’t change that. But the bill would require providers who vaccinate minors to provide parents or guardians with information about the risks, benefits, safety, and efficacy of each vaccine being administered. The information provided to the parents would be produced by the Florida Board of Medicine and the Florida Board Ostepathic Medicine (whose members answer to the governor.)
Additionally, before giving a vaccines to a minor the bill would require providers to get a parent or guardian’s signature affirming they’ve been provided the requisite information. The bill would require health care providers s to discuss with parents and guardians the administration of multiple vaccines at once and offer alternative timing options.
The bill would not, however, require parents who don’t want to vaccinate their children to have the same conversations or have forms signed by providers attesting they’ve been provided information about vaccines. Harrell argued it had been longstanding policy at the Florida Department of Health to require consultations for parents who opt out but that the DeSantis administration reversed the policy during COVID.
Harrell is considered a top Republican voice in the Senate on health care policy; her husband, now deceased, was an obstetrician-gynecologist and she helped operate his clinics. She offered an amendment to the bill that would have made the DOH also require parents who opt out of vaccinating their children to Florida licensed physicians sign forms attesting they discussed the benefits and risks associated with the vaccinations with parents.
“We are about to go down a road that’s going to create a major problem for children but also seniors … who can’t be vaccinated,” she said. “We will wind up with outbreaks of very devastating diseases such as polio — and I had a grandmother who had polio and I know how devastating that it,” said Harrell.
It was shot down at the request of Yarborough, who said it was an added barrier that wasn’t needed.
Another Harrell-sponsored amendment was adopted by the committee, though. It would provide civil, criminal, and administrative protections to medical doctors, osteopathic physicians, and advanced nurses who prescribe or administer ivermectin to adults.
Who’s in the driver’s seat?
Senate Health Policy Committee Chair Burton noted that Yarborough said SB 1756 would help put parents back in the “drivers seat.” But Burton said that the parents who testified before the committee Monday said the bill would do the exact opposite.
“We heard from a number of parents today who don’t feel like they’re in the driver seat if we pass this bill today,” she said. “I know you’ve heard that before because you’re a thoughtful person and you  listen to everybody,” she said.
“We have the challenge of weighing the rights and responsibilities of all parents, right? We lean one way or another, we will be leaving somebody out and potentially we’ll be endangering some students. And if we give parents the driver seat that allows them additional exemptions to not vaccinate their children, then I’m not sure what seat that leaves some of the other parents when they don’t have options of where to send their children to school because every school has to accept these children, including private institutions.”
While Masullo voted for the bill, he said his future support also was incumbent upon changes.
“You know our governor today was talking about MAHA (Make America Health Again) and making our country greater by making our population healthier. Vaccines is part of that. And we would need to remove some of these — I’d call false — statements about vaccines and have people believe the truth. But the only way they’re going to do that is we make the truth evident to them,” he said.
More than one
SB 1756 isn’t the only vaccine-related bill the Senate has discussed to date.
The Senate Committee on Regulated Industries last week voted to approve SB 408. Specifically, the bill would amend Florida law regulating drugs and cosmetics to allow an individual to file a lawsuit within three years following an alleged vaccine-related injury. The bill would provide one-way attorney fees, allowing any claimant who wins to recover “reasonable attorney fees” but not allow winning defendants to do the same.

Sen. Carlos Guillermo Smith, a Democrat from Orlando, is pushing a proposal (SB 626) to amend statutes to require the vaccines (hepatitis B, chickenpox, haemophilus influenzae type b, and pneumococcal disease) Ladapo is trying to eliminate via rule.
That bill has been referred to the Senate Health Policy, Education Pre-K-12, and Rules committees. But that proposal hasn’t been heard yet.

The bill targets decisions by school districts to raise more revenue by “opting out” of property tax limitations imposed by the state. Local residents can already petition a board’s opt-out decision to a public vote, but there is no requirement for an election if nobody organizes a petition drive.

Under the bill, a school board could approve an opt-out with a two-thirds vote, but the decision would then go to a mandatory election. The bill also requires boards to spell out not only the number of years an opt-out would run, but the “total maximum dollar amount of taxes payable over the full term.”
There are 79 active school district opt-outs across South Dakota, according to data from the Legislative Research Council, resulting in a combined total of $43 million in excess property taxes.
Sen. Sue Peterson, R-Sioux Falls, introduced the bill, which was recommended by lawmakers on last summer’s Comprehensive Property Tax Task Force.
The bill aims to provide property tax relief and increase accountability among school districts and boards, Peterson told lawmakers, adding that the current system is “making spending limits obsolete.”
“It only makes sense that the burden should be on the school boards to get direct consent from the people if they want to circumvent spending limits,” Peterson said. “It should not be the responsibility of the people to gather petition signatures to prevent over-the-limit spending.”
Opponents of the bill said taxpayer dollars would be spent on unnecessary elections since many referred opt-outs are upheld by voters. Sen. Jamie Smith, D-Sioux Falls, said that school board members decide to opt out because of inadequate state funding.

I will be working with a bipartisan group of senators to demand real oversight and transparency.”
At the same time, Utah Republican state leaders say there needs to be a de-escalation from both political sides. However, they made no comments on how the Trump administration has characterized the killing.

“In everything I’ve ever been involved in that’s been very controversial, and this surely is, it takes two sides, and I think you’ve got to figure it out, and it’d be really nice if we find a way to de-escalate it,” Utah Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, said on Monday. “And I think there’s rhetoric on both sides. And I really feel like, right now, whatever we say, we’re going to spin it up, and I don’t want to spin it up. I want to spin it down. I just think we know better how to treat each other and what’s happening there is not right.”
For Utah House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, there’s blame to be placed “on the far right and the far left.” The lack of action from Congress has led to the current situation, he told reporters on Monday.
“I think if Congress would get its crap together and act and come up with a reasonable solution to fix our broken immigration system, a lot of these things would go away,” Schultz said. “And it’s not that hard.”
As protests against the tactics of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement emerge nationwide, including in Salt Lake City, elected officials are also thinking about plans to mitigate violence in Utah demonstrations, with Schultz saying the state promotes peaceful protest but will not tolerate violence.



Let us know what you think...


 


Adams, who described Pretti’s killing as “just horrible,” said Utah has been able to “manage things well.”
“Does anybody like the loss of a life? I mean, that’s just crazy. It’s not a positive thing,” Adams said. “And yet, you know, law enforcement has a really tough job.” 
But, when asked how the Trump administration is handling the Minneapolis situation and about whether they believe the administration’s description of the shooting was accurate, Adams asked other members of the Senate leadership for thoughts, but only got one answer from Sen. Jerry Stevenson, R-Layton.
“I would really like to discuss Utah issues,” Stevenson said.
Schultz said he hasn’t seen the video of the shooting, so he wouldn’t get into the specifics of the case.
Graphic video captured by witnesses shows six federal agents appearing to wrestle Pretti to the ground and 10 shots can be heard. He was pronounced dead at the scene.
Congress hurtles toward partial shutdown after Alex Pretti killing in Minneapolis

The Department of Homeland Security said Saturday morning “this looks like a situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement.” However, video shows an agent approaching Pretti as he was being held on the ground and then walking away with what appeared to be a gun in his hand before shots were fired.
Like Curtis, Schultz said he would also be in favor of an investigation on the shooting.
“Again, we’re all sitting here, and I don’t think any of us can agree on what exactly happened. And so I think having a better understanding of what happened, I think, is important,” he said.
But, he added, it is the responsibility of the federal government to handle immigration issues.
“I’m going to come back to collaboration. This wouldn’t happen in Utah and it shouldn’t happen in Minnesota,” he said. “They need to find a way to come together for the benefit of the citizens of this state of Minnesota, and that’s the state, and the locals, and the federal government.”
Senate Minority Leader Luz Escamilla, D-Salt Lake City, said there are a lot of concerns and fear among families in Utah.
“We’re prepping, understanding that there’s no control as a state in terms of what the federal government does for that, and that we can exercise all of our tools in our toolbox to make sure that we protect our residents and our citizens in the state of Utah,” Escamilla said.
Additionally, Escamilla said to expect Utah House and Senate members to ask the state’s congressional delegation to push for more oversight of Department of Homeland Security actions.
Amid the turmoil, U.S. Senate Democrats are insisting on a renegotiation of Homeland Security spending to include more constraints on federal immigration enforcement. If an agreement is not reached by Friday, there may be a partial government shutdown.
Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee said he would oppose any effort to defund the Department of Homeland Security and has called multiple times to send in the national guard to Minneapolis on his X account. 
“We’re not defunding ICE. Live with it.” he wrote Sunday.

(Screengrab from virtual hearing)A New Mexico district judge on Monday denied social media giant Meta’s requests to limit news sources from streaming or recording an upcoming trial in Santa Fe regarding allegations of child exploitation on its websites.
New Mexico First Judicial District Judge Bryan Biedscheid gave his ruling from the bench late Monday morning saying that Meta’s concerns of “security matters” did not meet the standards to outweigh public interest in the case.
“While this court is sensitive to a point about concerns related to future trials and concerns about security and the like, the court does not find that, on balance, those outweigh the public’s right to understand,” Biedscheid said.
The New Mexico Foundation for Open Government and five media organizations sought to intervene in the case. Chuck Peifer, the attorney representing the media organizations and NMFOG, told the court that limiting video and recording would be a “significant impingement” on public access to the courtroom.
“When you say there’s no video and there’s no audio, you can only have print, which means that the public only gets to hear a narrative third-party description of what happened in the courtroom,” Peifer said.
The decision marks the latest development in the case against the company that owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, spurred by the 2023 civil lawsuit brought by New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez. In the complaint, the New Mexico Department of Justice alleges that Meta and CEO Mark Zuckerberg “failed to stem the tide of damaging sexual material and sexual propositions delivered to children” on the internet.
At the conclusion of the hearing, Biedscheid said he would consider making limitations on a more specific level for certain witnesses or evidence shown in the courtroom at a future date, saying he is not “oblivious or insensitive to specific concerns.”
“I, at this point, am focused on the broadest concern, and that is making it clear that there can be livestreaming video and audio that will be allowed throughout the trial,” he said.
Jury selection for the trial is scheduled to start on Feb. 2.

Marian Matthews (D-Albuquerque) carries a box of health care compact materials out of a House committee room Jan. 26, 2026. (Danielle Prokop/Source NM)The New Mexico House Judiciary Committee on Monday quickly passed legislation that would enter the state into seven health care worker compacts, part of lawmakers’ effort to pass as many compact bills as possible despite Senate opposition.
House legislators in both parties say the compacts are necessary to help reduce health care worker shortages in a variety of fields. Joining the compacts reduces licensure requirements and therefore barriers for health care workers to move to New Mexico and work here. 
The House and Senate Republicans have pushed for the compacts for several years. Senate Democrats have opposed them, though they agreed this session under mounting pressure to advance legislation entering the state into compacts for doctors and social workers. 
NM Senate passes interstate medical compact bill

The seven compacts the House committee passed Monday afternoon include physicians assistants, audiologists, speech-language pathologists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, dentists, dental hygienists and paramedics.
The committee did not hear two other pieces of compact legislation for counselors and psychologists. Rep. Marian Matthews (D-Albuquerque), who sponsored those bills, is still working on substitute versions of the bills that reflect the language preferences of the compacts she’s seeking to join. 
House Democrats celebrated the passage of the bills, which are now headed to the House floor. 
“By joining interstate compacts, New Mexico can expand access to vital healthcare services —  from counseling and physical therapy to emergency medical services and dentistry — all across the state,” Rep. Liz Thomson (D-Albuquerque), chair of the Health and Human Services Committee and lead sponsor of five of the compact bills, said in a statement.  Thomson’s committee passed the nine compacts last week. 
Should the additional compact bills pass the House as expected, House leaders said in a statement Monday afternoon they are “hopeful” the bills have enough support in both chambers.
Senate Democratic leaders, however, have argued against passing more than the social worker and doctor compacts. They say state agencies including the Regulation and Licensing Department, lack capacity to handle a deluge of new compact requirements and that each compact is complex and needs to be negotiated individually.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_3610-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-26 19:56:33.654986

(Danielle Prokop/Source NM)The New Mexico Senate Health and Public Affairs Committee on Monday unanimously advanced a bill allocating $547 million for a new University of New Mexico School of Medicine, something Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham labeled a priority in her final State of the State address. 
Senate Bill 6, a one-page bill, would direct nearly $547 million from the state general fund to the university Board of Regents to build and furnish a new school by 2030. Supporters of the bill, including sponsor Sen. George Muñoz, (D-Gallup), said it would provide a much-needed facelift to a 65-year-old school, double the number of medical students and ease the state’s physician shortage. The school currently produces nearly 40% of the practicing physicians across the state.
“I go to Arizona a lot. There’s not a 65-year-old building on Arizona State University’s campus,” Muñoz said.
The overall project will cost about $600 million, according to the university. Plans call for building the 330,000 square-foot facility on the northeast corner of University and Lomas boulevards, near the existing UNM Hospital. 
Both chambers of the Legislature have taken up causes to address New Mexico’s physician shortage. The state Senate voted 40-0 on Friday to pass Senate Bill 1, known as the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact Act. Supporters say the legislation would make it easier for licensed health care professionals from other states to practice in New Mexico.
Although the committee voted 10-0 to advance the UNM bill, some Republicans expressed concern over the dollar amount. Since late 2025, state economists have warned that lawmakers will have to deal with reduced spending in setting the upcoming fiscal year’s budget. Of particular concern is recurring spending, such as hiring new government employees. Lawmakers have said that non-recurring spending, such as construction projects, is less of a concern.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)With less than three weeks to go until their deadline, conservative groups collecting signatures as part of an effort to repeal Utah’s voter-approved independent redistricting law known as Proposition 4 still have a long way to go in order to qualify their effort for the 2026 ballot. 
According to the latest tallies recorded to the lieutenant governor’s website Monday morning, county clerks had verified 57,437 signatures submitted by the political issues committee Utahns for Representative Government, which was founded by Utah Republican Party Chairman Rob Axson. 
In order to pose the repeal question to voters on the November ballot, the GOP must collect at least 140,748 valid signatures from registered voters across Utah while meeting specific thresholds in at least 26 of Utah’s 29 Senate districts. 
That means the group needs to obtain and submit at least 83,311 more valid signatures by Feb. 15 at 5 p.m.
Another redistricting twist: Utah GOP changes tactics to repeal independent map-drawing law

It’s likely, however, the group has collected more signatures than what is currently reflected on the lieutenant governor’s website because totals are posted after county clerks verify signature packets. 
In response to a request for an interview Monday about the effort’s progress, Axson told Utah News Dispatch in a text message that the 57,437 signatures tallied on the lieutenant governor’s website as of Monday morning is “many weeks old,” adding there is a “substantial lag” from when signatures are gathered to when they are verified by clerks and posted online. 
County clerks have 21 days from when they receive each signature gathering packet to verify signatures. The final day for clerks to verify signatures is March 7. 
Trump looks to give repeal effort a boost
As the deadline looms, President Donald Trump looked to give the signature gathering effort a boost Friday, when he posted a call to action to Utahns on Truth Social, calling the Proposition 4 repeal effort “very important” to “KEEP UTAH RED.” 
The president echoed complaints from the Utah Republican Party and GOP lawmakers about the state’s new congressional boundaries recently ordered by a judge to be used for the 2026 elections. The courts determined the 2021 Utah Legislature violated Utahns’ constitutional rights when it repealed and replaced Proposition 4 and adopted a congressional map that year that wasn’t drawn using the measure’s independent commission or neutral map-drawing standards.
After determining the Utah Legislature’s proposed remedial map again didn’t adhere to Proposition 4’s neutral standards meant to guard against gerrymandering, 3rd District Judge Dianna Gibson chose an alternative map drawn by plaintiffs in the redistricting lawsuit that she concluded did adhere to map-drawing standards outlined by Proposition 4, which she restored as law. 
Utah’s court-ordered map created a Democratic-majority congressional district concentrated around northern Salt Lake County and three Republican districts — to the dismay of the state’s Republican leaders. The Legislature has pledged to appeal that decision to the Utah Supreme Court.
Utah Democrats likely to win congressional seat in 2026 if judge’s map order stands

“Utahns deserve Maps drawn by those they elect, not Rogue Judges or Leftwing Activists who never faced the Voters, and, therefore, I encourage all Patriotic Utahns, Republicans, and MAGA Supporters who love their Great State and Country to sign this initiative, ASAP,” Trump posted, while urging Utahns to attend signature gathering events held over the weekend across the state. 
Axson, chairman of the Utah Republican Party, applauded Trump’s post in a statement shared to social media, saying, “it is evident from the President’s message that he deeply cares about Utah, its people, and our future.”
“We greatly appreciate his help to share the message of representative government and constitutional order so that Utah remains true to conservative principles,” Axson said. 
It’s not yet clear how much of a bump Trump’s post may have given the Proposition 4 repeal effort. 
But as they’ve watched, critics of the repeal effort say it’s lagging far behind what it needs to qualify the question for the ballot. 
‘Desperation’
Utah Democratic Party Chairman Brian King called Trump’s Friday statement “desperation — the same strong-arm playbook, trying to intimidate voters instead of facing the truth.” 
“Donald Trump and his Utah Republican backers are desperate because they’re finally starting to come to terms with how unpopular their gerrymandering scam actually is,” King said. “Utahns already voted on Prop 4 and made it crystal clear that they demand fair maps, fair elections, and fair representation.” 
The Utah GOP has enlisted the help of conservative influencer Scott Presler, who over the weekend posted multiple times on X that he was working hard to gather signatures. 
A dark money group that helped finance Trump’s presidential campaign in 2024 is also bankrolling the Proposition 4 repeal effort. The nonprofit Securing American Greatness has contributed more than $4.3 million to Utahns for Representative Government, all of which was spent on its contracted signature gathering company, Patriot Grassroots, according to the group’s financial disclosure reports. 
King said despite throwing millions at the effort, “there’s a reason why Republicans are struggling to get the signatures they need and are parachuting Trump in from the sidelines: Utahns don’t want them to manipulate our elections.” 
5 key Utah redistricting issues to watch in 2026

“If Republicans want to earn voters’ trust, they should stop cheating and start actually listening to what Utahns want,” he said. 
The anti-gerrymandering group Better Boundaries that successfully sought Proposition 4 back in 2018 and other groups are urging Utahns to “decline to sign” the repeal effort, and is also encouraging anyone who did sign to go through a legal process to remove their signatures. 
Elizabeth Rasmussen, executive director of Better Boundaries, reacted to Trump’s statement in a video posted to social media with disbelief that the president said “the quiet part out loud” —  that the purpose of the repeal is to “keep Utah red.” 
“Utah’s maps are governed by Utah law, not national politics,” Rasmussen said in a statement issued in response to Trump’s post. 
She went on to say the Utah GOP’s efforts to gather enough signatures was falling flat because it’s not popular with Utahns.
“After burning through millions of dollars, outside actors still can’t get enough Utahns to sign on to repealing the reform voters already passed,” she said. “That tells you everything. If this repeal were popular with Utah voters, it wouldn’t need national megaphones and millions of dollars to survive. Prop 4 was about keeping politicians from picking their voters. Utahns meant it then, and they continue to mean it now.”
What do Utahns think about gerrymandering in Utah?
On Monday, Better Boundaries released a poll it commissioned, conducted by the firm Embold Research, that showed 71% of Utah voters believe there should be neutral, independent standards for redistricting in Utah. The poll also found: 

64% of Utah voters support Proposition 4, including 46% who strongly support and 18% who somewhat support. 
57% of Utah voters disapprove of the Legislature repealing Proposition 4, including 87% of registered Democrats and 68% of unaffiliated voters. About 47% of registered Republicans also disapprove, according to the poll, but a higher share (25%) said they were unsure.

The poll of 1,731 registered Utah voters was conducted Jan. 12-15 has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points, according to a summary of its findings issued by Embold Research. 
“We don’t need to spin or hype these numbers,” Rasmussen said in a prepared statement issued with the poll. “It is clear that Utahns want to choose their politicians, and they don’t believe that politicians should have the power to choose their voters.”
Utah GOP lawmakers confident repeal will qualify for ballot
In a media availability with reporters Monday, some Republican legislators said the repeal signature gathering effort is likely going better than people think — and they argued it’s something that should be put to a vote to let Utahns decide Proposition 4’s ultimate fate. 
“I think it’s going really well,” said Senate Majority Assistant Whip Mike McKell, who lives in the conservative city of Spanish Fork.

McKell said his personal business was used as a venue for a signature gathering event for the repeal effort, and “there were a lot of folks in south Utah county that were excited to come in and sign. … There was a lot of interest in my community.” 
Asked about the lagging number of verified signatures posted to the lieutenant governor’s website, McKell said he’s confident “they’ll get the signatures” to qualify the question for the ballot. 
House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, said he hasn’t been directly involved in the effort, but “you really don’t understand how it’s going … until the last week or two until all the signatures really start to get turned in.” 
“There’s a strategy there to be a little late,” Schultz said, though he added, “I don’t know what’s happening and what’s not happening. But I’m confident that it will likely end up on the ballot.”
Sen. Scott Sandall, R-Tremonton, noted that Proposition 4 passed by a narrow margin — with 50.34% of the vote — and he argued Utah voters should be given another chance to weigh in on the issue. 
“Now there’s a group that says, ‘We want to try it again and see if enough people will turn it around,” Sandall said, questioning why that’s controversial. 
Asked about Better Boundaries’ poll, Sandall said he thinks a vote on repealing Proposition 4 will be “a lot closer” than the numbers reflected in that poll, based on “when I talk to people, at least, in my area.”

The worst might still be ahead as even colder temperatures are forecast for the state overnight, where more than 125,000 residents in its northern and central sections remained without electricity Monday afternoon. 
Icy roads and downed trees are hindering power restoration efforts, with some portions of rural Northeast Louisiana possibly having to wait until Thursday to get reconnected.  
Gov. Jeff Landry urged residents to stay put so that utility crews can continue their work and first responders don’t have to take unnecessary risks to aid stranded motorists.
“Just because a road is passable does not mean it’s safe,” Landry said Tuesday during an update on the state’s response to the weather event.

State climatologist Jay Grymes said much of northern Louisiana will see temperatures down to the teens by Tuesday morning, with single-digits reading possible in some areas. Down in the state’s coastal parishes, readings in the 20s are forecast. 
“Even though we’re done with the freezing rain, the sleet and the snow, we’re still a long way from being out of the woods in terms of the cold,” Grymes said. “The dangerous and potentially deadly cold will continue through the week.”    
An 86-year-old DeSoto Parish man and his two pets were found dead at his home Monday morning, KSLA-TV reported. The state health department attributed his death to carbon monoxide poisoning, and State Fire Marshal Bryan Adams confirmed the man was using a generator in the garage adjacent to his home.  
Over the weekend, the deaths of two unidentified men in Caddo Parish were blamed on the severe cold, one of whom was found near the Shreveport YMCA. 
Louisiana Health Secretary Bruce Greenstein confirmed hypothermia caused their deaths, and he said two more fatalities being investigated are also believed to be from exposure to the subfreezing conditions.
“We think that the hypothermia deaths are avoidable. We really implore you to basically take care of yourself and take care of your neighbors,” said Greenstein, who directed residents to the state’s Get a Game Plan website and cellphone app for more information on warming centers that have been set up around the state. 
More than 60 warming centers were open as of Monday afternoon, and the governor said the state is fielding requests from parishes to open additional locations.

The need for warming centers is expected to last as long as parts of the state struggle to have their power restored. Outages during the winter storm reached 175,000 customers at their peak, Public Service Commission executive director Brandon Frey said. That number had been reduced to 125,000 as of Monday afternoon.
The problem was most severe in rural areas of Northeast Louisiana. In East Carroll Parish, 95% of its nearly 3,400 customers did not have power as of 3:45 p.m. Monday, and almost 60% of West Carroll’s 2,500 customers were in the same predicament, according to the tracking website FindEnergy.com. The outage rate was also high for Richland Parish, where 58% of its 9,200 customers awaited restoration. 
The situation was also acute in Ouachita Parish, where 57% of 83,000 customers didn’t have electricity Monday afternoon. Officials there were also dealing with water service issues. Greenstein said St. Francis Medical Center in Monroe reported it was experiencing low water pressure, though he expected the problem to be resolved shortly.
At the University of Louisiana Monroe, residential halls housing 440 students remained without power, though school officials said they are still safe for students. A warming center was made available on campus.

Entergy Louisiana serves all four parishes and reported the largest number of outages remaining statewide at roughly 84,000. Company CEO Philip May said 90% of its customers that aren’t dealing with access issues to have their power restored, such as closed roads or downed power lines, should have their electricity back by Wednesday. The utility has 4,300 workers in the field handling restoration, May said.  
For Entergy customers where crews can’t access their service lines, it could take until Thursday for their power to come back on. Anyone with home damage from the winter storm will need to consult an electrician to determine if they can have their power restored, May said. 
Some 24,500 SWEPCO customers should have electricity by Wednesday, and the bulk of more than 5,100 CLECO customers are expected to have their power back Tuesday, according to Frey.
More than 1,500 state highway workers are actively clearing roads of ice and debris, Transportation Secretary Glenn Ledet said, and employees from southern Louisiana are being sent north to help.
The governor said his staff has been in touch with the Federal Emergency Management Agency with a request to elevate the federal emergency declaration for Louisiana. The hope is FEMA can provide resources to assist the state with debris clearing, though the Trump administration has slashed funding and personnel at the agency. 
Another round of freezing weather is expected to impact Louisiana this weekend, though Grymes said it should not include the sleet or ice that created the current hazardous conditions.

University spokesman Adam McDonald said power provider Entergy Louisiana is hopeful it can restore power to 90% of the Interstate 20 corridor, which includes Monroe, by Wednesday evening. Meanwhile, temperatures are expected to remain below freezing into Tuesday. 
ULM students will be safe in their residence halls overnight, though the university has opened its activity center as a 24-hour warming center with cots, bathrooms and charging capability, McDonald said. 
“My entire leadership team is working around the clock with local and state partners and utilizing every resource available to us,” ULM President Carrie Castille wrote in a social media post. “Our priority is keeping our students safe, warm, and fed. I fully understand the discomfort and stress many of our students are experiencing, and I want to assure you that we are pushing for solutions on every front.” 
Classes at UL Monroe will remain cancelled at least until next Monday, McDonald said.
While ULM residence halls have water, the city of Monroe is experiencing low water pressure as the hard freeze has created leaks in its delivery system. 
Other universities in North Louisiana have not been as negatively impacted by the storm. Louisiana Tech, Grambling, LSU Shreveport and Northwestern State University have power, university officials said in separate interviews. 
But even with power, classes at Grambling, Northwestern State, LSU Shreveport, Southern University Shreveport and Centenary College are cancelled Tuesday, according to their websites. The Louisiana Tech campus will also be closed Wednesday.
LSU Shreveport spokeswoman Erin Smith said some students on campus lost power for a few hours Sunday, but it has since been restored. Some student apartments have also had hot water issues, though affected students are able to access hot water in other locations, Smith said. 
Louisiana Tech spokeswoman Cami Geisman said icy streets have made it difficult for some essential campus workers to make it to their posts, but campus police have been driving food service workers to work to ensure students are fed.

Larry Rhoden listens to a question at his first press conference of the 2026 legislative session on Jan. 15, 2026, at the South Dakota Capitol in Pierre. (Photo by Meghan O'Brien/South Dakota Searchlight)PIERRE — The South Dakota governor should retain exclusive control over a pot of economic development money known as the Future Fund, a committee of lawmakers decided Monday at the Capitol. 
The Senate State Affairs Committee rejected a bill that would have subjected the fund to greater oversight, after an earlier tie vote left the measure in limbo.
The committee voted 4-4 earlier this month on a motion to send the bill to the full Senate, with Sen. Arch Beal, R-Sioux Falls, excused due to illness. On Monday, with Sen. Curt Voight, R-Rapid City, replacing Beal on the committee, the proposal was defeated 5-4.
The bill would have required Future Fund awards to be approved by a majority vote of the governor-appointed Board of Economic Development, instead of the governor alone. It also would have directed the Governor’s Office of Economic Development to write rules establishing an application process, methods of assessing economic impact, selection criteria, qualification requirements and procedures for disbursing awards.
Governor pledges transparency in funding decisions that lawmakers might vote to take away

The Future Fund receives money from a fee paid by employers. It has drawn scrutiny in recent years over uses by former Gov. Kristi Noem, including millions in spending for a shooting range that lawmakers declined to fund, a rodeo and an advertising campaign starring Noem. 
Some of the bill’s opponents said a few examples do not undermine the value of a governor-controlled fund, which is intended to give the governor flexibility to quickly respond to economic opportunities. 
“This is funded by the employers. Not every taxpayer in the state funds this,” said Sen. Randy Deibert, R-Spearfish. “And those groups that represent employers are soundly opposed to this.” 
Groups opposing the bill included the South Dakota Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and the South Dakota Retailers Association. 
Earlier this month, Gov. Larry Rhoden attempted to get ahead of the issue with an executive order laying out procedures for how Future Fund awards are handled. It self-imposes requirements for public posting of awards and agreements, while still preserving the governor’s sole authority over the fund. The order is not binding on future governors if they choose to operate the fund differently.
Meanwhile, another bill would increase the Governor’s Office of Economic Development’s reporting requirements for the Future Fund. That bill, from Rep. Erik Muckey, D-Sioux Falls, has not yet had a hearing.
The economic development office is already required to report minimal information about the Future Fund twice per year to the Legislature’s budget committee. Muckey’s bill would require additional information to be included in the reports, such as all awards made in the prior 20 years, the fund balance at the time of the report, and the status of the research or economic development purpose of the awards. The report would also add a list of other legislative committees required to receive the reports once per year.

Initiative 95 would amend the Colorado Constitution to require law enforcement to notify the U.S. Department of Homeland Security when a person who is not in the country lawfully, or when it is unclear if the person is lawfully present, is charged with a violent crime or was previously convicted of a felony. 
Law enforcement agencies would have 72 hours after charging someone with a crime to notify DHS if the agency could not determine whether the person is lawfully present after making “a reasonable attempt” to determine it.

Colorado law currently restricts law enforcement from helping with federal immigration enforcement. Officers cannot keep someone in custody based on an ICE detainer request or arrest someone suspected of being in the country illegally at a courthouse. 
Local government officials and employees are also prohibited from sharing personal identifying information about immigration status with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which operates under DHS. Public officials who intentionally violate that data sharing provision are liable for a $50,000 civil fine, which goes to the state’s immigration legal defense fund.
As a constitutional amendment, the measure would need 55% of the vote to pass.
Advance Colorado, a conservative nonprofit advocacy group that does not disclose its donors, is behind the measure. The group led another ballot measure on the 2026 ballot that would mandate harsher penalties for possession of fentanyl.
U.S. Customs and Border patrol agents this week in Minneapolis shot and killed Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse, just two weeks after ICE agents shot and killed Renee Good in that city. The two killings have sparked nationwide outrage, even as President Donald Trump’s top advisers have rushed to spread false information about Pretti and Good, both of whom were smeared as “domestic terrorists” by the administration within hours of being killed.
The election is Nov. 3.

(Photo by Jim Obradovich for Iowa Capital Dispatch)With less than six months until the 2026 primaries, three candidates announced Monday they are ending their campaigns for Iowa U.S. House seats.
In Iowa’s 3rd Congressional District, state Rep. Jennifer Konfrst, D-Windsor Heights, suspended her campaign and endorsed Sen. Sarah Trone Garriott, D-West Des Moines, to become the Democratic nominee for the seat currently held by GOP Rep. Zach Nunn.
Konfrst said in a statement Monday she decided to run for Congress in January 2025 in order to “bring balance back to DC and bring my working class Iowa roots to the job.”
“I’m a sixth generation Iowan and I’ve spent most of my life in Iowa,” Konfrst said. “I love this state, even when it has disappointed me in recent years. I want Iowa to be a kinder place to live and raise a family. I want it to be a place where working class Iowans aren’t crushed by costs and struggling to get by. I want it to be a place where young Iowans, like my own kids and my students, can build a future for themselves. That’s still my goal and I’m ready to explore ways to do that.”
While Federal Election Commission fundraising reports are not due for federal candidates until Jan. 31, Konfrst fell behind Trone Garriott in October and July fundraising reports. The Democratic candidate thanked her campaign’s supporters who donated to her campaign, as well as the elected officials and community leaders who endorsed her in the race.
“I’m deeply proud of the campaign we’ve run, and I’m looking forward to serving in the Iowa legislature and working for my constituents,” Konfrst said.
Konfrst, formerly Iowa House minority leader, has not said whether she plans to seek another term at the Statehouse. She said her focus heading into 2026 was on electing Democrats in the 2026 elections, calling for mobilization against Iowa Republicans like Nunn who have supported President Donald Trump’s agenda.
“President Trump, enabled by Republican Congressman Zach Nunn, has unleashed an armed mob on American citizens, increased prices for groceries and utilities and engaged in unprecedented levels of corruption,” Konfrst said. “We must elect Democrats to the House and Senate in November to stop the chaos, fear and economic destruction – and this work begins in Iowa. I will be in this fight with you to elect Democrats, here at home in Polk County and across the whole state of Iowa.”
Trone Garriott thanked Konfrst for her leadership and the endorsement of her campaign.
“In a time when politics can feel loud and chaotic, Jennifer has stayed focused on what matters: protecting our public schools, doing right by Iowans, and standing up for our values. Our party is stronger because of her, and I’m thankful for her service,” Trone Garriot said. “… I’m ready to work alongside her to unify Democrats, earn the trust of voters across IA-03, and defeat Zach Nunn so we can lower costs and restore balance and accountability in Washington.”
In Iowa’s 1st Congressional District, Democrat Taylor Wettach also suspended his congressional campaign Monday, saying he will instead run for state auditor.
Wettach, a lawyer from Muscatine, announced his campaign in July for the seat currently held by U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks. In a campaign ad announcing his run, Wettach spoke about resigning from his job at Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, after the New York-based law firm agreed to provide free legal services to the Trump administration to avoid facing executive actions.
As he moved to the auditor’s race, Wettach said in a statement he wants to ensure the seat is held by someone who will serve as “an independent watchdog for the people, regardless of who is in power – not a lapdog for corrupt politicians.”
Currently, Democrat Rob Sand serves as Iowa auditor — currently the only Democrat to hold statewide elected office. Sand is running for Iowa governor in 2026. Wettach is currently the only Democrat running for the auditor’s seat, but there are two Republicans vying for their party nomination — Lt. Gov. Chris Cournoyer and Abigail Maas, an Iowa County supervisor.
Wettach said he believed the race should not be focused on partisan issues, and that he believes his experience as an attorney will allow him to provide “accountability” for Iowa taxpayers.
“When Iowans are tightening their belts, the last thing they should have to worry about is whether their tax dollars are being wasted or misused,” Wettach said in a statement. “Instead of making life better for Iowans, some politicians in Des Moines are rigging the system to protect themselves instead of protecting taxpayers. Corruption isn’t then an accident – it’s the predictable result of unchecked power – and that should alarm every Iowan, regardless of party.”
Wettach announced endorsements from prominent Democrats, including former Gov. Tom Vilsack, former Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller and Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart for his campaign for auditor.
Republican officials have pointed to Wettach and Konfrst’s announcements as signs that Iowa Democrats wanting to avoid primaries. Iowa’s 1st and 3rd congressional districts are expected to be extremely competitive races in the upcoming election, with political forecasters like the Cook Political Report rating both races as “toss-ups.”
With Konfrst exiting the 3rd District race, Trone Garriott is likely poised to become the party nominee in the race. In the 1st District, Democrat Christina Bohannan has led in 2025 campaign finance reports against both Democratic challengers and Miller-Meeks. Though Wettach left the race, Bohannan still faces a primary race against Travis Terrell, a patient access specialist at University of Iowa Health Care.
Iowa GOP spokesperson Jade Cichy said in a Monday statement the Iowa Democratic Party “is once again trying to decide primaries before voters ever have their say.”
“Today’s coordinated announcements make their priorities clear: protecting party favorites, not empowering Iowans,” Cichy said. “By attempting to anoint Christina Bohannan and Sarah Trone Garriott, party insiders are proving these candidates would serve as nothing more than mouthpieces for the Democrat establishment.”
One Republican candidate also suspended her campaign Monday — Iowa Rep. Shannon Lundgren, R-Peosta, who was running for Iowa’s 2nd Congressional District.
Lundgren said in a Monday statement she made the decision alongside her family to seek another term in the Iowa Legislature instead of seeking federal office.
“The challenges facing Iowa families are urgent, and I believe my voice and experience are most needed in the Iowa Legislature right now,” Lundgren said. “From lowering taxes and supporting our farmers to protecting our communities and promoting opportunity, I’ve worked tirelessly to make Iowa a better place. I’m excited to keep that momentum going and intend to run for reelection to the Iowa House to continue this important work on behalf of the hardworking people of District 65.”
There are two other Republicans — Republican candidate Joe Mitchell, a former state legislator and the the founder of Run Gen Z, and state Sen. Charlie McClintock, R-Alburnett — running for the seat currently held by U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson. Hinson is running for Iowa’s U.S. Senate seat in 2026, a decision she announced after U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst said she will not seek another term.
There are still four Democrats running for the party nomination in the 2nd Congressional District: Iowa Rep. Lindsay James, D-Dubuque; Clint Twedt-Ball, the founder of the nonprofit Matthew 25; Kathy Dolter, the former dean of nursing at Kirkwood Community College, and Guy Morgan, a Democrat from Boone.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/voting-stations-june-2024-primary-dm-12-13-_-jim-obradovich.jpg,,,2026-01-26 19:56:33.654986

Faster evictions in a tight housing market will only deepen Vermont’s homelessness crisis.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Maryellen Griffin: Evictions cause homelessness. We can’t afford more.  .","This commentary is by Maryellen Griffin, a staff attorney with Vermont Legal Aid who lives in Danville.



The data confirms what common sense tells us: eviction is a leading cause of homelessness. Thousands of Vermonters are already homeless, including hundreds of children, and legislative proposals to speed up evictions will only make things worse.  
Landlords filed 1,818 eviction cases in Vermont in 2024. If we speed up the eviction process, where will these households go? 

READ MORE

With a rental vacancy rate of just 2.1% and only 1% in Chittenden County, there’s simply nowhere for people to land. Raising the number and speed of evictions will create more homelessness.  
Instead, the Legislature should focus on preventing eviction. Preventing eviction is far cheaper than homelessness. 
The evidence consistently shows that back-rent assistance and right-to-counsel programs save states money by preventing eviction, homelessness and the resulting costs to taxpayers. These aren’t theoretical solutions. They’re proven interventions. 
Elinor (not her real name), a Legal Aid client, has lived in her apartment for five years without incident. Two years ago, three investors bought her building. 
They raised her rent by 30%, and when she questioned the increase, they started eviction proceedings against her. 
Vermont has no legal limit on how much a landlord can raise rent or how quickly, and Elinor can be evicted for no reason at all, even if she pays the increase. She’s willing to move, but she does not have anywhere to go. Way too many tenants in this situation end up homeless. 
Elinor’s story isn’t unique. In the past five years, requests for legal help with eviction have increased by 45%. This is what happens when eviction meets a housing crisis. 
Between 2019 and 2024, Vermont’s rental vacancy rate dropped from 4.5% to 2.1%. During this same period, median gross rent jumped 34.6%, from $980 to $1,319. 
Over half of Vermont’s renter households already pay more than 30% of their income on rent, and, for one in four, housing costs are more than half their income. 
More than 70% of all evictions are for nonpayment of rent. These aren’t irresponsible tenants. They’re our neighbors, our service workers, families and retirees whose income stayed flat while rents rose 35% in five years. 
In recent years, the number of available rental units has actually decreased. Between population growth, short-term rentals, flood damage and other losses, Vermont just doesn’t have enough of the kind of housing people need. 
Given the severe shortage of affordable units and the extremely limited availability of deeply affordable housing, our high rates of homelessness are completely predictable. 
When you evict someone in a market with a tiny vacancy rate, you’re not helping them find better housing. You’re making them homeless.  
In a crisis where there’s nowhere for displaced tenants to go, making evictions faster just pushes families into homelessness, transferring costs to the public that are far higher than the original rent dispute. 
The costs of mass homelessness are staggering: emergency department visits, shelter costs, management of encampments and, tragically, lives lost.  
While emergency housing is expensive, kicking people out of emergency housing when they have nowhere else to go is not just cruel; it actually costs municipalities even more. 
Meanwhile, some legislators are proposing ways to evict people faster, even though investing in eviction prevention strategies would cost less and work better. 
These are our neighbors being evicted. This can happen to anyone in a market this tight. 
Vermont faces a clear choice. We can fund back-rent programs and require mediation before evictions are filed. We can ensure effective housing support services are available to everyone facing eviction and guarantee tenants the right to legal counsel—programs that cost less and work better than managing the homelessness that results from eviction. We can improve access to rental assistance. 
Or we can speed up evictions and watch our homelessness crisis accelerate, spending even more on emergency services and shelter and seeing even more Vermonters suffer. 
Where are people supposed to go when we evict them faster? Until we answer that question honestly and invest in real solutions, legislating for more and faster evictions isn’t a solution. It’s simply a way to push more Vermonters onto our streets. 
The evidence is clear, and the human cost of getting this wrong is too high to ignore.

SB 1326 would require Florida judges to sentence offenders found guilty who intended to commit their crimes to prison, even if the accused couldn’t tell whether their actions were right or wrong. It was inspired by fears that Florida could accidentally release violent, legally insane offenders onto the street.
But the bill had glaring loopholes: Its language could remove the option for offenders to receive court-mandated mental health treatment. An independent senator called the legislation “crap,” a Democrat deemed it “unjust,” and a Republican voted “no,” resulting in SB 1326 barely passing in a 4-to-3 vote.
However, Republican Sen. Jonathan Martin, the bill’s sponsor, acknowledged problems and promised changes. 
“This bill is something that is far from perfect,” he said in the Senate Criminal Justice committee. 
“At this point, it’s our first attempt to deal with the issue that comes up when somebody is guilty of a heinous act and, but for the fact that they’re being found not guilty legally for reasons of insanity, they would serve a very long prison sentence,” the Fort Myers Republican added.
Florida is one of 25 states that uses the prevailing “right-wrong test,” or “M’Naghten Rule.” The strictest of insanity defenses, defendants can only be declared legally insane if they’re unable to tell the difference between right and wrong. 
Twenty-six other states use looser versions of the defense, while just four states have outlawed it altogether. Florida hopes to follow that latter pattern.
Despite this, the insanity defense is used in fewer than 1% of cases nationwide, and is successful in just a quarter of those attempts. That means roughly 30 Americans every year are declared not guilty by reason of insanity.
Harsh criticism
The measure ran into serious problems during its Monday afternoon stop. 
This included that the language would prevent judges from issuing a lesser sentence than usual if circumstances warrant and fails to mandate mental health treatment for unwell offenders. 
“It’s crap the way it’s written right now,” said Sen. Jason Pizzo, a former prosecutor and the sole independent lawmaker in the Legislature. The Hollywood NPA emphasized that he doesn’t believe the Legislature should take “the pen out of” judges’ hands. 
“I know where you’re trying to get … but we have some judges that … I would trust to find the appropriate remedy,” he added. Despite this, Pizzo voted yes because he believes the insanity defense needs reform and if Martin’s bill dies Monday, so would the issue.
Democratic Sen. Carlos Guillermo Smith, representing Orlando, took a different approach. He called the idea of removing judges’ ability to make special changes “unjust,” and a “public safety risk,” deriding the idea of putting a violent offender in prison with no available treatment options.
“We know what our prisons are dealing with. They are bursting at the seams, they are overcrowded, they are understaffed,” Smith said. “And this bill forces more people with serious mental illnesses deeper into a prison system that’s already failing.”
Joining Smith in his “no” vote were Democratic Sen. Mack Bernard from West Palm Beach and Miami Republican Sen. Ileana Garcia.
Where did it come from?
SB 1326 is a priority bill for Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier. In October, Uthmeier called for sweeping reforms to the state’s insanity defense, inspired by a 2015 case out of Kentucky.
Ronald Exantus stabbed a 6-year-old to death in Versailles, Kentucky. He was convicted of assault, but found not guilty by reason of insanity of murder. After serving less than half of his 20-year sentence, he was placed on mandatory supervised release.
Exantus moved to Florida, where he lived in Marion County near an elementary school and subsequently failed to register as a felon. So, Uthmeier in October led the charge to repatriate him to Kentucky.
“We cannot allow what happened in Kentucky to ever occur in Florida,” he said at the time.
Of note, Kentucky abides by a weaker version of the insanity defense than Florida, called the Model Penal Code. This allows defendants to be declared legally insane if they couldn’t tell right from wrong or could not control an impulse that led to the crime. 
Although 21 states use the MPC, it largely fell out of favor when the attempted Ronald Reagan assassin, John Hinckley Jr., was found not guilty by reason of insanity through it.
If Martin’s bill backed by the AG passes, it would replace the “right-wrong test,” with intent to commit a crime. This closely reflects a controversial, yet landmark, law out of Kansas.

(Danielle Prokop/Source NM)Days after federal agents shot and killed 37-year-old Alex Jeffrey Pretti, New Mexico Democrats on Monday morning said they’ll continue to protect immigrants across the state. One representative called on the governor to demand an end to all U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations.
Rep. Sarah Silva (D-Las Cruces) in a Sunday afternoon statement called on Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham to demand the federal government cease ICE operations and “de-escalate the situations we are seeing in Minnesota, New Mexico and other parts of the country.” In an interview with Source NM Monday, Silva said she was concerned that, without intervention, the Trump administration could similarly target New Mexico.
The U.S. Department of Justice in December sued New Mexico and five other states for allegedly failing to produce statewide voter registration lists. In Minnesota, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi in a letter to Gov. Tim Walz said state leaders could end the influx of federal agents, in part, by turning over voter data to the federal government.
“I am very concerned that New Mexico has already been targeted by the president with his comments around our Secretary of State and our voter rolls,” Silva said. “That, paired with Attorney General Bondi’s insistence that if Minnesota turns over their voter rolls, ICE will back off. That tells me that there’s a pattern that could put New Mexico next on the list.”
Lujan Grisham in a statement Sunday said she was “horrified by the killing of U.S. citizens by ICE agents in Minneapolis in recent days” and backed a statement from the Democratic Governors Association that said “these dangerous and reckless actions must come to an end.” The governor’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Silva expressed optimism, however, that criticisms of federal agents’ deadly use of force appear to be crossing party lines. She cited Chris Madel, a Minnesota attorney who on Monday posted a statement criticizing the wave of federal agents in Minneapolis and announced that he would no longer seek the state’s GOP nomination for governor.
As Silva left her office on the fourth floor of the Roundhouse, demonstrators gathered on the western steps of the Capitol building for Immigrant and Workers Day of Action. A bundled-up crowd waved pro-immigrant picket signs as the wind chill hovered in the high teens. New Mexico House Speaker Javier Martínez (D-Albuquerque) addressed the crowd with a promise to look out for immigrants in New Mexico, in part by passing House Bill 9, known as the Immigrant Safety Act, which would ban New Mexico counties and towns from signing onto immigration detention contracts.
“I will shout from the rooftops and demand that the federal government do the right thing. And I will also work like hell to make sure that every single policy passing is focused on…the rights of the least amongst us,” Martínez told Source NM.
He said he would happily back Silva’s call on the governor to act and said he hopes his constituents know that regarding the federal government’s immigration crackdowns, there is “no room in our state and there’s no room in this country for that type of hate.”
Nationally, some Republicans have called for an investigation into Pretti’s killing. In New Mexico, Senate Minority Leader Bill Sharer (R-Farmington) in an interview with Source NM said that “having somebody killed for any reason is tragic,” and said he believes “any death,” including those involving law enforcement officers, ought to be investigated. However, he said he doesn’t think people would die while protesting ICE if it weren’t for “organized rallies to interfere with their operations.”
“Why are people at risk today? Because we’ve got elected officials that are telling people to go out there and interfere with law enforcement,” he said. “They have a right to protest, I’m not saying that. But when you go out of your way to create a mob, that’s what causes problems.”
State Fair transformation project returns to Legislature
Lawmakers on the Senate Finance Committee on Monday morning had their first chance to weigh in on a massive State Fair grounds transformation project the Legislature set in motion last session.
The project has drawn widespread interest because it could move the New Mexico State Fair from its home of nearly 90 years and make way for proposed developments, including a new amphitheater, affordable housing and a public park. The potential benefits the investment could bring to the nearby International District, which has long been beleaguered by high rates of pedestrian deaths, crime and drug addiction, have also drawn particular interest.
Lawmakers this session will be asked to approve $92 million in bonds that will go toward acquiring property at the southeast end of the fairgrounds, as well as projects to improve pedestrian safety at two intersections. The legislation lawmakers approved last year empowers the board to issue up to $500 million in bonds for the transformation project. 
Republicans, including Sens. Steve Lanier of Aztec and Nicole Tobiassen of Albuquerque, urged presenters to bear in mind the cultural importance of the fair, particularly to rural farmers and kids in the 4-H program. 
Former Albuquerque Mayor Martin Chavez, who is spearheading the project on behalf of the governor, stressed that no decisions have been made thus far about the fair’s future.
“These are things we call ‘move-agnostic,’ Chavez said of the changes made possible through the bonds. “The issue of whether the fair goes or stays — a decision is not made. And that’s going to be a fun one for everybody involved.”
65 years in the making
In 1961 — while John F. Kennedy was being sworn in as president and the Beatles were playing their first show under that name at the Cavern Club in Liverpool — the State Legislature established the first University of New Mexico School of Medicine.
The Senate Health and Public Affairs Committee on Monday reviewed a measure, Senate Bill 6, to build a new UNM School of Medicine that would allow the school, which currently produces about 40% of the state’s practicing physicians, to double its enrollment. Lujan Grisham labeled that growth a priority in her State of the State address earlier in January.
Looking ahead
The House Consumer and Public Affairs Committee is scheduled on Tuesday afternoon to review four public safety bills, including House Bill 25. If enacted, HB25 would ban the sale or possession of a gun by an adult who was charged or sentenced for using a gun during a crime before they were 18, even if the person were not sentenced as an adult. Additionally, juvenile crime records involving firearms, which are typically sealed, would be available to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for the instant background check database. 
Tuesday is Future Farmers of America Day at the Roundhouse.

Lawmakers tweaked provisions that would have increased class size and omitted positions like school counselors from the funding model. This came after hours of testimony, much in opposition.
The post After pushback, legislative committee scales back proposed cuts to public education appeared first on WyoFile .","Over two days last week, teachers, parents, administrators, lobbyists and others took turns explaining to state lawmakers the problems they see with Wyoming’s evolving plan to fund public education. 
Many who testified before the Select School Recalibration Committee in Cheyenne began by pointing out the positive — the bill would give teachers a salary bump. 
But — and there were a lot of buts — the bill draft also raised classroom sizes, eliminated hundreds of full-time teacher roles, cut millions in education funding and failed to address issues like school nutrition and mental health counseling mandated by a 2025 court order, critics said. 
“Teachers aren’t fooled,” Laramie County educator Jen McKee said Friday. “We see the hidden tradeoff buried in this plan … This proposal pretends to invest in education while quietly dismantling the structures that keep Wyoming schools functioning.”
The complaints did not go unnoticed. The lawmaking panel ultimately made several amendments to the legislation, modifying it to create smaller class sizes, adjusting the minimum number of teachers in small schools and inserting a placeholder for mental health, nurses, counselors and related-support funding.
Lawmakers will still wait until next summer to nail down the specifics for funding those areas, said Sen. Bo Biteman, R-Ranchester, but the placeholder shows intention. 
“I think it’s wise that we put it in the bill draft to show as a placeholder, to show that we are serious about this,” Biteman said. 
He wasn’t the only lawmaker to emphasize the gravity of the job. The committee is tasked with the exhaustive and tedious work of assessing the state’s constitutionally mandated school funding model and making necessary updates. Recalibration, as it is known, is required every five years, and this time it is unfolding following a 2025 court decision that Wyoming was failing to properly fund its public schools. 
The committee, which has been chipping away at the process since early last summer, reconvened last week for a final time before the legislative session starts in February. Lawmakers, perhaps anticipating blowback, were quick to defend their work.

“We want everyone to know that we are working diligently on recalibration. It’s a tremendous undertaking,” Co-chair Scott Heiner, R-Green River, said, adding that the committee didn’t feel it could get through it all in the one-year timeframe. “We just don’t have a silver bullet to fix everything within one fell swoop, and it’s going to take time to hear all the testimony and do what’s best for our state and for the children of Wyoming.”
State-funded education 
The recalibration process is required every five years to ensure the Legislature fulfills its constitutional duty to “provide for the establishment and maintenance of a complete and uniform system of public instruction.” 
To do that, the state’s consultants, Picus, Odden and Associates, have been holding meetings with Wyoming educators, analyzing data and making recommendations over the course of many months.
Amid the minutiae and acronym-heavy language of education, several issues emerged early as topics of high interest for educators and lawmakers — including teacher pay, school resource officers, school nutrition programs and technology. Wyoming once offered stellar pay compared with neighboring states, educators, say, but that has slipped and with it districts’ ability to attract and retain high-quality teachers.
Many of those priorities overlap with areas identified in a February district court ruling that found the Wyoming Legislature violated the state’s constitution by underfunding public education and must amend that. The ruling, which the state is appealing, is the latest in a string of court cases that have further delineated the state’s education obligations.

In his 186-page order, Laramie County District Court Judge Peter Froelicher found the Legislature failed to properly fund the “basket of quality educational goods and services,” that the Wyoming Supreme Court in 1995 ordered lawmakers to set, update and fund every two years. 
The judge also found the state failed to properly adjust funding for inflation; failed to provide funding for adequate salaries for teachers and staff; and failed to provide sufficient funding for mental health counselors, school safety resource officers, nutritional programs and computers for students. Lawmakers also have failed to properly assess school buildings for “educational suitability,” and have allowed inadequate facilities to exist for too long without repair or replacement, he ruled.
In October, recalibration committee members advanced several recommendations for inclusion into the final bill. That included setting average weighted teacher salaries at roughly $70,000, a bump from the model’s current weighted average of under $60,000. It also, however, increased classroom sizes, mandated that districts use the state health insurance plan and tabled topics like mental health counselors for future study. 
Educators and others decried the latter decisions during the two days of testimony last week. 
Several district superintendents stressed the importance of Wyoming’s so-called “block grant model,” which gives districts flexibility on spending. 
“Some of these policies could inadvertently hurt all schools that rely on flexibility to meet essential needs,” Fremont County School District 2 Business Manager Amanda Ysen said. 
Administrators along with insurance industry representatives also came out strongly against a mandate to join the state’s health insurance plan, warning it would have negative consequences. There are good reasons that districts have not opted to join the plan in the past, said Sheridan County School District 1 Business Manager Jeremy Smith. The mandate represents “a massive government takeover of private industry,” he said. 
“Don’t waste anyone else’s time today testifying about how the state health insurance plan works, because it doesn’t work for us,” he said. “It won’t work for us, and that’s true for the other 47 districts who have not chosen it.”
Another major bone of contention was class sizes.

“In education, we know that the most important factor in a child’s learning is the teacher in the classroom, and that teacher’s ability to build relationships with students and spend time with students,” said Sheridan third-grade teacher and mother Megan Edmunds. “I’m deeply concerned about the proposed funding changes and the negative impact I feel they’ll have on student learning.”
Alex Petrino, a parent, counselor, Natrona County school board trustee and Wyoming Counseling Association member, warned lawmakers that mental health supports are essential in schools. 
“Educators, counselors and school teams are not asking for extras. They’re asking for basic capacity,” Petrino said. “And yet this committee is talking about taking away the very basic support that the students need where they spend most of their day. This is not recalibration, that’s destabilization.”
Taken together, Lincoln County School District 1 Superintendent Teresa Chaulk said, the bill’s proposals are harmful.  
“I respectfully urge the Legislature to align it with its stated priorities and to provide clear, transparent answers so that Wyoming students and teachers are not the unintended casualties of this recalibration process,” Chaulk said.
Bipartisan, unanimous
After hours of feedback last week, lawmakers began to propose changes aimed at quelling some of the public’s concerns. 
Sen. Wendy Schuler, R-Evanston, proposed an amendment to decrease the proposed fourth- through eighth-grade class size ratios from 25 students to one teacher down to 22:1, and kindergarten through third-grade from 16:1 to 15:1. That passed. 
“I think this will help the districts tremendously,” Schuler said. 
Rep. Mike Yin, a Teton County Democrat, proposed a complicated amendment that aimed to buffer his home district from negative impacts a regional cost adjustment would incur owing to Teton County’s unique economics. Rep. Chip Neiman, R-Hulett, proposed an amendment to increase minimum teachers for small schools. Rep. Ocean Andrew, R-Laramie, proposed limits on maximum school-population-reduction  amounts for schools. All passed.

Sheridan Republican Rep. Tom Kelly proposed striking the state health insurance plan mandate. 
“I have been a critic of fixing something I don’t think is broken, and in this case, I think the choice of health insurance is not a broken system,” Kelly said. 
Kelly’s motion was not seconded, meaning it didn’t have enough support for discussion or vote.  
Laramie Democrat Sen. Chris Rothfuss piggybacked on the topic by asking that the committee undergo more rigorous investigation into the insurance provision before pulling the trigger. His suggestion passed. 
The committee also tweaked provisions regarding investments and how often cost adjustments take place, and extended a state mental health grant by one year. 
Lawmakers unanimously advanced the recalibration bill, which Co-Chair Tim Salazar, R-Riverton, said wasn’t luck.
“We did a lot of work,” Salazar said. “There was a lot of give and take. There was compromise, and I so appreciate working on a bipartisan effort to have a unanimous vote.”
Not everyone was took such a rosy view. In a legislative update post on its website, the Wyoming Education Association, which filed the lawsuit that resulted in the 2025 court order, said the committee presented no substantial solutions to the concerns it heard.
“The big takeaway is that after days of testimony, with educators and advocates lined out the door to provide testimony, the committee offered no real fixes and instead dangled scraps from the table in an attempt to dissuade education professionals from standing up for themselves and their students,” the post read.
The bill still has a long way to go. The Wyoming Legislature convenes for its budget session on Feb. 9.

Both seem to be pushing slightly against their respective party lines.
Pretti, a Veterans Affairs nurse, was shot multiple times by immigration agents during a scuffle that erupted Saturday as he stepped between two women and an agent who was shoving them.
Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem claimed Pretti, who had a pistol holstered in his waistband, “attacked” officers and “brandished” his weapon. But video footage appears to contradict that accusation, and does not show Pretti ever holding the firearm. He had a permit to carry the pistol legally.

The shooting took place just over two weeks after another ICE officer shot and killed Minnesota resident Renee Good.
Republican Sen. Dave McCormick issued a statement on Sunday calling for a “full investigation” into the shooting that killed Pretti.
“As I have often said, I support the Border Patrol, ICE, and the critical work they do to enforce our laws. Irresponsible rhetoric and a lack of cooperation from Minnesota’s politicians are fueling a dangerous situation,” he wrote on the social media platform X. “I also agree with the [National Rifle Association] and others — we need a full investigation into the tragedy in Minneapolis. We need all the facts. We must enforce our laws in a way that protects the public while maintaining its trust. This gives our law enforcement officers the best chance to succeed in their difficult mission.”
The National Rifle Association, which has long supported primarily conservative politicians, objected to administration officials’ claim that Pretti was an innate danger for carrying a gun, and also called for a “full investigation” into the shooting.
McCormick did not respond to questions from the Pennsylvania Capital-Star about who should lead the investigation. 
Sen. John Fetterman, meanwhile, has been perhaps the staunchest supporter of the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement agenda among congressional Democrats.
While many in his party, including Democratic House members from Pennsylvania, were quick to criticize the shooting, Fetterman remained silent — until Monday.
“The operation in Minneapolis should stand down and immediately end. It has become an ungovernable and dangerous urban theatre for civilians and law enforcement that is incompatible with the American spirit,” Fetterman said in a statement. “As a very pro-immigration Democrat and Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Border Management, I believe our nation deserves a secured border and that we should deport all criminal migrants. I also believe there needs to be a path to citizenship for those hardworking families who are here.”

Fetterman also rejected calls from members of his party to “abolish ICE” entirely. And he addressed a movement in his caucus to vote against a coming appropriations bill over DHS funding, a move that could lead to a partial government shutdown.
“I’ve also spent significant time hearing many different positions on the funding bills and maintain that I will never vote to shut our government down, especially our Defense Department,” Fetterman’s statement said. “A vote to shut our government down will not defund ICE. DHS has $178B in funding from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which I did not vote for.”
Fetterman’s comments followed shortly after his wife, Gisele Fetterman, issued a statement of her own. 
“For more than a decade, I lived undocumented in the US,” she wrote in her first post on the social media platform X in almost a year. “Every day carried the same uncertainty and fear lived in my body – a tight chest, shallow breaths, racing heart. What I thought was my private, chronic dread has now become a shared national wound. This now-daily violence is not “law and order.” It is terror inflicted on people who contribute, love and build their lives here. It’s devastatingly cruel and unAmerican.”
Pennsylvania’s Democratic U.S.House members have largely taken a harder tack. Even before Pretti was killed, all seven Democratic representatives voted against a bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security. Those who spoke about their decisions cited concerns about a lack of oversight and accountability for the agency’s immigration enforcement officers. The bill passed the Republican-led chamber regardless.

Six of the Democrats — all but Rep. Chrissy Houlahan (D-06) — have co-sponsored articles of impeachment filed for Noem. Without Republican support, it’s unlikely to result in impeachment in the House or conviction in the Senate.
All ten of Pennsylvania’s Republican House members voted in favor of funding for DHS. A number have publicly supported ICE as well, even after the killing of Good in Minneapolis.
Rep. Ryan Mackenzie, a Republican who represents a swing district, has issued a statement calling for “a full and fair investigation” into Pretti’s shooting.
“Moving forward, oversight and cooperation need to be emphasized,” he wrote on X. But,  Mackenzie did not lay the blame squarely on ICE. He also noted, “officials in Minneapolis and even here in our own community have fanned the flames of division and disrespect for law enforcement.”
As it stands, the Department of Homeland Security has said they are conducting their own investigation, which has raised concerns of a possible coverup among local elected leaders and investigators, as well as Democrats.
According to state officials, law enforcement were blocked from the scene when initially responding to the shooting, even after obtaining a warrant. The Hennepin County Attorney’s office and Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension have filed a lawsuit to prevent the destruction of evidence. It claims witnesses were arrested by federal agents and cell phones that may have been used to record the shooting were seized.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/alexpretti-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-26 18:56:49.327235

The report from Doug Hoffer’s office describes a lack of systems for tracking energy reductions and two projects that cost the state hundreds of thousands more than they save.

Vermont is failing to meet and monitor its own longstanding goals to formally reduce the amount of energy the state consumes — laws and systems aimed both at reducing cost and impact on the environment — according to a recent report from the State Auditor’s Office.
At the center of auditor Doug Hoffer’s report are the shortcomings of two initiatives: the State Agency Energy Plan, which is an evolving document providing guidance since 1992 for state agencies to reduce energy consumption in government work, and the State Energy Management Program, which is run by the Department of Buildings and General Services to implement these energy efficiency projects in state buildings.
The Department of Buildings and General Services has not been measuring the state’s progress in meeting the goals outlined by the State Agency Energy Plan, despite its requirement to report on it every two years, as the auditor’s report outlined.  
It has no system to quantify how much transportation fuel state employees use and how much energy the state uses in the buildings it leases, and no established way to capture all the energy used across state buildings, Hoffer’s report cites.
Moreover, the auditor’s report found two instances where the BGS energy office actually lost money, rather than achieving energy efficiency savings with its project.
One lighting project the auditor cited at the Barre Courthouse cost $143,170 more than it is expected to save over the course of its lifetime, according to estimates by Efficiency Vermont, an organization that contracts with the state and aims to reduce energy use and cost — though the department’s internal estimates reported it would cost $72,749 more than it saved. 
A second lighting project, at the government office building at 133 State St. in Montpelier, will cost $550,687 more than its expected lifetime savings, the auditor’s report found, again highlighting a difference in its calculations and the department’s. The department originally stated the project would save more than $303,000 because it was partially paid for with funds from outside the State Energy Management Program. 
It’s part of a broader trend the auditor describes of miscalculation at the department. The Auditor’s Office compared Efficiency Vermont’s estimates of lifetime savings for 13 projects and found that the Department of Buildings and General Services overestimated savings by more than $1,666,500.

Moreover, the program may be leaving money on the table by not seeking out as many cost-saving projects as it historically has, the auditor report claims. Normally the program completes around five projects a year, the report cites, but over the last three fiscal years, that number has been only one or two a year. 
It’s likely due to staffing shortages, the auditor wrote. One or both of the energy project manager positions have been vacant since 2021, he noted. It’s likely not due to any shortage in potential projects, of which the program has identified more than 50, through energy audits from 2016 through 2024. Of those, the department only completed 15. 
The auditor concluded with a series of recommendations to address these shortfalls, including that the department adhere to the reporting requirements and develop a system for tracking energy use. Hoffer’s report also calls for the department to scale up the number of projects it does and for more coordination with Efficiency Vermont. 
Wanda Minoli, the commissioner of the Department of Buildings and General Services, responded to Hoffer’s findings in a letter added to the report. Minoli agreed with nearly all of Hoffer’s findings and offered a timeline for the department to implement the recommendations the report outlines.

Monday’s email from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services did not specify why the plan was canceled or whether it will be rescheduled, an employee said.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has reportedly canceled its plan to send some of its Vermont workers to Minnesota — for now.
According to an employee who works for the federal agency in one of its Vermont offices, USCIS notified workers by email Monday that its plan to temporarily deploy a few employees to Minnesota to assist the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, is canceled.
Last week, at least seven USCIS employees based in Vermont were tapped to be reassigned to Minnesota this month, according to an employee who spoke to VTDigger on the condition they not be named due to fear of retaliation.

Monday’s email from USCIS did not specify why the plan was canceled or whether it will be rescheduled, the employee said. The person was not one of those chosen for the temporary relocation.
A federal agency under the Department of Homeland Security that processes visa, asylum, citizenship and other immigration-related applications, USCIS has several offices across Vermont, including in Barre and Essex Junction. It does not typically engage in the kind of immigration enforcement ICE conducts.
The decision to send workers who mostly process paperwork to support ICE activity in Minneapolis would be “dangerous,” the employee said last week.
U.S. Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt., who was “outraged” last week and demanded answers from the Department of Homeland Security for sending Vermont workers to assist ICE in another state, welcomed the recent change.
“Given the aggressive ICE operations underway in Minnesota which have already led to deadly force and widespread fear, I raised serious concerns about sending Vermont USCIS employees into roles far outside their mission and training,” she said in a Monday press release. “I’m relieved those reassignments are no longer moving forward, and that these public servants can remain focused on helping people navigate the immigration system safely and lawfully.”
Escalating enforcement in the northern state of Minnesota, which borders Canada, has become the department’s largest immigration operation to date, according to Homeland Security.
Continued violence and heightened tensions in Minnesota have sparked anti-ICE protests across the nation and in Vermont since federal immigration agents in Minneapolis fatally shot 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good on Jan. 7 and then 37-year-old intensive care nurse Alex Pretti on Saturday.
Republican Gov. Phil Scott has since condemned the violence of federal immigration agents and called on President Donald Trump to change course in Minnesota.
Senators Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Peter Welch, D-Vt, both condemned ICE’s aggressive immigration tactics there.
“ICE is out of control, ignoring the law and our Constitution,” Sanders said in a press release Monday urging Congress to vote against additional funding for Homeland Security. 
Welch called for the “dire need for accountability” on the shootings of civilians in Minneapolis on MS NOW.
“When I talked to law enforcement officers here in Vermont, this is not policing that they at all respect. There has to be an investigation [into] the tactics of ICE,” he said, according to a press release Monday.
Meanwhile, more than a dozen clergy from across Vermont traveled to Minnesota last week to stand in solidarity with faith leaders against the violence, according to a Monday press release from Vermont Interfaith Action, a grassroots community organizing network.

(Photo by Nicole Girten/Daily Montanan)A Bozeman Republican has joined the 2026 Senate race in Montana, seeking to primary incumbent Sen. Steve Daines.
Trey Gregory, a political neophyte, is originally from Atlanta, Georgia and attended Texas Christian University. He has worked with hedge funds, in medical sales, and as a entrepreneur and consultant according to his campaign website.
He is running “not as a career politician, but as an outsider ready to be the authentic voice for all Montanans,” according to his campaign.
Republican Trey Gregory is campaigning to unseat incumbent Sen. Steve Daines.
In an email to the Daily Montanan, Gregory said he’s challenging Daines because he believes the incumbent has fallen short in delivering “tangible outcomes for everyday Montanans.”
“Healthcare is still a disaster – especially for seniors living on fixed incomes and for younger Montanans who don’t have the luxury of staying on a parent’s health plan,” Gregory wrote. “We talk about reform every election cycle, but people are still struggling to afford care, prescriptions, and coverage. That’s unacceptable.”
He also said that Montana’s land and natural resources are not being utilized to the fullest extent, saying that he believes there is work that can be done to forge “mutually beneficial partnerships” with the state’s Tribal Nations to responsibly increase resource development.
A pillar of Gregory’s campaign is a plan to entirely fund his efforts to unseat a sitting senator, which he says he has received criticism for, but he believes it’s what Montanans want to see.
“Find me one person who dislikes the fact that they don’t have to cough up funds to support the right person for the job,” Gregory wrote. “I am not fundraising for this campaign. I don’t believe Montanans should have to pay for representation or open their wallets just to support someone running for office.”
“I’m not taking anyone’s money, therefore I’m not beholden to anyone. That independence is intentional,” he said, adding that Daines has previously had “campaign finance controversies.”
Montana’s primary election will be held on June 2.

(Photo by Karsan Turner for Iowa Capital Dispatch) Young hunters could skip the in-person elements currently required by Iowa’s hunter safety program under a bill that advanced from a House subcommittee Monday. 
Currently, Iowa hunter education for those under the age of 17 requires either in-person classes or a combination of an approved online program, plus an in-person field day. 
House File 2020 was filed by Rep. Jason Gearhart, R-Strawberry Point, who explained that the in-person requirements were difficult to attend for some families — like his own — who live in more rural areas and have limited opportunities to attend.

Gearhart said to get around this, his children took an approved hunter safety course from the North Carolina Department of Natural and Cultural Resources, which does not have a field day requirement, but is accepted in Iowa through reciprocity. 
“So we accept it from other states, I just feel like we should offer the same and make the field day optional,” Gearhart said. 
The bill adds language that a hunter over the age of 11 may obtain a hunter safety certification from a “nationally recognized organization, including the national rifle association.” 
HF 2020 also said the requirement could be satisfied by an online course either offered or approved by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources. 
Tammie Krausman, DNR’s communications director, said the language pointing to “recognized organizations” could affect Iowa’s reciprocity with other states since certifications are issued by a government entity. 
Krausman said the field days are a time for hunters to learn about handling firearms, Iowa-specific laws and how to interact with landowners. 
“We want to make sure we have really good hunters out there with good ethics,” Krausman said. 
The department was not registered for or against the bill. 
Gearhart said the field days should be optional for hunters who have someone to show them how to shoot and be responsible hunters.
“I feel it’s more important for a parent, mentor or grandparent, someone to take that child out, teach them how to hunt versus one day at a field day,” Gearhart said.

The office also includes the Billings Office of the Custer-Gallatin National Forest (Photo by Darrell Ehrlick of the Daily Montana)A series of public opinion polls show strong opposition from western voters to President Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the Bureau of Land Management. 
According to the poll conducted by RABA Research and released by the Montana Wildlife Fund, 75% of voters in Montana oppose the nomination of Steve Pearce. 
Identical surveys conducted in Idaho and New Mexico showed similar results.
Pearce has been a polarizing pick to lead the nation’s largest federal land management agency, with opponents pointing to his record advocating for selling off federal lands, while mining and energy companies have enthusiastically supported his nomination. 
A former Congressman from New Mexico, Pearce sponsored legislation in Congress that would authorize land sales or exchanges with local governments, and he once wrote that the federal government does “not even need” most of the public land in the west. 
He also has strong industry ties as the former owner of an oilfield services company who still holds strong business connections. 
But there has been a concerted effort by outdoor-focused lobbying groups to draw a hard line on public land sales — a flashpoint in Congress last year — including funding polls to illustrate a dearth of public support for Pearce’s nomination. 
The Montana poll, which was conducted via online interviews with 503 voters from Jan. 16-18, found that 97% of respondents said public lands were important to the state and community, and that 84% said public lands should be “protected and kept in public hands.”
Nine in 10 respondents said they have concerns Pearce’s confirmation could dramatically change how Montanans use BLM land. 
Among the respondents, 40% self-identified as Republicans, while 27% self-identified as Democrats. 
Asked specifically about the state’s current U.S. Senators, who must vote to confirm the nominee to lead the BLM, 62% of respondents said they would have a more favorable opinion of their elected officials if they voted against Pearce. The poll had a calculated margin of error of around 4.4%. 
Frank Szollosi, director of the Montana Wildlife Fund which released the poll, said the results demonstrate Montanans’ desire to preserve their public lands and offer the state’s senators a “clear choice” about standing with the majority of Montanans. 
“You don’t keep public lands in public hands by putting someone in charge who wants to sell them off,” Szollosi said in a statement. “Steve Pearce has treated public lands like disposable real estate. Montana’s BLM lands provide world-class hunting for elk, deer, antelope, and upland birds. These places protect important wildlife habitat and should not be sold to the highest bidder.”
Montana Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy are both members of the newly-formed Senate Stewardship Caucus, a bipartisan coalition focused on public land access, land management policies and rural communities.
The two senators bucked their party in a vote last summer which blocked a provision in the One Big Beautiful Bill that would have included public land sales.
However, Daines is the only member of Montana’s congressional delegation who has issued a comment on Pearce’s nomination, which is awaiting approval by the Senate. 
“I knew Steve in the House days, and Steve is a great pick. And I particularly like the fact that it’s a Westerner,” Daines said in an interview. “I think it’s helpful when we have leaders in those important positions that come from the West, when they understand uniquely the challenges we face as it relates to federal land, state land, private land. And Steve Pearce has lived it and breathed it.”
Sheehy has not publicly stated whether he will support Pearce. 
In Montana and the two Dakotas, the BLM manages more than 8.3 million acres of federal land. Nationwide, the BLM oversees 245 million acres of federal land, along with 700 million acres of subsurface rights for extraction and energy development, putting the position directly in the crosshairs of energy developers and outdoor industry groups. 
Opponents to Pearce’s nomination have also held up his relationships with oil and gas companies as problematic. In a letter to the Senate Energy and National Resources Committee, dozens of environmental and conservation organizations pointed to his former ownership of an oilfield services company and extensive stock holdings in oil-related companies, as well as the more than $2 million he received in political donations from the industry as reasons he “has not merited the honor of stewarding” public lands. 
The RABA survey found that 80% of Montana voters said Pearce’s connections to the oil and gas industry is inappropriate. 
Identical surveys conducted in Idaho and New Mexico showed 76% and 71% of voters, respectively, oppose Peace’s nomination, and 69% and 60% of respondents saying they’d view their senators more favorably for opposing Pearce.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/BLM-office-I-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-26 18:56:49.327235

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Snowed in — unless you’re skiing: Vermont schools close as slopes fill up.","Winter storms blanketed Vermont with snow over the weekend and Monday, forcing schools to close, impacting road conditions and driving the masses to ski slopes. 
At least 8 inches of snow accumulation was reported across that state, with some locations reporting close to 15 inches over the course of the storm, according to the National Weather Services. 
Snow from the storm was lighter and more powdery because of the low moisture content, according to Adrianna Kremer, a meteorologist in the Burlington office of the weather service. Lighter snow poses less of a hazard to trees and power infrastructure, she added.
The weather service forecasted that additional snow storms would add 2 to 4 inches to the standing snow across most of the state by the end of Monday. Kremer did not expect much more snow in the coming week after Monday.  
Roads were still being cleared on Monday afternoon, according to the Vermont Agency of Transportation’s plow finder map. Few road closures or delays were reported on New England 511’s road conditions map as of Monday afternoon. 
Over the past weekend, school districts throughout the state preemptively announced closures.  
“Today was one of the best days for skiing and riding all year,” said Matt McCawley, a spokesperson for Smugglers’ Notch Resort, in an email. “Conditions right now are like Mary Poppins, practically perfect in every way.” 

McCawley said local ski pass holders came out in force after a foot of fresh powder covered the resort. Families took advantage of the school closures, he said, to get an extra day of skiing in. 
Killington Resort reported similar turnout as the storm dumped 14 inches of snow on the resort’s slopes by Monday morning, with an additional snow accumulation bringing its total to 17 inches by Monday afternoon. 
“Killington and Pico are seeing the best conditions of the season,” said Amy Laramie, a spokesperson for Killington Resort.
“Monday, the place was jumping,” McCawley said. “The joyous hoots and hollers coming from the woods over the silence this morning was amazing.”

It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
As with tens of thousands of fellow Mississippians since a winter storm struck during the weekend, the Hood family of Oxford was coping with the loss of electricity as best they could early Monday in their Northpointe neighborhood home about 2 miles north of Square.
Tucker and Leanna Hood, husband and wife and both lawyers, and their two young daughters were all bundled up and “camping in” around the gas fire logs in the living room. Mary Ann Hood, Tucker’s mom who was visiting from Brandon, was also sleeping under several blankets. They were all fairly cozy, until the home’s carbon monoxide alarm, which had converted from electric power to battery-operated, went off at 5:30 a.m.
Reynolds Hood, 2, stayed warm in the car.
“It woke me up, and I immediately turned off the gas logs,” Tucker Hood said.
The temperature was 7 degrees outside and it was going to get really cold, really fast inside the house. The Hoods’ oldest daughter, Reynolds, is 2. The youngest, Ida Orley, turned 5 months old Monday. The roads were covered in ice and snow.
What to do?
“We decided to go for the cars,” Tucker said. “Seemed like the best option.”
One problem: The car doors and locks were frozen. Using heated water from a gas stove, the Hoods were able to get in the family van and crank it up, along with Mary Ann Hood’s small SUV.
In the vehicles, they had all they needed, except space.
Mary Ann Hood posted on Facebook: ”I am sitting on my lovely heated seat and the warm air is blasting away. I am charging my phone while listening to channel 28 on SirrusXM or sometimes to my favorite playlist… I have three excellent books to choose from and just had a delicious breakfast of belVita Crunchy biscuits. I have on my best Patagonia long underwear, flannel PJ’s, puffy jacket and two pair of Ugg socks in my cozy Ugg boots (thanks to whoever gave me these wonderful socks for Christmas). …Thank goodness, I have a full tank of gas.”
Tucker, LeAnna and the kids were parked a few feet away in the family van. Reynolds, the 2-year-old, was watching a movie in the backseat.
And that’s where they spent the next five hours until a family friend arrived with a generator to use in the house. File this all under: All’s well that ends well.

Mark Kelly’s lawyers on Monday urged a federal judge to block the Defense Department from downgrading his retirement rank as a Navy captain and his pay for telling U.S. troops they aren’t required to follow illegal orders. Paul J. Fishman wrote in a 35-page filing that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s attempt to punish Kelly for appearing in the video alongside other members of Congress violates several constitutional rights.  “As a decorated combat veteran and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Kelly is deeply committed to the necessity of good order and discipline in the armed forces,” Fishman wrote. “He asks this Court to reinforce, not degrade, those principles. “His speech—simply reminding servicemembers of their fundamental obligation not to follow unlawful orders— promotes good order. And discipline does not demand silence —particularly from those no longer serving on active duty.”Fishman firmly rejected the Department of Justice’s assertion in a brief filed last week that the federal court system has no authority over the Defense Department’s actions in this instance. “Defendants begin from the premise that questions of ‘military discipline’ lie beyond judicial review,” Fishman wrote. “Their claim that this Court is ‘not permitted to address’ Senator Kelly’s challenge disregards reams of precedent reviewing military disciplinary actions and demands an untenable level of deference.”Senior Judge Richard J. Leon, who was nominated to the bench by President George W. Bush, had scheduled a hearing on the issue for Wednesday, but postponed that until Feb. 3 due to the snowstorm. Hegseth pursues penaltiesDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced earlier this month that he had started the process to downgrade Kelly’s retirement rank and pay, writing in a social media post that his “status as a sitting United States Senator does not exempt him from accountability, and further violations could result in further action.”The Defense Department letter of censure to Kelly alleged that his participation in the video undermined the military chain of command, counseled disobedience, created confusion about duty, brought discredit upon the Armed Forces and included conduct unbecoming of an officer. The video at the center of the debate featured Kelly, Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin, Colorado Rep. Jason Crow, Pennsylvania Reps. Chris Deluzio and Chrissy Houlahan, and New Hampshire Rep. Maggie Goodlander, all Democrats with backgrounds in the military or intelligence community.They said that Americans in those institutions “can” and “must refuse illegal orders.”“No one has to carry out orders that violate the law or our Constitution. We know this is hard and that it’s a difficult time to be a public servant,” they said. “But whether you’re serving in the CIA, in the Army, or Navy, or the Air Force, your vigilance is critical.”Kelly lawyer’s argumentsFishman wrote in his brief that the Trump administration is asking the court to “embrace a novel rule” regarding the First Amendment: “that retired military veterans have no constitutional protection for their speech whenever the Secretary of Defense—in his sole discretion and without even identifying all of the speech at issue—concludes that it ‘risks undermining military discipline and good order.’” The Justice Department's brief from last week, he wrote, erroneously argued that retired military officers can legally face punishment for speaking out against Defense Department policies they oppose.“From Alexander Hamilton denouncing President Adams’s fitness to command during the Quasi-War, to modern episodes in which retired generals publicly called for Secretary Rumsfeld’s resignation over the Iraq War, retired officers have long participated forcefully in public debate over military policy,” Fishman wrote. “The same is true today: retired servicemembers, including Members of Congress, have openly criticized presidential decisions ranging from the Afghanistan withdrawal to vaccination requirements,” he added. “Many continue to serve with distinction as legislators, governors, and federal judges. Yet against that backdrop, Defendants assert the power to limit the First Amendment rights of more than two million retired servicemembers, all without judicial review.”",,,,2026-01-26 18:56:49.327235

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The state of Minnesota and the Twin Cities appeared before a federal judge Monday and asked the court to stop the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement surge, arguing the chaos of recent weeks and the administration’s threats are unconstitutional.
Minnesota, Minneapolis and St. Paul on Jan. 12 sued the Trump administration, alleging that the influx of federal agents under the Trump administration’s “Operation Metro Surge” harms Minnesota’s police powers and violates state sovereignty. These rights are guaranteed under the 10th Amendment.
U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden, heard arguments from both the state and federal government Monday but didn’t issue a ruling. Menendez asked skeptical questions of both sides, and though she said the case was “extremely important,” she didn’t issue a ruling Monday.
The state submitted voluminous filings to bolster their case, documenting widespread use of racial profiling, arbitrary arrests and warrantless searches of private residences.
The Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in Minnesota has led to three shootings by immigration officers in three weeks, with two ending in death.
But most of the hearing was dedicated to abstract legal arguments, in particular the claim from the plaintiffs that the federal operation is violating the state’s sovereign rights under the 10th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.
Brian Carter, an attorney for the state, said the government is using Operation Metro Surge to “coerce” the state into acceding to its policy goals. Under the 10th Amendment’s anti-commandeering doctrine, the federal government cannot coerce states to enforce federal laws.
As evidence, Carter pointed to a letter U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi sent to Gov. Tim Walz in the wake of the killing of Minneapolis resident Alex Pretti by federal agents on Saturday. In that letter, Bondi suggested the Administration would scale back its immigration enforcement if Walz would release the state’s unredacted voter rolls, scrap all “sanctuary policies” designed to protect immigrants and share the state’s records of Medicaid and supplemental food assistance.
Carter referred to the missive as a “shakedown letter, a ransom note,” likening it to a threat from a mobster to burn down a restaurant. As further evidence of improper motive, he pointed to a tweet from President Donald Trump in which he stated that Minnesota’s “day of retribution” was coming.
Brian Carter argued that the Trump administration’s actions are “outrageously unlawful.”
“In the 250 years of this nation’s, of this republic’s history, we have never seen a federal government attack states based on personal animosity,” Carter said.
Menendez noted that the U.S. Constitution, federal law and “an awful lot of history support significant federal power around immigration.”
Brantley Mayers, an attorney with the Department of Justice’s Civil Division, urged Menendez to reject the state’s 10th Amendment arguments which, he said, “turns federalism on its head.” He did not rebut any of the factual claims made by the plaintiffs.
Mayers said Minnesota’s request to end Operation Metro Surge was “staggering.”
Mayers argued the Trump administration’s goal was to enforce federal immigration law. Because of Minneapolis’ so-called “sanctuary” policies, more federal agents are needed in the Twin Cities to enforce federal law.
Menendez appeared skeptical of this argument, noting that Chicago also has sanctuary policies. The federal government sent 400 immigration agents there, compared to Minnesota’s 3,000 plus, she said. She grilled the federal government’s attorney on whether Operation Metro Surge was really just about immigration enforcement or whether coercion was a factor.
“Is the executive trying to achieve a goal through force that it cannot achieve through the courts?” Menendez asked Mayers.
Mayers said no. “There’s nothing to back up this claim that we are here for another reason,” he said.
After the hearing, Attorney General Keith Ellison expressed optimism that the state would prevail.
“Once they decided it was retribution, they crossed a line,” Ellison said, referring to Trump’s tweet and Bondi’s demand letter. “At the end of the day, this is coercion and federal overreach.”
In a separate case earlier this month, Menendez ruled that the federal government could not retaliate against or detain people who are engaging in peaceful and unobtrusive protest.

“The good news is the public worked with us,” he said. “They stayed off the roads to give PennDOT an opportunity to get out and clear the roads, and so we really want to thank the public.”
Some schools, businesses, and government offices remained closed or delayed opening on Monday. The coroner’s office reported three people died while attempting to clear snow in Lehigh County, where about a foot fell.

“The team included PennDOT, our partners at the state police and [Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency], the public, the trucking community,” Carroll said.
The winter storm moved into the northeast early Sunday morning after spreading snow and ice from Colorado across the deep south to Virginia. By the time it ended early Monday, most places across Pennsylvania had received between 8 and 12 inches of snow. The greatest accumulation reported to the National Weather Service was nearly 25 inches in Jennerstown, Somerset County.
While more than 500,000 homes and businesses remained without power across the south, Pennsylvania was spared the worst of the storm’s freezing rain, which brought down trees and power lines in other states.

(Photo by Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)A ballot measure that would change voter-approved legislative term limits faces a challenge before the North Dakota Supreme Court.
In a lawsuit filed last week, former Minot lawmaker Sen. Oley Larsen and Grand Forks County commissioner Terry Bjerke claim the Legislature violated the state constitution by creating the measure.
Under an amendment passed by voters in 2022, state lawmakers can serve no more than eight years in the House and eight years in the Senate.
Last year, the statehouse narrowly approved Senate Resolution 4008, which aims to give lawmakers more freedom over how they spend their terms. The resolution creates a ballot measure to allow lawmakers to serve up to 16 years in either chamber. It would also make it so partial terms don’t count against term limits.
The measure will appear on the November election ballot, according to the Secretary of State’s website.
Both Bjerke and Larsen were members of the sponsoring committee to put the term limits amendment on the ballot, according to the lawsuit. The ballot measure passed with 63% approval from voters.
In the lawsuit, filed with the North Dakota Supreme Court, Larsen and Bjerke argue that the resolution violates powers reserved for the public in the state constitution and should not be allowed to go to the ballot. The lawsuit names both the Legislature and the North Dakota Secretary of State’s Office as defendants.
The 2022 constitutional amendment, Article XV, mandates that the Legislature “shall not have authority to propose an amendment to this constitution to alter or repeal” the term limits it establishes.
Term limits changes revived for possible statewide vote in North Dakota

Larsen and Bjerke state in the suit that regardless of that provision, another section of the constitution under Article III says that the Legislature must reach a two-thirds majority vote in each chamber to change constitutional amendments within seven years of their effective dates. Senate Resolution 4008 did not meet this threshold, the plaintiffs claim, since it passed the Senate by a 24-23 vote and the House by a vote of 53-39.
If the high court doesn’t act, “an obviously unconstitutional ballot measure will be before the North Dakota electors in November — wasting taxpayer dollars on a plainly unconstitutional referendum,” they write.
An attorney for the plaintiffs, Jesse Walstad, did not return a call seeking comment on Monday.
Lawmakers who supported the resolution have said the Legislature’s ability to put constitutional amendments on the election ballot is protected elsewhere in the constitution. Article IV states that the House and Senate only need to clear a simple majority to refer constitutional measures to the ballot.
“The constitution already says that the Legislature can recommend amendments to the constitution through legislative action,” said Sen. Michael Dwyer, R-Bismarck, the primary sponsor of Senate Resolution 4008.
Legislative Council Director John Bjornson said the Legislature has always taken the position that the two-thirds requirement in Article III doesn’t apply to resolutions.
“The resolution isn’t amending or repealing anything, it’s simply placing on the ballot a measure for the people to have the opportunity to do so,” he said.
Rep. Austen Schauer, R-West Fargo, in testimony on the House floor in April acknowledged that the resolution would likely be challenged in court, but that a lawsuit could help make sense of the conflicting language in the constitution.
“This bill may be useful in terms of having the North Dakota Supreme Court step in and decide if it is constitutional or unconstitutional to limit legislative authority,” he said.
Secretary of State Michael Howe said that while he’s not surprised the resolution is being challenged in court, his agency had a duty to approve the proposal for the ballot. He said state law and previous North Dakota Supreme Court rulings indicate it isn’t the role of his agency to determine whether or not a ballot measure is constitutional.
“We’re just required to perform the certification regardless of the content,” he said.
The Legislature and Secretary of State’s Office have yet to file a response in the suit.
Legislative Management will meet Tuesday to discuss the case.
Bjerke and Larsen in the lawsuit say the case should immediately be heard by the Supreme Court because ballot measures to change the constitution are of “substantial public importance,” because the Supreme Court has a responsibility to settle questions about the Legislature’s constitutional powers and because the general election is quickly approaching.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)A bill that would require the state of Florida to develop and maintain a centralized database to provide individuals with felony convictions the information to determine whether they are eligible to have their voting rights restored moved through its first committee stop on Monday.
The proposal (SB 132), sponsored by Sen. Tina Polsky, D-Boca Raton, comes more than seven years after Floridians approved a constitutional amendment to restore the voting rights of felons who had completed their sentences. However, the Legislature passed a requirement that they needed to pay off all their financial obligations imposed by a court to fully restore their voting rights.
That legislative measure limited the pool of Floridians who were initially thought to be eligible to vote when the measure was approved by more than 65% of the voters in November 2018. It also create doubt and in some cases resulted in people being arrested after believing that in fact they were eligible to vote.
Polsky’s legislation would require the Florida Commission on Offender Review to create a website no later than July 1, 2029, to provide individuals who have been disqualified from voting based on a felony conviction (other than murder or a felony sexual offense) “clear instructions” about getting their voting rights restored and to register to vote.
Starting in late 2024, the Division of Elections created a way for people with felony convictions who were unsure about their voting eligibility to request an advisory opinion from the Florida Division of Elections. That process evolved as part of a legal settlement after the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition dropped its 2023 lawsuit against Gov. Ron DeSantis, Secretary of State Cord Byrd, and other Florida election officials.
Polsky’s bill passed unanimously in the Senate Criminal Justice Committee.
A companion bill (HB 273) has been filed in the House by Rep. Felicia Robinson, D-Miami Gardens.
Meanwhile, a related measure (SB 748) sponsored by Sen. LaVon Bracy Davis, D-Ocoee, was also approved by the Senate committee on Monday. Her bill would require that sentencing scoresheets include a notice informing defendants about the effect of their sentences on their voting rights. It would be required that defendants must receive a copy of the scoresheet containing this notice before sentencing. (A companion bill — HB 467 — has been filed in the House by Miami Democratic Rep. Ashley Gantt).
“Providing this notice helps Floridians understand this status under the Constitution, and it helps avoid confusion and unintentional violations that can occur when individuals misunderstand their eligibility,” said Davis. “It’s about clarity, transparency, and making our system work as intended.”
Sen. Carlos Guillermo Smith, D-Orlando, applauded both bills.
“This is exactly the direction that we should be heading in — transparency, information — making sure folks understand what voting rights or what other rights are implicated based on some of these convictions that they have and can have them all restored, hopefully in theory, once they have served their time and been in compliance with Florida law,” he said.
Versions of these bills have been advocated for in the past by Democrats without ever getting a hearing, so, in that respect, the committee’s approval on Monday was a small victory in the battle for such legislation. The question is how far supporters can advance during this legislative session. Both bills have two more stops in the Senate. Their House companions have yet to be heard in any committee.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/D1edi1VX4AMOWFK-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-26 17:57:36.200737

(Image courtesy U.S. Forest Service)The Montana Environmental Information Center says that Lincoln County has failed to provide documents requested under the state’s right-to-know laws related to the county’s push to change pollution standards in Lake Koocanusa.
MEIC’s complaint, filed before Lincoln County District Court on Jan. 23, stems from a rule-making petition the county submitted to the state last summer seeking a change to the site-specific standards for the element selenium in the transboundary lake.
The current site-specific standard of acceptable concentration is 0.8 micrograms of selenium per liter of water, much more stringent than the federal threshold of 1.5 micrograms per liter, which is the level the county asked the state to consider.
The state Department of Environmental Quality denied the petition — in part because the International Joint Commission, an organization created by the United States and Canada to resolve disputes related to shared waterways, has convened a board of experts to study the issue of transboundary pollution in the Elk-Kootenai River Basin.
MEIC said they filed the lawsuit to ensure the state constitution is being followed.
“We’re in the business of holding our elected officials and corporations accountable,” Derf Johnson, deputy director of MEIC, said in a press release. “When our public resources are offered up as sacrifice to a foreign, for-profit corporation with a history of polluting and leaving a mess, we definitely want to know what happened behind the scenes.”
Lake Koocanusa has long been the center of a fight between environmental groups and industry backers over the leeching of the element selenium into the Elk River in British Columbia from Canadian coal mines. The mining pollution flows downstream into Koocanusa, where concentrations are documented to have quadrupled in the last three decades and threaten aquatic species, including West Slope Cutthroat Trout and White Sturgeon.
While a U.S. Geological Survey study published in 2023 linked the expansion of mining operations with increased selenium and nitrate concentrations over decades, and indicated selenium concentrations in Koocanusa had not met Montana’s site-specific standards since 2020, the owners of the mining operations have pushed for moderating the selenium standard in Lake Koocanusa.
Teck Resources Limited, former owner of Elk Valley Resources, which operates the Canadian coal mines, submitted the same petition as Lincoln County back in 2021, and the current owner, international mining conglomerate Glencore, has continued to dispute the strict standard.
Following Lincoln County’s submission last summer, MEIC and representatives of other environmental organizations pushed back against the petition, saying there is no scientific basis to weaken the standard and pointed to potential impacts to Montana’s robust recreation-based economy that includes a $149 million contribution from boating and fishing.
According to court documents, a few days after the petition was submitted, MEIC submitted a records request to Lincoln County for all documents related to the petition, but has not received any response.
“Lincoln County’s actions could best be characterized as ‘radio silence,'” court filings state. “It has not provided the requested information, nor has it provided a reason for its inaction.”
In the lawsuit, MEIC alleges the county is violating its right to know under the state constitution and public records laws, and seeks a court order forcing Lincoln County to provide the requested information.
Lincoln County Commissioner Neil Duram told the Daily Montanan last year that he had met with representatives of both the Montana Department of Environmental Quality and Elk Valley Resources to discuss the pollution issue. He also said the mining company had given a presentation challenging the science of the existing standard, and offering more recent studies that could be used to argue for a more lenient rule. odd – i just was mentioning him in a story – I didn’t realize you could be both county commish and state rep – is that right? we should mention he’s also state rep
This filing is the latest in a long line of legal disputes orbiting the lake’s selenium standard and the rulemaking process.
There is an ongoing lawsuit between the Montana Board of Environmental Review – a quasi-judicial body that handles environmental permit disputes — Teck, and Lincoln County, and a multitude of environmental groups led by the Montana Environmental Information Center seeking to keep the stronger pollutant standard in place, after the review board overturned the standard. In another suit, MEIC sued the Montana Department of Justice for denying access to communications between Teck and the state.

The cost to house those state inmates  in county jails and in out-of-state facilities has risen sharply. (Photo by Mia Maldonado/Idaho Capital Sun)Idaho’s rising rates of incarcerating state prisoners in county jails and out of state have led to skyrocketing costs. The price for operating the state’s 10 prisons are also on the rise, according to the correctional agency director. 
Idaho Department of Correction Director Bree Derrick presented the agency’s budget on Monday to the state budget writers on the Legislature’s Joint Finance-Appropriation Committee. 
“The inflationary cost that we’ve experienced related to inmate supplies has been pretty staggering, so we have some examples where basic things – toilet paper, paper towels – going up between 25% and 26% over the last two or three years,” Derrick said. “So that for us is a huge impact. We also have a population spike that we haven’t seen before at the Department of Correction.” 
Under the governor’s recommendations, the agency’s budget for county and out-of-state placement of people who are incarcerated is expected to grow just over 69% from the current fiscal year. 
 How much does it cost to house Idaho inmates when state prisons are full? 

Gov. Brad Little in his proposed budget recommended the state pay a supplemental payment of $15.2 million in the current fiscal year to cover the difference in what was allocated last year to cover costs of housing people who are incarcerated outside of state prisons, compared to the projected actual costs. Little’s recommendation was based on the incarcerated population numbers through November. 
Little’s budget also calls for $25 million in additional spending in the next fiscal year, which begins July 1. 
As of Jan. 1, there were 10,023 total people incarcerated by the Department of Correction, according to the agency’s population dashboard. The in-state capacity is just over 8,200, according to the dashboard. The state operates 10 prisons.

The available population data shows the inmate population has remained the state’s capacity since 2019, when the data starts. The capacity has increased from around 7,100 in 2019 through a number of projects. 
When the state prisons are full, people who are incarcerated serve their terms either in county jails or out-of-state facilities. 
The reimbursement rate to county jails is set in state code at $55 per resident per day for the first seven days of confinement, and then $75 per resident per day thereafter. The state pays an additional $2.50 per resident per day for medical costs. 
The reimbursement for out-of-state facilities is set by contract. The average daily rate per resident is projected to be about $83 for these contracts, according to the legislative budget book. 
Derrick said Monday that the state’s contract with a facility in Arizona costs the state about $85 per resident per day. 
Based on the October populations, the agency projected the state would house 991 inmates in county jails monthly, and 761 residents in out-of-state facilities monthly. The governor’s budget included higher costs than the agencies’, based on more up-to-date data available through November. The governor’s updated cost projection didn’t include exact numbers of residents. 
The expected total cost of incarcerating people outside of state prisons is expected to be around $51 million.

 Why is the Idaho prison population rising? 

Rep. Brooke Green, D-Boise, on Monday asked what was behind the state’s unprecedented prison population spike. 
Derrick said the agency has recently been trying to determine this. She said the number of people entering facilities has grown, while the rate at which people are released has remained stable. She said that the average length of stay at a facility also seems to be remaining largely unchanged. 
“But there hasn’t been one trend that has really stood out to us,” Derrick said. 
Sen. Phil Hart, R-Kellogg, said “each year the Idaho Legislature creates a new crime, or proves an enhancement or passes some kind of mandatory minimum legislation.” 
He asked if the department had a model to predict the impact of those legislative decisions. 
Derrick said the agency uses a mathematical model to try and predict the impact. Hart also asked how Idaho’s incarceration rate compared to neighboring states. 
Derrick said the state’s rate of incarceration is high compared to national averages and to Idaho’s neighboring states. In 2023, Idaho had the fifth highest rate of incarceration in the nation, at 490 people in prison per 100,000 residents, according to U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics reported by USA Facts. 
Montana’s rate that year was 438, and Wyoming’s was 378. Oregon and Washington’s rates were much lower, at 291 and 181 respectively. 
Senate Minority Leader Melissa Wintrow, D-Boise, said she would encourage legislators to look at more programs that may incentivize good behavior in facilities with early release and other policies that may reduce prison populations. 
 IDOC nearly had to furlough entire staff to comply with governor’s budget holdbacks 

The Idaho Department of Correction, known as IDOC, would have had to temporarily furlough its entire staff to comply with mid-year budget holdbacks ordered by the governor earlier this year, according to its director. 
In August, the state faced projected revenues that were $39.1 million behind what had been budgeted for, the Idaho Capital Sun reported at the time. In response, Gov. Brad Little signed an executive order calling on all agencies outside of K-12 public schools to immediately cut their current fiscal year budgets by 3%.
Little’s office told agencies in September to extend those reductions into the next fiscal year and beyond.  
“We got to a place where we were very seriously considering furloughing all of our staff, so 2,200 staff, most of whom are law enforcement officers in the state, which I don’t think is good for public safety,” Derrick said. “But those are the real types of decisions we’re being faced with at this time.” 
The governor exempted IDOC’s budget from the cuts to avoid the mass furloughs. However, the agency is still working to reduce its budget where possible. 
She said planned upgrades through a software meant to track and help reduce recidivism have been slowed. Other software has been reduced or eliminated. 
The governor’s recommendation for the agency’s entire budget — which includes its divisions for management, community corrections, and medical services — totals $388 million of state general funds. The request is about 10% above what was provided by the Legislature last year.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)PIERRE — Families of students who qualify for reduced-price school meals would no longer have to pay a portion of the cost if a bill advancing to its next step in the South Dakota Legislature becomes law.
“The government already plays a role in education,” said Rep. Kadyn Wittman, D-Sioux Falls, who introduced the bill. “When the state mandates education, it takes on a shared responsibility to ensure that students can succeed while they are there.”
The bill would require $601,000 of state funding annually to reimburse schools, according to Grant Judson from the state’s Bureau of Finance and Management. Students whose families meet income qualifications for the reduced-price program currently pay 30 cents for breakfast and 40 cents for lunch. The rest of the cost is covered by the federal government, which also covers the cost of free meals for students whose families meet stricter income limits.
More than a third of the state’s public school students receive free or reduced-price school meals, according to the South Dakota Department of Education.
The federal government requires that students in the program receive a meal, regardless of whether they have incurred meal debts.
“Even if a child receives a meal, that meal still has to be paid for, the food still must be purchased, the staff must prepare it, and the cost has to come from somewhere,” Wittman told the committee. “Right now, that burden is being covered through a patchwork of local fundraising, philanthropy and the generosity of faith communities and nonprofits.”
Sen. Brandon Wipf, R-Huron, said the cost of the bill seems like “pennies compared to the enormous investment that we make in education.” Other supporters of the bill said students from lower-income families shouldn’t have to worry about meal debt.
The House Education Committee voted 13-1 on Monday at the Capitol in Pierre to send the bill to the House Appropriations Committee for further consideration.

(Photo by Minnesota House Public Information Services)Gov. Tim Walz on Monday issued an executive order to implement weapons screening at the Minnesota State Capitol, using executive authority to bolster security because the split Legislature is unlikely to do so.
Walz’s executive order comes after an advisory legislative committee on Capitol security earlier this month issued a set of recommendations that include the implementation of weapons screening.
“Government cannot function effectively when elected officials fear for their safety. In the last year, Minnesota has seen horrific acts of political violence,” Walz said in a statement. “This executive order will make the Capitol – the central seat of Minnesota’s state government – safer, ensuring the people’s house remains open, welcoming and secure.” 
The weapons screening must be in place by the start of the 2026 legislative session — Feb. 17, according to the executive order.
The executive order is silent about whether people with a permit to carry a gun will still be allowed to do so. But Bob Jacobson, Department of Public Safety commissioner, indicated in a statement that the measure will “ensure what is allowed today is allowed after implementation,” i.e., permit holders will be allowed to carry their firearms — an important concession to Republicans.  
The Advisory Committee on Capitol Area Security has held monthly meetings since the June assassinations of Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband. The Democratic-Farmer-Labor-led committee recommended the Capitol implement weapons screenings despite opposition from the two Republicans on the committee, Rep. Jim Nash of Waconia and Sen. Warren Limmer of Maple Grove.
Minnesota Republicans, including the two Republicans on the committee, have been clear they will oppose any restrictions on their right to carry.
Officials did not say how much the weapons screening will cost. The Department of Public Safety, which is in charge of installing the weapons screening, said it’s working through the details.
“We will share more information as soon as it is available, well in advance of implementation, so visitors, staff and legislators can plan for a smooth and predictable experience at the Capitol,” Jacobson said in a statement.
Minnesota’s Capitol has historically been one of the most open in the nation and regularly draws tens of thousands of visitors a year, both tourists and people who want to engage with the legislative process. 
For months, the officials within the Walz administration have said they wanted the weapons screening measures to be approved by the Legislature. But Walz’s executive order signals the governor knew Republicans, who share control of the Minnesota House, won’t pass them. 
Meanwhile, the DFL-controlled state Senate announced the upper chamber would begin screening visitors who enter the small Senate gallery, and implementing a ban on firearms and dangerous weapons, including for gun permit holders. The exceptions are licensed police and the sergeant-at-arms. 
The Minnesota State Patrol last year hired The Axtell Group to conduct a third-party assessment of the Capitol’s security measures. Its top recommendation was to implement weapons screening procedures.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/596812282_1290057636490087_3676829915866584955_n-1024x677.jpg,,,2026-01-26 17:57:36.200737

(Photo by Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Proposed legislation in Kansas cracks open state guidelines to allow courts to sentence any kid deemed an offender to juvenile prison, reversing a decade-old effort to treat youth incarceration as a last resort.
Ten years ago, Kansas judges were allowed to sentence kids to juvenile prison regardless of their level of offense. That could include kids adjudicated of a misdemeanor, a low-level or first-time offender, or a low-risk youth. House Bill 2329 is stocked with modifications to the juvenile justice system, and one seeks a return to looser sentencing rules.
Changes to state law in 2016 moved the system toward a rehabilitative model, saving incarceration for high-risk cases and prioritizing prevention and intervention. Megan Milner, deputy secretary for the Kansas Department of Corrections, said Monday she remembers the formerly broad approach to incarcerating children.
“At one point, prior to the reforms in Kansas, we were still sentencing youth who were misdemeanors to the custody of the secretary and the juvenile correctional facility,” Milner said. “Eventually, kids who were adjudicated of things like disorderly conduct were pushed deeper into the system because of some of the statutes that we had.”
Senate lawmakers considered the changes at hearings Thursday and Monday. In addition to broadening sentencing guidelines, the bill would double the limit on detention time for youths, increasing the maximum from 45 days to 90 days. That limit does not apply to kids adjudicated of more serious crimes.
The bill also requires kids who are found to be in possession of a firearm, regardless of whether or not they use it, to serve time in juvenile prison. It mandates courts send to juvenile prison kids deemed high-risk or moderate-risk if they are chronic offenders. And it requires the corrections department to contract with secure youth residential facilities to add between 35-45 beds to avoid placing kids who are in corrections department custody in a foster home.
While foster care providers and law enforcement lined up Thursday to support the bill, the corrections department, advocacy groups and the state’s Juvenile Justice Oversight Committee expressed opposition at a Monday hearing.
Most were interested in addressing a specific population of kids 10 years and older who cross over between the juvenile justice and foster care systems. Those kids have some of the highest risks and needs in each system, but groups differed on which solutions can mitigate the risks and meet kids’ needs.
HB 2329 was put forth as one of the solutions.
The bill was framed as a way to give judges more discretion, but that may not actually be the case. Judges are already able to override rules attached to certain eligibility assessments, such as high, moderate or low risk, to allow for flexibility in deciding where to place kids.
Khavayi Tsimonjela, a youth intern for the Wichita juvenile justice advocacy organization Progeny, said judges are uniquely equipped to gauge a child’s needs, and the state should avoid investing in systems known to be ineffective.
“Accountability does matter,” Tsimonjela said, “but science shows that accountability does not have to be punitive to be effective.”
The bill treats firearm possession and use the same, she said, but there are levels of offenses for a reason.
 
Uncertain progress
Rep. Bob Lewis, a Garden City Republican, introduced the bill last February. The House approved it a month later in a 106-16 vote. It was left behind by the end of the 2025 legislative session, but the Senate Judiciary Committee revived it and plans to work the bill Tuesday to prepare it for a potential Senate vote.
Those who testified Monday against the bill feared it would undo a decade of progress. But those who supported the bill said Thursday that the bill could fill in major gaps that strain service providers
The set of 2016 reforms came up repeatedly in the hearing. Senate Bill 367 expanded community-based programs for justice-involved youths, placed limits on which kids are detained and reduced probation times for misdemeanor and low-level felony crimes. Since its passage, one of the state’s two youth prisons closed and youth prison populations have fallen from 347 kids in detention in 2010 to 110 kids as of July 2025, according to corrections department data.
Milner, deputy secretary of the corrections department, said Monday that components of the bill were counterproductive and “may have a negative impact on youth, families and communities.”
One piece of the bill, expanding reliance on out-of-home placements, which can include secure residential facilities such as group homes or detention centers, is associated with bad outcomes, Milner said.
Incarceration is often treated as a last resort, and Milner said placements should be reserved for youths posing an immediate threat to public safety and at the greatest risk of reoffending. The bill’s changes risk pushing low-risk youths and those who commit low-level crimes deeper into the juvenile justice system, Milner said.
The bill’s proponents focused on the crossover population of juvenile offenders.
Foster care providers EmberHope Connections in Sedgwick County, Saint Francis Ministries in much of central and western Kansas and KVC in northeastern Kansas testified in support of the bill.
They said the foster care system is being treated as a default.
Matt Stephens, vice president of advocacy for Saint Francis, said children entering the system for reasons other than abuse and neglect is evidence of an overwhelmed system.
Of the 2,708 juvenile justice system intakes so far in fiscal year 2026, which began July 1, 1,353 kids, or 50%, were returned to a parent or guardian. Around 580 kids, or 22%, were sent to juvenile prison, and nearly 230 kids, or 8%, entered into the foster care system.
Jim Howell, a Sedgwick County commissioner, said he is asking for a “rebalancing.” The bill addresses the unintended consequences of 2016 reforms and creates a place for kids to go, he said.
“One of those unintended consequences is that we are comingling juvenile offenders with foster kids, children in need of care, kids that are abused and neglected that are basically needing some parents,” Howell said.
He claimed the state is not funding an alternative.
The bill proposes carving into an existing pot that funds prevention and intervention programs, including ones that focus on mentoring, substance use deterrence, behavioral health support, family therapy, coaching workshops, workforce development, future planning, anger management and conflict resolution.
The evidence-based program fund would be gutted to fund the required new beds in secure facilities.
Mike Fonkert, deputy director of Kansas Appleseed, said evidence-based investments exist that can address the concerns of lawmakers, foster care providers, law enforcement, advocates and government agencies alike. Therapeutic foster homes, which are trained to house kids with behavioral needs, are one of those investments.
Several opponents of the bill, along with some proponents, mentioned youth crisis response centers as an alternative solution to increasing reliance on detention. Those centers provide emergency respite for kids with nowhere else to go.
At the core, Fonkert said, are missed decision points in the progression of a kid’s entry into the juvenile justice and foster care systems.
“There’s a hundred ways to attack this,” he said, “but what we’re saying is the nine ways that are in this bill are all pretty bad.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/P1220145-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-26 17:57:36.200737

Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders ordered the guard to transition supporting the health department in 18 counties at least through Wednesday. 
Sanders activated nearly 170 guardsmen on Friday to assist stranded motorists and clear debris ahead of the winter storm that struck the state over the weekend. 
The White House over the weekend approved an emergency declaration for Arkansas and several other states that received snow, ice and sleet along with bitterly cold temperatures.
The Arkansas National Guard is shifting its mission to assist emergency medical services in accessing and transferring patients to ambulance crews, according to a news release. 
Guardsmen will also assist when ambulances become stuck and serve as additional manpower when EMS crews must hike to locations with stretchers and equipment. 
Counties receiving support are: Conway, Craighead, Drew, Faulkner, Garland, Hempstead, Hot Spring, Howard, Izard, Jefferson, Lawrence, Miller, Mississippi, Phillips, Pike, Poinsett, Saline and Stone. Craighead and Jefferson counties will be supported by two teams. All other counties will be supported by one team of guardsmen.
The 77th Expeditionary Combat Aviation Brigade will support Saline County only. The 87th Troop Command will support Mississippi, Poinsett, Craighead, Lawrence, Stone and Izard counties. The 39th Infantry Brigade Combat Team will support the remaining counties. 
In total, 121 guardsmen will perform ambulance escort duties around the clock. All guardsmen from the 142nd Field Artillery Brigade and 189th Airlift Wing have been relieved of state active duty.

The Midwest lawmaker is contesting his DUI charge following his arrest last month in Johnson County.
The post Rep. Bill Allemand asks judge to rescind court-ordered alcohol testing during upcoming legislative session appeared first on WyoFile .","Natrona County Republican Rep. Bill Allemand wants to forgo court-ordered alcohol testing during the upcoming legislative session, while a driving under the influence case against him proceeds, recent court filings show. 
A deputy arrested Allemand on Dec. 28 in Buffalo after being pulled over for suspicious driving. The Republican lawmaker from Midwest subsequently pleaded not guilty. 
As a condition of his bond, Allemand is required to undergo random alcohol testing. He is also prohibited from possessing or consuming alcohol or controlled substances, and from being in any bar, liquor store or anywhere else where alcohol is the main item for sale. 
R. Michael Vang, Allemand’s attorney, filed a motion on Jan. 21 asking the court to either entirely rescind the testing condition of his bond or amend the order so Allemand can forgo testing during the upcoming legislative session in Cheyenne. 
The filing points to Allemand’s obligation as a lawmaker to attend the session, which begins Feb. 9, and argues that the Wyoming Constitution protects a “citizen’s fundamental right to be free from unreasonable searches” as well as “reasonable conditions of bond pending trial.”
After Allemand was pulled over, a Johnson County sheriff’s deputy said he found an open can of beer in the center console of the lawmaker’s truck alongside four unopened beers and a loaded pistol on the front passenger seat. Allemand admitted to drinking two beers 15 minutes before the stop and told the deputy “he drinks while driving for anxiety,” according to a police report.
During a field sobriety test, Allemand “lost balance multiple times and almost fell,” forcing the officer to stop the test, according to the affidavit. Police also allege that Allemand had “significant difficulty getting in and out of [the] patrol vehicle.” 
Vang told WyoFile in a statement, “it is not appropriate to have random chemical testing as a condition of bond for someone with no prior history of alcohol or drug abuse for a first offense DUI charge, where the person is presumed innocent and the burden of proof is on the government to prove their guilt.”
A leading DUI defense trial attorney, Vang also pushed back on the accuracy of such testing. 
“I also don’t like random chemical testing because they use what are called presumptive tests, which must be confirmed to prove the presence of alcohol or drugs,” Vang said. “Unfortunately, I see lots of people falsely accused of using alcohol and drugs because the random testing is not conducted with validated scientific methods.”
A hearing in the case is scheduled for Wednesday. 
Voters first elected Allemand in 2022 to represent House District 58, which encompasses a central section of northern Natrona County. He is a member of the Wyoming Freedom Caucus, a group of Republicans who control the House.

Michelle Davis, R-Whiteland, speaks during a House committee meeting in February 2025. (Photo by Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)President Donald Trump is publicly backing a Republican primary challenger to state Sen. Greg Walker, who was an early and vocal opponent of the Indiana congressional redistricting demanded by the president.
Trump has vowed political revenge against Republican legislators who helped defeat the redistricting bill — and in a Monday social media post he endorsed Rep. Michelle Davis in her challenge to Walker.
“Michelle will be a fantastic replacement for Walker who, for whatever reason, voted against Redistricting in Indiana, which puts the United States Congress in jeopardy,” Trump’s post said.
Davis, a third-term House member from Whiteland, announced her Senate campaign in August after Walker had said he would not seek reelection to the seat he first won in 2006.

But Walker, R-Columbus, earlier this month filed for the May primary, saying he was “greatly concerned when I see Hoosier politics play a surrogate to those national battles.” 
Davis voted in favor of the redistricting plan when it passed the House in December. She said after Walker reversed his decision on seeking reelection that she was continuing her Senate campaign.
Trump’s post called Walker a “‘RINO’ LOSER” — for Republican in name only — and “an America Last politician” for voting against the redrawing of Indiana’s U.S. House maps aimed at helping Republicans win all nine seats.
Walker did not immediately reply to a text message from the Indiana Capital Chronicle seeking comment.
Davis is challenging Walker in Senate District 41, which includes all of Bartholomew County and much of Johnson County south of Indianapolis.











Trump’s post included a graphic claiming Walker would win without his endorsement of Davis.









The president used similar language last week in endorsing a primary challenger to Sen. Travis Holdman, R-Markle, for also voting against the redistricting bill. Trump said he was supporting Blake Fiechter, a Bluffton City Council member who has not yet filed a candidacy for the Senate seat.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/P2122815-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-26 17:57:36.200737

That won’t happen. Boo Ferriss Field at Harvey Stadium on the DSU campus in Cleveland is covered in ice and snow. At noon Monday, the temperature was 21 degrees. The wind chill was 7. The weekend forecast is for more freezing temperatures. The DSU Statesmen are sometimes called the Fighting Okra, but they would be more like Eskimos if they played this weekend.
“We’ll play it by ear, but it doesn’t look good, “ Delta State coach Rodney Batts said Monday.

Repairs will have to made to the backstop at Harvey Stadium before any baseball is played.
“The ice on the netting is so heavy with ice, it tore away from the poles,” said Delta State athletic director Mike Kinnison, a former DSU baseball All America and Hall of Fame coach. “In fact, it is so heavy that it bent some of the poles that were holding it up. That will all have to be repaired.”
The good news: Delta State, which must replace 25 seniors who graduated from last year’s team, can continue pre-season workouts in the Bryce Griffis Indoor Practice Facility adjacent to Harvey Stadium.
The Griffis facility was the brainchild of the late Boo Ferriss. For decades, the DSU baseball program was plagued by rainouts – and sometimes early season “ice-outs.” Practice time often was hard to come by.
“Baseball is a game of repetition,” Kinnison said. “You have to do it every day: hitting, pitching, ground balls, double play turns, relay throws, everything. We were missing too much.”
Ferriss spearheaded the drive to raise the money for the indoor facility and secured the lead gift from the late Bryce Griffis, a Starkville timber man and former Delta State baseball and football player.
The 10,400-square-foot facility was completed in December 2000, opened in 2001, and is used by DSU’s baseball, softball, soccer and football teams. In 2004, Kinnison’s Statesmen won a national championship.
Says Batts, whose team worked out indoors Monday, “I don’t know what in the world we would do without it.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/26152629/ferriss-field.jpg,,,2026-01-26 17:57:36.200737

(Photo by Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)New restrictions on sending physical books, magazines and other reading materials to people incarcerated in Arkansas state prisons are on hold for now, the state’s top prison official says.
Arkansas Department of Corrections Secretary Lindsay Wallace told the Advocate Friday that the restrictions, which were originally approved last month needed to go through the administrative rulemaking process. The restrictions were intended to take effect later this week.
Arkansas inmates restricted from receiving physical books, other media directly under new policy

That process, which takes longer and is more formal than a board policy change, requires sign-off from legislators on the Arkansas Legislative Council. The rulemaking procedure can take months, and Wallace said the department was at the very beginning of the process.
Department spokesperson Rand Champion confirmed that incarcerated people can “still receive printed materials as before” while the rule is pending.
Kaleem Nazeem, a co-director of decARcerate and someone who was previously incarcerated in the Arkansas prison system, applauded the delay, but still expressed concerns and said he hoped the state would reverse the policy.
“I hope they don’t put that type of stringent policy into place where individuals can’t even order books from reputable vendors,” he said.
Under the policy approved last month by Board of Corrections, books wouldn’t be banned outright. While incarcerated people will no longer be able to individually receive physical reading materials, bulk donations of books from libraries or nonprofits to prison libraries would still be permitted.
Supporters of the policy said last month that physical reading materials sent to people inside state prisons were being used to deliver illicit drugs, even when they were ordered from booksellers like Amazon, endangering prison staff and inmates alike.
But the restrictions’ critics say the number of times drugs have been found in books, newspapers and magazines is too small to justify the changes. The restrictions would limit the availability of reading and learning materials to the selections available in prison libraries, or whatever is loaded on tablets, critics argued.
Books provide those incarcerated with crucial connections to their communities, said Sarah Moore, the executive director of the Arkansas Justice Reform Coalition. Physical books are also available to read at any time, she added — which isn’t necessarily the case with tablets.

Last year, lawmakers required the state’s entire voter registration list to be made publicly available for free on a state website.
Katie Hruska, the governor’s general counsel, said the disclosure makes judges and law enforcement officers vulnerable to bad actors. The Governor’s Office requested the legislation.
“Certainly the goal of transparency is always there, but it should never drop to the side in favor of reckless distribution of personal information,” Hruska said.

The bill originally would have removed the same information from the records of people elected or appointed to state and federal offices.
Rep. Will Mortenson, R-Fort Pierre, said running for office means accepting the risk of private information becoming public. The House Judiciary Committee approved the legislation 12-1 with an amendment to keep the information of statewide and federal elected and appointed officials public.
The committee rejected a related bill requested by the governor. It would have created a felony crime to punish people who maliciously publicize private information about elected officials, law enforcement officers and judges with the intent to place them in fear of death or injury — a practice sometimes described as “doxing,” when private documents are involved.

Scott Simmons, Mississippi Emergency Management Authority’s external affairs director, said his agency is working to bring 30 generators to North Mississippi hospitals, long-term care facilities, nursing homes and warming centers. He said multiple locations had generators that failed over the weekend, and only some had come back online by Monday morning.
Small, rural facilities in northern Mississippi are bearing the brunt of the storm’s impact.
Tippah County Hospital, a 25-bed facility in Ripley, is operating at full capacity with reduced staff and no running water, CEO Patrick Chapman told Mississippi Today. Staff at the hospital delivered a baby Saturday for the first time in years while attending to a heart attack patient. Staff joined forces and went back and forth between two rooms, offering care to patients facing life and death in “a heartwarming moment,” Chapman said. 
“It shows you how people can take the worst circumstances and bring out the best,” he said.
But staff confronted grim realities outside the hospital brought on by the weekend’s wintry conditions. Monday afternoon, Chapman picked up a nurse for her evening shift. When Chapman arrived, the nurse was sitting in her car trying to stay warm because her house had no heat, he said.

In Winona, Tyler Holmes Memorial Hospital is facing many similar trials. The facility has running water, but is operating on a generator while staff members work overtime, said CEO Cori Bailey. 
Staff held a disaster team meeting Tuesday to make sure the hospital had adequate food, water and beds for staff to shelter in place as long as needed. Bailey said she’s heard that could be up to two weeks. 
“One of my directors rearranged her office so that she could bring something to sleep in and be here for the duration,” Bailey said. 
The hospital has seen an uptick in patients who lost power and had to be admitted to continue life-sustaining treatments. 
“They may not be sick enough that they need to be in the hospital, but they’ve got to have electricity to run their (oxygen) concentrators,” said Bailey.
Starting tomorrow, the hospital will start cancelling appointments. 
“It hurts my heart so bad because these patients need to come in, but also, they may not be able to get here,” Bailey said. 
Greg Flynn, spokesperson for the Mississippi State Department of Health, said there were several nursing homes and long-term care facilities that reported being without power and having difficulties operating generators Sunday, all of which were working with local emergency management authorities to restore power. He said he did not know how many facilities were impacted. 
Cornerstone Rehabilitation and Healthcare Center, a nursing home in Corinth, has been using a generator all weekend, and has a maintenance man staying overnight to ensure all the rooms are well heated. Everyone there is pitching in additional duties, said Monica Jackson, the facility’s human resources officer, who was on phone duty Monday. 
“We are working on little to no staff,” Jackson said. “Our administrator tried to go and pick up a few people that he could. We’ve got a few people who have been here since this all started Friday night – with no relief. They’ve just been taking naps.”
In the counties surrounding Oxford, community mental health workers for Communicare have been stuck at facilities since Friday because other staff members aren’t able to navigate roads — blocked by trees and downed power lines — to relieve them. Executive Director Melody Madaris told Mississippi Today in a text message she does not know how long the on-site employees will have to continue working.
Madaris said she expects most Communicare services will be closed all week, but its crisis intervention team will be available. 
Wendy Bailey, executive director of the Mississippi Department of Mental Health, wrote in an email the community mental health center that serves counties in the state’s northeast corner is closed and without power. 
Getting patients to timely care has become a harrowing experience in many parts of the state, including the Mississippi Delta. Greenwood Leflore Hospital’s emergency room remained open through the storm, though the hospital’s clinics, outpatient rehabilitation center and retail pharmacy were closed Monday. The hospital provided accommodations for in-house staff since Friday, said spokesperson Christine Hemphill.
The hospital’s helipad was cleared Monday morning, allowing two patients to be transferred to a higher level of care, Hemphill said. Three additional patients are awaiting transfer.

Pafford Medical Services, one of the largest ambulance providers in the state and the company that provides medical helicopter services to Greenwood Leflore Hospital, began transporting critically ill or injured patients by air from around the state to hospitals in Jackson and Memphis from select facilities late Sunday after landing pads were cleared of ice. 
Unusually thick ice on helipads and continuous precipitation kept air ambulance services grounded in many areas over the weekend, said Clay Hobbs, chief operating officer of Pafford Medical Services.
By midday Monday, most of the state’s hospital helipads were back in service, he said. The company is working to keep as many aircrafts in the air as possible to transport patients to hospitals that can meet their care needs. The company’s emergency operations center, which opened on Friday, triages air and ground transports to ensure that the patients with the greatest needs and who can be transferred safely are transported first.
“Air Ambulance will be busy for the next two to three days,” Hobbs said. 
Hobbs said the company has seen an increased number of 911 calls for traffic accidents and other medical issues since the storm hit. 
Ambulance providers across the state are working to attend to the health needs of patients, particularly those in areas without power who are receiving oxygen or use medical devices that require electricity. 
“Ambulance providers are the first line of defense for those patients,” he said. 
Pafford ambulances are also working to transport patients to Jackson or Memphis for higher levels of care than local hospitals can provide. Operations are fairly normal, Hobbs said, but emergency providers are still encountering some obstacles. 
One ambulance transporting a patient was stranded on the interstate for several hours this morning after an 18-wheeler blocked traffic and made the road impassable, he said. The patient survived. 
All Baptist Memorial hospitals in the state are open and have power, said spokesperson Kimberly Alexander. However, clinics in north Mississippi were closed Monday, Alexander said, and the system’s Oxford hospital was not offering elective or outpatient surgeries and procedures. They will re-assess on a day-to-day basis, she said. 
All eight North Mississippi Health Services hospital locations are open, said David Wilson, chief operating officer for North Mississippi Health Services and president for North Mississippi Medical Center-Tupelo in a statement. Some clinics and outpatient services are closed today or opening later in the day, and most clinics are expected to return to normal operations Tuesday.

Large hospitals in Jackson say they are operating as usual and are prepared to accept transfers from smaller hospitals. 
The University of Mississippi Medical Center’s main campus in Jackson, the state’s largest hospital, is operating normally, said spokesperson Patrice Guilfoyle. UMMC Holmes County is operating on a generator, and UMMC clinics north of Lexington are closed Monday. 
St. Dominic Hospital in Jackson is currently experiencing typical transfer volumes, but anticipates an increase as road and travel conditions improve, spokesperson Meredith Bailess said in an email. 
“We remain prepared to support the needs of these impacted areas,” Bailess said.
Wendy Bailey, the mental health department executive director, said some of the generators at North Mississippi Regional Center’s community homes for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, which her agency runs, have failed. But at least one of the generators was up and running again by Monday morning. 
The Department’s legislative budget request for the upcoming fiscal year requests more funding to replace the backup power sources at the regional center and North Mississippi State Hospital. After the agency’s board meeting in December, Wendy Bailey said the state hospital’s generator will not pass its upcoming review if it is not replaced. 
“Backup generators are essential to support operations during a power outage,” she said in her Tuesday email. “These programs are providing 24/7 services to some of Mississippi’s most vulnerable residents.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/26155413/IMG_7428-1.jpg,,,2026-01-26 17:57:36.200737

In a budget hearing at the state Capitol on Monday, state Superintendent Lindel Fields requested $4 billion for public education, $23 million more than the state’s current spend to account for the rising cost of educators’ health insurance. Lawmakers will consider the request when crafting a state budget for the 2027 fiscal year.
He also gave a list of priorities without a cost attached to them: school security, raising first-year teacher salaries, teacher development, school leader training and improving literacy.
Fields described these priorities as fundamentals that would enable the state to execute a broader strategy toward academic improvement, particularly in elementary reading.
“Those are the X’s and O’s,” he said while making a football analogy. “We get those right, I think we can successfully run the plays — this year’s play being early literacy.”
Legislative leaders have said literacy is among their top priorities this year, too. However, when House and Senate lawmakers asked Fields in the joint budget hearing how much he’d like to spend on his priorities, he said he didn’t yet have a specific dollar amount to request.
Although public education is the Legislature’s largest state government expense, Oklahoma ranks near the bottom in the country in per-pupil spending, Fields said, and behind most bordering states in average pay for first-year teachers with $41,152, even when considering cost of living differences. 
He noted Mississippi — whose leap in literacy scores local policymakers hope to emulate — has spent hundreds of millions of dollars specifically to improve its reading outcomes. If Oklahoma hopes to move the needle, he said, “having a reading specialist in every elementary school is a direction we need to head (toward).”
“The numbers add up pretty quickly, to give you a specific number for the future of education,” Fields said. “If we want to be competitive for first-year teachers, if we want to provide safe schools, we want to improve literacy, it’s substantial. It’s a substantial investment.”
Republican lawmakers, though, took note when Fields said about half of the $12,000 Oklahoma spends per pupil is applied to non-instructional expenses. 
“I think one of the areas that is a struggle for this body is when you see record levels of investment but you also see steady growth in non-instructional spending and the growth of that outpacing the growth of classroom expenditures,” said Rep. Chad Caldwell, R-Enid, who leads a House subcommittee on education funding.

Some of that, Fields said, comes down to how the state classifies certain expenditures. 
State records show, for example, dollars spent on instructional technology, curriculum development, instructional staff training, school counselors, speech pathology and school libraries all fall outside of the “instruction” category in the state’s accounting system.
Some items on Fields’ priority list would correlate with bills lawmakers already filed ahead of their 2026 legislative session, which begins Feb. 2. 
For example, Sen. Adam Pugh, R-Edmond, submitted legislation to continue a $50 million-per-year school security program and to set up a framework for school principal training and mentorship.
Multiple lawmakers have filed bills hoping to improve early elementary reading scores and to increase teacher salaries.

Lockhart,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/26/ct-unemployment-jobs-report-december-2025/,"The state's labor force contracted as national issues, from tariffs to inflation, created uncertainty for employers.","Connecticut’s unemployment rate ticked up slightly in December from 4% to 4.2%, as the state shed 500 jobs, according to numbers released by state Department of Labor on Monday.
For the full year in 2025, the state’s unemployment rate rose 1% — a notable increase, though unemployment remained low compared to historical figures. Connecticut’s unemployment rate at the end of 2025 was also lower than the national rate of 4.4%. 
But overall, 2025 was a mixed year for the state’s economy, as job growth slowed and the labor force — the number of people working or looking for work — contracted. Some industries experienced declines in jobs even as the state reported GDP growth through the second and third quarters of last year. (Fourth quarter GDP growth hasn’t been reported yet.)
“There was considerable volatility in 2025 with national issues playing a role in dampening Connecticut’s job growth,” Labor Commissioner Danté Bartolomeo said in a statement. “Over the past year, Connecticut’s workforce declined; that makes it harder for employers to hire and it reduces retail and services spending.”
Those “national issues” included tariffs and inflation, both of which have amplified economic uncertainty as their exact effect on the economy over the coming months and years remains unclear. The Connecticut Department of Labor has also cited changes in immigration enforcement as a concern in recent months, noting that the national crackdown could affect this state’s labor force, which has relied on immigrant workers to offset the effects of the state’s aging population.
The latest labor report rounded out a year of stagnation in the state’s labor market. Connecticut currently has a labor force participation rate of 64%, which is higher than the national rate of 62.5%. But some 20,000 people left the labor force in 2025, potentially making it harder for companies to fill open roles.
The state currently reports having some 70,000 job openings.
“Connecticut’s economy has shown resilience through some ups and downs this year,” CTDOL Director of Research Patrick Flaherty said in a statement. “As we’ve said in the past, the state’s economy will follow national trends, so we remain watchful of inflation, the impact of tariffs, and overall hiring.”
Connecticut’s economic picture is mixed – but shows warning signs
Connecticut employers shed 2,200 jobs overall in 2025, despite reported job increases in six out of the twelve months.
In November of last year, Connecticut ranked 37th for job growth in the nation, with states like Missouri, South Carolina and North Carolina landing in the top 10. In 2025, job growth increased 0.4% nationally, while it declined 0.1% in the state. 
Looking at the past year, most of the recent job declines in Connecticut were concentrated in specific job sectors, including retail (- 4,800 jobs), accommodation & food services (-3,000 jobs), and private education (-2,800 jobs). 
The losses were partially offset by growth in sectors like government (+3,200 jobs) and health care (+3,300 jobs). 
The muddled job picture raises concerns about growth in the state, which still has not recovered many of the jobs lost during the Great Recession. Connecticut officials have looked to support investments in emerging technologies and foster workforce growth in science and research-based industries, but business leaders say the state has a ways to go. 
“Connecticut employers and their employees are showing remarkable resilience — navigating uncertainty, innovating, and driving productivity,” Chris DiPentima, president and CEO of the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, said in a statement. “But innovation alone cannot sustain long-term growth if underlying workforce challenges remain unaddressed.” 
The state Department of Labor acknowledged that some issues holding back job growth were out of the state’s hands, with the national economy currently in flux. Hiring has slowed nationally and it’s unclear exactly how much tariffs could harm U.S.-based companies. DOL’s Flaherty said he is expecting “modest growth” in 2026 so long as the national economy doesn’t tip towards a downturn. 
For now, local and national economists aren’t ringing alarm bells. But the data does suggest Connecticut leaders may look to address the state’s relatively high cost of living, an issue that has repeatedly been cited as straining Connecticut workers and hampering growth. 
With lawmakers returning to Hartford for the 2026 legislative session next week, business advocates say now is the time to act. “Employers are doing their part,” DiPentima said. “If policymakers do the same, Connecticut can put all the pieces together for stronger, more sustainable economic growth.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_7454-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-26 17:57:36.200737

Despite frigid temperatures, New Mexico’s Immigrant and Workers Day of Action drew more than 500 people to the Roundhouse Monday morning rallying for an end to New Mexico’s participation in federal immigrant detention.
Immigrant advocacy groups and residents from across New Mexico urged movement on House Bill 9, which if passed would prohibit local and state government entities from entering into agreements to detain people accused of federal immigration violations.
Last week, HB 9 advanced through its first committee along party lines. Recently, Republican leadership in the house has requested the federal government step in and stop it. 
Monday’s rally followed Saturday’s killing in Minnesota of 37-year-old Alex Jeffrey Pretti by federal immigration agents — the second such fatal incident in that city in the last month.
New Mexico lawmakers championing HB9 legislation cited the immigration raids in Minnesota as a reason to pass the bill and resist federal immigration policy. House Speaker Javier Martínez (D-Albuquerque) called HB9 “a movement that will help the United States of America find its soul again.”
Source NM recently reported that dozens of immigrants arrested in Minneapolis were shipped to the Torrance County Detention Facility, which is run by private prison operator CoreCivic, in New Mexico.
One attendee at the roundhouse Monday, 26-year-old Andres Esquivel, a campaigns manager at immigrant rights nonprofit New Mexico Dream Team, said the legislation is a long time coming, citing reports of civil rights violations and abusive conditions in the facilities documented by Congress.

“I’m fighting to end federal detention immigration centers, I’m fighting for the rights of all immigrants, including myself, my parents, my friends, my whole community,” Esquivel told Source NM.
Esquivel, who was born in Chihuahua, Mexico, moved to the United States when he was 2 years old. He called the prospect of increased immigration detention in New Mexico “pretty terrifying” for immigrant communities.
“New Mexico has so far seemed to be under the radar, when it comes to ICE activity, which I’m glad about, but I think we need to start organizing more,” he said.
Participants and lawmakers spoke about the recent killings of Pretti and Renee Nicole Good, also 37.

Eder Lopez, 17, a New America high school student from the South Valley in Albuquerque, held a sign memorializing Pretti, calling him an “ICU nurse, neighbor and friend.”
“I’m here to represent my community, and what we stand for,” Lopez told Source NM. “This country wouldn’t be where we are without the immigrant community.”

Norma Dorado, 57, told Source NM in Spanish: “This is a fight for our country, for everything happening with our community.”
Ramon Dorado, 62, who currently works three jobs, also noted Pretti’s and Good’s deaths, and said the Trump administration’s recent actions have heightened immigrants’ fear.
“This administration is very bad, it doesn’t matter who you are,” he said. “They’ve broken the law, they’ve broken the Constitution.”

Seen here in Tallahassee on Jan. 26, 2026. (Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Brad Bishop is a founder of Offentsive Corp., a Pensacola nonprofit organization aimed at reducing overdoses, homelessness, and human trafficking.
In 2023, his brother Randy had just completed drug treatment in Panama City and was just a few days out of jail when he took what he thought was a Xanax pill.
“It wasn’t Xanax, it was fentanyl,” Bishop told the Senate Criminal Justice Committee on Monday. The drug resulted in his brother’s sudden death.
“He had no reason to believe his life was in danger, but today street drugs are almost always intentionally mixed with fentanyl,” he said.
The Florida Legislature addressed that issue in part when it passed a bill in 2023 that legalized fentanyl testing strips — small pieces of paper capable of detecting whether drugs such as cocaine, heroin, or methamphetamines have been adulterated with that powerful and sometimes deadly drug.
However, the state continues to see more accidental drug overdoses by people taking other danger adulterants such as xylazine and cathinones. That’s why Sen. Don Gaetz, R-Seaside, has introduced legislation (SB 646) that would decriminalize the possession, distribution, and use of drug-testing products “that can detect these deadly adulterants and prevent unnecessary deaths.”
Xylazine, also known as “tranq,” is a veterinary tranquilizer that has been found in some illicit drug supplies. Cathinones, also known as “bath salts,” are a class of lab-made stimulants designed to mimic effects similar to those produced by cocaine and methamphetamines, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.
“Thirty-three other states have already decriminalized test strips,” Bishop told the committee. “Test strips provide early warning signs about lethal batches, track emerging synthetics before a fatal overdose, and tie overdoses to distribution patterns, not just death certificates.”
The bill passed unanimously in the committee. It has two more stops before reaching the Senate floor. A companion bill (HB 477)  has been filed in the Florida House by Rep. Michelle Salzman, R-Escambia County.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/0-2-3-1024x771.jpeg,,,2026-01-26 17:57:36.200737

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)The westbound Washington Bridge’s ongoing closure is driving a Providence vegan food hall near Interstate 195 out of business after six years, its owner announced Monday.
Now Plant City’s impending closure is taking center stage in the 2026 gubernatorial race.
In a letter to customers posted on its website and social media, Plant City owner Kim Anderson said the South Water Street eatery will permanently close on Sunday, Feb. 8, after experiencing an “immediate and lasting reduction” of guests in the over two years since the westbound highway was shuttered. The food hall opened in 2019.
“Despite our efforts, we could not overcome this,” Anderson wrote.
State officials suddenly closed the westbound lanes of the Washington Bridge on Dec. 13, 2023, after contracted engineers discovered broken anchor rods that put the highway connecting Providence and East Providence at risk of collapse. At the time, the highway carried over 90,000 vehicles per day.
Demolition crews began to remove the bridge in two parts in July 2024, starting with the bridge deck and superstructure with work completed in December. State contractors will now focus their attention on the replacement bridge, which is tentatively scheduled to open in November 2028 under the the timeline set in the $427 million contract awarded to Chicago-based Walsh Construction in June.
Gov. Dan McKee told reporters Monday that his administration will offer state resources to help the roughly 70 employees affected by Plant City’s closure. While lamenting the bridge’s impact, he said dealing with infrastructure changes is part of running a small business during a media availability in Cranston on the state’s response to Sunday’s snowstorm.
“When you have an infrastructure that is interrupted, or is down, whether you’re putting sewer lines in or water lines in by businesses, that it’s going to impact our businesses,” he said“Their overhead is huge, and if they’re not getting the customer base in, they’re making the right decision — I’m just sorry that the bridge played a role in their decision making.”
Helena Buonanno Foulkes, McKee’s 2026 Democratic gubernatorial rival, called the governor’s response to the closure “disconnected” from the state’s economic reality.
“Comparing the bridge closure’s devastating impact on small businesses to routine sewer line work is insulting and dismissive,” Foulkes, a former CVS executive, said in a statement. “Our small business owners deserve leadership that supports them, listens to their challenges and actually works to help, instead of shrugging off the impact of this administration’s failures.”
Anderson has donated to Foulkes’ campaigns for governor. Records show she contributed the maximum $2,000 in both 2024 and 2025 toward Foulkes’ second primary campaign against McKee. Foulkes announced her 2026 gubernatorial bid on Sept. 9, 2025.
Anderson also contributed $1,000 toward Foulkes’ first campaign in 2021. McKee bested Foulkes by three percentage points in the five-way Democratic September 2022 gubernatorial primary.
In a media statement, Anderson noted the ownership team has connected with the Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training, whose staff will visit the food hall during the week to connect employees with resources and training.
Anderson’s letter did not disclose details of the financial impact of the closure on Plant City’s Providence location. A representative for Plant City did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Plant City’s locations in Barrington, which opened in 2024, and Warwick, which opened in 2021, will remain open, Anderson’s letter said.
Plant City itself billed itself as the world’s first and largest plant-based food hall and marketplace — serving only 100% plant-based cuisine and products. The Providence space includes four restaurants offering different cuisines, three bars, as well as a coffee bar and retail market.

(Photo by Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)Colorado Democrats unveiled a trio of bills Monday meant to increase affordability for consumers, including a second try at outlawing the use of personal data to set prices and wages.
“Fighting for affordability means exercising the courage to hold wealth and power accountable and to make sure that everyone, regardless of how much money they have, plays by the same set of rules,” Rep. Javier Mabrey, a Denver Democrat, said.
A yet-to-be-introduced bill would ban corporations from using someone’s personal data such as their browsing history, device type, location, shopping patterns and other demographics to set a price or wage. That practice is known as surveillance pricing and was the subject of a Federal Trade Commission study under the Biden administration. New parents, for example, might be shown a higher price for baby thermometers in their search results. People sitting in a store’s parking lot might see a higher price for an item online than someone at home.

A similar bill died in its first committee hearing late last session. This year, Mabrey, House Assistant Majority Leader Jennifer Bacon, Sen. Mike Weissman and Sen. Iman Jodeh will back the legislation. Not only is the bill coming up sooner in the session, they said, but more Coloradans this year are likely to have become aware or been affected by surveillance pricing.
“As consumers, we need to have a say in how we are treated when we go to places like the grocery store,” Bacon said. “As technology advances and (artificial intelligence) becomes more integrated in our everyday lives, practices like surveilling to set prices and wages are driving up costs for us.”
Level the playing field for small businesses
Another bill expected to be introduced in February would prohibit wholesalers from charging small businesses more than bigger retailers. Mike Callicrate, the owner of Ranch Foods Direct in Colorado Springs, said it would help level the playing field for small businesses.
“We have to compete with massive chain retailers like Walmart, Amazon, Whole Foods, Kroger, Albertsons and Safeway that externalize costs on taxpayers and communities while sourcing the cheapest products they can find,” he said. “If we want to stay in business and build resilient communities that can feed themselves, we need bold legislation to make markets fair.”
The wholesale bill will be sponsored by Sens. William Lindstedt of Broomfield and Judy Amabile of Boulder, and Rep. Kyle Brown of Louisville, all Democrats.
The bill will still allow price differences when it comes to volume purchasing and other logistics.
“But it ensures that those small businesses have the same access to wholesale prices that the largest corporations and monopolies in this country use to box out that very competition,” Lindstedt said.
Republican defends price premium
The third bill in the package, House Bill 26-1012, was introduced this month on the first day of the legislative session. The measure would require retailers that sell through delivery apps like Instacart and Door Dash to display how much the delivered item would cost at the store. It would also ban retailers from artificially inflating prices to so-called captive customers, who have limited purchasing options in places like stadiums, hospitals and airports.
“Everyone has experienced the $20 beer at a Nuggets game, the $10 water at the airport or the $80 Tylenol in the emergency room, when people are forced to pay more simply because they are trapped,” Rep. Yara Zokaie, a Fort Collins Democrat, said. “That isn’t a free market. It’s exploitation.”
HB-1012 is sponsored by Zokaie, Lindstedt, Weissman and Brown.
Rep. Chris Richardson, an Elbert County Republican who sits on the House Business Affairs and Labor Committee, said in a statement that the policy would make Colorado an outlier by imposing price ceilings.
“When prices are artificially capped, demand increases while supply shrinks. Vendors cannot cover costs, quality operators exit the market, and consumers are left with fewer options, lower quality, and worse service,” he said. “The bill also ignores the reality of venue economics. Vendors in airports and stadiums pay significantly higher rent and operating costs than businesses outside those facilities. A modest price premium is not price gouging. It is what allows these businesses to stay open at all.”
The bill also has opposition from the Colorado Bankers Association, the Colorado Hospital Association, and the National Western Stock Show and Rodeo. DoorDash, Instacart and Uber are requesting amendments.

It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
Mississippi Today is welcoming two new reporters to its team. Madeline Nguyen will join as an investigative reporter, and Aaron Lampley is the newest reporter on Mississippi Today’s Jackson desk. 
Madeline Nguyen
Nguyen, who just graduated with a master’s degree in investigative journalism from Arizona State University, has joined Mississippi Today for a year-long fellowship from the Roy Howard Center for Investigative Journalism at ASU.
“It’s an honor to join Mississippi Today’s investigative team, whose track record of accountability exemplifies the core mission of local investigative journalism: reporting that makes the community we live in a better place,” Nguyen said. “I’m eager to build on the team’s legacy of highlighting inequities in a criminal justice system where justice is too often absent.”
Lampley, a recent broadcast and digital journalism graduate of Mississippi State University, previously interned with Mississippi Today as a video producer during the summer of 2025. He will contribute to the Jackson team as a reporter with an eye towards bringing stories to life through video.
“Growing up in Mississippi, I saw so many different voices and stories go unheard. I’m so grateful to be a part of Mississippi Today, a team whose mission helps to serve those very individuals,” Lampley said. “Shedding light on the untold stories of Mississippi and its many amazing communities, while also providing them with information they might not otherwise have access to, plays a vital role in helping this state grow and succeed. I’m excited to help carry that mission forward.”

Nguyen, who also has a bachelor’s degree in journalism and mass communications and political science, will work with the nonprofit news organization’s investigative team headed by veteran journalist Jerry Mitchell as well as assist the newsroom as a whole. 
While at Arizona State, Nguyen led a local, long-form investigation for Arizona PBS uncovering key footage that Phoenix police edits out of body-camera videos released to the public. She engineered a custom Excel database tracking the department’s video editing in nearly 100 use-of-force cases by collecting data on hours of footage and filing public records requests for police reports.
Nguyen previously pioneered a new data-focused beat while working as a cost-of-living intern reporter at the Times of San Diego and was a data and research contributor for The Guardian, Consumer Reports and the Food & Environment Network. She also served as a health disparities congressional correspondent for Arizona PBS-Cronkite News’ Washington bureau.  
“We are thrilled to have Madeline Nguyen join our investigative team,” said Debbie Skipper, justice editor at Mississippi Today. “Her skills and innovative approaches will enhance our abilities to further our mission of informing the public and holding decision makers accountable.”
A Noxapater native, Lampley doesn’t hesitate to tackle sensitive subjects, such as a short documentary he directed, filmed and edited while in school that told the stories of two trans Starkville-area residents navigating the fears and fallout of Trump-era policies. He will cover news and human-interest stories in the capital city. 
“I’m delighted to have Aaron back after working with him last summer on a video about one of the city’s biggest news stories of the year, the human impacts of water shutoffs at apartment complexes,” said Jackson Editor Anna Wolfe. “I appreciated his sensitivity when visiting with residents, and I’m eager to see the audience he reaches with this medium.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/04185133/MT-Featured-Image-General-Logo.jpg,,,2026-01-26 17:57:36.200737
,DC,2026-01-26 21:59:14+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Congress hurtles toward partial shutdown after Alex Pretti killing in Minneapolis,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/congress-hurtles-toward-partial-shutdown-after-alex-pretti-killing-minneapolis,,"WASHINGTON — White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Monday urged Senate Democrats to advance the government funding package that must become law before the weekend to avoid a partial shutdown, rejecting their proposal to remove the Homeland Security funding bill.Democrats in the upper chamber say they are ready to help pass five of the six bills, but insist the Homeland Security spending measure must be stripped and renegotiated to include more constraints on federal immigration enforcement after officers killed a second American citizen in Minnesota this weekend. “We absolutely do not want to see that funding lapse and we want the Senate to move forward with passing the bipartisan appropriations package that was negotiated on a bipartisan basis,” Leavitt said. Negotiators in Congress have reached bipartisan consensus on each of the dozen full-year government spending bills during the last few months, though the final bills still need to clear the Senate and become law.Funding for hundreds of programs in those measures lapses Friday at midnight, when the stopgap spending law Congress approved at the end of the last shutdown expires.  A partial shutdown would affect the Departments of Defense, Education, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Labor, State, Transportation and Treasury. The Executive Office of the President, Supreme Court and judicial branch would also go without funding if a solution cannot be reached in time. Leavitt said during the briefing that “policy discussions on immigration in Minnesota are happening” and pointed to the phone call that President Donald Trump and Minnesota Democratic Gov. Tim Walz had earlier in the day. “But that should not be at the expense of government funding for the American people, which would include FEMA funding,” Leavitt said. “And we are in the midst of the storm that took place over the weekend and many Americans are still being impacted by that.”The Homeland Security appropriations bill funds numerous programs in addition to Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection. The Coast Guard, Federal Emergency Management Agency, National Flood Insurance Fund, Secret Service and Transportation Security Administration are among the other agencies that rely on the bill for budget authority. Schumer demands removal of DHS bill Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., wrote in a statement that Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., should remove the Homeland Security funding bill from the larger package before the deadline to avoid a lapse in funding. “The responsibility to prevent a partial government shutdown is on Leader Thune and Senate Republicans,” he wrote. “If Leader Thune puts those five bills on the floor this week, we can pass them right away. If not, Republicans will again be responsible for another government shutdown.”Senate Appropriations Chairwoman Susan Collins, R-Maine, in a brief floor speech urged lawmakers from both political parties to vote to advance the full funding package, calling the possibility of another shutdown “harmful, unnecessary and disastrous.”“I hope we can come together in a constructive way to get this done and to ensure that we do not lurch into a dangerous and detrimental government shutdown,” she said. Collins did acknowledge the killing of Alex Pretti over the weekend, saying his “tragic death” had “refocused attention on the Homeland Security bill and I recognize that and share the concerns.” “I do want to point out to my colleagues that there are many safeguards that have been put in this bill that I would encourage them to review,” Collins added without going into detail. “And that the vast majority of the funding in this bill, more than 80%, is for non-immigration and non-border security functions.” A Senate Republican aide, who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly, said GOP leaders are “determined to not have another government shutdown.” “We will move forward as planned and hope Democrats can find a path forward to join us,” the aide added. A Senate Democratic leadership aide said that “Republicans and the White House have reached out but have not yet raised any realistic solutions.”‘Government shutdowns do not help anyone’Senate Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee Chairwoman Katie Britt, R-Ala., wrote in a social media post that the array of programs in that bill “are critical to keeping Americans safe and must be funded.”“We know from recent history that government shutdowns do not help anyone and are not in the best interest of the American people,” Britt wrote, referring to the shutdown of historic length that ended Nov. 12. “As we approach a government funding deadline, I remain committed to finding a pathway forward.”Senate Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee ranking member Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union with Jake Tapper & Dana Bash” that he couldn’t “vote to fund this lawless Department of Homeland Security.” “And remember, it's not just in Minnesota. They're violating the law all over the country,” Murphy said. “I spent last week in Texas where they are locking up 2-year-old and 3-year-old kids who are here in the United States legally, just for the purpose of traumatizing them.”Fetterman, Shaheen part waysPennsylvania Democratic Sen. John Fetterman appeared to be the only member of his party in that chamber to support the entire package, writing in a statement he “will never vote to shut our government down, especially our Defense Department.”“I reject the calls to defund or abolish ICE. I strongly disagree with many strategies and practices ICE deployed in Minneapolis, and believe that must change,” Fetterman wrote. “I want a conversation on the DHS appropriations bill and support stripping it from the minibus. It is unlikely that will happen and our country will suffer another shutdown.”New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen backed the strategy of pulling out the Homeland Security spending bill and allowing the other five government funding bills to become law before the shutdown deadline.“The Senate then needs to have a real bipartisan discussion about what additional reforms we need to put in place to prevent tragedies like Minneapolis from happening across the country,” Shaheen wrote in a social media post. “I will vote against DHS’s funding until additional reforms are in place.”",,,,2026-01-26 17:57:36.200737

Odds grow amid ICE funding clash,Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/26/another-government-shutdown-odds-grow-amid-ice-funding-clash/,"Senate Democrats, including CT's two U.S. senators, are mostly unified against new funding for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.","With the second fatal shooting of a U.S. citizen by a federal agent, the likelihood of a partial government shutdown grew as Congress approaches its Friday funding deadline.
Senate Democrats, including Connecticut’s two U.S. senators, are mostly unified against new funding for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. 
They want to revise the DHS bill and separate it from a package that funds other government agencies as a way to avoid a shutdown. Republicans are in the majority and would need to make that decision.
Democrats in Congress were already skeptical of more funding for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement after the shooting of Renee Good on Jan. 7 by an ICE officer. But resistance to the DHS funding bill solidified after the shooting of Alex Pretti, who was protesting ICE activity in Minneapolis over the weekend.
Ongoing tensions with ICE, on top of the snow storm, are complicating the passage of the funding bills. Senate votes were delayed a day and lawmakers aren’t expected to get to the package until later in the week, right before the Jan. 30 deadline. Plus, any changes to legislation made by the Senate would need approval by the House, which is currently out of session through the end of the week.
While Republicans control the Senate, Democratic votes are still needed to advance most legislation. Lawmakers must reach a 60-vote threshold, meaning Republicans typically need at least seven Democrats to move it toward final passage. But with all GOP senators unlikely to support it, even more support is needed from Democrats.
During negotiations in recent weeks, congressional Democrats were pushing for more reforms to ICE in any compromise funding bill for DHS. Many were disappointed by the final product and acknowledged the bill fell short of their party’s broader demands.
As things stand, Senate GOP leadership doesn’t plan to uncouple the DHS bill from the other five government funding bills, which have wide support. If the Homeland Security funding remains in the package and unchanged, Democrats maintain that senators shouldn’t support it — even with the risks of a partial shutdown.
“We shouldn’t let Republicans bully us again into funding a lawless administration,” U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said in an interview with the Connecticut Mirror prior to the shooting of Pretti over the weekend. “It’s Republicans’ choice to put in front of the Senate a bill that combines DHS funding with other agencies. They’re putting those other agencies at risk by not doing what the House did, having a separate vote on DHS.”
What’s different this time
The possibility of a partial shutdown comes about two months after a record-long closure of the federal government in the fall that lasted for 43 days.
A potential funding lapse this time around would affect a smaller portion of the government since a handful agencies already got their funding approved. And unlike last time, there would be no effect on federal nutrition assistance since the agency that oversees SNAP benefits secured its funding through the end of fiscal year as part of the deal last year to end the government shutdown.
But the remaining agencies that need new full-year funding cover the vast majority of the government’s discretionary spending and would still have some major implications. It would again lead to furloughs of some federal employees in the six government agencies where funding runs out after Jan. 30.
Congress must pass 12 appropriations bills to fund the federal government for fiscal year 2026. The House completed its work last week. Connecticut’s congressional delegation joined most House Democrats in opposing the bill that funds Homeland Security. But in a separate vote that same day, all five members voted for a funding package with the final three bills.
Now, it’s the Senate’ turn to vote on the last six bills, which are all packaged together.
In addition to DHS, the rest of the final package includes funding through the end of September for Labor, Health and Human Services and Education; Defense; Transportation and Housing and Urban Development; and the State Department.
Outside of ICE and Border Patrol, the Department of Homeland Security also oversees TSA, FEMA and the U.S. Coast Guard.
Since returning to Washington after the holidays, congressional appropriators responsible for drafting and negotiating government funding bills made steady progress on releasing bill text and passing smaller packages with full-year funding for fiscal year 2026. Congress appeared on track to meet Friday’s deadline.
But after the weekend shooting, the Senate Democratic caucus appears in alignment that they can’t accept the current version of the DHS bill. That included those who have been vocally opposed, key members of leadership, appropriators who negotiated the bill and Democrats who voted for the deal that ended the 43-day shutdown in the fall.
Murphy has been strongly opposed to the bill since it was released. And his trip last week to south Texas to learn more about ICE’s enforcement and detainments provided “more evidence of how critical this moment is and how DHS does not deserve to be funded without reforms,” he said.
Murphy, who is the ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Homeland Security Subcommittee, said he can’t support funding for DHS without reforms. Some of those demands that didn’t make it into the final bill included preventing U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents from being moved off the border and into the interior, requiring warrants for certain arrests and protocol around mandatory training.
“I just don’t think we will be perceived as credible if we vote to fund DHS’ illegality and abuse for the rest of the year while talking like it’s a moral and legal crisis,” Murphy said.
Murphy said Minneapolis isn’t the only place facing abuses by ICE and other federal agents.
“They are violating the law all over the country. This is a nationwide campaign of lawlessness,” Murphy said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “We cannot fund a Department of Homeland Security that is murdering American citizens, that is traumatizing little boys and girls all across the country in violation of the law.”
U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., echoed those sentiments and said he would also oppose the Homeland Security bill.
“I’m a NO on DHS funding without strict restraints & comprehensive reforms to stop lawless, lethal violence led from the top. Americans are rightly terrified & outraged by the illegal brutality — police state tactics — we’re watching in real time. It must be stopped,” Blumenthal said in a post on X following the fatal shooting in Minneapolis.

Americans are rightly terrified & outraged by the illegal brutality—police state tactics—we’re watching in real time. It must be stopped. 1/— Richard Blumenthal (@SenBlumenthal) January 25, 2026

“A government shutdown can be readily avoided by splitting the DHS appropriations from other funding measures, as was done in the House. Democrats have a consensus. Republicans should listen to America,” Blumenthal continued.
Even without new funding, ICE received an additional $75 billion allocated over four years in Republicans’ “big beautiful bill” for expanding the agency’s detention capacity and hiring more officers. DHS has been arguing in court filings and to members of Congress showing up to tour detention centers that it is largely operating on money from the special budget reconciliation bill and not through the full-year appropriations laws that Congress seeks to pass through its normal process.
But the Senate is in a much different situation than the House. Senators won’t get the same leeway to vote down the DHS bill but support the rest of the funding measures unless GOP leaders make a change.
“Senate Republicans must work with Democrats to advance the other five funding bills while we work to rewrite the DHS bill,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement.
As of now, Senate Republican leadership doesn’t plan to detach DHS from the overall legislation and is proceeding with the existing framework.
It is also unclear if Republicans would support adding in additional reforms to ICE. Some have called for a full investigation into the fatal shootings of Pretti and Good, but reiterated their support of the Trump administration’s enforcement actions and the federal agency itself.
“At this point, the White House supports the bipartisan work that was done to advance the bipartisan appropriations package, and we want to see that passed,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said at Monday’s briefing.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25274448207070-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-26 17:57:36.200737

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Senators in a subcommittee Monday rejected a bill that would have enforced clean air act protections on casino floors. 
Sen. Tony Bisignano, D-Des Moines, did not vote in favor of the bill, but made a “promise” that a reversal of the exemption would happen “relatively soon.”
Senate File 2051 would have eliminated an exemption in the Iowa Smokefree Air Act that allows smoking in gambling structures, excursion gambling boats, and racetracks. 
Bisignano, who said he “participates” in casino activities and also serves on the board of directors for Prairie Meadows casino in Des Moines, said “smoking is bad” and that it was an “absurdity” to leave casinos out of the original clean air act.
“Casinos need to take the responsibility … and I think their business plan better start to change, and change quickly, because I will be the one pushing this,” Bisignano said.

Advocates for the bill, including representatives from the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, American Lung Association and American Heart Association, said the bill would protect gambling establishment employees who, under current law, are subject to secondhand smoke during their shifts. 
Lobbyists on behalf of casinos in Iowa argued the bill would put them at a competitive disadvantage with casinos that do allow smoking. 
According to the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, exposure to secondhand smoke for nonsmokers increases the risk of lung cancer by about 20% and the majority of lung cancer is caused by tobacco use and exposure.
“I want to stress that there is no safe level of secondhand smoke exposure, making this an occupational hazard for casino workers,” Jackie Cale said on behalf of the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network in the subcommittee meeting. 
Cale and other speakers representing health organizations noted that Iowa has some of the highest cancer rates in the nation.
Data gathered by the American Nonsmokers’ Rights Foundation show that as of July 2025, 21 U.S. states had laws in place to prohibit smoking in gambling establishments. States with these laws include Iowa’s neighbors, Nebraska, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Illinois, but not Missouri.
Mary Earnhardt, on behalf of the Iowa Gaming Association, opposed the bill and noted that casinos on tribal lands do not have to adhere to smoking laws. She said the bill would “therefore create an uneven regulatory treatment among competitors operating in the same markets, both within and across state lines.” 
Earnhardt also pointed to revenue declines at casinos in Delaware and Shreveport, Louisiana, following local smoking bans. 
Traci Kennedy with Americans for Nonsmokers’ Rights opposed these claims, arguing there were additional economic factors that impacted the declines at those casinos. 
“The business model built on smoking in the year 2026 does not make sense,” Kennedy said. “Nearly 90% of the U.S. population are non-smokers, and so we’re catering to a smaller demographic.” 
A study conducted by C3 Gaming, a casino consulting firm, found that the COVID-19 pandemic caused “a radical change in consumer attitudes towards smoking in casinos” and that since the pandemic, casinos that implemented smoking prohibitions have not experienced a drop in revenue. 
Jake Highfill, speaking on behalf of Penn Entertainment and Ameristar, which is expanding a casino in Council Bluffs Iowa, said going to the casino is an “adult decision.” 
“Nobody’s making you go to the casino, it is 100% adults,” Highfill said. “Nobody’s dragging kids across the floor, let adults make adult decisions.” 
Joe Hafley, a former casino employee and representative for Casino Employees Against Smoking Effects, said secondhand smoke was “unavoidable” when he worked at a casino and caused him and other employees to develop persistent coughs and shortness of breath.
“For casino workers, exposure is not optional,” Hafley said. “We cannot step away from it, we breathe it in for the entirety of our shifts …There is no neutral position here. Every delay means more exposure, every delay increases the risk of serious illness.”
Tony Phillips, also with Penn Entertainment and Ameristar, said if the bill were enacted, it would put his company in “a direct competitive disadvantage” with nearby Prairie Flower Casino, operated by the Ponca Tribe of Nebraska. 
Bisignano said “greed” is the force pushing back on this bill. 
“I believe in this industry, but whether it’s Wall Street, or any street, greed isn’t good to me, because people get hurt by greed,” Bisignano said. 
Bisignano, who was joined by Sen. Dawn Driscoll, R-Williamsburg, in voting against the bill, said the bill “wasn’t going to go anywhere” and he didn’t want to give “false hope” by passing it out of the subcommittee. 
Sen. Dennis Guth, R-Klemme, who sponsored the bill and chaired the subcommittee, said he was “grieved” that the government was unable to play “its proper role.”
“The role of government is to protect its citizens, to protect its freedoms, and it’s not about economic development,” Guth said.

(Courtesy of Brown University Health)Aquidneck Island residents breathed a sigh of relief when Brown University Health committed to keeping the Noreen Stonor Drexel Birthing Center at Newport Hospital open through Sept. 30, 2026.
But Rep. Lauren Carson, a Newport Democrat, remains worried about the future of the award-winning labor and delivery unit and the thousands of residents whose health depends upon its services. That’s why Carson has introduced a bill putting up more guardrails against birthing center closures or service reductions.
The legislation, introduced Jan. 22, one day before national Maternal Health Awareness Day, sets up a rigorous review process led by the Rhode Island Department of Health before any birthing center can close, relocate or cut capacity or hours by 25% or more. 
“This issue is a very high priority not only for me but for all of my constituents,” Carson said in an interview Monday. “If you didn’t give birth at Newport Hospital, you were born there.”
Hospital executives last year said low service levels and lack of funding were why it was considering closing the birthing center.  The health care operator reported a $41.2 million profit for fiscal year 2025, which ended in September, according to audited year-end financial statements. 
Backlash from residents, local and state leaders and health care advocates prompted Brown Health to reconsider its cost-cutting move, with the health care operator pledging to keep the labor and delivery unit open through the end of its next fiscal year. A Community Advisory Panel set up by Brown Health held its first meeting in November to evaluate the birthing center’s future.
Carson was hopeful the appointed panel would be inclusive of the broad swath of community members affected. But so far, she hasn’t heard anything about the 12-member panel or its work, nor was she aware of when its second meeting was taking place.
“It’s not really clear to me or my constituents what’s going on there,” Carson said. “I’m the state representative. I would think if they were sharing information with the community, I would at least read about it in the newspaper.”
Members of the community advisory panel were asked to sign confidentiality agreements.
Brown Health’s website says the advisory panel will meet four times. No other meeting dates are listed. 
Nicole Searles, a spokesperson for Newport Hospital, did not answer questions about the advisory panel’s meeting schedule and outreach efforts. 
“Newport Hospital is actively exploring a range of potential strategies to ensure the birthing center’s long-term future and to preserve access to high-quality women’s health care,” Searles said in an emailed statement Monday. “Programs like the birthing center, which provide 24-hour access to critical services to respond to any women’s health emergency, are inherently resource-intense. Sustaining a high-quality program requires dedicated investment in recruiting and retaining specialized physicians and staff to ensure exceptional care.”
Searles continued, “We appreciate Rep Carson’s, and the entire Aquidneck Island delegation’s, continued support of our shared purpose of finding a sustainable path forward that ensures continued access to high-quality women’s health for our community.”
Carson’s bill, which has not yet been scheduled for a hearing, would require the owner of any birthing center to seek approval from the state health department, submitting a formal application at least 180 days beforehand. Notices to municipal leaders, patients, emergency services agencies, media outlets and state legislative leaders would also be required.
The application must include expansive financial documentation — five years of audited financial statements, five-year forward financial projections, capacity reviews, cash on hand, endowment and investments — alongside details on workforce, services, patient load and proposed transition plan. A comparative analysis of three alternatives to closing, including sharing staff with other area health care or facilities and community partnerships, would also be required.
The health department director would be required to review the application, holding at least two public hearings and consulting an independent expert — paid for by the applicant — to consider “sustainability, feasible restructuring alternatives, and pathways to avoid closure or significant reduction of services.”
The health department director can only authorize a closure or reduction in birthing center services if the operator demonstrates “clear and convincing evidence” that the facility cannot be “reasonably sustained” and that there are no other feasible alternatives, according to the bill. The proposed closure also cannot worsen outcomes for maternal or newborn health, racial, economic or geographic disparities, according to the proposed legislation.
Failure to comply with the state review process and application requirements would result in fines of up to $25,000 per violation per day.
Existing state law under the Hospital Conversions Act already requires primary care and emergency service operations to seek health department approval prior to closure. But the review process is shorter (90 days versus 180) and the scope of considerations narrower.
“I really wanted to open this up to discuss a very broad set of issues related to birthing centers,” Carson said. “I wanted to make sure we’re reviewing a wide variety of factors before we come to a conclusion.”
Annemarie Beardsworth, a spokesperson for the Rhode Island Department of Health, referred to the existing law governing regulatory reviews for hospital closures in an emailed statement Monday. She did not comment directly on Carson’s proposal. 
Lisa Tomasso, senior vice president of the Hospital Association of Rhode Island, which represents 16 hospitals and health care facilities in Rhode Island, including Newport Hospital, remained noncommittal in a statement Monday. She pledged to review Carson’s proposal and work with her as the legislative process continues. 
A companion bill has not yet been introduced in the Rhode Island Senate. Carson’s bill has also not been scheduled for an initial hearing.
The legislation, if approved, would take effect immediately, guaranteeing its application to a potential closure of the Newport birthing center since Brown Health’s new fiscal year starts on Oct. 1.

A long trend: How the Idaho Legislature has removed local governments’ powers

But after an unusually lengthy debate Monday, the Idaho House State Affairs Committee introduced the bill and removed language that would’ve banned local government entities from flying their own official flags. The new bill by Rep. Ted Hill, a Republican from Eagle, would create fines for government entities that violate a recent state law that banned state and local government entities from flying any flags other than official domestic government and military flags. 
Hill said the bill was targeted at Boise.
He falsely claimed that Boise Mayor Lauren McLean acted alone to make the LGBTQ+ pride flag an official flag of the city. The City Council voted to add the flag and organ donation flags as official city flags in May 2025, BoiseDev reported.
“She just made it so. She’s having to do this because she gave a middle finger to the Legislature, pretty much,” Hill told fellow lawmakers. “‘Hey, I’m not going to follow the law, and I’m going to do it the way I want to do it.’”
After the Utah Legislature passed a similar state law last year, the Salt Lake City council voted to adopt versions of new city flags that resemble the LGTBQ+ pride flag, the transgender pride flag and the Juneteenth flag, Utah News Dispatch reported.

Hill’s bill this year would allow Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador to enforce Idaho’s flag restriction law through lawsuits to stop cities from flying certain flags and seeking civil court fines. The bill would fine government entities that violate the flag ban law $2,000 each day, per each offending flag.
Hill’s bill would also amend last year’s flag ban law to allow Idaho government entities to display official flags of Idaho colleges or universities, and the Basque autonomous community flag.
Rep. Bruce Skaug, a Nampa Republican, proposed introducing the bill but removing the ban on government entities flying city and county flags. The committee widely supported Skaug’s motion on a 12-2 vote, just after a vote to introduce the bill but tweak it to ban flying other states’ flags failed on a 7-7 tie vote.
But after Skaug’s tweak to the bill, it isn’t immediately clear if it would allow Boise to be fined for flying the LGBTQ+ pride flag.
The bill could return for a full committee hearing with public testimony in the coming days and weeks, before it would advance to a full vote in the House. To become law, Idaho bills must pass the House and Senate and avoid the governor’s veto. 
Last year’s Idaho law restricting what flags state and local government entities can display was one of several bills that removed local governments’ powers, the Idaho Capital Sun reported.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – Open primary supporters on Monday said they turned in more than the number of needed signatures to get the issue on the ballot.
Proponents of State Question 836 said they submitted over 200,000 signatures to the Oklahoma Secretary of State for verification. The proposed constitutional amendment required 172,993 signatures.
“We are able to turn in these signatures today because hundreds of hardworking volunteers from every corner of the state stood in the wind, bitter cold, and the snow – even through the holidays – to get this on the ballot,” said Ken Setter, a supporter. “They did that because they understand that we can’t fix what’s broken in our state until we fix how we choose our leaders.”
If approved by voters, State Question 836 would require candidates for most elected offices to appear on a single primary ballot. Party affiliation would be listed.
All voters would be allowed to participate in the primary, regardless of party affiliation or lack of it.
The top two vote getters, regardless of party, would advance to the general election.
Currently, Oklahoma has a closed primary system, although state law allows recognized political parties to open their elections to unaffiliated voters. Democrats in the past have allowed independents to vote in their primaries, but Republicans and Libertarians have not.
All partisan primary elections will be closed to independents for the next two years after the State Election Board said no party notified them that they’d be open to independent voters. 
Supporters said the current closed primary system locks out too many voters and results in extreme conservatives being elected. Open primaries would force candidates to be responsive to all voters, supporters say. They also say the measure would increase voter turnout.
Many races are decided in the primary or primary runoff, leaving some voters with no candidate to pick in a general election, where voter turnout is higher.
The measure sustained a legal challenge and is opposed by more than 100 lawmakers.
In a recent letter, the opposing lawmakers wrote that the measure would limit voter choices, result in lower turnout and would help candidates advance by appealing to fringe voters.
Had the measure been law in 2018, voters would have to pick one of two Democrats for governor because the Republican vote was split among 10 candidates in the primary, the letter said.
The Oklahoma Legislature and all statewide elected offices are controlled by Republicans.
Supporters are hoping to get the state question on the November ballot after the Secretary of State verifies that supporters collected the required number of signatures.

The case involves 28-year-old Jorge Gonzalez Ochoa of Iowa City, who came to the United States from Colombia in 2024, seeking asylum and alleging he was fleeing persecution in the form of threats and extortion.
In October 2025, while still seeking permission to remain in the United States legally, Gonzalez Ochoa was charged by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement with unlawful use of a Social Security number and immigration documents. Prosecutors allege he worked under a false name, using a fraudulent Social Security card and permanent resident card to obtain a job at The Bread Garden Market, a restaurant in Iowa City, where he was arrested.

According to the subsequent findings of a U.S. magistrate in the case, there were members of the public in the area when Gonzalez Ochoa was arrested at The Bread Garden Market, and they asked the arresting ICE agents to identify themselves.
“No identification was made,” Magistrate Stephen B. Jackson found. “At the time of the arrest, the ICE agents were in plain clothes.”
At a hearing on Gonzalez Ochoa’s subsequent request for pretrial release, ICE agent Jess Liebold testified on behalf of the government but was unable to answer many questions about the case. “Based upon his testimony, it is clear Officer Liebold was not competent to testify,” Jackson later ruled. “Indeed, his testimony and lack of knowledge as to basic, material facts, undermines the government’s (case).”
Jackson noted that “nothing the government presented showed Gonzalez Ochoa posed a serious risk of flight … No evidence was shown to demonstrate he was using fraudulent documents for hiding his identity from ICE or to be able to travel undetected and surreptitiously. Instead, he was apparently using them to work, as he has a family to support. Indeed, the conditions of his release from ICE custody included a GPS monitor which he, apparently, wore in compliance with those conditions, as that is how ICE was able to monitor and locate him.”
Judge calls ICE actions ‘indefensible’ 
On Dec. 22, 2025, with the criminal charges still pending, a federal judge ordered Gonzalez Ochoa’s release, subject to supervision, while the case proceeded toward trial, which is now scheduled for March 2, 2026. The order required ICE to release Gonzalez Ochoa from the Muscatine County Jail at 10 a.m. on Dec. 23, 2025.
At 9:59 a.m. that day, officials with ICE sent the jail an arrest warrant and an accompanying “order to detain” for Gonzalez Ochoa. By law, those two documents should have been accompanied by a “notice to appear,” served in person at the jail, indicating when Gonzalez Ochoa could expect a court hearing on the matter. By all accounts, no such notice was provided, although ICE did eventually send a notice to Gonzalez Ochoa by regular mail.
Gonzalez Ochoa’s attorney, Katherine Melloy Goettel, objected and took ICE and the county jail to court, arguing ICE had unlawfully arrested her client and was keeping him unlawfully detained at the jail. She also argued Gonzalez Ochoa was being illegally denied a bond hearing and his due process rights.










ICE was required to allow Gonzalez Ochoa to be released at 10 a.m., period -- not to arrest him and then scramble around later to backfill crucial missing documents in a misleading way.


– U.S. District Judge Stephen H. Locher


Recently, U.S. District Judge Stephen Locher issued a ruling that was highly critical of ICE’s actions in the case.
“With no pending or newly initiated removal proceeding, ICE had no basis as of 10:00 a.m. on Dec. 23, 2025, to issue the arrest warrant or the order to detain Gonzalez Ochoa,” Locher ruled.
He noted that ICE then failed to provide Gonzalez Ochoa with the required notice to appear.
“The only logical explanation is that the Notice to Appear did not yet exist,” Locher found. “In context, it appears that ICE served the Notice to Appear by regular mail to obfuscate the timing of events and suggest that it might have been issued at the same time as the arrest warrant and order to detain. In other words, ICE knew [Locher’s emphasis] it should not have issued the arrest warrant and order to detain in the absence of a notice to appear, but sought to ‘cover its tracks.’ This is unacceptable.”
Locher went on state that “ICE was required to allow Gonzalez Ochoa to be released at 10 a.m., period — not to arrest him and then scramble around later to backfill crucial missing documents in a misleading way… ICE violated federal law and this court’s order dated Dec.  22, 2025, requiring him to be released. Again: This is unacceptable.”
Judge orders bond hearing
As for the argument that ICE was continuing to illegally hold Gonzalez Ochoa in the Muscatine County Jail, Locher ruled in the government’s favor finding that regardless of its earlier, illegal acts, “ICE eventually commenced a new removal proceeding and thus has the authority to detain Gonzalez Ochoa in connection therewith.”
On the issue of whether Gonzalez Ochoa is entitled to a bond hearing, Locher noted that an overwhelming number of judges have found no merit in the government’s argument that such detainees are subject to mandatory detention, and he ordered that a bond hearing for Gonzalez Ochoa be scheduled.
Muscatine County Jail officials said Monday that Gonzalez Ochoa was released on Jan. 9, 2026, seven days after Locher’s order was issued.
Andrew Kahl, the lead attorney for the government in the case, declined to comment on Locher’s ruling, as did MacKenzie Benson Tubbs, the public information officer for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Southern District of Iowa.
Since June of last year, more than 300 federal judges in 1,600 cases have ruled that the Trump administration’s interpretation of the law on bond hearings is incorrect, ignores decades of past practice, and conflicts other longstanding federal laws on immigration.
Despite those rulings, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, of which ICE is a part, and the U.S. Department of Justice continue to use that interpretation of the law to argue for mandatory detention. In addition, immigration judges — who are not part of the Judicial Branch and instead function as administrative employees of the Executive Branch led by the president — are continuing to deny detainees bond hearings unless otherwise ordered by a federal judge in U.S. District Court.

DOVER, Del. — Gov. Matt Meyer called on Delaware regulators to stop approving Delmarva Power rate hikes in his State of the State address, but the utility’s newest request remains pending before the Delaware Public Service Commission and will proceed under the same legal schedule.
Delmarva Power & Light filed the electric base-rate case on Dec. 9, 2025, seeking $67.8 million in additional base-rate revenue compared with rates approved in 2024 and an increase in the fixed monthly customer charge from $13.50 to $15.94, state officials said.
Under Delaware law, the company may implement the proposed rates on an interim basis — subject to refund if regulators later reduce or deny part of the request — with interim rates eligible to take effect July 9, 2026, according to the state.
Meyer’s remarks add political pressure, but they do not change the PSC’s docket or authority. In prepared remarks, Meyer said, “I call on the Public Service Commission to stop approving any Delmarva rate hikes,” arguing that “egregious price increases” have been passed along to families.
Public Advocate pushes back
The Delaware Division of the Public Advocate, which represents residential and small-business customers in rate cases, has criticized the filing and urged regulators to take a harder line as bills climb.
The case will move through discovery, testimony and hearings before the commission issues a final order, which state officials have said is expected later in 2026.
History: requests often reduced, rarely fully denied
Delmarva’s filing is its third electric base-rate case in roughly five years, and state officials noted that regulators have allowed “significantly less” than what the company sought across recent filings.
Regulators also have a track record of trimming large requests rather than rubber-stamping them. In one earlier electric rate docket resolved by settlement, the Delaware PSC authorized Delmarva to increase rates by $31.5 million, after the company’s original filing sought about $62.766 million.
At the same time, full denials of base-rate relief are uncommon in utility regulation because commissions are required to set rates that are “just and reasonable” — balancing consumer protections with a utility’s ability to recover prudent costs and earn an allowed return.
Who decides
The five-member Public Service Commission is led by Chairman Dallas Winslow, along with commissioners Joann Conaway, Harold Gray, Kim Drexler and Mike Karia, according to the PSC.
Another bill change is already scheduled
Separately from the base-rate case, new electric supply rates are scheduled to take effect June 1, 2026, state officials have said — a different part of customer bills than base distribution rates.

What it means for your bill
Two big takeaways: (1) this request is still under review, and (2) customers could see changes before the final ruling because of interim-rate rules.
1) A higher fixed charge could raise bills even if you use less power.Delmarva is asking to raise the monthly customer charge from $13.50 to $15.94 — an increase of $2.44 per month that applies regardless of usage.
2) Estimated bill impacts vary — depending on usage and whose calculation you’re reading.Recent reporting has cited different monthly estimates:


Delmarva estimate (example “average” usage): For a residential customer using about 810 kWh/month, Delmarva said the increase would be about $6.42 (about 4.13%) in one set of calculations.


Public comments reported by WBOC: Another estimate cited in coverage projected about $9.30 per month for a non-heating customer (about 16%) and closer to $15 per month for a space-heating customer (about 23%–24%).


Why the difference? The numbers can change based on the assumed monthly usage, how customer classes are defined (heating vs. non-heating), and what costs are included in the calculation.
3) When could you see a change?


Now through early summer: No base-rate increase is in effect yet; the case is still pending.


June 1, 2026: Separate electric supply rates are scheduled to change.


July 9, 2026: Delmarva may be eligible to put base-rate increases into effect on an interim basis, subject to refund, while the PSC finishes the case.


4) If interim rates go up and the PSC later cuts the request, refunds are possible.Interim rates are allowed “subject to refund,” meaning customers can be repaid if the final approved rates are lower than what was collected on an interim basis.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Delmarva_Retouched-5931.jpg,,,2026-01-26 16:56:43.498477

Akers, R-Kanawha, speaks on the House of Delegates floor in Charleston, West Virginia, on Jan. 23, 2026. (Photo by Perry Bennett/West Virginia Legislative Photography)West Virginia House of Delegates members are expected to vote on a bill involving undocumented immigrants this week as national attention turns on the issue after federal immigration officers shot and killed a second U.S. citizen over the weekend.
The House and Senate quickly gaveled in and out Monday due to the ongoing winter storm, and most members were absent as West Virginia is under a state of emergency.
In the GOP-controlled House, members had been expected to vote this week — as early as Tuesday — on a bill that would expand the state’s definitions of human trafficking, smuggling crimes, forced labor and more. The measure establishes specific felony penalties for the illegal transport of adults and minors.
House Bill 4433 defines human smuggling as transporting, isolating and harboring an illegal alien to avoid law enforcement. 
Del. Bill Ridenour, R-Jefferson
“I believe that the federal government is attempting to enforce laws, but that doesn’t mean that the state cannot engage in activities to either facilitate what the federal government is doing or to ensure the protection of our citizens as well,” said bill sponsor Del. Bill Ridenour, R-Jefferson.
Democratic House members are concerned that the bill could penalize church groups or nonprofit organizations helping undocumented immigrants, including giving them a ride to the grocery store.
“My concern is that these types of actions will subject people of faith to criminal penalties and time in jail,” said Del. Evan Hansen, D-Monongalia.
Del. Evan Hansen, D-Monongalia
As the House Judiciary Committee vetted the measure, Hansen asked, “Would they be involved in human smuggling based on this bill?”
Ridenour replied, “If they’re engaged in smuggling individuals into the state, then yes, they would be.” 
Del. Kayla Young, D-Kanawha
On the House floor Friday, Del. Kayla Young, D-Kanawha, attempted to amend the bill by editing the definition of human smuggling to include that it required an intent of financial or material benefit. Her amendment was in an effort to carve out protections for churches and individuals helping undocumented immigrants.
“I think we all want to go after people that are breaking the law,” Young said. “I want to make sure we’re targeting people that are profiting off of exploiting other people. This amendment clarifies that there would be a financial motive for people who are doing this for a capital gain.”
House Judiciary Chairman J.B. Akers, R-Kanawha, said the amendment wasn’t necessary because the bill already provided a safeguard for people working with immigrants without criminal intent.
“If you are someone who receives grant services — a church for example, who is transporting immigrants who may have illegal status — you could then be criminally liable and culpable if we adopt this amendment,” Akers said. “You do not have criminal liability under this bill if your purpose is simply to provide transportation services to someone [or] do a favor for somebody.” 
Akers added that the bill is in line with federal law on human smuggling. He urged rejection of Young’s amendment, and it was voted down.  
The bill also requires that perpetrators pay restitution to adult and child victims of human trafficking regardless of their immigration status after Akers amended it on the House floor last week. A judge would decide what the restitution would be.
The House passed similar measures in 2024 and last year, citing the border crisis. The bills stayed parked in the Senate. 
Lawmakers are scheduled to return to committee meetings and floor sessions on Tuesday.

West Virginians are encouraged to call 211, the state’s 24/7 call center, if they need help during the winter storm. 

Gov. Patrick Morrisey said West Virginia is dealing with a “a very dangerous cocktail” of ice, snow, sleet and cold temperatures. He has declared a State of Emergency for all 55 counties due to the winter storm that started over the weekend. 
“My message to folks becomes very clear: please stay home. Please stay off the roads. Only go out if you have to,” the governor said Monday during a news conference.

Tim Walz and President Donald Trump Monday morning, Trump said he will look into reducing the number of federal agents in Minnesota and talk to Homeland Security about independent Minnesota investigations into the fatal shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti, according to a statement from Walz’s office.
The call is the first public signal of rapprochement after months of angry rhetoric.
In a Truth Social post, Trump said that Walz called him “with the request to work together.” Trump said the call was “very good” and that the two “seemed to be on a similar wavelength.”
Trump also said that he spoke with Walz about his decision to send U.S. border czar Tom Homan to Minnesota to oversee ICE operations, which has led to speculation that Trump has lost confidence in current operations.
“He was happy that Tom Homan was going to Minnesota, and so am I!” Trump wrote in the post.
The call comes amid a two-month siege in federal immigration enforcement activity that Walz has sharply criticized, including in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece published after the call Monday, and two days after federal agents shot and killed 37-year-old Pretti.
Videos from multiple angles of the killing appear to show Pretti disarmed of a gun he never drew before he was shot by federal agents, contradicting the immediate narrative set by senior Trump administration officials that Pretti had posed a clear and present danger. Criticism of Trump’s deployment of over 3,000 federal agents to Minnesota has only grown since then, with some elected Republicans and gun rights groups expressing discomfort with the Trump administration officials placing the blame on Pretti.
Trump seems to be distancing himself from comments made by his administration officials in the immediate aftermath of the shooting. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller accused Alex Pretti of domestic terrorism Saturday. In a press briefing Monday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that Trump has not characterized Pretti as a domestic terrorist.
Leavitt still placed the blame for the shootings on Democratic leaders who “have actively defied federal immigration law and the will of the people.”
In the aftermath of the fatal shootings of Renee Good and Pretti, the feds have blocked the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension from accessing the crime scene and evidence, impeding an independent state-led investigation. After being ousted from the investigation into the killing of Good, Minnesota prosecutors asked the public for information to try to investigate the shooting without cooperation from the federal government.
The BCA was also impeded by the FBI in its investigation into the nonfatal shooting of Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis in north Minneapolis on January 16, saying in a statement that it has not been permitted to talk with the officer who fired the shot.
In the Monday call, the Walz statement said, Trump “agreed that he would talk to his Department of Homeland Security about ensuring the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is able to conduct an independent investigation, as would ordinarily be the case. The president also agreed to look into reducing the number of federal agents in Minnesota and working with the state in a more coordinated fashion on immigration enforcement regarding violent criminals.”
Walz’s office also said that the governor reminded Trump that the Minnesota Department of Corrections, which operates state prisons but not county jails, does honor federal “detainers” — written requests from ICE that law enforcement detain an individual for an additional 48 hours to give ICE time to decide to take the person into federal custody to begin removal proceedings. Top Trump administration officials have previously accused Minnesota law enforcement of not honoring detainers, including a claim that 1,360 individuals with ICE detainers are in Minnesota custody.
The Minnesota Department of Corrections created a new website Saturday to combat “ongoing misinformation” from Homeland Security, including clarifying that it does cooperate with ICE on detainers, and that there are around 301, not 1,360, people with ICE detainers in Minnesota state prisons and county jails. The DOC also said that the individual named by Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino as the target of the operation which led to Pretti’s killing did not have a significant criminal history, as Bovino alleged, and was previously released from immigration custody in 2018 — during the first Trump administration.

(Eddie Moore/Albuquerque Journal)The New Mexico official overseeing a newly created statewide Office of Housing on Monday cited “continuing uncertainty” with a federal homelessness prevention program as one reason her office needs $45 million in state funds to reduce homelessness. 
Last November, the federal Housing and Urban Development agency announced unexpected changes to its Continuum of Care grant program that would have resulted in up to 70% cuts to the state’s provision of permanent supportive housing to previously unhoused people. HUD’s Continuum of Care is the agency’s main anti-homelessness program. 
Department of Workforce Solutions Secretary Sarita Nair told the Senate Finance Committee in a presentation Monday that HUD’s announced changes would have threatened $16.7 million in rent payments that currently go to more than 1,000 landlords and 30 providers who help roughly 8,000 households stay housed. 
“That’s over 10,000 people who are in housing and stable, who are currently inside, because of the money that we get from the federal government,” she said. 
Santa Fe homeless shelter predicts doubled wait lists without federal funding

Multi-state lawsuits filed against HUD shortly after the November announcement prompted HUD to withdraw the announcement. And Nair said a congressional budget committee proposal released earlier this month “actually looks OK” in terms of homelessness funding, including the Continuum of Care and other emergency homelessness grants.
“But what we’re left with is just that continuing uncertainty,” she said, noting that even if the federal budget passes, the state could be in the same precarious position again soon, especially with the potential of more federal government shutdowns.
“Anytime you see that lack of continuity, we’re talking about people physically on the street,” she said. 
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s budget proposal seeks $110 million for housing, including the $45 million for programs combatting homelessness that would go to Nair’s department. 
Nair said that the request reflects the potential loss of HUD funding and builds on her office’s effort to tackle the state’s growing homelessness population and housing shortage. The Office of Housing became part of Workforce Solutions last April, after the Legislature awarded it more than $100 million to address housing and homelessness. 
Since then, Workforce Solution has announced spending on affordable housing development in Albuquerque and elsewhere, as well as a first-of-its kind statewide grant program for warming centers for unhoused people amid a recent cold snap.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250224-news-workforce-3-1024x674.jpg,,,2026-01-26 16:56:43.498477

Senate File 2002 would freeze tuition for resident students entering their first year at a public university, ensuring their payments won’t go up in the following years. If passed, the legislation would go into effect for students starting their first year of college during or after 2027.
Sen. Jesse Green, R-Boone, chaired the subcommittee and was joined by Sen. Herman Quirmbach, D-Ames, and Sen. Kerry Gruenhagen, R-Walcott.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“It sounds like an interesting idea, but there are a host of problems with implementing it,” Quirmbach said. “It may actually wind up costing people more.”
A bill signed into law last year by Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds required the Iowa Board of Regents explore potential tuition freezes at Iowa’s public universities. The board completed its study and submitted a report on its findings in November.
According to the report, tuition rate guarantees come with both benefits to students and families and risks for the institutions, mainly revenue erosion and the potential of budget shortfalls and limited ability to provide financial aid and support services to those who need it.
Members of the board of regents agreed to hold back on implementing any new tuition programs until they could see the results of a cap on tuition increases they previously approved that limits tuition increases to no more than the three-year rolling average of the Higher Education Price Index inflation rate.
Jillian Carlson, a state relations officer for the board of regents, cited the study during the subcommittee meeting, saying each state university has “significantly lower” tuition costs than their peer groups’ averages. Many institutions that have implemented tuition freezes have since ended those programs, she said, when economic downturns occur and state support shrinks.
Quirmbach said the board of regents is “doing a responsible thing trying to keep tuition rising too fast” with the tuition cap, and looking back over the past couple of decades, a “failure of the state to maintain support” has driven tuition increases.
If universities can’t raise tuition but still need to balance their budgett, Quirmbach said they would have to frontload charges, making tuition for first-year students higher than it would be otherwise but not increasing it during their undergraduate education. However, for students who drop out after one or two years, he said they’d be saddled with more debt but without the degree to help pay it back.
Students who switch programs while in college would also pose a complication in a tuition freeze, Quirmbach said, as many programs have different tuition levels to deal with program-specific expenses.
“I think if we want to give our families a predictable path for paying for college, we’ve got to keep up our end of the deal and maintain constant support,” Quirmbach said.
Both Green and Gruenhagen expressed interest in seeing the board’s report, and passed the legislation to the full Senate Education Committee in order to keep talks on the topic going.
“I believe it’s worth continuing the conversation, but I do look forward to seeing that study,” Gruenhagen said.

The Tennessee Department of Health confirmed three weather-related deaths as of Sunday night — all in West Tennessee — with one death in Crockett County, one in Haywood County, and one in Obion County.
Temperatures are expected to drop to single-digits Monday night. The National Weather Service issued an Extreme Cold Warning for all of West and Middle Tennessee from Monday evening through noon on Tuesday.
Nursing home residents experiencing a power outage in a small West Tennessee town evacuated their facility Sunday night as weather conditions worsened and temperatures continued to plummet. 
West Tennessee town without power, water for 18+ hours
Adamsville, a community of about 2,200 people in Hardin and McNairy counties, has been without water for at least 18 hours. The water service interruption is linked to widespread power outages that persist across most of McNairy County, according to the county’s emergency management agency.
Water service cannot be restored until power is restored, the agency announced on social media on Sunday night. Once water service is restored, the Adamsville water system will be under a boil water notice, the city stated. Residents should strain water through a clean cloth to remove particles and then bring the water to a rolling boil for at least one minute.
Adamsville resident Bethany Willard’s home lost power at around 3:30 a.m. Saturday. Willard and her two daughters are staying warm in one room with extra layers of clothing and blankets. The rest of the house is “ice cold,” and the water froze this morning, she told the Lookout over text. 
A family member delivered a propane heater Monday morning with about 12 hours of propane that they are conserving by using it for short periods, Willard said. They have a bathtub full of water and some extra water containers. The nearest warming station is about 15 minutes down the road from her home, but road conditions are dangerous.
“Right now, my biggest concern is not having a way to contact someone if we need help, if my phone dies and the power still isn’t on,” she wrote. “My cell service hasn’t worked until now. So we’re just hoping and praying that it will be (back on) any time.”

“At the moment, we are trying to look at opening an additional shelter, however, we have no resources available,” Smiley-Sliger said in a video streamed on Facebook. “I need volunteers to run that shelter … and I need food. Obviously, it’s hard to get stuff in right now.”
The shelter at People’s Tabernacle Church is becoming overloaded, she said, though limited space remains at Voices of Savannah. 
Road conditions are still treacherous — most main roads in Hardin County are “passable at best,” and side roads are “horrible,” Smiley-Sliger said. She encouraged everyone who is able to safely stay home to remain in their houses. People who are able to get out and willing to volunteer at a warming shelter should contact Hardin County EMA on Facebook, she said.
Those who are unable to leave their homes, without power and needing assistance reaching a warming center should also message the agency on Facebook, Smiley-Sliger said.
“We’ll be glad to attempt to get resources to you,” she said. “Right now, every resource in the county — fire, law enforcement, EMS, EMA — all of us are taxed. We’re doing the best we can.”
Electric services report working through dangerous conditions to restore power
Hardin County Fire Department Chief Melvin Martin described “total devastation with trees across all the roads” around 11 a.m. Monday. He said the county’s priority is clearing the roadways and getting power back on, but trees are still falling and complicating recovery efforts.
Local utilities and Pickwick Electric Cooperative, which provides power services to McNairy County in addition to portions of surrounding counties, reported 10,645 customers remained without power as of 11:30 a.m. Monday, down from 14,743 early Sunday. 
“Our crew members reported to work as quickly as possible … we have had several close calls and near misses due to falling trees, slick road conditions, and extreme cold as we have worked,” the cooperative stated on Facebook.
Outside help from multiple other utilities from neighboring counties to states as far as Florida have begun to arrive, and the cooperative is prioritizing power restoration to water pumps, health care buildings, nursing homes and other essential services, according to the cooperative’s Facebook post. 
“These conditions are extreme,” the cooperative stated. “Our crews have at times had to cut their way into spots to put a line up only to have a tree tear it back down.”

Davidson County residents and businesses account for more than 166,000 of customers without power as of 2:30 p.m. Monday, according to the Nashville Electric Service. The utility reported at least 153 broken poles. Power has been restored to 68,000 customers of the 230,000 that reported losing power over the weekend.
Nashville Electric Service reported doubling its workforce as of Monday, deploying about 400 line workers in addition to vegetation management and supplemental contract crews.
The utility stated that it can only safely reconnect power to buildings with undamaged weather heads, power masts and meter bases. Homeowners are responsible for this equipment and should contact a licensed electrician for repairs, Nashville Electric Service stated.
Gov. Lee: Tennessee facing ‘historic levels of snow and ice’
In an appearance on “Fox & Friends” Monday morning, Gov. Bill Lee described “historic levels of snow and ice” followed by frigid temperatures as low as single digits. 
“Our primary focus is … security of people’s lives,” he said.
More than 100 warming centers are open throughout the state, with locations available on the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency’s website. 
Lee also expressed gratitude for President Donald Trump’s quick approval of an emergency declaration for Tennessee, allowing the state to access resources from the Federal Emergency Management Agency for protective measures. This includes support for state-led efforts to restore power, clear roadways for emergency services, and other services to save lives and limit property damage, according to FEMA. 
Lee said the Tennessee Department of Transportation, Tennessee Highway Patrol, the National Guard and local and federal officials are cooperating in the storm response.

Michigan’s Extreme Risk Protection Order, or ERPO, law, which allows a person’s firearms to be temporarily removed from their possession in the case of a mental health crisis, was a point of focus for the 10th Annual Suicide Prevention Education Summit, hosted last week by Kevin’s Song, a Michigan charity aiming to grow awareness on the causes of suicide, as well as the Community Mental Health Association of Michigan. 
For April Zeoli, an associate professor of public health and a director at the Institute for Firearm Injury Prevention at the University of Michigan, the red flag law in Michigan is crucial for suicide prevention.
“What we know in research is that there are people who would be alive today if they hadn’t had access to a firearm when they were acutely suicidal,” Zeoli said in an opening keynote speech. “We also know that there are people who didn’t die because they didn’t have access to a firearm when they were acutely suicide, and extreme risk protection orders can help limit access to firearms.”
She noted that, of the 22 states that currently have some kind of red flag law on the books, many put those laws into place after a mass shooting, like that at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida or at Oxford High School in Michigan. Despite that, these laws are often used to prevent firearms being used in suicides as opposed to homicides or mass shootings. 
“We’re seeing cases in our work that we wish somebody knew what the ERPO was and that they had utilized it effectively,” said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller, emphasizing the importance of spreading information on how to effectively utilize these types of orders. “We have very few in our county.”

Jan. 23, 2026. | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance.
ERPOs are broadly popular across the United States, Zeoli said, and while firearm owners tend to have slightly lower levels of support for these types of laws, they are still overwhelmingly supported across the board.
“79% of gun owners said this is a good law. 89% of non gun owners said this is a good law. You can look at NRA members, non-NRA members,” she said. “You can break this down however you want, race, gender. A large majority, and when I say large, I mean over 70% of each group, finds that they support these laws.”
In Lansing, however, House Republicans have taken up legislation to overturn the ERPO law, arguing that even a temporary restriction on a person’s access to firearms is a violation of the Second Amendment. 
Fuller pushed back strongly against those concerns in a panel at the event. 
“There is no part of this that is against anyone’s constitutional rights. We have seen proven success,” he said. “Law enforcement can’t just take your firearms.”
“For our friends who want to repeal ERPO, I point to Florida,” added Danielle Hagaman-Clark, the Criminal Bureau Chief of the Michigan Department of Attorney General. “Florida is one of the most conservative states in terms of ideology, and they’ve had ERPO on the books since 2018, and have had over 10 thousand ERPOs that have been done in their state, and so they clearly work. They clearly are bipartisan in nature.”
Even some elected officials who were initially opposed to the law have come around to it, Zeoli added. 
“The sheriff in Livingston County went on the record before the ERPO law passed, and said that he wasn’t going to use these. He thought that they were unconstitutional, that the law shouldn’t be passed, and if it’s passed, he’s not going to use them,” she said. “He has used them.”
GOP Livingston Co. sheriff says he won’t enforce pending state ‘red flag’ gun laws

The role of firearms in suicide prevention was a key discussion topic at the event, even outside of discussions of the ERPO law. Cynthia Ewell-Foster, a clinical professor at the University of Michigan and Sarah Derwin, a health educator for the Marquette County Health Department, explained that especially in rural communities, firearms are involved in a high proportion of suicides — and for kids, that is often guns owned by their parents or grandparents. 
“We don’t want to start having conversations about firearms after we know that the kid is at risk for suicide. Let’s back it up and have those conversations while everybody’s doing okay,” Ewell-Foster said. “Let’s talk about it like bike helmets and seat belts and something that’s good for everybody.”
The ERPO system is not perfect, Hagaman-Clark said, and there are improvements she would like to see made — especially in terms of helping resolve the underlying issues that caused the ERPO to be granted in the first place.

“We’re good, at this point, at taking guns, right? We’re a gun taking state,” she said. “But what are we doing to make sure that that person who’s had their guns taken is doing anything to get back on the path to wellness?”
But despite that, Hagaman-Clark said that she was “really encouraged” by the use of ERPOs in Michigan in the last two years that the law has been in place.
“We’ve seen other states that have had this law in place, and have far fewer numbers even than what Michigan has,” she said. “I’m encouraged, and I think that the numbers of ERPOs are only going to go up as the word gets spread and as people recognize that it is an opportunity or another way in which we can keep our loved ones safe.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DSC_3849-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-26 16:56:43.498477

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)NJ Transit resumed limited service Monday after a one-day suspension while a storm blanketed parts of the state with up to 17 inches of snow, Gov. Mikie Sherrill said Monday.
Sherrill, speaking to reporters in Maplewood, commended the state Department of Transportation and transit officials for working throughout the storm to ensure people could safely travel.
“We saw everyone working together and at a really high level of preparation. It was pretty impressive, and the people of New Jersey, I think, should be very, very proud of their public workers and the people who serve the public for all of the hard work they did around the clock,” she said.
Gov. Sherrill says impeachment of U.S. homeland security chief ‘has to happen immediately’

As of early Monday afternoon, about 85 bus lines were operating — the agency oversees more than 250 bus routes — and most train lines were running on a weekend schedule. Trains will continue to operate on a weekend schedule on Tuesday, and commuters should expect some delays.
Sunday’s snowstorm marked the first major storm under Sherrill, who took office last Tuesday. She said she had been in contact with state officials during the transition period, aware that her swearing-in would take place in the middle of winter.
The storm was seen as her first major test, since extreme weather bedeviled some of her predecessors during their first years in office. A 2018 storm under former Gov. Phil Murphy led to massive gridlock on state highways and local roads, while ex-Gov. Chris Christie was criticized for remaining on vacation at Disney World when a blizzard hit in 2010.
Sherrill declared a state of emergency starting Saturday (she ended it Monday) and announced a temporary suspension of transit service, cutting bus, light rail, and access link services all day Sunday, with train service ending at 2 p.m. that day.
On Monday, NJ Transit President Kris Kolluri thanked Sherrill for leading with “pragmatism that we sorely needed.” The transit agency typically suffers during times of extreme heat and extreme cold.
“The storm is clearly over, but I remind everybody that the cold weather wreaks havoc on the infrastructure. Not just on our infrastructure, but the northeast corridor infrastructure, which is so critical for our service,” he said.
Kolluri also urged municipalities that own bus shelters to clean them to avoid having riders stand on roadways.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Georgia’s two Democratic senators are joining their colleagues in the U.S. Senate in a pledge to vote against a spending package that includes billions of dollars in funding for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
Senators have until Friday to pass the package of six bills, which includes a $64.4 billion Homeland Security appropriations bill that funds Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the U.S. Border Patrol. Failure to pass the package could lead to a partial government shutdown.
Sens. Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock are joining other members of their caucus in refusing to support the department in the wake of a second fatal shooting caught on camera in Minneapolis by a federal agent amid an immigration crackdown in the city.
The latest victim, a man killed on Saturday, was identified by authorities as 37-year-old Alex Pretti, U.S. citizen and registered nurse.
According to Reuters, the latest incident was one of five shootings involving federal agents in January, including the videotaped shooting death of 37-year-old Renee Good in Minneapolis on Jan. 7, which sparked demonstrations around the country, including in Georgia. Reuters reports that at least six immigrants have died in federal custody this month.
“Massively deployed and ill-trained Federal forces are violating civil liberties with impunity and showing reckless disregard for life and property,” Ossoff said in a statement. “Masked federal agents are detaining citizens without cause and raiding Americans’ homes without a judge’s warrant. A growing number of Americans have been assaulted or killed. This cannot be America. Democrats and Republicans alike must act to stop this spiraling chaos and protect our Constitutional rights.”
Ossoff is up for re-election in November.
Sen. Raphael Warnock echoed Ossoff’s comments in a social media post.
“I will vote NO on the funding bill for Trump’s ICE,” Warnock wrote. “They are killing Americans. Detaining children. Trampling our freedoms. We are losing our humanity.This is a defining moment for our nation. A moment for moral courage. We must stand together and say no.”
Senate Republicans need at least seven Democrats to vote for the spending measures to reach the needed 60-vote threshold, but Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, citing the killings of Pretti and Good, said his caucus will not provide the votes and called on the DHS bill to be split from the other five.
Gun rights
Federal officials characterized Pretti as a would-be terrorist intending to kill law enforcement, but videos of the incident seem to contradict those claims. Video does not appear to show Pretti brandishing his weapon or fighting with agents but does show an agent removing Pretti’s gun from his person before he is shot multiple times while on the ground.
Pretti was a lawful gun owner with a concealed carry permit and no criminal record, according to Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara.
Congressman Mike Collins, one of the Georgia Republicans vying to challenge Ossoff in November, addressed the incident in a social media post Saturday.
“Please do not fight with or interfere with law enforcement doing their job,” he wrote. “Please do not fight with or interfere with law enforcement doing their job and be armed while doing so.”
Members of the Libertarian Party of Georgia have said criticism of Pretti being armed at the protest is contrary to the Second Amendment and characterized the Minneapolis ICE action as extreme government overreach.
“The Libertarian Party of Georgia platform is explicit: government force must be strictly limited to the protection of individual rights to life, liberty, and property,” the party said in a statement Sunday. “Laws should apply only to violations involving force or fraud, and government must never be permitted to violate the rights it claims to protect. When federal agencies operate beyond these limits, they undermine public trust and erode constitutional protections for everyone.”
Election fallout
In a Monday press release, Ossoff called on his three main Republican rivals, Collins, Congressman Buddy Carter and former football coach Derek Dooley to repudiate the federal deployments in Minneapolis and other U.S. cities.
“Americans left, right, and center are shocked by the Trump Administration’s abuses of civil liberties and police state tactics. My opponents have a clear choice: do they stand with Trump or with Americans’ Constitutional rights? I challenge each of them to condemn and demand an end to the Trump Administration chaos that is undermining Americans’ core civil liberties,” Ossoff wrote.
In an email, Carter’s campaign said the congressman stands by an op-ed published in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution before the Pretti shooting calling for an increased ICE presence in Atlanta to deal with crimes committed by immigrants who are here illegally.
Carter accused Ossoff of prioritizing immigrants and criminals over funding the government.
“Ossoff is putting pedophiles, murderers, and rapists ahead of public safety,” he wrote. “Where was his outrage when Laken Riley’s rights were taken by a violent illegal from Venezuela? His faux anger is nothing more than a fearmongering fundraising tactic that will continue to put Americans in harm’s way by radicalizing them against the law enforcement agents charged with keeping them safe.”
Collins’ campaign pointed to a social media post criticizing Ossoff for what Collins characterized as being willing to risk a government shutdown.
“Last October, Jon Ossoff voted to shut down the government to give healthcare to illegal immigrants, blocking SNAP funds for hundreds of thousands of Georgians, delaying millions of dollars in Hurricane Helene relief for Georgia farmers, and throwing our country into turmoil,” Collins wrote on social media. “Today, he announced that he’s ready to shut down the government again to stop the Department of Homeland Security from detaining and deporting criminals he let into our country.”
Dooley’s campaign did not respond to requests for comment.
Georgia Democrats call for action
The latest killing spurred an outpour of reaction from Georgia politicians, particularly Democrats.
Following the Good shooting, Georgia Democrats called for a raft of legislation designed to limit the powers of ICE and other federal agents.
The bills proposed by Senate Democrats include requiring ICE agents to show their faces and badges while conducting operations and banning operations from places like churches and schools, passing them into law under a Republican-controlled legislature would be a difficult task.
Democrats are also pushing back against a proposed “large-scale” immigrant detention center in Social Circle southeast of Atlanta first reported on by the Washington Post.
The facility would reportedly hold between 5,000 and 10,000 detainees and be one of seven such facilities built around the country.
Georgia House Minority Leader Carolyn Hugley, a Columbus Democrat, said in a Monday statement citing Good and Pretti that such a facility would “bring the same chaos and heartbreak we’ve witnessed in Minnesota to our own communities here in Georgia.”
“We cannot — and will not — stand by while the administration replicates its failed Minnesota approach here in Georgia,” Hugley said. “Our children should not have to fear that their parents won’t come home. Our families should not live in constant terror. Our communities deserve better than to become testing grounds for policies that have already proven devastating elsewhere.”

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)An Iowa Senate subcommittee advanced a bill Monday that would make it a crime to engage in any acts attempting to alter the weather.
Senate Study Bill 3010 bans “geoengineering” activities for acts intending to “manipulate or alter the weather.” The legislation specifically points to activities like “cloud seeding,” “weather engineering” and “polluting atmospheric activity” — meaning the deliberate discharge of materials, including chemical substances, electromagnetic fields or pulses, sound waves or light pollution — with the intention to alter weather.
The measure would create a Class D criminal felony for people engaging in these activities, punishable by up to five years of incarceration and fines between $1,025 and $10,245. The bill states each day a person commits a violation of this ban counts as a separate offense. It also specifies that if an entity is suspected of committing “geoengineering” activities, the Iowa Department of Public Safety is directed to issue a cease and desist letter.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The measure is similar to a bill advanced through the Iowa House committee process during the 2025 session, House File 927. The two measures have slightly different language, with the House language prohibiting specifically “intentional emission of air contaminants into the atmosphere with the express purpose of affecting temperature, weather, or the intensity of sunlight.” The House measure would not impose criminal penalties, but would have required the Environmental Protection Commission to adopt emergency rules related to air quality that would address these practices.
Sen. Charlie McClintock, R-Alburnett, who introduced the Senate bill, said the measure was “the most compact version and the most reasonable version we could put together” to address some constituents’ concerns about cloud seeding and other alleged weather-altering methods.
Rep. Jeff Shipley, R-Fairfield, told senators at the subcommittee meeting he appreciated the measure being brought forward, and said he believed it was important for the state to establish rules on how these practices can take place.
Shipley said currently, “if I wanted to say, deploy a cloud seeding program over Van Buren County, there’s nothing in law, to my knowledge that’s currently preventing me from doing that, or any sort of regulation of oversight of that sort of activity.” He pointed to a 2025 law signed Florida as an example of what could be brought up in Iowa.
“Obviously, there’s a lot of appetite in the public in this discussion,” Shipley said. “There’s a lot of theories in the public about what could or cannot be going on. There’s a lot of various approaches that could be taken.”
One of the main drivers of conversations on geoengineering and related practices is the “chemtrails” conspiracy theory, which posits some aircraft are spraying certain chemicals that impact weather patterns as well as people’s health and fertility. Advocates with groups like the Iowa Atheists and Freethinkers spoke against the bill, saying the proposal is referencing and validating “pseudoscience” instead of addressing real environmental concerns.
One confirmed practice referenced in the bill is cloud seeding, where certain particles, like silver iodide crystals and salt, are added to existing clouds in order to cause rain or snow to fall that would not occur naturally. While there are not reports of the widespread use of cloud seeding in Iowa, this practice has been used in several western states to address drought or minimize hail damage.
Grayson Gee with the Rainmaker Technology Corporation, a U.S.-based cloud seeding startup, spoke in opposition to the inclusion of cloud seeding in the measure targeted at geoengineering practices.
Gee said cloud seeding has been “researched, regulated and transparently conducted in the United States for over 70 years,” and that it does not change weather patterns outside of encouraging precipitation.
“Cloud seeding doesn’t alter the temperature, doesn’t alter the sunlight, it doesn’t alter climate systems,” Gee said. “It doesn’t create clouds or storms, and it can’t produce precipitation out of clear skies. Its effectiveness depends entirely on the presence of suitable atmospheric conditions provided by nature.”
He said other proposed technologies related to geoengineering, like solar radiation modification or other stratospheric aerosol injection, are not well-studied or researched and have the potential to cause serious harm. Gee said it was important to distinguish between these ideas, which he called “conspiratorial and, frankly, somewhat concerning,” and existing practices like cloud seeding.
The measure was passed out of subcommittee unanimously. Sen. Izaah Knox, D-Des Moines, said he supported the bill moving forward as “there needs to be more conversation about this,” though he was not sure the current language is the correct approach. McClintock said there are still many steps before the bill would become law, but said he believed lawmakers are moving with “due diligence” to address Iowans’ concerns on the issue.

WILMINGTON, Del. — A Delaware-shot comedy is headed for a Maryland debut on the big screen — and the filmmakers are also urging Delaware audiences to stream it at home to catch familiar local sites, small businesses, and community faces in a feature film that’s a rare “made here” production for the First State.
The State Theatre in Harve de Grace, MD with be the premiere of the locally filmed movie The Conspiracists on 1/30/2026
The Conspiracists, a comedy mockumentary directed by Michael Perrie Jr. and co-written with Lacy Reily, screens Friday, Jan. 30, at The State Theater in Havre de Grace, Maryland, with a red-carpet arrival and a Q&A with cast and filmmakers, according to the production’s media alert.
The 2025 independent feature follows siblings Daisy and Eric Sureloc as they attempt to launch the world’s first all-inclusive conspiracy convention, “ConCon,” only to see their plans spiral into chaos and unexpected revelations.
While the Havre de Grace event is designed for a live audience, the film is already widely available — offering Delaware viewers an easy way to support a local project and play “spot the location” from the couch. The film is streaming on Amazon Prime Video and Verizon Fios, with additional distribution handled by Buffalo 8.
Delaware people in the credits
The film’s production team includes multiple Delaware-connected credits, including:


Christopher Robert Bruce, founder of Wilmington-based King Creative, is an executive producer.


Edward (Eddie) Layfield, an executive producer with Uncultured Swine, is a Delaware native.


Terrie Lynne, who plays Daisy, is an alumna of the Cab Calloway School of the Arts.


Guy Wellman, part of the cast and described in coverage as having grown up in Newark.


The film’s official “Team” page also lists a full slate of crew roles — from cinematography and sound to hair/makeup and production assistants — reflecting a broad regional collaboration behind the camera.
Delaware locations featured on screen
Promotional materials and regional coverage cite multiple Delaware locations used in filming, including:


Hotel du Pont (Wilmington)


The Grand Opera House (Wilmington)


Siegel Jewish Community Center (Siegel JCC)


Captain Blue Hen Comics (Newark)


Precious Paws and Delaware Tire Center


A feature on the Wilmington premiere reported the movie was filmed across 12 Delaware locations, positioning the project as a home-state showcase.
Why Delaware viewers may want to stream it
Delaware rarely sees independent features shot locally at this scale, and the filmmakers have emphasized that local participation — from locations to crew to extras — helped make the project possible.
For audiences, that translates into something personal: a comedy you can watch for laughs, then watch again to recognize places you’ve been — and support a Delaware-made film by clicking “play.”

Subcommittees of the House Appropriations Committee have been meeting since mid-January to make additions or subtractions that would subsequently be considered by the full House and Senate before the finished product went to Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly. GOP leadership is in a rush to tweak the current 2026 fiscal year budget and pass a budget for fiscal year 2027 before adjourning so incumbents could hit the campaign trail.
Dylan Dear, assistant director for fiscal affairs at the nonpartisan Kansas Legislative Research Department, told members of the committee that an interim House and Senate panel placed the starting point of budget talks in House Bill 2434. In that baseline bill, he said, there was no new money for escalating wages of state employees, hiring personnel or bolstering agency programs. Portions of the proposed budgets — capitol improvements, for example — were left intact.
An array of House subcommittees have started sharing with their peers a collection of ideas for refining the budget draft.
“Some of that money is restored. Some of that money is further deleted. Other adjustments are being made,” Dear said.
No agency or individual sought to testify Monday on the unfinished bill, but subcommittee recommendations did draw attention of legislators.
Rep. David Buehler, a Lansing Republican, said his subcommittee wanted to restore $650,000 for operating expenses of the Kansas Office of Veterans Services that was dropped from the current year’s budget.
In terms of the upcoming budget, Buehler said the subcommittee endorsed a $77,000 increase to cover higher office rent after the Office of Veterans Services moved from a privately owned structure in Topeka into a larger space in the Landon State Office Building.
Rep. Sean Tarwater, R-Stilwell, said he was puzzled the Office of Veterans Services’ rent costs went up upon relocating to a state-owned building. There has been an unusually high number of agency moves in the past year because of the opening of the rebuilt Docking State Office Building.
“Is the agency growing that fast?” Tarwater said. “That’s a lot of money to spend on a move, plus they have to pay for renovations.”
Rep. Barbara Ballard, D-Lawrence, said it was “kind of weird when you’re charging more when you come to a public building.”
Buehler said the subcommittee didn’t include $162,000 to hire an attorney for the Office of Veterans Services, but Buehler said there was merit to the proposal because the current method of seeking legal counsel was “very clunky.”
“It certainly would seem to be a needed function,” said Buehler, a retired U.S. Navy officer.
Each agency seeking more state funding for personnel ought to report to the Legislature the number of full-time staff, how many job vacancies existed and how long those jobs had been empty, said Rep. Barb Wasinger, R-Hays.
Rep. Avery Anderson, R-Newton, said his subcommittee recommended restoring $1.4 million to a substance abuse program serving people who had been incarcerated. He said the governor’s budget wouldn’t fill the gap in a program offering 18-months of support to reduce recidivism.
“Our committee felt like this is a very important program,” Anderson said. “This is one of those things where we believe the governor supports (it) and intentionally kind of underfunds and expects the Legislature to come in and fund it in full.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Seat-Tarwater-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-26 16:56:43.498477

A legislator wants to sell “unnecessary” state lands for “homestead clusters” of 10-acre lots to achieve the American Dream. Plus, he says it “might help the habitat.”
The post A Wyoming lawmaker wants to sell state land at $1 per acre for affordable housing appeared first on WyoFile .","A legislator who proposes that Wyoming sell “unnecessary” state-owned land for $1 an acre for affordable housing said his plan for new communities of 10-acre lots might also help wildlife habitat.
Rep. Jacob Wasserburger, a Cheyenne Republican, told WyoFile he doesn’t know how much land might qualify for sale under his House Bill 55 “ Wyoming homestead opportunity program.” He introduced the 19-page bill Thursday.
“Right now I’m still learning where the potential opportunities are,” Wasserburger said. Regarding the acreage that might be available, he said, “I don’t have 100% full certainty how much.”
In addition to providing affordable housing for Wyoming residents, building out instead of up could help the state’s wildlife, he said.
“We keep talking about affordable housing … but, the only [current] solution is subsidized apartment complexes.” Jacob Wasserburger
“I actually think it might help the habitat,” he said, by devoting property to homesteads instead of wind farms and data centers. “That saves the eagles from getting their lungs collapsed,” and he added, saves bats from being struck by turbine blades.
The bill targets Wyoming lands designated as “unnecessary for state needs.” It would exclude acreage dedicated to funding schools and institutions and land used for wildlife refuges, parks, landmarks, historic sites and other public areas.
Wasserburger admitted to getting “quite a beating from the public” and legislators regarding his bill last week. That continued over the weekend.
“This is a terrible idea,” Rep. Mike Yin, a Jackson Democrat, said. Rep. Karlee Provenza, a Laramie Democrat, agreed.
“It’s likely this bill does nothing but continues the narrative that we should sell public lands,” she said. “It’s a foot-in-the-door technique that public land owners must see for what it is — a dishonest attempt to try and take our land.”
Land lottery
The bill would provide $250,000 to the Office of State Lands and Investments to inventory property that would meet Wasserburger’s criteria. Such “homestead clusters” would range from 3,000 to 10,000 acres, containing between 300 to 1,000 lots of 10 acres each, the measure states.
The Office of State Lands and Investments already maintains an online map with codes attached to each parcel showing where revenue from each parcel goes, agency officials said in an email Monday.

“It is unclear exactly how many acres would be eligible for sale if [HB 55] were to pass,” the email reads. “Determining this will take significant detail[ed] study.”
The lots would be sold to Wyoming residents — living in the state for a year — through a lottery and would be reserved for “detached” single-family homes. A person could own a maximum of 25 acres. Businesses and corporations would be barred.
“We keep talking about affordable housing, affordable housing, affordable housing,” Wasserburger said. But, “the only [current] solution is subsidized apartment complexes.”
In such “condensed areas … the crime rate gets to be pretty high,” Wasserburger said. “It’s just not really a healthy way to live, in my opinion.”
In a press release announcing the bill, Wasserburger offered this reasoning behind his measure, referring to himself in the third person.
“While liberal elites want to import the third world and pack everyone into dense high-crime urban areas owned by Wall Street, Wasserburger’s landmark legislation delivers the opposite: families living on affordable acres of land away from big cities,” the release reads. “Radical leftists opened America to the third world which not only drove up housing prices for American families, but also led America into a historic housing deficit.”
Tapping the housing crisis to justify opening publicly owned lands to development is drawing sharp opposition.
“Folks are using the crisis around affordability, the crisis around housing, the crisis around health care, the crisis of groceries, to justify things like tariffs that are illegal, unconstitutional,” Rep. Melanie Stansbury, a New Mexico Democrat, said at a meeting of the House Natural Resources Committee in December. Those people are “justifying opening your public lands and resources … then trying to convince the American people that we’re doing this to help you with the everyday costs that are affecting you.
“It’s just complete f***ing bullshit,” she said.
Out, not up
Rather than having people living in a “built up” vertical environment, “we could have people spread out across land,” Wasserburger said. “People would have the opportunity of the American dream.”
There’s one 640-acre section north of Niobrara County’s Manville, population 95, that could qualify, he said.
The state owns about 3.9 million acres, but only about 16,000 might be unencumbered by leases or other uses and potentially qualify under Waserburger’s criteria, Sen. Mike Gierau, a Jackson Democrat, said. Most of the acreage is leased for grazing, oil and gas development or used for state functions like government, hospitals, prisons, state parks or the Wyoming Game and Fish Department.
Gierau was skeptical the bill could work. 
“There may be 5 acres here, 20 acres there,” he said.
Other institutions and agencies like the University of Wyoming, Department of Transportation, Department of Health and military also own or administer state property, Provenza said.
“This bill is not solving a problem, but certainly is creating many more,” she said.

MAURA HEALEY demanded Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem resign on Monday, following outrage that erupted around the nation this weekend after federal agents fatally shot Alex Pretti in Minneapolis.
Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse at the Minneapolis VA hospital, was killed Saturday during an encounter with with federal immigration agents amid a surge of Immigration Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol activity in Minnesota. He was the second US citizen fatally shot by federal agents in Minneapolis this month; Renee Nicole Good was killed earlier during a separate encounter.
Videos of Pretti’s death show a chaotic scuffle with several ICA agents moments before shots were fired.
Healey on Monday escalated her criticism of the administration, calling on Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to resign, alleging agencies under her purview are “harming public safety.”
“Kristi Noem has got to go. Kristi Noem’s got to go,” she said during a press conference.
“It is just an example of how out of control ICE is,” Healey said. “We have people who are clearly untrained who work for ICE … So my heart goes out to Alex Pretti, to his co-workers, and I really hope Americans take this in and understand the very sad and dangerous moment we’ve reached in this country.”
Healey referenced an internal ICE memo made public last week that directs agents to use force to enter a residence with only an administrative warrant, which are signed by ICE officials and do not require a judge’s approval. 
“That basically said, throw away everything we’ve done for 250 years. Throw away the Fourth Amendment. You have the right to go into someone’s home,” Healey said. “As governor of Massachusetts that infuriates me, because 250 years ago it was a lawyer named James Otis who stood before a court here in the commonwealth and said it is wrong for British soldiers to be able to go into people’s homes without a warrant and ransack their property. That’s what led John Adams to write the Massachusetts Constitution, which said that’s wrong, and people have a right, and that right later appeared in the United States Constitution.”
Federal officials defended the actions of the US Border Patrol agents involved in Pretti’s killing. 
The Department of Homeland Security said agents acted in self-defense. Noem said Pretti “approached” officers with a “9mm semi-automatic handgun” and “reacted violently” when they tried to disarm him, prompting an officer to fire “defensive shots.” White House adviser Stephen Miller escalated the rhetoric, calling Pretti a “a would-be assassin” who “tried to murder federal law enforcement and the official Democrat acount sides with the terrorists.”
Those assertions were sharply rejected by Democratic officials in Massachusetts, many of whom cited the video footage of Pretti holding a cellphone, not a gun, in his hand. They also said Pretti had already been disarmed and was laying on the ground when he was shot. Healey said there were “lies” and “efforts to smear Alex Pretti and who he was” after his killing. 
“With the repulsive murder of Alex Pretti, the Trump Administration has further demonstrated that it views American citizens exercising their Constitutional rights as a threat,” Senate President Karen Spilka said. “It is impossible to overstate how dangerous this is.”
Congressman Bill Keating urged the public to “watch the videos,” and “count the shots” saying, “The statements by Trump officials are false on their face.”
Congressman Jim McGovern said he was “so goddamn angry,” accusing Noem and Miller of trying to portray “the man who was murdered… as somehow a domestic terrorist.”
Congressman Seth Moulton, a Marine veteran, appeared on MSNBC and CNN to discuss the killing. 
On MSNBC, he said, “This is Gestapo type stuff happening in the streets of America.” Asked about Miller’s comments, Moulton replied, “No, Stephen Miller is a domestic terrorist.” 
Moulton also warned that fear is spreading in Massachusetts communities. “Everywhere I go… people are scared. People are really scared, and they’re scared for good reason,” he said, adding that the administration’s actions were intended to “terrorize blue cities across America.”
Congressman Lori Trahan said, “The brutal murders of two American citizens in Minneapolis made clear that the communities ICE enters are less safe than they were before,” and argued that if Trump would not fire Noem, “Congress must step in and remove her.” Congressman Jake Auchincloss said, “Public safety is the first duty of government,” calling ICE “an active threat” and demanding a “thorough investigation.”
US Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey tied Pretti’s killing to the fight over the Department of Homeland Security budget. “Congress must stop the violence by ICE, not bankroll it,” Warren said, arguing that funding for DHS and ICE should be stripped out of a government spending package and debated as a standalone bill. 
Senate Democrats have made clear they will oppose any appropriations legislation that includes DHS funding without significant reforms, a stance that has put pressure on party leaders and raised the prospect of a partial government shutdown when current funding expires at the end of the month. 
Democratic opposition has grown even among senators who previously helped avert a shutdown, with several saying they will vote “no” on the DHS funding bill as it stands, leaving the measure unable to garner the 60 votes needed to proceed in the Senate without changes. 
Markey called Pretti’s killing “a classic example of excessive use of force” and warned that the country was “descending into authoritarianism day by day.”
Outside elected office, advocacy groups also weighed in. 
The Massachusetts Nurses Association condemned what it called the “unwarranted and brutal killing of Alex Pretti,” saying he was gunned down while “engaging in his lawful right to observe and document.”
The Metro Mayors Coalition described the ICE surge as a “militarized invasion” that was eroding community trust and public safety.
In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, President Donald Trump declined to directly say whether the Border Patrol agent who shot Pretti did the right thing, saying, “We’re looking, we’re reviewing everything and will come out with a determination.”
He added, “I don’t like any shooting. I don’t like it,” while criticizing Pretti for attending a protest while armed, adding, “But I don’t like it when somebody goes into a protest and he’s got a very powerful, fully loaded gun with two magazines loaded up with bullets also. That doesn’t play good either.” 
The president also signaled that immigration enforcement officers would leave Minneapolis “at some point” but offered no timeline, and said his administration was considering how to “review everything” about the incident as it unfolds.
At the same time, some Republicans have called for deeper scrutiny. 
House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Andrew Garbarino of New York said his “top priority remains keeping Americans safe.” Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana called the shooting “incredibly disturbing” and said “the credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake,” urging “a full joint federal and state investigation.” Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina called for a “thorough and impartial investigation.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/6977be3a839ed.image_.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-26 15:57:16.219773

(Photo by Paul Hyde/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — A winter storm that blasted the country with freezing temperatures and snow brought power outages, travel delays and some snow to South Carolina over the weekend.
No deaths or serious injuries have been reported in South Carolina from Winter Storm Fern’s freezing temperatures and snow. A state of emergency remained in effect Monday afternoon, and the state had the potential to see freezing temperatures again overnight.
By declaring a state of emergency, Gov. Henry McMaster activated the state’s Emergency Operations Plan and allowed the National Guard to respond as needed. The state’s law against price gouging also went into effect with the emergency declaration.
Power outages
The storm caused power outages, especially throughout the Upstate, as ice accumulated on power lines or brought down tree limbs. Around 30,000 people and businesses across the state were without power as of Monday afternoon.
That included nearly 15,000 outages in Pickens County, 10,000 in Oconee County and 5,000 in Greenville by 3 p.m. Monday, according to Power Outage, a site that tracks outages across states and utilities.

To keep food fresh during power outages, keep refrigerator and freezer doors closed as much as possible, the state Department of Environmental Services advised.
Anyone using generators to heat their homes during the cold snap should be sure to place them outside and not in the house or a garage. Never use an open oven or gas stove to heat a home, since that comes with high risk of carbon monoxide poisoning and fires, state and federal agencies cautioned.
Other ways of staying warm include bundling up and keeping all members of a household in the same room, with doors to other rooms closed. If temperatures are falling too low, seek shelter elsewhere.
Freezing temperatures and closures
In the Upstate on Monday, which got the brunt of the storm, few trucks and cars could be seen on normally busy streets. Upstate officials said the area had not been hit by an ice storm of this magnitude since 2005.
Small cities were like ghost towns as most businesses remained closed, though some stalwarts like QT stations and Waffle House were open, enjoying a moderate business. Arts events at Greenville’s theaters and the Peace Center were canceled over the weekend.
School districts across the Upstate were closed with plans to remain closed through Tuesday. Monday and Tuesday were classified as “e-learning” days for students at Greenville County Schools, the state’s largest district.
Clemson University and Tri-County Technical College canceled classes Monday. University of South Carolina students had a late start at 11 a.m.

Neither the House nor Senate will return to their chambers until Wednesday, though some House committee meetings are still scheduled for Tuesday.
Law enforcement throughout the Upstate and Midlands urged residents to stay home over the weekend, with some warnings continuing into Monday. Even if rain or snow is not actively falling, roads can remain slick with ice, officials warned.
On Sunday, with a break in the icy rain, some Upstate residents took the opportunity to enjoy some sledding in ice-covered parks and on school grounds. The area got 1 1/2 inches of snow, according to the National Weather Service — more than a typical January day but less than the record for that day in 1923, which is 2.3 inches.
The highest two-day snowfall ever recorded in South Carolina occurred in February 1969, when nearly 29 inches fell in Caesars Head State Park in Greenville County, according to the state climatology office. Several years later, in 1973, Rimini in Clarendon County saw 2 feet of snow. More recently, Winthrop University recorded snowbanks of just over 17 inches in February 2004.
In the Midlands on Saturday night and into Sunday, Icy rain left a sheet of frost, making roads slick. Temperatures climbed Sunday night and into Monday, melting ice into puddles by Monday afternoon.
Any stray snowflakes in the Midlands air did not accumulate enough to calculate a snowfall amount, according to the National Weather Service.
Temperatures along the coast hovered around freezing throughout the weekend. Charleston stayed above a comparatively balmy low of 32 degrees Sunday, while the Grand Strand’s temperatures fell as low as 28 degrees.
Travel impacts
The state Department of Transportation urged drivers to remain cautious Monday. Crews are working to clear interstates and busy thoroughfares from snow and ice, as well as downed tree limbs. Highways, ramps and bridges get top priority because they ice over more quickly than other roads, according to the agency.

Travelers felt the lingering effects of the storm Monday, as airports across the state canceled or delayed both arriving and departing flights, especially to states that got hit with heavier snow and ice.
At Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport, all departures were canceled on
Sunday. Many arriving or departing flights were canceled Monday as well.
Every flight out of Charleston International Airport on Monday morning was canceled or delayed, though some afternoon flights started to take off on time. The same was the case at Columbia Metropolitan Airport.
What’s coming?
Much of the state will be under a cold weather advisory Monday night into Tuesday morning, according to the National Weather Service.
Those in the Upstate should expect temperatures as low as 11 degrees overnight, with an advisory running from 6 p.m. Monday to noon Tuesday. Columbia could get down to 14 degrees, and coastal residents could experience temperatures in the 20s, according to weather service forecasts.
Warming stations for those without power or a place to stay opened throughout the Upstate and Midlands. More information about Department of Emergency Management shelters is available by visiting the agency’s website.
Shelters for those who rely on medical equipment requiring power are available upon request by calling (833) 351-9990.



Cold weather advisories

Columbia: 10 p.m. Monday to 10 a.m. Tuesday, with a low of 14 degrees
Charleston: 10 p.m. Monday to 9 a.m. Tuesday, with a low of 26 degrees

(Photo courtesy Cordelia Kellie) In Washington, D.C., politicians are debating U.S. annexation of Greenland based on abstract ideas like “defense,” “security,” and “critical minerals.”
In Alaska, the issue is personal.
The state’s ties with Greenland go back centuries, to when the ancestors of the island’s Indigenous residents migrated east from Western Alaska.
Today, many Alaskans count Greenlanders as friends, colleagues or kin who speak a closely related language and participate in similar cultural traditions — and some Alaskans are now calling for solidarity against the actions threatened by their own president.
“We are witnessing, on a world stage, harm against our family,” said Ayyu Qassataq, an Anchorage-based Iñupiaq and Yup’ik advocate.
It is “disturbing on a visceral level,” she added.
Alaska’s connections to Greenland extend beyond cultural relations.
Alaskan scientists work alongside Greenlanders, studying oceans, glaciers, and climate change, and policymakers from both places have sat beside each other at international forums like the Arctic Council. The president’s rhetoric, some critics say, could strain those relationships, along with U.S. geopolitical alliances.
But Trump’s comments are provoking particularly intense feelings of anxiety and concern among some of Alaska’s Indigenous communities.
Greenland, an autonomous country within the Kingdom of Denmark, is home to some 57,000 people, most of whom are Inuit and whose ancestors came from Alaska about 1,000 years ago.
Today, Greenlanders and Alaska’s Iñupiat speak languages with the same roots and carry on many of the same traditions in music, art and food. Both peoples are Inuit — a broader group that encompasses Indigenous residents of multiple Arctic regions.

“We are essentially the same people that just speak different dialects of the same language,” said Tim Argetsinger, who’s Iñupiaq from Northwest Alaska and currently lives in Nuuk, Greenland’s capital.
Argetsinger told Northern Journal that some Greenlanders are selling their homes and moving off the island because they’re afraid and uncertain about their future.
“The sense of fear and anxiety is very palpable,” he said.
As Trump’s threats have escalated in the past week, Inuit leaders in Alaska have made increasingly passionate pleas of support for Greenlanders, who overwhelmingly oppose American annexation.
Alaska’s branch of the Inuit Circumpolar Council — a transnational body representing Indigenous people in Alaska, Russia, Canada and Greenland — released a rare political statement this week. It affirmed the council’s “support and solidarity” with Greenlanders and called on the U.S. to “respect and uphold international law and rules-based order that honors diplomacy and Inuit rights.”
“We stand united with our Greenlandic relatives,” said Marie Greene, an Iñupiaq elder from the Northwest Alaska village of Deering who’s the president of ICC’s Alaska arm.
Others, like Qassataq, have shared videos on social media expressing support alongside Inuit from Alaska and Canada.
Qassataq, who runs a consulting business, Qulliq Munaqtuġuut, that promotes Indigenous self-determination and well-being, has traveled to Greenland multiple times over the past year to work on Inuit healing and advocacy efforts and to teach courses on Inuit culture at Ilisimatusarfik, Greenland’s university.
Like many Alaskans, she has good friends there and has been in close contact with them over the past week, she said.
Greenlanders are “having very real conversations” not only about the island’s political future but also their personal safety, in light of Trump’s militaristic rhetoric, Qassataq said.
“Because we care so much for them, we feel deeply what they’re experiencing and what their fears are,” she said. “Though we are separated by hundreds of years, false borders and different colonial influences, they are our family.”
Qassataq and other Alaskans said in recent interviews that they grew up hearing about Greenland from relatives and Inuit leaders.
Cordelia Qiġñaaq Kellie, who’s Iñupiaq and lives in Anchorage, said the topic of Greenland would come up frequently in conversations well before Trump’s threats, indicating the long-standing connections between Alaskans and Greenlanders.
“Oftentimes, if I mention Greenland, friends and community members will respond with, ‘Oh, when I was in Greenland…,’ beyond those I was aware had ever been there,” she said.  “Sometimes people joke that we need to go to Greenland to learn our language because it’s so similar.”
Along with a few other Alaskans, Kellie went to Nuuk last year as part of an Inuit Circumpolar Council policy workshop for young Inuit leaders.  She has kept up her friendships with some of the Greenlanders that she met there. One recently visited Anchorage. She’s been checking in on others.
“It was like Inuit summer camp,” Kellie said of the workshop.
In Nuuk, she experienced being in a “majority-Inuit society” for the first time, she said.

“Oftentimes, we can think of Alaskan Inuit rural hubs in a cloistered context,” she said. “But imagine if the United States had been replaced with all Inuit people.”
“You go to a sushi restaurant, and they have beluga sushi,” Kellie added. It tastes “just like beluga from home.”

(Photo by John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)Eleven people, including a former prison food service contract worker, inmates alleged to be gang members and non-inmates have been indicted in Bon Homme County on a host of drug-related charges tied to a November overdose death at Mike Durfee State Prison in Springfield.
South Dakota Attorney General Marty Jackley announced the charges at a Monday press conference in Pierre. The charges flow from an inquiry led by the state Division of Criminal Investigation into the November death of inmate Timothy Tyree, one of eight men who died of drug overdoses in the state’s prisons last year.
‘Moral leadership’ needed to stop South Dakota prison overdose deaths, inmates and activists say

All but one of those deaths has been linked to K2, a synthetic drug typically sprayed on paper and smoked. To the naked eye, paper soaked in K2 is indistinguishable from untainted paper.
In addition to the charges, investigators seized three sheets of K2 with 61 stamp-sized doses, said Jackley. The day Tyree was found unresponsive, Jackley said, “numerous individuals” at Durfee were “sick from K2.” 
Last year, Jackley’s office charged inmates, a former correctional officer and others outside the prison walls in connection with other overdose deaths at the state penitentiary in Sioux Falls and the penitentiary’s Jameson Annex. 
“I think we’re slowing it down,” he said of drug trafficking in the state’s prisons.
The distribution ring in Springfield that was broken up in the current investigation hinged on the alleged cooperation of a now-former contract worker in the Durfee kitchen. People outside the prison would deliver the K2 to her, Jackley explained, and she would hand it off to inmates inside the prison for distribution from there.
The most serious charge faced by the 11 is distribution of controlled substances resulting in death. Each person was indicted on that charge, which carries a penalty of up to 25 years in prison.
Two of the inmates indicted in the Tyree case have detainment orders from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Jackley said, meaning they’d have been handed off to ICE upon parole. 
Jackley said his office intends to pursue the state-level charges in the indictments, but he would defer to the federal agency on what happens when the parole dates arrive later this year.
“To the extent it makes more sense to have ICE take further action, I will be supportive of that and will work with them on those decisions,” Jackley said.

Oct. 22, 2025. | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance. Before Michigan ever sees federal officers flood our streets, before another video shocks the conscience, the warning signs are already here — and they are coming from inside our own state government.
As Michigan Advance reported last week, a group of Michigan House Republicans has now openly threatened the funding of state courts if the Michigan Supreme Court adopts a rule that would have the effect of limiting most immigration arrests in courthouses.
In other words, lawmakers are signaling that judicial independence itself is conditional and that courts will be punished for attempting to protect basic access to justice.
This is not a side issue. It is the canary in the coal mine.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Courts are where people go to comply with the law. Threatening to turn those spaces into traps, or to defund them for refusing to do so, is not about public safety or “law and order.” It is about coercion. And it tells us exactly how unprepared Michigan Republicans are to meet a moment when federal power is increasingly exercised without restraint.
That context matters, because the apparent murder of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis should end any lingering illusion that what is happening elsewhere cannot happen here. Video evidence shows Pretti stepping in to help two women who were being maced by federal immigration officers. For that act, he was set upon by officers, beaten and disarmed of a weapon he was legally licensed to carry. All evidence indicates he never brandished that gun, but at least one federal agent shot him to death.
Whatever euphemisms are offered in the days ahead, what the public saw was not restraint. It was escalation. And it should force a reckoning well beyond Minneapolis.

Michigan must be ready to respond to a similar surge by the Trump administration here. 
Ready does not mean issuing statements after the fact. Ready means our leaders deciding now where they will stand, and what they will do, when federal power arrives without restraint and demands compliance.
The hardest question for our leaders is also the most personal: Are we prepared, like Alex Pretti, to place their bodies between what has clearly become an unrestrained mob and our fellow citizens?
That question isn’t rhetorical. It’s a measure of civic courage, and it does not apply only to people in the street. It applies to those in office, those with badges, and those with microphones.
This is where the threat to court funding becomes impossible to ignore. When Michigan Republicans threaten to kneecap the judiciary for resisting ICE arrests in courthouses, they are not merely posturing. They are laying the groundwork for complacency. They are signaling that when federal abuses come, they will not defend the institutions meant to check them — they will discipline those institutions instead.
This from the same crowd that incessantly intones that immigrants must “follow the law” and “come here the right way.” Arresting people in courtrooms, a place they have come specifically to follow the law, exposes the lie at the heart of the so-called law and order movement.
If compliance becomes the danger, then law and order has nothing to do with justice and everything to do with intimidation.
But this moment does not give Democrats an automatic pass. Opposition cannot be selective or symbolic. Sen. Elissa Slotkin has said she will not vote to fund the Department of Homeland Security when the issue comes up later this week. That is good to hear. It shows awareness of the stakes. But it must be the starting point, not the entirety of the response.
Michigan faces a choice. We can tell ourselves the killing of Alex Pretti was an aberration, or we can acknowledge the reality in front of us: federal power escalating without restraint, and political leaders here seemingly preparing to excuse it.
Threatening to defund the courts is not a warning sign — it is the decision itself.
Michigan’s leaders will either defend the rule of law before it is broken here, or they will help normalize its collapse.
Silence will not be mistaken for neutrality. It will be remembered as consent.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSC_1820-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-26 15:57:16.219773

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Gov. Tony Evers announced Monday that Wisconsin has signed on to an effort to support the state of Minnesota’s lawsuit seeking to challenge the presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol agents in the Twin Cities area. 
Minnesota filed its lawsuit after the federal government sent about 3,000 federal agents into the region and an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Good Jan. 7. On Saturday, agents shot and killed Alex Pretti. Minnesota is seeking a temporary restraining order against the federal government’s actions.
Late last week, Wisconsin joined Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, District Of Columbia, Delaware, Hawai‘i, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont and Washington in filing an amicus brief supporting Minnesota’s case. 
“DHS has set in motion an extraordinary campaign of recklessness and disregard for norms of constitutional policing and the sanctity of life,” the brief states. “This has resulted in federal agents that have fatally shot one resident, seriously wounded others, tear gassed an infant and other children, attacked peaceful protestors, and systematically conducted illegal stops and arrests. When tragedy has struck and public outcry rung out, the response has been a promise to deliver more of the same. Indeed, just days ago, President Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act, and it is reported that the Pentagon is preparing 1,500 troops to possibly deploy to Minnesota, reflecting the Administration’s desire to further escalate tensions and put the military into an unlawful domestic role.” 
The brief argues that the states have a “strong interest in ensuring that federal immigration enforcement is not used as an excuse to infringe the sovereignty of the States,” and that if allowed to continue unchecked in Minnesota, will likely repeat the pattern elsewhere. 
“Under the claimed auspices of carrying out immigration enforcement, the federal government has seriously undermined state and local authorities and made it impossible for the public to go about their day-to-day activities because they fear being stopped, tear gassed, or worse,” the brief states. “If left unchecked, the federal government will no doubt be emboldened to continue its unlawful conduct in Minnesota and to repeat it elsewhere.” 
Evers said in a statement that Wisconsin has a responsibility to stand up for its neighbor and work to prevent further damage. 
“Wisconsin stands with our neighbors across the river in Minnesota. American citizens are having their rights and freedoms violated and are being put in unsafe and life-threatening situations in their own communities,” Evers said. “Two have already lost their lives. It has to stop.” 
“In Minnesota and across our country, dangerous and unlawful actions at the hands of untrained individuals are sowing fear, division, and distrust,” Evers added. “This isn’t helping make our kids, families, and communities safer—in fact, it’s doing the opposite. It’s clearer than ever that this has nothing to do with public safety. And, as states, we have a responsibility to stand up and say no more.”

Sean McCann (D-Kalamazoo), March 14, 2023 | Laina G. StebbinsU.S. Rep. Hillary Scholten, who flipped what was once considered a Republican stronghold during the 2022 election, has given her support to state Democratic state Sen. Sean McCann of Kalamazoo in his push to unseat U.S. Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Holland Township).
McCann, who was first elected to the Legislature in 2010, announced he would be running for the 4th Congressional District last July. Looking toward the August primary, McCann is running against Diop Harris, a former congressional staffer. However, with endorsements from Scholten, alongside Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson and Democratic former U.S. Rep. Mark Schauer, McCann has secured his spot as an early favorite for Democrats.
“As the first Democrat to hold my Congressional seat in almost 100 years, I know what it takes to earn trust here, win tough races, and deliver for families and small businesses. And I know Sean has what it takes to win and serve in Congress too. That’s why I’m so proud to endorse him for Michigan’s Fourth Congressional District,” Scholten, a Grand Rapids Democrat, said in a statement. “We’re building something new in West Michigan. The work we started will continue when more serious, accountable leaders who are deeply rooted in our communities step up and serve. Sean is exactly that kind of proven leader.”

According to the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, Michigan’s 4th Congressional District leans “Likely Republican,” though the seat is a key target for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, U.S. House Democrat’s official campaign arm.
Huizenga was first elected to Congress in Michigan’s 2nd Congressional district in 2011, however, redistricting placed Huizenga in Michigan’s 4th Congressional, which includes all of Allegan and Van Buren Counties as well as parts of Berrien, Calhoun, Kalamazoo and Ottawa Counties.
“Congresswoman Scholten knows there’s more that unites us than divides us and that it is critical that we put people above partisanship,” McCann said. “She has always shown up and delivered results for West Michigan. I’m so grateful to have her support, and look forward to joining her in Congress to fight for the 4th district to deliver lower costs and expand health care access.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/DSC_0575_2-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-26 15:57:16.219773

The two have lived in a tent in Milford for months, and as temperatures plummeted Friday ahead of a storm that dropped a foot of snow on the town, they packed to go to a motel for the weekend. But questions remained. What would they do with their tent? Would the place that had been home for months withstand the whipping winds? If they packed everything up, would they be able to find a dry spot, get the stakes back into frozen ground?
They were just a couple of the dozens of people experiencing homelessness in Milford — and among many more around the state — who had to scramble to find a place to stay through the weekend’s winter storm.
“It’s just not a normal thing,” DeLorenzo said. “You’ve got to stay bundled up, whether you’re under the covers or not. It’s cold.”
“And then sometimes you have three layers of clothes, you’re not comfortable. Sometimes sleeping like that is a pain,” Mancini added. “But we get through it.”
Beth-El Center, a Milford nonprofit, planned to put about 20 people living outside or in their cars up in motels for the weekend and early part of the week. Another 40 would sleep on cots at the shelter, and 20 more would stay in overflow spots at local churches, said Hannah Smith, the organization’s director of shelter services.

Homelessness — particularly unsheltered homelessness — has been increasing in Connecticut in recent years. The population of people living outside, in their cars or in other places not meant for human habitation rose by 45% from 2024 to 2025. An annual count, which takes place in January each year, showed that 800 people were unsheltered on that night last year.
Connecticut homeless service providers for years have said they need more resources to meet the need of the unhoused population. This need becomes particularly acute, they say, in instances of extreme weather. Across the country, at least 12 people died because of the cold weather over the weekend, according to national news media.
Key lawmakers have said they want to focus on addressing homelessness in the legislative session that begins next month. Last session, a bipartisan group of legislators formed the new Homelessness Caucus to advocate for more solutions and aid for the unhoused population.

Mancini and DeLorenzo became homeless for the first time after an eviction in 2020. They’ve since rented rooms in other people’s houses, but always ran into problems with roommates who didn’t pay the rent or utility bills.
They met in middle school and interact with the ease of a longtime couple. He helps her put on her backpack as they leave their tent and head over to the Beth-El shelter. She is almost always smiling and helps him keep his spirits up, he said.
Their site is clean, devoid of trash. They’re diligent about cleaning up and keeping the elements outside their tent. The storm posed problems.
Jason Blakeman, an outreach worker, tried to convince them to pack up their tent and all their belongings but DeLorenzo resisted, worried that they wouldn’t be able to put the tent back up in their old spot. They like their spot. It’s quiet.
During the last storm, DeLorenzo said, they had to hold the tent up to keep it from collapsing in the wind. He planned to come out every couple of hours to sweep snow off the top.
The two hope to move into an apartment soon. Just a few days ago, Mancini got approved for the Housing Empowering Recovery from Opioids (HERO) program through the Connecticut Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services. The program aims to help people achieve sobriety through stabilizing their housing. Mancini has been in her current sobriety program for nearly a year.
They’re excited for regular date nights, for time to focus on romance rather than survival. “I’m excited to get our old life back,” DeLorenzo said.

For Brian Liberatore, who lives in a wooded area of Milford, “survival is a full-time job.” He has a campsite complete with a tent, tools covered with a tarp and a cook stove. He’s in culinary school at Gateway Community College and likes to practice on the propane stove.
His tent is coming apart at the seams after a December snowstorm ripped through the fabric. In preparation for this weekend’s storm, he’d clamped the edges together and tied the tent to nearby trees. He, like DeLorenzo, planned to hike through the storm from his motel room every couple of hours to sweep snow off his home.
Liberatore is familiar with the unsheltered community and has an extra tent he’s let people stay in before, notably a man who was recovering after heart surgery and had been discharged from the hospital back into homelessness.
“These are people that have had lives,” he said. “They’ve had families, children, and they deserve the respect and basic humanity, and compassion.”
Liberatore keeps a guitar at his campsite where he said he likes to play all kinds of music. He got a guitar for his now-12-year-old grandson a few years ago. He prefers the freedom of living outside to a shelter, but wishes he had a place to stay.
“I would rather not live in a shelter because I have freedom, no neighbors, no rules. But the weather has just gotten a little too much,” Liberatore said. “You’re good until you’re not good.”

Extreme weather is just one of the circumstances that can reveal the fragility of unsheltered homelessness. Blakeman and Smith on Friday visited an old campsite where a group of people had built tiny homes in the woods, complete with running water, a garden and an outdoor bar. They’d listen to music at night and established rules and chores for everyone living there.
A fire broke out in August, displacing everyone who lived there and killing one man, Joseph Kane. Now, rosaries hang on the remains of Kane’s home. Blakeman said he waited while first responders retrieved Kane’s body from the wreckage.
“I wanted him to have someone here who cared about him,” Blakeman said, through tears.

He and Smith spent much of the day Friday visiting people who lived outside and ensuring they knew where to go and when. They arranged Ubers to take individuals, ensured they had enough space to pack up their belongings and even to transport pets. They got people gift cards to buy enough food to wait out the storm.
For Bonnie Rossignol, who has seen someone’s tent flattened because it was too close to the path of a snow plow, the news that she’d be able to stay in a motel paid for by the provider didn’t arrive until late Friday afternoon. Rossignol said she’d set up an awning in the front of her tent to try to keep the snow away from the front door.
“When the snow comes down, it just pushes down on that awning,” she said. “But if that awning collapses, there goes the whole front of my tent and everything inside of it is, boom.” She smashed her hands together. 
Blakeman had an extra tarp for her. He and Smith arranged an Uber to pick her up at 4:45 p.m. She promised to be at the meeting spot and packed by then. 
But, for them, the work was just beginning. The snowstorm dropped more than a foot of snow across the state and temperatures are expected to stay below freezing for days.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026_0123_SR_HomelessStorm_015-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-26 15:57:16.219773

Agreements for two major projects – a $500 million soccer stadium and two new hotels across from the Encore Boston Harbor casino – were announced just as former mayor Carlo DeMaria was leaving office earlier this month. Another massive mixed-use development that will include manufacturing, office, and retail space is already the works.  
It’s all part of DeMaria’s 18-year legacy, during which he ushered in a development boom anchored by the city’s welcoming of the commonwealth’s biggest casino. But in November, voters decided that the swaggering mayor’s work in Everett was finished after a series of scandals, including an investigation that found DeMaria had intentionally concealed “longevity” bonuses that were improperly paid to him.  
Few cities have experienced the kind of growth Everett has seen in the last seven years. Now, further transformation of the city’s once-blighted Lower Broadway district will be overseen by newly elected mayor Robert Van Campen, who was inaugurated on January 5.

“I refer to it as a case study for urban renewal,” he said in an interview. “It is quite an honor for me to come into office at a time when I have the ability to make sure this is all implemented properly.”  
On his last day in office, DeMaria announced that he had finally struck a deal with Wynn Resorts – the operator of Encore Boston Harbor – allowing two hotels to be built across the street from the casino after years of discussion. The agreement requires Wynn to pay up to $25 million for the construction of a new, long-sought commuter rail stop along the Newburyport/Rockport line. 
Wynn also committed $15 million for other transportation and infrastructure improvements in the area, including expanded bus lines, bike lanes, and a pedestrian bridge that will allow people to safely cross Route 99. The new hotels are expected to total up to 800 rooms and will be built on land currently owned by Wynn by as early as 2028, though the plans still need to be reviewed by the Everett Planning Board.  
“We look forward to partnering with Mayor Van Campen on the many details to be worked through on our recent agreement and making Everett and Encore even more successful,” Wynn said in a statement.  
During his campaign, Van Campen vowed to approach development differently, saying that overdevelopment had “strangled” Everett neighborhoods in recent years.  
“The difference between the mayor and me is that I have a more focused view to ensure that the developers aren’t dictating these projects, and that the people of Everett are the ones in the driver’s seat,” Van Campen said in a November interview with CommonWealth Beacon. 
But the new mayor mostly expressed content with DeMaria’s last-minute agreement with Wynn, saying the infrastructure commitments, increased city revenue, and anticipated job creation will be good for the community.  
“There are positives to this deal. There’s no question about that,” Van Campen said. “But the question is now going to be implementation.”  
Van Campen said he will ensure the people of Everett “have their voice heard” when the city outlines the hard details of the project. He also wants to ensure that the benefits of development are felt not only in South Everett, but in Everett Square, Glendale Square, and in the city’s neighborhoods, adding that he hopes residents will eventually see increases in the value of their homes. 
The real estate is expected to generate approximately $12 million in annual revenue for the city and will be constructed under a collective bargaining agreement. Wynn could not yet provide estimated cost details for the two hotel projects, which will not include any gambling activities.

Less than a week before the hotel development deal was announced, DeMaria, in his final act, also landed a community impact agreement with the Kraft Group, allowing the construction of a widely discussed New England Revolution soccer stadium to move forward.  
Under the 20-year agreement, the city is expected to receive nearly $92 million through direct payments, infrastructure additions and upgrades, and other community investments. The city will receive $2.25 for every ticket sold. The Kraft Group also committed $100 million for environmental mitigation and cleanup at the contaminated former power plant site where the stadium will be built. The 25,000-seat stadium will be made available for public school and youth athletic events. 
In a November interview, Van Campen said he wants to drill down on the potential impacts the stadium will have on both vehicle and pedestrian traffic.  
A mixed-use development project led by development firm The Davis Companies is also scheduled to take over a former ExxonMobil fuel storage facility in Everett. The new site will include an energy storage facility, as well as industrial and manufacturing space, lab and office space, retail space, and thousands of residential units.  
The massive projects will further transform Everett’s blighted industrial land and keep DeMaria’s vision for a growing entertainment district alive.

Van Campen said he wants to continue attracting investment in the Lower Broadway corridor. In the future, he plans to recruit a developer to build a new boys and girls club in the area.  
“[DeMaria] does leave behind a legacy of transformation in this community, which he should be proud of and I think the community is grateful for,” Van Campen said. “But now it’s time to write a new chapter.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/00000CarloDeMaria.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-26 15:57:16.219773

One of America’s last battleships, USS Wisconsin, is moored on the Elizabeth River in Norfolk, Virginia.
Now a floating museum, the ship’s most recent battle was winning Good Morning America’s Great Christmas Light Fight this past holiday season.
USS Wisconsin was still decked out in lights when David Woods recently gave a tour of the historic ship. A retired warrant officer, Woods spent 30 years in naval aviation, often working on aircraft carriers.
He said the Wisconsin – one of four Iowa-Class battleships that entered service in the final months of World War II – is still intact enough that it can technically be recalled back into service.
“The little stipulation we have with the Navy: There’s certain things we can’t do to the ship as a museum, because they have to be able to take the ship back and undo everything we did within like two or three weeks,” Woods said.
USS Wisconsin came into service in 1944. It was revived briefly during the Reagan defense buildup in the 1980s, then decommissioned again in the early 1990s after its 16 inch guns were used for shore bombardment in the first Gulf War.
Its 13 inch steel hull is thick enough to withstand a modern tomahawk cruise missile. But operating it would cost nearly $1 million a day just in fuel. With its dials and analog firing systems, the ship would also require a complete retrofit.
Woods said the Wisconsin and other battleships of its era are probably no longer the ships the Navy needs.
“I would volunteer to come out of retirement in a heartbeat to serve on one of them,” he said. “But in modern warfare and feasibility-wise, they’re just obsolete, unfortunately.”
Battleships haven’t been part of the Navy’s arsenal since the World War II era ships were finally retired. The Navy now relies mainly on smaller, more versatile destroyers.
“Today’s ships have to be multi-functional,” Woods said. “A battleship is a bowie knife; a destroyer is a Swiss army knife.”
President Donald Trump announced plans in December to revive the battleship concept and build as many as 20 – 25 new battleships as part of what he’s calling the “Golden Fleet.”
Following Trump’s announcement, the Navy put on hold its plans for a new, more powerful destroyer. Instead, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Daryl Caudle embraced Trump’s vision.
“Battleships will anchor maritime fires and sea control in the most contested environments, massing durable combat power and absorbing punishment and adversary cannot match,” Caudle said in January at the Annual Surface Navy Association National Symposium in Arlington, Virginia.
During the conference, the Congressional Budget Office released an estimate that the first ship could cost as much as $22 billion, while follow ups could cost between $10 to $15 billion.
That would rival the cost of the larger Ford-Class aircraft carriers. USS Gerald F. Ford cost roughly $13 billion after cost overruns and delays.
The design concept of the new ship, which was unveiled during a Trump press conference, has been pulled from the Internet. But the battleship was more than double the length of current destroyers and needed almost three times the crew. It included a number of weapons systems that aren’t in production.

Bryan Clark, a senior fellow with the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank, expressed concern about the design’s complexity.
He noted it’s one thing to say the Navy needs a larger ship which could launch more missiles.
“It’s another thing to say, ‘I need to have a laser on it, I need to have a rail gun on it, and other systems that don’t exist yet and that are going to be too complex to introduce all into one platform without creating a massive increase in cost and schedule,'” he said.
In 2021, the Navy dropped plans for railguns, which fire metal bolts rather than shells, when the program failed to produce a consistently working model.
The Navy has a history of stopping ship production when delays pile up and costs get out of hand. It ended the Zumwalt class of destroyer after three ships. And the Trump Administration just ended production of the Constellation class frigate after the first two ships.
A new battleship could be the costliest U-turn in Navy history.
“If they end up abandoning it, now you’ve got these orphan ships that have a lot of unique capabilities that will be difficult to maintain on that small scale,” Clark said.
Ultimately, Congress will have a say on whether the battleships are built. Even if lawmakers approve the plan, the U.S. won’t roll out its first battleship since 1944 for at least a decade, Clark said.

(Photo by Stephen Maturen/Getty Images)Washington’s governor on Monday painted a dire outlook of how clashes between federal immigration authorities and the state could unfold if a crackdown similar to the one in Minnesota hit here.
Gov. Bob Ferguson said he could envision members of the National Guard acting as a buffer between immigration officers and protesters. Attorney General Nick Brown didn’t rule out the possibility of state or local authorities stepping in to enforce state law against federal agents.
And both Ferguson and Brown urged residents to monitor and record questionable immigration enforcement conduct.
After immigration agents in Minnesota shot and killed a man over the weekend, Ferguson issued a statement saying that the nation’s “descent into authoritarian rule continues” and calling on people to “defend your democracy while you still can.”
On Monday, he hosted a press conference alongside Brown at the Capitol to lay out the state’s preparations for the possibility of a ramped-up deployment of immigration agents in the state. 
It came two days after federal agents killed Alex Pretti in Minneapolis on Saturday, escalating already high tensions over intensifying U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations across the country under the Trump administration. 
“Our job, my job, attorney general’s job, all of our jobs here, is to make sure that we are doing everything we can to prepare for a worst-case scenario,” said Ferguson.
The first-term Democrat said ICE was “completely and totally out of control.” 
The governor said he met Sunday with Adjutant General Gent Welsh, who leads the state’s National Guard, to discuss related issues, but didn’t offer details. As of Monday, Ferguson said he had “no specific information” that an immigration crackdown in Washington is forthcoming.
Brown called the Trump administration a “little cabal of cruelty.”

“America is weaker because of the operations in Minnesota, and real people all across this country are now traumatized, injured and dead because of this president’s fascist tendencies,” said Brown, also a Democrat and former federal prosecutor.
He acknowledged the state was on the cusp of messy territory when it comes to issues like state or local officers intervening in federal immigration operations.
“It’s obviously incredibly complicated when you’re talking about the division of authority between state law enforcement, local and the federal government,” Brown said. “As a general matter, state and local law enforcement do not have to simply watch or look away if the law is being violated.”
‘Everybody has a role’
Democrats around the country are slamming ICE over its conduct. And, following Pretti’s death, there’s a possibility that Senate Democrats will withhold needed votes on federal funding legislation, a move that could trigger a partial government shutdown. 
In the Washington Legislature, Democratic lawmakers are considering a slew of measures in response to the heightened immigration enforcement campaign. 
These include a ban on police face coverings, as many ICE agents have covered their faces during operations, protections for immigrant workers from federal raids and guardrails for the use of automated license plate readers that authorities have used to track down immigrants.
Even some Republicans, who are generally wary of criticizing the president, are raising concerns.
A group of governors on Sunday, including the Republican chief executive of Oklahoma who chairs the National Governors Association, called for a “reset” from the federal government on its immigration enforcement campaign.
And U.S. Rep. Michael Baumgartner, a Republican from eastern Washington, called for congressional hearings into immigration enforcement after Pretti’s shooting, which he called “disturbing.”
Ferguson and Brown also emphasized the role the public has in “defending our democracy.”
“We have certain powers as attorney general or governors to do our part, but everybody has a role in our state right now,” Ferguson said. “And we’re going to need that to get through this.”
They said if Washington were faced with a broad ICE incursion, they would pursue legal avenues to stop it, as officials in Minnesota have. 
But state leaders here can’t keep ICE out of the state, Ferguson noted. And he and Brown encouraged residents to record interactions with federal agents. Videos of the shootings of Pretti and Renee Good in Minnesota have captured the circumstances leading up to their deaths.
King County and the cities of Seattle and Shoreline, along with local elected officials in Bellingham and Tacoma, signed onto a legal brief last week arguing the Minneapolis crackdown is unconstitutional.
A federal judge is considering halting the 3,000-agent deployment. 
Letter to Noem
Ferguson and Brown on Monday sent a letter to U.S. Homeland Security Kristi Noem, whose agency oversees ICE, urging her to withdraw federal agents from Minnesota: “Now is the time to deescalate.”
They also took issue with an internal memo arguing ICE agents can enter people’s homes without a judicial warrant, despite vast legal precedent to the contrary. 
“If ICE agents attempt any such unconstitutional measures in the state of Washington, we will do everything in our power to oppose it,” Ferguson and Brown wrote in their letter. “Our state will consider all legal options to hold the U.S. Government and individual ICE agents accountable for violating Washingtonians’ constitutional rights.”

(Baylor Spears | Wisconsin Examiner)University of Wisconsin-Madison Chancellor Jennifer Mnookin is set to leave her post at the end of this school year to become the president of Columbia University in New York. 
Mnookin has served as UW-Madison’s chancellor since 2022, leading the university as it has faced pressure from Wisconsin Republicans to end diversity programs as well as cuts to federal research grants and tensions surrounding a pro-Palestine encampment on campus. 
“It has been a true honor to be a part of the Wisconsin family,” Mnookin said in a statement Sunday. “I am proud of what we have accomplished together, even in a challenging period for higher education, and I know great possibilities lie ahead for the UW-Madison campus community.”
After her departure was announced, Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) praised Mnookin’s tenure. 
“Chancellor Mnookin had many great accomplishments during her tenure, such as bringing more free speech to campus and closing its division of DEI,” Vos said in a statement. “I enjoyed working with her as we both wanted students to reach their full potential and have a successful and impactful life after graduation. I wish her nothing but the best and I know that Columbia University will be in great hands with her at the helm.”
Mnookin will be taking over at Columbia as the university has been under a national microscope following pro-Palestine protests and a crackdown by both campus officials and the Trump administration. Last year, Columbia agreed to pay the federal government about $200 million to restore federal funding that had been cut. 
Universities of Wisconsin President Jay Rothman will name an interim chancellor to take the role after Mnookin leaves following spring commencement. The UW system board of regents will launch a search for someone to fill the role permanently. 
“During her tenure, Chancellor Jennifer Mnookin brought unbounded energy, resilience, and deeply thoughtful leadership to this great university. As she now takes on a new opportunity at another prestigious institution, we extend our substantial gratitude for her service and wish her continued success in the years ahead,” Rothman said.

Update on State of Emergency, Snowfall totals, Power Outages, Schools, and more. 
WILMINGTON, Del. — Delaware began shifting from emergency response to recovery Monday after Winter Storm Fern delivered measurable snow across the state, left scattered power outages, and triggered road restrictions and widespread school closures.
Gov. Matthew Meyer terminated Delaware’s state of emergency at 3 p.m. Monday, Jan. 26, a move that also released Delaware National Guard assets, state officials said. But Level 1 driving warnings remained in place for New Castle and Kent counties, urging motorists to avoid travel unless necessary and to use extreme caution, especially on secondary roads where icy conditions may persist.
Snowfall totals: Wilmington saw 6.5 inches; Sussex totals varied
Final snowfall reports compiled by the National Weather Service showed 6.5 inches in Wilmington, with higher totals reported nearby — including 9 inches just east-northeast of Wilmington and 7.8 inches in Hockessin.
In Sussex County, totals varied sharply by location. Spotters reported 4 inches in Milton and Selbyville, while reports around Georgetown and the Seaford area were closer to 1.5 inches in earlier storm totals. The National Weather Service report did not list a storm-total measurement specifically for Milford.
Power outages improved through the day
Statewide outage tracking showed about 1,415 customers without power earlier Monday, with Kent County reporting the largest share of outages in that snapshot.
By late afternoon, conditions appeared to have improved significantly: PowerOutage.us showed 1 customer without power statewide, with outages concentrated in New Castle County.
Driving restrictions downgraded; Sussex warning lifted
As conditions evolved, the state also eased travel restrictions. Delaware officials announced that, effective 10 a.m. Monday, New Castle and Kent were downgraded from a Level 2 driving restriction to a Level 1 driving warning, and the Level 1 warning in Sussex County was lifted.
Even with the downgrade, officials warned that black ice and prolonged subfreezing temperatures could keep road conditions dangerous.
Bitter cold ahead; flurries possible
Forecasters expect the storm to give way to a stretch of frigid weather. In Wilmington, temperatures were forecast to drop into the single digits Monday night, with highs remaining in the teens and 20s through midweek.
Schools closed; some districts extend schedule changes
Closures were widespread Monday, with Delaware Public Media reporting that all of Delaware’s public school districts were closed for the day as the state dug out.
Some districts also announced additional adjustments:


Brandywine School District: no school for students Monday and Tuesday (Jan. 26–27) due to storm-related closures affecting its scheduled professional responsibilities day.


Sussex Technical High School: operated on a remote learning day Monday.


Christina School District: schools and offices closed Monday.


Warming sites and Code Purple shelters
For residents in need of a warm place to stay, the state emphasized Code Purple operations.
State officials said Code Purple shelters remained open 24 hours statewide, and shared contact numbers by county:


New Castle County: 302-652-8033


Kent County: 1-800-733-6816


Sussex County: 302-519-0024


Or call 211


Separately, DHSS advised that its offices — including State Service Centers — were closed Monday, and directed people who need shelter or support services to contact 211 for available options.

(Photo by Whitney Downard/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)One year into his first term as Pennsylvania’s attorney general, Dave Sunday touted a list of accomplishments, including illegal firearm recoveries, fentanyl seizures and combating scammers. 
“This first year as your attorney general was full of unique challenges and achievements, including progress in defending Pennsylvanians from modern-day threats, such as artificial intelligence and online environments that expose our children and older residents to physical, mental, and financial harm,” Sunday said in a release. “Technology and criminal methods are advancing quickly, but our great team embraces the hard work that comes with protecting people, families, and their assets.” 

An eight-minute video posted to his YouTube channel included portions of Sunday’s inaugural speech as the state’s top law enforcement officer and clips from various press conferences. A top focus was the seizure of more than 56 million fentanyl doses and 100,000 fentanyl pills, with an estimated street cost of $58 million. 
Much of that dangerous drug came from Philadelphia and its collar counties, as detailed at a press conference in October, but the issue impacts thousands of Pennsylvanians. In 2023, 4,719 Pennsylvanians died from an overdose and there were 37,371 nonfatal suspected overdoses, according to the state Department of Health. 
“But enforcement alone isn’t enough. We cannot just arrest our way out of this crisis,” Sunday said in the video, pivoting to highlight the Law Enforcement Treatment Initiative. 
The program offers an alternative to incarceration for non-violent offenders and is available in 33 counties. Initially tailored for those with substance use disorder, some counties chose to expand its reach to include mental health resources.

Additionally, 539 illegal firearms were recovered by task forces led by the Attorney General’s Office, including guns that were illegally trafficked, had no serial numbers or were possessed by individuals prohibited from buying firearms — either due to a prior felony conviction or for another reason. 
Other accountings included in the release: 

120 defendants charged with fraud, abuse or criminal waste related to the Medicaid system, leveraging more than $40 million in restitution. Another 550 cases and investigations are active. 
100 new investigations into large-scale theft and fraud under the Organized Crime Retail Unit.

After growing up in Ottumwa and graduating from Indianola’s Simpson College, I worked in South Dakota at the start of my career. I enjoyed my years in the Mount Rushmore State, but their higher education system pales in comparison to Iowa’s, and the same is true of other surrounding states. So I’m grateful to have spent the last 18 years in Iowa’s higher education system.
Iowa is the envy of other states when it comes to our full complement of higher education options: three top-notch Regents institutions, 15 excellent community colleges, and 26 nonprofit, private colleges and universities that each contribute to the economy, culture and quality of life in the communities they call home. Iowans are blessed to have access to each of these options, and we desperately need all three to continue flourishing. 
And yet, Iowa’s House of Representatives is poised to advance a bill that will likely lead to the closure of some of Iowa’s private colleges. If House Study Bill 533 becomes law, Iowa taxpayers will be on the hook for $20 million (for starters) to enable Iowa’s community colleges to offer bachelor’s degrees, something the state’s three public universities and 26 private colleges already do exceedingly well.
The argument is not valid 
The proposal’s key argument is that there are higher education “deserts” in Iowa. That’s just not true. Through Iowa’s public and private four-year colleges, all of Iowa is covered for in-person and online, undergraduate and graduate education. Moreover, Iowa already has a statewide transfer guarantee that enables students from all 15 community colleges to seamlessly complete a bachelor’s degree at Iowa, Iowa State, UNI, or nearly any Iowa private college. Northwestern is a proud participant in this program.
Rationale for the proposal’s key argument is embarrassingly weak. The report submitted to the House education subcommittee contains sparse anecdotal data with no concrete research or analysis to back its claims. No degree start-up costs or economic impacts to Iowa private colleges or their communities are identified. Alarmingly, despite this inadequate data and little meaningful input from the private colleges that have been providing four-year degrees (at zero taxpayer cost) for more than 170 years, the bill is moving recklessly forward.
At the same time, higher education faces a well-documented “enrollment cliff.” Due to declining birth rates during the 2008 recession, the number of high school graduates nationwide will decrease by 15% in the next decade. This is precisely the wrong moment to spend taxpayer dollars enabling community colleges to duplicate degrees already offered by Iowa’s four-year institutions.
‘Isn’t competition good?’
Competition is good, if the terms are fair. Despite supporters’ generous investment in private colleges, our institutions will not be able to compete with a glut of state-funded bachelor’s degrees if community colleges begin offering them too. More of Iowa’s private colleges will experience decline and closure, like Iowa Wesleyan University did in 2023.
A solution without a problem 
We need our community colleges to continue doing what only they can do! They are critical producers of the diverse workforce we need in Iowa. Many employers already can’t find enough welders, powerline workers, and other tradespeople to hire. Iowa already has three public universities and 26 private, nonprofit colleges that are superbly educating students who want bachelor’s and graduate degrees.
Iowans like a good deal. We already have a great deal with our outstanding system of higher education. Let’s not waste taxpayer dollars attempting to fix a problem that simply doesn’t exist.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Northwestern-College-photo-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-26 14:57:33.271668

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)The state’s newly expanded charter school co-location program could be limited after the Florida Department of Education received “a lot of feedback,” an administrator said.
The department hosted a rule development meeting Monday, soliciting feedback for Schools of Hope rules, the program that lawmakers vastly expanded in the waning hours of the 2025 legislative session.
Since the last-minute change approved by lawmakers, traditional public schools have been overwhelmed by newly-enabled charter school operators applying to open inside unused portions of public schools.
The department had not finalized rule language as of Monday. The state said it anticipates the language will be posted this week to the state’s website and that the state Board of Education will review language during its Feb. 20 meeting in Key West. The state website provides room for members of the public to submit feedback. 
Adam Emerson, director of the Office of School Choice at the department, was the only speaker during a teleconference Monday. He said since the state implemented the expansions in the fall, there has been “a lot of feedback.”
According to Emerson, some “high-level components that we will consider” in further Schools of Hope administrative rules include:

Limits around the number of building notices submitted by a single Hope operator. “We are limiting the number of building notices in this particular rule development.”
“We are looking at greater assurances around a Hope operator’s proposed co-location with a district school.”
More provisions with mutual management plans “with a goal of offsetting some of the costs that are associated with that co-location.”

“We will be looking at tweaking the criteria to approve the Hope operator” and setting timelines for operators to submit notices of intent to co-locate, Emerson said. 
The Schools of Hope program was created under former House Speaker Richard Corcoran to allow charter schools to open near “persistently low performing” schools, but the 2025 Legislature expanded the area and scope that these publicly funded and privately operated charter schools that may open in areas adjacent to “persistently low performing” traditional public schools may serve.
It allows these schools to open in low-income zones or even outside such zones if there is a suitable underused, vacant, or surplus facility, and in the attendance zone of a “persistently low performing school.”

Under the new law, “hope operators” are allowed to open in vacant spaces inside public schools at no cost. School districts must provide custodial, maintenance, safety, food, nursing, and transportation services if the school of hope requests it.
In September, the day after the Board of Education implemented the law, Gov. Ron DeSantis and billionaire Ken Griffin announced that a New York-based charter operator would open in Miami.
Less than a week after the rule went into effect last fall, the Florida Policy Institute, a non-partisan policy research organization, reported that charter operators had sent 690 “letters of intent” to co-locate inside of public schools in 22 counties.
Education Commissioner Anastasios Kamoutsas defends the program, and the GOP-led Legislature has not indicated a move toward addressing school concerns in this legislative session, although Democratic legislators have proposed changes to the laws passed less than a year ago.

(Getty Images)Wolverines in the lower 48 States were trapped, hunted and poisoned to near extinction in the late 1800s and early 1900s and have not recovered, just the opposite in fact. It took court action by the Alliance for the Wild Rockies and other conservation groups to finally get the dwindling population listed as “threatened” under the Endangered Species Act in 2023.
The federal government is legally required to designate “critical habitat” to protect ecosystems for the recovery of threatened and endangered species, but has failed to do so for wolverines, which are hanging on by the thinnest of threads. To stave off extinction, we need to protect the habitat in which they can survive — a challenge now further exacerbated by an increasingly hot climate diminishing the deep snows they require for denning and food storage. 
The Fish and Wildlife Service stated that wolverines can no longer be found in New Mexico but wolverine habitat currently exists in portions of northern New Mexico, Utah, Oregon, California, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Nevada and Washington. Efforts are underway to reintroduce wolverines to the Southern Rockies (which include north-central New Mexico). Evaluating lands in that region for protection as critical habitat will only benefit that effort and help restore the species to the region.


It’s estimated there are only 318 wolverines remaining in the entire lower 48 States. Scientists believe the “effective population,” which is the number of individuals capable of reproducing and contributing to the next generation, is likely less than 40. 
You read that right, fewer than 40 wolverines are currently capable of keeping the species from going extinct in the contiguous U.S. And what is the U.S. Fish and Wild Service doing to recover wolverines as required by law? Not much.
The Fish and Wildlife Service noted that wolverine populations are relatively small, fragmented and isolated from larger populations in Canada. In Montana, the areas required for wolverines range from 193 to 588 square miles for males and 55 to 148 square miles for females.
To protect the ecosystems upon which wolverines depend, the Endangered Species Act requires the Fish and Wildlife Service to designate “critical habitat” — the areas that provide the secure habitat where they are protected from threats like incidental trapping and can successfully reproduce.
The designation of “Critical Habitat” includes those areas occupied by the species at the time of listing that possess the physical and biological features such as food, water and shelter needed for survival and recovery. These areas may also include areas not yet occupied but needed for future population growth.
Because critical habitat designation is essential to the conservation of the species, special management consideration or protections may be required.  The designation also guides federal actions to prevent destruction or modification of this habitat, thereby increasing species’ chances of recovery, 
Unfortunately the Fish and Wildlife Service has not followed the law, has not designated critical habitat, and is shirking its duty to keep wolverines from extinction — which is why the Alliance for the Wild Rockies and our fellow plaintiffs recently filed a lawsuit in federal district court in Montana. 
Although the majority (95%) of wolverine habitat in the lower 48 states is federally owned and managed by the Forest Service, there are no regulatory mechanisms or standards in Forest Service Land and Resource Management Plans to protect wolverines and their habitat. Not only is nothing being done to protect and restore wolverines and the ecosystems upon which they depend, the Forest Service has announced a massive 25% increase in national forest logging, in effect, destroying what critical habitat may be left on public lands. 
The Fish and Wildlife Service has failed — and continues to fail — to comply with its mandatory, non-discretionary, duty to designate critical habitat for wolverines as required by Section 4 of the Endangered Species Act. To maintain and recover the species our choice was either take the delinquent agency to court or watch wolverines dwindle into extinction. We sided with the wolverines and are being represented by the Western Environmental Law Center.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/wolverine-1024x682.jpeg,,,2026-01-26 14:57:33.271668

(Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)A state appeals court ordered a lower court Monday to restart proceedings over whether a casino exemption in New Jersey’s indoor smoking ban violates the state’s constitution, finding procedural deficiencies had denied the case a fair hearing.
The decision is the latest in a yearslong fight over the 2006 Smoke-Free Air Act, which banned indoor smoking statewide but allowed it to continue inside casinos and their simulcasting facilities. Casino floor workers represented by the United Auto Workers union have for years pushed to end the exemption.
A lower court judge in 2024 dismissed a complaint filed by the union and an antismoking advocacy group, but Monday’s decision dings that judge for improperly addressing the plaintiffs’ equal protection challenge and for not performing detailed fact findings. The lower court judge decided the case based on written briefs alone and no testimony, according to Monday’s ruling.
“On remand, the court shall allow the record to be developed and litigated to address the hotly contested projections of revenue loss, and for the court to make appropriate findings of fact concerning the reliability and credibility of the competing expert projections. Such findings are especially crucial to the ultimate disposition of plaintiffs’ state equal protection arguments, with the health of thousands of casino employees and, perhaps, millions of dollars at stake,” Judge Jack Sabatino wrote for the three-judge panel.

The casino workers sued after legislative pushes to close the exception — ones that enjoyed broad support among lawmakers — stalled over concerns about the effect an indoor smoking ban would have on gambling houses’ profitability.
The workers alleged the law unconstitutionally singled them out to face the harms of secondhand smoke.
They charged it violated constitutional rights to safety and equal protection and was unconstitutional special legislation — laws that improperly single out an individual or group and do not apply to others similarly situated.
When he was governor, Phil Murphy banned smoking inside casinos for about 11 months during the pandemic, though that ban was lifted in June 2021 (Murphy left office last week).

(Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)
The trial court judge in August 2024 ruled there was no constitutional right to safety, found provisions in the New Jersey Constitution related to Atlantic City and its casinos allowed special legislation, and dismissed the workers’ equal protection claims.
The workers harmed by secondhand smoke could just find other jobs, the trial judge ruled, and casino revenue demanded that the indoor smoking exception be allowed to continue.
That judge, who denied preliminary restraints to bar casino smoking and dismissed workers’ challenge to the law, erred repeatedly, the appellate court found Monday.
The trial court used the wrong test to weigh the constitutionality of the smoking exemption, asking whether a rational basis existed for such a ban rather than employing the three-part balancing test used in equal protection cases lodged under New Jersey’s Constitution, Monday’s ruling says.

The trial judge also improperly deferred to the findings of a casino-funded report that found banning indoor smoking would significantly reduce gambling houses’ revenue. That report found the ban would cut revenue by diverting smokers to casinos in other states or forcing them to interrupt their gaming for cigarette breaks.
UAW and Casino Employees Against Smoking Effects, which joined the union as a plaintiff, pointed to a separate study that found smoking and non-smoking casinos perform similarly.
The lower court took the casinos’ study at face value and did not appear to consider the one raised by smoking opponents, Monday’s decision says.
“The trial court improvidently accepted at face value respondents’ disputed economic contentions and the untested premise that ending the smoking exemption will inexorably result in drastic revenue and job losses, without a development of a fuller record,” Sabatino wrote.
The appeals panel declined to weigh whether the state’s constitution creates a right to safety, saying that matter falls outside the scope of its review and is better left to a higher authority.
“If such a sweeping right is recognized for the first time, it should be by the Supreme Court as the ultimate arbiter of our State Constitution,” wrote Sabatino.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-26 19:42:05+00:00,CT Mirror,CT legislators to pitch bill to allow lawsuits against federal agents,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/26/ct-legislators-to-pitch-bill-to-allow-lawsuits-against-federal-agents/,CT Democrats said they will propose a bill allowing residents to sue federal agents for violations of their constitutional rights.,"Connecticut state lawmakers said Monday that they will propose a bill allowing CT residents to sue federal law enforcement agents for violations of their constitutional rights. 
The bill’s proposal is in response to the shooting of Alex Pretti by a U.S. Border Patrol officer in Minneapolis on Saturday. Pretti is the second protester killed by federal immigration authorities in Minnesota this month, after Renee Good was shot and killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer Jonathan Ross on Jan. 7. 
“I’ve heard from many of my constituents who are concerned that this could happen here and who are looking to the state and our state leaders and to provide some assurance that Connecticut is doing what we can to protect our residents,” said Sen. Matt Lesser, D-Middletown, during a press conference on Monday. 
Connecticut would join several other states that have enacted similar laws, including California, Massachusetts, Maine and, most recently, Illinois. 
“This is a well-established thing that we can do to make sure that if constitutional rights are violated, that the residents of the state can do something about it and can bring a lawsuit and can achieve justice,” said Lesser.
In 1983, a federal law was passed allowing for lawsuits against local and state officials in the case of a violation of constitutional rights. But there is no equivalent law allowing people to sue federal officials. In response, states began to create what are called “converse 1983 laws,” allowing for lawsuits against federal agents. 
The 1971 Supreme Court case Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics found that individuals do have a right to sue federal officials for damages relating to violations of people’s constitutional rights. But the court has not allowed a lawsuit under Bivens to proceed in more than 30 years, and a 2017 Supreme Court decision tightened its use even further. 
Sen. Gary Winfield, D-New Haven, noted that the Westfall Act, a 1988 law that protects federal employees from personal lawsuits for their conduct while carrying out their professional duties, further limits individuals’ recourse. 
“I think it’s important for folks to be able to rest assured that the Constitution of the United States means something. If that doesn’t mean something, I don’t know who we are, what this country is,” said Winfield. 
Sen. President Pro Tem Martin Looney, D-New Haven, said it was possible the law could be challenged by the federal government. The federal government sued the state of Illinois last month, claiming that a law allowing people to sue federal immigration agents went against the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, which says that federal law overrides state law. 
But Looney disagreed that the proposed Connecticut law was at odds with the U.S. Constitution. 
“These actions actually further the ultimate supremacy of the federal constitution by helping people vindicate their fundamental federal constitutional rights,” said Looney. 
Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, welcomed debate on the proposed law in a statement he issued Monday. 
“Anyone who breaks state or federal laws should be held accountable for their actions. In the meantime, the amped up rhetoric and the violence must end. Anyone who doesn’t like how the law is enforced is free to advocate for different laws, and to protest peacefully,” said Harding. 
Democratic lawmakers said they had been working with the Connecticut chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union to draft the legislation. 
There have been constitutional violations in Connecticut as ICE increased its presence here, said Chelsea Infinity-Gonzalez, ACLU-CT’s director of public policy and advocacy.  
“ There’s operations ramping up all around us, in New York and Massachusetts, most recently in Maine. And so it truly is only a matter of time,” said Gonzalez. 
Gonzalez said the ACLU was also working on legislation that would regulate the use of license plate readers so that the data collected was not used to assist federal law enforcement. 
At the federal level, Connecticut politicians have widely criticized the shootings in Minnesota, and several have called for an independent investigation into the shooting. State investigators were not allowed access to evidence in the shooting of Good, and Drew Evans, superintendent of Minnesota’s Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which investigates police shootings, told reporters Saturday that federal officers had blocked his agency from the scene of Pretti’s shooting even after it obtained a signed judicial warrant.
U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi sent a letter to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Saturday, calling on him to share records on the state’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, to repeal “sanctuary policies” and allow detention centers to cooperate with ICE, and to provide the federal government with access to the state’s voter rolls. 
Connecticut, along with 22 other states, has been sued in federal court by the Trump Administration for its voting records. The state in July joined 20 other states in a lawsuit pushing back against a directive from the federal government to provide data on people enrolled in SNAP. 
In response to a question from CT Mirror, spokesperson for the Attorney General’s office Elizabeth Benton said the state “has not received such a letter” from Bondi and referred to earlier comments in which she said that any statements about hypothetical requests for data from the federal government would be “premature” and depend on the exact data requested. 
Duff said during the press conference that the federal government was targeting Democratic-led states, and that Connecticut would “resist feverishly.”“The federal government does not run elections, and we’re not going to give them data in order to try to make a mockery of our residents, our voters, and anyone else for their cruel and dangerous policies,” he said. 
Connecticut’s congressional delegation last week voted against a bill that would fund the federal Department of Homeland Security. The bill passed the House of Representatives and is now headed to the Senate.

Federal Emergency Management Agency officials are in the state to help distribute generators, meals, blankets and other supplies after President Donald Trump approved an emergency declaration for Mississippi on Saturday, Gov. Tate Reeves announced Monday.
The state’s largest electric providers had few estimates Monday for how long it will take to restore power, with multiple providers citing difficulties assessing damage. Frigid temperatures, icy roads and downed trees have impeded restoration efforts. Two deaths – one each in Hinds County and Tishomingo County – and two injuries from the storm have been reported in the state.
About 153,000 customers were without power across 47 of he 82 counties at midday Monday, the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency said.
Entergy
Entergy Mississippi serves over 400,000 customers in 45 counties. The company said Monday that the storm had impacted 55,000 of its customers and it had deployed over 2,000 workers.
In a video press release Monday, Haley Fisackerly, president and CEO of Entergy Mississippi, reminded people to stay away from downed power lines and to report any downed lines to 1-800-968-8243 or on www.entergy.com. 
Fisackerly added that continued freezing temperatures could cause more outages.

Electric Cooperatives of Mississippi 
Twelve of the Electric Cooperatives of Mississippi’s 26 operations have requested restoration assistance with additional crews coming from out of state. According to a Monday press release, travel is dangerous in parts of the state that have been hardest hit and it is difficult to say when everything will be back on.
Tishomingo County Electric Power Association
“It’s a war zone out here,” said Cody Durham, CEO of Tishomingo County Electric Power Association. Around 80% of Tishomingo Electric’s customers are without power. 
Durham said restoring power to the county’s electric water pumps is the first priority. He hopes water would be restored by Monday night. 
“We’re doing the best we can to work through these tough conditions,” Durham said. Because of cold and icy conditions, he said it’s impossible to know the exact extent of the damage. He requested additional crews to help clear trees and repair lines. He urged people to check for warming shelters that are being set up in the county and go there if the roads are passable.
Tippah, Alcorn, Benton and Union counties 
The Tippah Electric Power Association, which serves 13,927 customers in Tippah, Alcorn, Benton, and Union counties in Mississippi as well as Hardeman County in Tennessee, reported Monday that all but six of its customers had lost power. The provider said Sunday it is looking at “weeks instead of days to restore power” to everyone.
The utility is one of several in north Mississippi that buys power from the Tennessee Valley Authority.
“Tippah EPA still does not have feed to 5 of our substations,” the utility wrote on its Facebook page. On Sunday, the provider wrote that its power distribution system had “suffered catastrophic damage.”
“TVA and local power company crews are working around the clock to restore service as safely and quickly as possible,” TVA spokesperson Julia Wise told Mississippi Today on Monday. “We are making progress despite difficult conditions for workers, including fallen trees, deep snow, icy roads and frigid temperatures. Crews are on the ground and in the air assessing storm damage and repairing transmission lines.”
TVA serves 346,000 customers in northeastern Mississippi, through local public utilities and cooperatives.
Officials in Ripley, the county seat of Tippah County, reported both gas and water outages in addition to the power troubles. “Most areas” of Ripley dealt with water issues after an outage at a pump station, city officials wrote on social media. 
On Sunday, the city also reported a “major gas line break” between Ripley and Blue Mountain that left “many residents” without gas. Officials Monday said repairs were still in progress.
Water and generator system failures
Local newsrooms report boil-water notices for Quitman County, Panola County and Holly Springs. The Mississippi State Department of Health’s Bureau of Public Water Supply is working with local water systems to clear the boil advisories, according to department spokesperson Greg Flynn. 
He said no contamination has been reported, but water systems need to check their quality whenever a power outage causes a drop in water pressure. Because there may be no power to boil water in some places, Flynn said people might need to use bottled water.
County emergency management contacts in Quitman County, Panola County and Marshall County did not immediately respond to Mississippi Today’s calls Monday. Scott Simmons, Mississippi Emergency Management Authority’s external affairs director, said MEMA is working with local governments and the state Department of Transportation to take 64,000 bottles of water to north Mississippi communities that lack access to fresh tap water. 
The authority was sending the water and 30 generators to Camp McCain in Grenada before distributing them to communities.
Simmons said the generators would go to health buildings serving vulnerable groups — long-term care facilities, hospitals, nursing homes and warming centers. He said multiple locations had generators that failed during the weekend, and only some had started working again by early Monday. 
“It’s going to be a challenge, but that’s the challenge we’re tackling right now,” Simmons said.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)Shockwaves from the shooting death of an anti-ICE Minneapolis protester over the weekend are reverberating throughout the Republican Party and even dividing conservative leaders within Florida — the most ICE-friendly state in the nation.
The cracks in the resounding GOP support for the Department of Homeland Security are both rare and a first under President Donald Trump, whose promise of mass deportations helped him win in November 2024. But the tactics employed to carry out that agenda have begun to raise concerns, even among the president’s most ardent of supporters.
“Distorting, politicizing, slandering — justifying what happened to Alex Pretti contradicts the American values the administration campaigned on,” Republican state Sen. Ileana Garcia posted on social media Monday morning. The Miamian co-founded “Latinas for Trump” in 2016.
Ileana Garcia via Florida Senate
“He was neither a domestic terrorist nor an assassin. … Allowing individuals like Stephen Miller, among others, who represent the government and make hard-line decisions, to make such comments will have long-term consequences,” she warned. “This is not what I voted for!”
This is the second time Garcia, the daughter of Cuban exiles, has criticized the Trump administration’s actions on undocumented immigration. In June, she similarly blasted Trump’s homeland security adviser, Miller, for his “inhumane” approach to mass deportations.
Other Republicans like U.S. Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar offered more muted criticisms. 
“Washington’s failure on immigration is hitting our streets. Minneapolis is the result of Washington refusing to fix a broken immigration system and continuing to enforce outdated laws,” she wrote on social media, calling for an end to “chaos” and “tragedy.” 
“There is precisely one bipartisan bill … that revamps our immigration system, including ICE enforcement policy, so they don’t need to be out in large-scale operations in our communities,” she added.
Florida Republicans have long-touted how the Sunshine State is the most friendly in the nation to Trump’s mass deportation agenda. This includes multiple state-run migrant detention centers, all 67 counties partnering with ICE, and laws (although contested) preventing undocumented immigrants from entering the state.
What happened?
On Saturday, 37-year-old VA ICU nurse Alex Pretti was shot and killed during a struggle with Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis. Pretti, who had a revolver stowed in his belt, approached an officer while recording. The agent had just shoved a woman to the ground, videos show.
Pretti was quickly swarmed by five officers. According to video footage, one officer appears to take Pretti’s revolver out of his waistband before another discharges his weapon and kills him.
DHS offered another version of events.
“An individual approached US Border Patrol officers with a 9 mm semi-automatic handgun. The officers attempted to disarm the suspect, but the armed suspect reacted violently,” DHS Secretary Kristi Noem claimed.
This was the second videoed death of an ICE protester in Minneapolis in a matter of weeks. On Jan. 7, 37-year-old Renee Good was shot and killed by ICE while fleeing in her vehicle. Officials say she was attempting to run over an agent with her car, prompting the lethal action.
 Growing call for action

Garcia isn’t the only Republican demanding answers. U.S. Rep. Andrew Garbarino, a New York Republican chairing the House Homeland Security Committee, is requesting ICE and CBP testify in front of his panel.
Other congressional members from Texas, North Carolina, Louisiana, Maine, and Alaska are also calling for an investigation. Even Sen. Pete Ricketts, a Nebraska Republican and staunch Trump supporter, has asked for a “transparent investigation.” Others like the National Rifle Association have criticized the administration in the surrounding chatter of Pretti’s death.
This came after FBI Director Kash Patel claimed, “You cannot bring a firearm, loaded, with multiple magazines to any sort of protest.” That’s false, and the NRA said as much.
But not all Republicans are breaking ranks. Gov. Ron DeSantis blamed Minnesota’s Democratic leadership for its “toxic environment,” although he didn’t mention Pretti’s death specifically. His office did not respond to a request for comment on Pretti.
“What we’re not doing is what people like [Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz] and what this Mayor are doing, which is basically trying to sabotage the enforcement operations,” DeSantis said during an unrelated press conference Monday morning. “ They’re creating a toxic environment where they’re really inciting people to go out and show hostility to the agents who are doing this. That is not a recipe for success. That is not the way that you do business.”
Pretti’s death has even been reflected into the looming Florida gubernatorial race. Democrat David Jolly, a former Republican member of Congress, called the shooting a “murder” and demanded Noem be removed from her post.
“We know what we saw. An American citizen practicing civil disobedience was disarmed and then shot 10 times in the street, and his body lay lifeless and he was murdered,” Jolly said during a campaign event, Florida Today reported.
But his opponent and favored candidate to replace DeSantis, U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds, saw the situation differently. On an appearance with Fox News, Donalds — endorsed by Trump — apologized to immigration agents for “having to deal with all these protests.”
“We stand behind you, we want you to continue to do your job on behalf of the United States of America,” he said.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/alexpretti-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-26 14:57:33.271668

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)For the fourth consecutive year, Utah lawmakers rejected a proposal aimed at holding gun owners accountable when an improperly stored firearm ends up being used by a minor to commit a crime. 
In a 9-2 vote, the House Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice Committee shot down HB80, sponsored by Rep. Andrew Stoddard, D-Millcreek. The bill would have created a class C misdemeanor penalty for unsafe firearm storage. The bill would not punish adults for gun accidents or if the firearm is used for self defense, suicide, or if it is reported stolen. 
“This isn’t for the tragic situations where there is a loaded firearm that’s not secured, a child gets it, and then dies from an accidental shooting,” Stoddard, the bill sponsor, said during the committee meeting. “In order to qualify under this proposed statute, it would have to be used intentionally in a fight or a quarrel.”
Republican committee members raised concerns about gun owners accessing their firearms in case of a home invasion, saying “seconds count” in dangerous self-defense situations. They argued secure gun storage can delay access and hinder self-defense.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Stoddard said HB80 is similar to a Florida law that holds gun owners liable when a minor uses a firearm “in a public place” or “in a rude, careless, angry or threatening manner.” Twenty-seven states and Washington D.C. have secure storage laws aimed at preventing children from accessing a firearm, according to a Johns Hopkins study. 
“This is just one small step to try to help it so that we don’t have to be so reactive, that we can be proactive in stopping school shootings with the side effect of stopping firearm suicides,” Stoddard said. 
The same Johns Hopkins study found that child access prevention “was associated with reductions in youth gun suicide rates.” As Utah’s high youth suicide rate continues to increase, Stoddard sees HB80 as a helpful mechanism to reduce that tragic statistic.
“You can see that the data is clear,” Stoddard said. “These types of laws help.”
A narrower bill every year
For the last four years, Stoddard has sponsored some version of a gun storage bill without success, narrowing the legislation every year in an effort to respond to lawmakers’ concerns.
“I’ve worked with the drafting attorneys year after year to try to get this as narrow as possible,” Stoddard said in an interview with Utah News Dispatch. “There’s really nothing else we can do to make it more narrow, other than drop it to an infraction, which at this point just seems ridiculous.”
HB80 includes four requirements, all of which must be met to proceed with criminal prosecution of a firearm owner in the event a minor uses it to commit a crime:

A gun owner fails to secure a loaded firearm in a “box, case, chest, locker, safe, or similar receptacle that is secured in such a manner so as to prevent an individual from accessing the contents of the container.”
A gun owner “knows or reasonably should know that a minor is likely to obtain possession of the loaded firearm.”
The minor obtains access to the firearm in violation of “Section 76-11-211, possession of a dangerous weapon by a minor.”
The minor “possesses, exhibits, or uses the firearm in a public place; or draws, exhibits, or unlawfully uses the firearm” as a “dangerous weapon in (a) fight or quarrel.”

For third year in a row, Utah lawmakers shoot down secure firearm storage law  

“It is a very strict statute. You saw four separate requirements that had to have been met,” Stoddard said. “This isn’t just, ‘oh, I didn’t lock up my gun. Now you can charge me with a crime.’ This is, ‘I didn’t lock up my gun. I knew a kid could get it. Kid got it, kid did something illegal with it.’”
Despite multiple failed attempts, Stoddard said he plans to “keep bringing back” similar legislation in the future. “I feel very strongly about it, both in terms of gun violence, safety and also mental health,” he said. “It should be a higher crime, but I wanted to pass something the committee would be comfortable with in terms of bill language and bill level.”
“At this point, there’s nowhere else to go,” Stoddard added. “It’s either we want kids to be safe and we’re willing to deal with what might be an inconvenience of locking up our firearms and requiring people to do the same, or we’re just OK with it because we don’t want to step into that role.”
Violent gun crime
During public comment, Brett Robinson, chief policy adviser for the Salt Lake County District Attorney’s office, spoke in favor of the bill, citing trends in youth violence. 
“Up until five years ago, the demographic that committed the most homicides in our state was those who are 20 to 29 years of age at 150 homicides,” he said. “You flash forward to the last 10 years, the demographic with the most homicides are those who are 10 to 19 years of age, with 164.”
Robinson thanked the committee for previous legislation aimed at reducing youth crime, but emphasized HB80 could serve as an additional preventative tool. 
“This is another avenue that perhaps can decrease that number, and that’s just to stem the flow of these guns that get in the hands of children,” he said. “Many of the cases that we prosecute involve minors, and many of them get these guns or access to them within their own homes. Doing something to encourage responsible ownership is something that we believe will decrease the amount of cases that we need to prosecute.”

University of Utah freshman Ivy Manno expressed concern for mass shootings during public comment, referencing her experience with a school shooting that targeted a neighboring high school in Denver. 
“My generation knows all too well the devastation that gun violence can wreck in someone’s life,” she said. “My experience leads me to emphasize how important safe storage is today.”
Manno is a member of Students Demand Action, a student-run, anti-gun violence activist group. She spoke with Utah News Dispatch after the committee meeting and expressed frustration with the vote. 
“I think there was a slight misunderstanding of the bill in a lot of cases,” she said. “It can be construed in a different light, to make it sound like they’re trying to criminalize gun owners, but that really is not the intent.”
Opposition to the bill
The bill was voted down along party lines, with the nine Republican committee members who opposed it citing home defense and rural gun ownership. 
“I don’t know that we’re in a position where we should be mandating (firearm storage),” said Rep. Matthew Gwynn, R-Farr West, pointing to concern about “defending the sanctity of the home.” 
Referencing his own experience as a firearm owner, Gwynn said his family does not lock up all their firearms. 
“I don’t know that I can support a bill that’s going to make myself in violation of the statute,” he added. “This bill will make me a criminal. That’s the reality … we live in a world where sometimes we get threats.”
Clark Aposhian, board chairman for the Utah Shooting Sports Council and the organization’s registered lobbyist, spoke in opposition to the safe storage bill. He expressed concern that the bill would shift the “burden of proof in criminal law from (the) state to the individual.”
“HB80 shifts the legal burden in a very concerning way,” Aposhian said. “It includes an affirmative defense clause, so gun owners now must prove they comply with the state’s safe storage expectation if a minor acts as a firearm.”
Stoddard responded to Aposhian’s claims when he spoke with the Dispatch. “That’s 100% inaccurate. We have so many statues with affirmative defenses, and it’s not something that’s novel to this bill,” he said. “We have a lot of criminal statutes that have affirmative defenses. So it doesn’t shift the burden. It’s essentially a way out.”
Stoddard also emphasized that the bill’s narrow scope would prevent frequent prosecution under HB80. “This isn’t something that would get charged very often, and if it was, it would be in a justice court where someone could come in and say, ‘hey, look, here’s how I had this locked up.’ (The) prosecutor can see it and dismiss the case, and that’s why we provided that escape valve.”

Phaneuf discuss his article about Susan Keane, who is retiring after four decades.","Susan Keane spent four decades shaping fiscal policy in Connecticut. This will be the first year the General Assembly will convene without her since 1983.
WSHU’s Ebong Udoma spoke with CT Mirror’s Keith Phaneuf to discuss his article, “Susan Keane, champion of open budgeting in CT, calls it a career,” as part of the collaborative podcast Long Story Short. Read Keith’s story here.
WSHU: Hello, Keith. Over the years, most of us have turned to you to help explain the intricacies of Connecticut state budgets. So it’s fascinating to hear about Susan Keane, the person behind the scenes who helped shape Connecticut budgets for more than four decades. She was your guide to understanding the state’s budget. Tell us about Susan and about how you first met her.
KP: Well, I first met Susan Keane back in the early 1990s, 1993 to be exact, when I was literally just in my first session trying to understand how the Appropriations Committee works. I think a lot of reporters tend to think, Well, the first thing I have to do is get to know the legislators. But what I learned early on is that good, non-partisan staff are what make every committee work. They’re the folks who handle the records, who gathered the research for legislators, who organized the meetings. And it was Susan Keane who first really showed me how that process worked. And it took me a while to realize how much I was benefiting just from how seriously she took that process.
WSHU: Now, you say that she kept things on track; she pretty much kept things moving. And crafting a budget is a very complicated business. Could you just tell us what goes into it and how she was able to keep on top of it?
KP: I can tell you what goes into it, if you want me to explain how she was able to pull it off — I still haven’t learned. It’s a very long process. We tend to think most folks, when they think of the budget, of the budget or the state budget, they just think of a book or the money that’s spent, but really it’s, it’s the product of months and months of work. The legislature’s Appropriations Committee, which has roughly 50 members, one of the largest committees, has a dozen subcommittees, and at any given time, its members can also be assigned to different task forces. They will, over the course of about two to two and a half months, be conducting dozens of hearings, not just the committee proper, but all of the different subcommittees. They break the budget down, and one subcommittee will deal with human services, and another with transportation, and so on. And I mean, most news organizations have one or two folks covering the capital. You can’t even get to all those meetings, so you’ve got to be able to go back, look at the minutes, and try to figure out what’s important. Meanwhile, in some sessions, hundreds of bills move through a committee, all of which, if they have any fiscal impact, ultimately become part of the budget. The fact that Susan has a system that allows you to get that information pretty much at your fingertips is amazing.
WSHU: Well, that’s really amazing. Let’s talk a little bit about Susan, the person. How did she get into this in the first place?
KP: Susan sort of got into it by accident. She was attending the University of Hartford. She wasn’t intending to work in government, but there was an opportunity for an internship at the state capitol. State Representative at the time in the late 1970s, Tom Serrani of Stamford, picked her for that internship, and within two years, he had asked her to run the Transportation Committee. A few more years after that, her mentor insisted that she apply for an opening with the Appropriations Committee, and she very quickly, not only got the job, but developed a close friendship with the house chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee at the time, a state representative named Janet Polinski, who really instilled in Susan a deep appreciation for open government.
WSHU: Now, you know, you say that she did not particularly care for the Appropriations Committee. She felt it was something that would be difficult for her to understand. How did she warm up to it?
KP: Well, what she said originally was, because Susan’s very loyal, and she was working on the Transportation Committee, and she noticed that the Appropriations Committee killed a lot of their bills, meaning whatever the Transportation Committee legislators were asking for money. The way Susan recalled it, appropriation said no, but I think appropriation, some folks call it the feeling committee. It is really where, probably more than any other committee, the public consistently reaches out. I mean, the average person may never testify in their life before the General Assembly, or maybe once or twice, but when you get that issue, that drives you to the point where you may want to drive to Hartford, or nowadays, thanks to Susan Keane, there are sometimes opportunities to testify online, or even if you submit something in writing, usually there’s dollars attached to it, which means, sooner or later, it goes through the Appropriations Committee, and I think, dealing with the public and seeing how people needed a way to connect with their legislators. And Susan saw herself as the facilitator of that connection, and I think that’s what drew her to the job and kept her on the job.
WSHU: How did she make that process open to the general public? What exactly did she do?
KP: Again, so many ways. I’ll just give you a few examples. Okay, if there were challenges in testifying. Let’s say you were a community college student, and you really wanted to talk to the General Assembly about some cutbacks, but just because of your classes, nine to five wasn’t working, Susan would find a way to make sure that there might be evening hours. There were instances, at times, where folks with mental illness, perhaps because of anxiety or other issues, really had trouble staying in a crowded room, so she’d have different procedures to stagger the testimony. Traditionally, a lot of times, committees let public officials go more quickly than the general public. Susan reversed it the other way and said, okay, the folks who have the mental health needs, we’ll take care of them. First, one of the things, if you’ll permit me, though, I want to also point out, as a member of the media, that was huge. You know, if you’re trying to cover an issue, it’s hard enough, it’s complicated enough. But if legislators are discussing a document, say a draft section of a portion of the budget, and you want to follow along. It’s hard enough to follow the discussion, but imagine if you’re following it and you don’t have a copy of the document they’re discussing. Now you might get it afterward. But Susan made sure you could get it while they were talking about it. She said, I know reporters will be coming to me saying, Can I get a copy so I know when they turn to page 43, What the heck is on page 43. Susan already had copies ready. She had an organized process to make sure the copies didn’t run out.
WSHU: Wow, I can really identify with that. You say that during COVID, she took the helm and made it possible for the hybrid hearing system to be developed, where you would have online people testifying online. Could you just tell us a little bit about how that evolved and how she took charge of that?
KP: Susan had been involved for years in taking the lead on training legislative staff, new legislators, providing an orientation for them, and assisting lobbyists to try to understand how the process works. So it was natural that during the coronavirus pandemic, when the pandemic struck, legislative leaders turned to her to basically say, please take the lead and try to set up a process. I mean, we’ve always had, I shouldn’t say, always, for a long time now there’s been the Connecticut Network, the internet news and cable news system for the legislature, and they have most of the hearing rooms in the Legislative Office Building wired for sound, and there are cameras, but it’s not interactive. You can watch something on CT-n, but it’s not like you can speak to legislators through your computer screen. So we had to set up with, you know, remote technology systems.
And I’m not saying like, for example, that. Susan Keane invented Zoom. But if you think about it, the legislature has very specific rules, for example, on how you conduct a meeting and how you vote, and you can’t just assume Jane Doe voted, because I think I heard some sound in the ether, and Susan set up a process to keep the things going, keep the debates going, keep the votes going, where folks would have to almost like, I think I compared it to a game of Simon Says. First, Simon says, turn on your computer camera, show your face. Then Simon says, state your full name. Then Simon says, state how you’re going to vote. Then wait to make sure the committee administrator has confirmed it. And at the beginning, folks continue to forget what Simon said and Sue with without ever any arrogance, would gently, sort of steer them back, go through it all. She also set up tons, most folks don’t even know of YouTube channels for General Assembly committees, which also creates another record. So if you miss a meeting, you can go back. Say you just wanted to watch. But for some reason, the event wasn’t on the Connecticut Networks’ main news feeds. You could find it on YouTube.
And just one last point, I’m sorry to drag this out. This system is still very much in play. There will be a lot of hybrid meetings. Most meetings now are hybrid, where some folks are in attendance, some aren’t. There will be times when the legislature, a legislative committee, really can’t schedule enough votes unless they have remote attendance, and it makes committee meetings so much more efficient, because you can gather them relatively quickly, because folks don’t all have to drive in from Hartford.
WSHU: Now you say that Susan will be missed at the Capitol for her Irish wit and fiery red hair, not to mention a deep appreciation of music and dance. Could you tell us about the music and dance aspect?
KP: Well, she was an Irish step dancer as a child, actually very accomplished at that in the 80s and 90s. And I’m feeling old here, because I definitely remember the 90s with the General Assembly session, and there was a really big party after midnight, after they gaveled out. And Susan always enjoyed her dance. Her knowledge of music, though, is staggering. I mean, like I said, if you want to talk classical, if you want to talk big band, if you want to talk hip hop, if you want to talk 70s pop, or 70s funk, or 80s pop. It does not matter. Susan Keane is right there with you.
WSHU: And you say she will always be remembered for her laughter and sense of humor.
KP: Yes, Susan certainly was always very focused on the job. But there were a few times when, if we let’s put it this way, she never shortchanged a laugh. Susan did not. There was not a little mild chuckle. If she was going to laugh, she committed full-scale. She commits full scale to that laugh.
WSHU: Well, thank you so much, Keith. I really appreciate this behind-the-scenes look at the administrative staff that makes the Capitol work.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026_0109_SR_SusanKeane_085-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-26 14:57:33.271668

In a conversation moderated by Dr. Ebony Lumumba, a Jackson Stave University English professor, Davis will discuss the connection between freedom struggles in the Deep South and in Sudan, Congo and Palestine. It will center on themes from her 2016 book “Freedom is a Constant Struggle.” Attendees can submit questions that Lumumba will review and select for the moderated discussion.

The event will be at Woolworth Chapel starting at 5 p.m., with doors opening at 4 p.m. It is free and open to the public. An RSVP is not required to enter and does not guarantee seating. There will also be a livestream. 
Humanitarian organization Mississippi for a Just World partnered with Tougaloo College and Black With No Chaser to create the Voices for a Just World Lecture series.
“One of our main focuses is on educating community, and we want to bring dynamic speakers who have radical imaginations that are rooted in the fight for human rights,” said Candace Abdul-Tawwab, MSJW’s co-founder and executive director.
C.J. Lawrence, co-founder and CEO of Black With No Chaser, said, “It’s very rare that you would get the opportunity to do this. I think it’s important that we seize the moment while we can to connect with a revolutionary person and icon like Professor Angela Davis.”
Abdul-Tawwab said that partnering with Tougaloo College made sense because of the institution’s legacy as a hub for civil rights activists. Several people who work at Black With No Chaser are Tougaloo alumni.
In the 1960s and 70s, Davis was a prominent activist and member of the Communist Party of the United States of America and associated with the Black Panther Party.

James Comer received praise from President Donald Trump for a weekend interview where the congressman had suggested the president should consider removing federal immigration agents from Minnesota. 
Comer, who represents Kentucky’s 1st Congressional District, was critical of Democratic Minnesota leaders, including Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, for “getting people jacked up” about U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in the state on Fox’s Sunday Morning Features with Maria Bartiromo. Comer contrasted the situation in Minneapolis with Washington, D.C., where Mayor Muriel Bowser’s administration has cooperated with federal law enforcement and National Guard troops deployed by Trump to fight crime. 
ICE agents fatally shot a 37-year-old man, Alex Pretti, in Minneapolis on Saturday. The death comes roughly two weeks after an ICE officer shot 37-year-old Renee Good. 
“If I were President Trump, I would almost think about, ‘OK, if the mayor and the governor are going to put our ICE officials in harm’s way, and there’s a chance of losing more innocent lives or whatever, then maybe go to another city and let the people of Minneapolis decide: Do we want to continue to have all of these illegals? Are we going to allow our governor, attorney general and mayor to get away with this?”
Comer continued, adding that he thinks Minnesotans would “rebel against their leadership” over illegal immigration. 
Trump wrote on Truth Social Sunday afternoon that Comer “was GREAT in his Interview” on Fox, adding that Comer had “said it all” about Minnesota and other topics. 
“Jamie is doing a fantastic job!” the president said. 
The president announced on Monday that he would send U.S. border czar Tom Homan to Minnesota following Pretti’s death. 
On Fox, Bartiromo also asked Comer if ICE officers saw Pretti was armed during Saturday’s incident. The Kentucky Lantern’s sister outlet, the Minnesota Reformer, reported that a local official said the victim in the shooting was a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry. 
“I’ve watched that video dozens of times in slow motion. I’ve tried to determine whether he actually pulled a gun out or not,” Comer said. “I don’t know. I just know that the situation’s bad there.”
Comer then blamed sanctuary policies in Minnesota for illegal immigration in the state.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fancyfarm_001-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-26 14:57:33.271668

The new version of the state’s Work-Based Learning Tax Credit, approved in 2025, took effect this month. It replaces two prior incentives and supports learning requirements in Louisiana’s new school accountability system. 
The nonprofit Leaders for a Better Louisiana advocated for the tax credit changes because few employers took advantage of the old ones, chief policy officer Barry Erwin said.
“The change in the accountability system has prompted school districts and superintendents to consider more ways to involve students in internships and other work-based learning experiences in high school, so hopefully it will be a win-win,” Erwin said in an email, “Help meet school performance goals for students and provide employers a stronger incentive to hire them.” 
In 2024, Louisiana’s Board of Elementary and Secondary Education approved a school accountability system that places a greater emphasis on high schools offering work-based learning experiences to their students. The system went into effect for the 2025-26 school year. A student who takes part in a work-based learning program under the accountability system also qualifies their employer for the tax credit.
The credit is available to businesses who make eligible hires in 2026. The amount of the credit is $2.50 per hour worked, up to a maximum of $2,500 per eligible worker per year. Students must work for their employers for at least 100 hours in the tax year for the business to qualify for the credits. The old credit offered $1.25 per hour worked and required businesses to employ the student for at least 250 hours per year. 
In certain circumstances, the credit can apply to workers up to age 24 who are not in high school. It is non-refundable, but any credit that exceeds a company’s Louisiana tax liability can be carried forward for up to five years.
Employers can claim the credit on their tax returns beginning in 2027. Total tax credits are capped at $1 million the first year but are allowed to grow to a maximum of $7.5 million in future years if participation grows.
Louisiana lags well behind other Southern states in the number of young people participating in internships and apprenticeships. Only about 5% out of the more than 40,000 Louisiana high school students who graduate annually hold an internship credit each year. The percentage is up to five times higher in Georgia and Tennessee, according to a Leaders for a Better Louisiana report last year. 
The same goes for apprenticeships. Louisiana has fewer apprenticeships than many of its neighboring states, and they pay the least. Only three out of every 1,000 Louisiana students graduate high school with apprenticeship experience, compared with nine in Arkansas. Apprenticeships in Louisiana pay an average of $14.90 per hour, comparable to the Arkansas wage but much less than Mississippi’s $21 per hour, according to the Leaders for a Better Louisiana report. 
Applications for Louisiana’s tax credit will be approved on a first-come, first-served basis and must be submitted between Jan. 1 and Feb. 28 each year through the Louisiana Taxpayer Access Point, known as LaTap for short. 
More information can be obtained from the Louisiana Department of Revenue.

(Bryce Dix/KUNM)Two bills that aim to strip the Mexican gray wolf of its federal endangered species protections are now snaking their way through the federal lawmaking process.
The Republican-led pieces of legislation – the “Pet and Livestock Protection Act” introduced by U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert, (R-Colo.) and the “Enhancing Safety for Animals Act of 2025” authored by U.S. Rep. Paul Gosar, (R-Ariz.) – would essentially do the same thing: delist the Mexican gray wolf from the Endangered Species Act.
If successful, the delisting would shift management back to the states of New Mexico and Arizona, potentially create “opportunities” for lobo hunting and trapping (depending on individual state regulations), and halt genetic diversification efforts.
While similar attempts to delist the animal have failed in the past, the current political atmosphere has advocates worried about what might happen if Congress decides the wolf doesn’t need help anymore.
Leia Barnett, a conservation advocate with the New Mexico-based environmental non-profit WildEarth Guardians, said she is stunned these bills are sailing through Congress, and wants politicians to ground themselves in the science of consistent management of the species, not political bickering.
“We’re not going to see that if we’ve got a patchwork management scheme that’s based on individual state agencies determining what’s right, rather than a larger national plan that can work towards meaningful, robust recovery,” Barnett told KUNM.
On Thursday, Rep. Gosar’s bill went through a “committee markup” meant to tweak language before a bill is sent to the House floor.
There, Gosar made the claim that the wolf “has been recovered” and his constituents are “paying the price” for increasing livestock depredations.
“Ranchers are losing cattle, horses and dogs,” Gosar said. “Families who have been stewards for the land for generations are being driven out of business.”
Although the species was almost completely wiped off the landscape from trapping and hunting, the Mexican wolf population has made a significant comeback thanks to coordinated recovery efforts and the broad protections of the Endangered Species Act.
At the same time, as wolf numbers continue to grow, data from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service shows that cattle kills have been proportionally dropping since 2019.
[data-viz src=”
Despite these discrepancies, Gosar said the federal management of the wolf is costing taxpayers and ranchers lots of money.
“This is not an anti-conservation bill, it is a pro-science, pro-law and pro-people bill,” Gosar said in support of his own legislation. “It acknowledges success where success has been achieved, and rejects the notion that federal agencies should operate without limits or consequences.”
To conservationists like Barnett, it’s not as black and white.
“There is robust science that tells us what we need to have a healthy, thriving, resilient lobo population,” Barnett said. “That includes 750 wolves at a minimum, dispersed across three interconnected sub populations of 200 wolves.”
A recent survey count estimates there are around 286 wolves in New Mexico and Arizona.
Additionally, research shows that the genetic diversity of the species is dangerously low – so much so, the whole population is as genetically related as siblings.
After the brief debate about the lobo’s recovery – ranging from the population’s growth, to the loss of rancher livestock from depredations, to science – the House Committee on Natural Resources ultimately decided to leave most of Gosar’s bill untouched, and recommended the full House pass the measure when it’s taken up for a vote.
The language of this bill, in particular, is alarming to Barnett because it would make any future attempts to relist the wolf much harder by preventing wildlife managers from considering the recovery status of lobos south of the border.
“That’s vindictive and malicious,” Barnett said. “It’s not based upon the needs of that species.”
Meanwhile, Rep. Boebert’s attempt at delisting the wolf is much farther along in the legislative process. It has already cleared the House and is now moving through Senate committee assignments.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/brycedixphoto-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-26 13:57:12.861996

(Photo by Meghan Riley)A lawsuit filed by more than 15 conservation organizations says that the federal government has stalled in its plans to save wolverines. The lawsuit asks a court to compel the U.S. Department of the Interior and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to lay out specific plans to protect the threatened species’ habitat, the first part of the conservation project.
Biologists and conservation organizations have long lobbied scientists and politicians to place the wolverine on the Endangered Species List as a “threatened species,” a designation that focuses on a species’ habitat and ranges. The Biden administration did that in February 2023.
After an animal or plant is placed on the list, federal law allows the government a year to determine its range — the places that need to be protected and given special consideration in order to stop further losses. The federal government may extend that time by one year, if it needs, according to the lawsuit.
However, more than two years have passed, and the conservation organizations say that the federal government is violating its own laws by not moving forward on the process, even as the Trump administration looks to remove protections for other species, like grizzly bears and gray wolves.
“The service has yet to initiate the process of designating critical habitat for wolverines,” the lawsuit said. “The service is not actively working on a proposed rule to designate critical habitat for wolverines.”
 Wolverine populations in the West

The lawsuit said organizations included in the lawsuit have been commenting, and reminding the federal government, about the deadline. Now, they say the courts have the power to act and compel the federal government to begin the process.
“The (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service) determined wolverine warranted listing under the ESA, primarily due to ongoing and increasing impacts of climate change and associated habitat degradation and fragmentation,” the lawsuit said.
The lawsuit said science proves wolverines need the snow of high elevations in order to den and rear their kits. Those areas are being impacted by both climate change and more human encroachment, the lawsuit states.
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimates that 50 wolverines occupy the Idaho/Montana linkage area and 63 are in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, as of November 2023. Furthermore, it estimated just a few more than 200 wolverines in the Lower 48 states beyond those in and around Montana’s ranges.
“Wolverine populations, though widespread, were relatively small, fragmented and isolated from larger populations in Canada,” the lawsuit said.
The groups say that the service has not been able to provide any documentation that process has even begun, now more than two years after the designation.
“Wolverines are just hanging on — down to roughly 300 individuals. They deserve and desperately need all the protections guaranteed by law after being recognized as threatened, including critical habitat” said Matthew Bishop, senior attorney at the Western Environmental Law Center. “Having areas set aside as critical habitat is a major — if not the most important — factor in helping threatened and endangered wildlife recover. Given wolverines’ small population size and climate change quickly shrinking the snowy habitat they rely on to survive, time is of the essence.”
The groups who are suing the federal government include: Friends of the Bitterroot, WildEarth Guardians, Friends of the Wild Swan, Swan View Coalition, Oregon Wild, Cascadia Wildlands, Alliance for the Wild Rockies, Cottonwood Environmental Law Center, George Wuerthner (as an individual), Footloose Montana, Native Ecosystems Council, Helena Hunters and Anglers Association, Wilderness Watch, Trap Free Montana, and Friends of the Clearwater.

Ron DeSantis. (Screenshot via the governor's X livestream)Candy for Valentine’s Day?
Maybe not.
The administration of Gov. Ron DeSantis announced Monday that it had tested 46 types of candy and that more than 60% of them (28) contained elevated arsenic levels that, consumed over time, could put children at an increased risk of cancer. 
This is the second announcement this month the DeSantis administration has made about its testing efforts and the results being posted on the Healthy Florida First website. The governor and First Lady Casey DeSantis announced Florida had tested 24 infant formulas and found that 16 contained heavy metals or chemicals.
Those efforts followed Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s, directive to the federal Food and Drug Administration to look at ingredients used in infant formula. Before he joined the administration of President Donald Trump, Kennedy promised to look at whether there were toxic metals in infant formula.
Although the DeSantis administration purports that 28 candies showed high levels of arsenic, the first lady stressed that not all test results were bad. For instance, she said none of the candy the state tested showed elevated levels of lead, mercury, cadmium, or “other problematic carcinogens.”
She also highlighted the candy that didn’t contain higher levels of arsenic, including Hershey Milk Chocolate Bar, Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups, Whoppers, M&M’s, Twix, and Milky Way.

“Our goal really has been, as the governor has articulated, to support the federal [Make America Healthy Again] movement by working as force multipliers, to be able to drive accountability through testing,” she said Monday during a press conference at The Villages. 
“The [Food and Drug Administration] primarily works as a reactionary force, stepping in after problems are identified, and while that role is very important, Florida is really working to change the system by supporting the FDA to not only continue to get in front of these problems by testing, but also by leading a coalition of states to trust but verify the integrity of our food supply.”
Florida tests 24 formulas; purport that 16 have at least one heavy metal

Florida tested candy from 10 different manufacturers. The Florida Phoenix reached out to six of the companies for comment but none of them immediately responded.
Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo joined the governor and first lady at the press conference and thanked the pair for providing him with the support to conduct the tests. He also thanked them for having the “vision” to know the testing should be conducted.
“There’s a lot more to go. There’s plenty of dirt, unfortunately, to uncover,” Ladapo said.
Arsenic is a naturally occurring element. It is a confirmed carcinogen and long-term exposure can increase the risk of skin, bladder, lung, and liver cancer. Kidney and prostate cancers may also be tied to high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic is “everywhere” and “in all foods,” Ladapo said, but added that it tends to be in low concentrations.
“I was really shocked by the levels of arsenic in common candies, the levels of arsenic in common candies are much higher, two, three, four times higher than even foods that we know have high levels of arsenic in general, like rice,” Ladapo said. “And compared to foods, just typical foods that people eat, the levels of arsenic were 20, 30, 40, times higher. It’s just unbelievable.” 
While elevated arsenic levels in a single piece of candy may not be harmful, the first lady stressed that it becomes harmful when taken into context of how candy is marketed and consumed.
For example, she said, Nerds Grape and Nerds Strawberry candy both showed elevated arsenic levels. The DOH determined that a child could safely eat roughly 96 pieces of Nerds candy in a year with no worries. 
“But 96 Nerds, as we well know, is not typically what comes in a box. When you think about it, a typical smaller box can contain about 2,000. If you get one of those big boxes that you get, like a movie theater, that’s about 8,000 Nerds,” she said. “Asking families to stop at 96 pieces over a year is not realistic when it’s viewed against how the product is packaged, marketed, and then consumed.”",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-26-at-9.45.40-AM-1024x553.png,,,2026-01-26 13:57:12.861996

Dan McKeon of Amherst and his lawyer Perry Pirsch, not pictured, during an arraignment hearing at the Lancaster County Courthouse on Monday, Jan. 26, 2026, in Lincoln. (Kenneth Ferreria/Lincoln Journal Star)LINCOLN — Former State Sen. Dan McKeon of Amherst is sticking with his not guilty plea in court after resigning from the Nebraska Legislature to avoid the risk of being expelled.
A procedural hearing in Lancaster County Court on Monday set the date for McKeon’s bench trial for March 19. McKeon faces a misdemeanor charge of disturbing the peace, which comes with a maximum sentence of three months in jail, a $500 fine or both.
McKeon arrived late to his rescheduled hearing Monday after first trying to participate via Zoom from his attorney Perry Pirsch’s Lincoln office. Pirsch told Lancaster County Court Judge Matthew Acton that they intended to be there in person, but a prior Cass County Court case Pirsch was involved with was delayed.

Acton said parties must receive permission ahead of time to attend hearings using Zoom and ordered McKeon and Pirsch to travel to the courthouse before they proceeded.
“Court rules for both the district and county court states that all court hearings are presumed to be in person, sir,” Acton said. “And you did not ask for permission prior to appear via Zoom, so get down here.”
McKeon resigned from the Legislature this month minutes before debate was set to begin on a resolution to possibly expel him, which would have been a first in Nebraska history. He faced expulsion proceedings over allegations that he inappropriately touched a legislative staffer during an end-of-session party last year and what the Legislature’s Executive Board described as a “demonstrated pattern of behavior,” based on the results of an internal investigation.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
A separate criminal investigation after the incident led to McKeon being cited for misdemeanor public indecency by the Nebraska State Patrol in October. Prosecutors have since charged him with misdemeanor disturbing the peace.
The Examiner is aware of the alleged victim’s name but is not publishing it because it is the policy of States Newsroom and the Examiner not to identify people who say they have been abused unless they wish to talk publicly.
McKeon missed his first court date in December. Pirsch said McKeon initially intended to plead no contest and sought to file that plea through a waiver, but Acton said that wasn’t allowed and ordered the arraignment be rescheduled for Monday and ordered McKeon to attend in person.
McKeon later changed his mind and pleaded not guilty in response to the Legislature’s Executive Board recommended he be expelled in a unanimous vote.
In a social media post Jan. 20, McKeon addressed his district saying that the process that led to his departure was “painful, frustrating, and at times unfairly portrayed in the headlines.”
“A series of political maneuvers reached a point that forced my resignation before an expulsion vote could occur,” McKeon said in a since-edited Facebook post.
McKeon had faced calls to resign since October when he was initially cited, including from Gov. Jim Pillen and other state officials. McKeon said multiple times that he would not resign.
Multiple lawmakers — including one who supported McKeon — corroborated that there were enough votes to successfully expel McKeon, had the debate taken place. It takes 33 votes to expel a sitting senator.
The day after McKeon’s resignation, Pillen appointed State Sen. Fred Meyer of St. Paul to represent District 41 in central Nebraska. Meyer had previously been appointed to the same seat by Pillen to replace Tom Briese, who resigned to serve as state treasurer.
Later this year, a special election will decide who serves the remaining two years of McKeon’s term. The Nebraska Secretary of State’s Office confirmed that no candidates have filed for that election as of Monday.

Carolyn Caiharr, an Edwardsville Republican, questioned a proponent of a bill that would allow lenders to charge a prepayment penalty to real estate investors. (Screen capture from the House Financial Institutes and Pensions Committee)TOPEKA — Real estate investors buying residential buildings in Kansas could be charged a penalty for paying off their mortgages early under proposed changes to the Kansas Contracts and Promises statute. 
The statute currently bars lenders from charging prepayment penalties on “any home loan” paid off after six months from the day the loan was taken out, the House Financial Institutions and Pensions Committee heard Monday. It doesn’t specify whether those loans are for individual homeowners or for real estate investors buying properties to rent or lease. 
House Bill 2497 would add language that allows lenders to charge prepayment penalties for investment properties but leave the ban in place for consumer personal loans.
Michael Stidham testified for Rocket Mortgage in favor of the bill, which he said would give investors more financing options. 
Rocket sets lower interest rates for loans that have a penalty for paying off early versus loans with no prepayment penalties, Stidham said. 
“A higher interest rate is always going to be required to offset the potential returns if that loan is paid off earlier than anticipated by the investor,” he said.
Allowing lenders to offer lower interest rates and include a prepayment penalty gives real estate investors flexibility to determine the best option for their financial situations, Stidham said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/House-finance-1-26-26-1024x612.png,,,2026-01-26 13:57:12.861996

(Jordan Hansen / Daily Montanan)Upper Missouri Waterkeeper is again petitioning the Montana Department of Environmental Quality to list the Big Hole River as impaired in a letter submitted earlier this month.
The letter was submitted as a comment to the agency’s 2022-24 Draft Water Quality Integrated Report, which is a federally required process to determine where waterways are unhealthy and outline what’s being done about it.
While the Big Hole is not currently listed as “impaired,” other waterways in Montana are — about 11,000 miles of rivers and streams as well as 375,000 acres of lakes. Each of those rivers, streams or lakes has supporting documentation detailing why they’re considered impaired. Those problems can range from lack of clean drinking water to the health of fish living in the water.
“DEQ is actively reviewing and assessing mainstem Big Hole River data submitted by the petitioners. Some additional information requested from petitioners was received as recently as January 9,” DEQ spokesperson Madison McGeffers wrote in an email. “In addition, 2025 laboratory results from DEQ’s own monitoring were recently received and will be incorporated into the assessment after quality assurance checks are performed.”
In the letter, Waterkeeper says that the state isn’t using nutrient pollution and dissolved oxygen concentrations in their river assessments. Low oxygen levels can happen at night, which are sometimes caused by algae blooms. Most plants don’t photosynthesize and produce oxygen at night.
In the draft DEQ water report, oxygen concentrations are specifically addressed:
“DEQ also will not be including dissolved oxygen (DO) assessments during this Integrated Report. Upon initial implementation of a draft DO assessment method, DEQ identified many instances in which Montana’s DO standards do not fully account for natural variability in DO conditions, leading to potential impairment designations even in areas with little to no human influence.”
Waterkeeper and other organizations it has worked with have done extensive monitoring on the Big Hole River.
“Nothing is preventing local groups and residents from taking actions to address water quality issues in the Big Hole River watershed right now. The entire watershed is eligible for 319 funding (DEQ’s 2026 call for applications open through Feb. 20) to address nonpoint source pollution,” McGeffers wrote. “Thanks to previous monitoring and watershed restoration planning, DEQ and local partners have already identified nutrient issues in the greater Big Hole watershed and have a good understanding of pollution sources as well as the types of strategies that can be implemented to address them.”
Montana, following legislation passed in 2021, does not base nutrient assessments upon the numeric nutrient criteria, instead using what’s called “narrative standards,” which Waterkeeper says is less accurate. The Environmental Protection Agency rebuffed Montana’s use of narrative standards under the Biden administration, but it’s been implied this appears to have changed under the second Trump administration.
“We note the Department withheld publishing a draft 2022-24 Integrated Report until winter 2025/26, almost a full year after the 2024 field season and after EPA’s approval of Montana’s repeal of numeric nutrient standards,” the Waterkeeper letter reads. 
The DEQ’s assessments also do not include assessments of excessive algal growth, nitrate and nitrite, total nitrogen, as well as total phosphorus, the draft report states.
“DEQ has a mandatory duty under federal law to identify unhealthy waters based on available data,” Guy Alsentzer, executive director of Upper Missouri Waterkeeper, said in a statement. “Instead of using existing, undisputed science to identify problems and initiate restoration planning for degraded waterways, the agency is pretending very real nutrient pollution problems don’t exist.”
The letter also states the agency’s actions on the Big Hole are “contrary” to the requirements of the Clean Water Act, saying it’s not assessing “nutrients and nutrient impairments.”
It goes on to say the Clean Water Act requires all currently available data be used.
“The Department’s refusal to assess our and others’ scientific evidence and make a determination of attainment or nonattainment in the Big Hole River — or any other river for which the Department possesses nutrient science — is unlawful, as it frustrates and undermines the purposes and intent of the CWA and Montana WQA, and citizens’ right to a clean and healthful environment under the state constitution,” the letter reads.

The Wauchula Republican, now in “good spirits,” began experiencing chest pains Sunday morning. He was taken to the emergency room at Tallahassee Memorial Hospital, where physicians discovered a small blood clot in his lung.
“The President is in good spirits and has been in frequent communication with staff via phone and email yesterday and today,” the Senate’s office wrote in a statement. “All previously scheduled Senate business will proceed as planned this week.”
Although Albritton is still in the ER under observation and awaiting further testing, his office expects him to return to his office later this week.
The 57-year-old Senate president was first elected to the Florida House of Representatives in 2010 and then to the Senate in 2018. In Oct. 2023, during the first Senate presidential term of Republican Sen. Kathleen Passidomo, Albritton was unanimously selected president-designate.
He took over the role in November 2024, presiding over his first session as president in the coming months. Albritton’s top priority legislation was a “Rural Renaissance” package designed to revitalize housing, education, healthcare, business, and agriculture in Florida’s farmlands.
Although it failed, the bundle has been resurrected for the 2026 session.
“The President and Mrs. Albritton are grateful to the physicians and staff at Tallahassee Memorial for the excellent care the President is receiving,” the statement continues. “He looks forward to returning to the office later this week.

Kevin Stitt, is calling on the federal government to reassess their immigration enforcement policies. 
Stitt, chair of the National Governors Association, and Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, vice chair of the organization, issued a joint statement Sunday calling for federal and state governments to work together and reset strategy following the death of a second Minnesotan by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

“As governors, we urge leaders at all levels to exercise wisdom and consider a reset of strategy toward a unified vision for immigration enforcement,” Stitt, a Republican, and Moore, a Democrat, said in a statement. “We believe there are criminals in our country who must be held accountable, but moments like this demand thoughtful leadership, coordination, and clarity. Scenes of violence and chaos on our streets are unacceptable and do not reflect who we are.”
Across the country, including in Oklahoma, the Trump administration has ramped up deportation efforts amid growing protests. The Trump administration has focused heavily on Minnesota, which officials have said has the “worst of the worst” criminals in the country illegally. The federal government has sent over 3,000 federal agents there, five times the number of Minneapolis police officers.
President Donald Trump said in a post on Truth Social that he is sending Tom Homan, the White House Border Czar, to Minneapolis. He also wrote that deportation efforts are going “peacefully and smoothly” in Republican-run cities and states, including Texas, Georgia, Florida, Tennessee and Louisiana. 
He said those states have had “zero protests, riots or chaos” because local police and ICE were “cooperating and working together.” Multiple media reports in those states show residents in those states are protesting immigration enforcement.
There have been three shootings by immigration officers in Minnesota in as many weeks, most recently on Saturday when 37-year-old nurse Alex Pretti was killed.

The shootings have led to increased demonstrations and protests in Minnesota and in cities around the country. 
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has said Pretti was armed and officers fired in an act of self-defense. Videos of the shooting, captured by bystanders, shows Pretti wrestled to the ground by multiple officers before more than 10 shots are fired. 
Minneapolis’ chief of police has said Pretti was a lawful gun owner.
Earlier in the month, authorities said ICE agent Jonathan Ross shot and killed Renee Good, 37, on Jan. 7 as Good was protesting. A week later, federal agents shot a Venezuelan man in the leg during what ICE called a “targeted traffic stop.”
Stitt and Moore, on behalf of the National Governors Association, asked for the federal government to work with state and local law enforcement with a “transparent strategy” and a unified approach. 
“Clarity of purpose is essential to maintaining public trust, ensuring accountability, and avoiding unintended escalation,” they said. “The use of federal authority should be guided by a transparent strategy that complements — rather than supplants — state and local efforts to uphold the law.
Stitt also said on CNN that the death of Americans causes “deep concern” and called the situation a tragedy. He said Americans “don’t like what they’re seeing right now.” 
“So what’s the goal right now,” he said. “Is it to deport every single non-U.S. citizen? I don’t think that’s what Americans want. We have to stop politicizing this. We need real solutions on immigration reform.”

Huizenga has now joined a small group of Republicans calling for increased oversight of ICE actions, including GOP Sens. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who have all called for independent probes into Pretti’s killing. 
Murkowski said on Sunday, POLITICO reported, “ICE agents do not have carte blanche in carrying out their duties.”

As a faculty member for 12 years and a North Carolina resident for more than 20, this delights me. I always recommend my home institution, NC State, but I’m enthusiastic about our entire system, rightly known as one of the best in the country. Our sixteen public universities offer comparatively lower tuition than neighboring states, and our extraordinary faculty include Nobel Prize winners, MacArthur Genius grantees, Pulitzer Prize winners, and more.
But a college education is still expensive — for most families, it’s like buying a new car every year for the next four years. Ideally, the expense will be worth it, launching students into financially, intellectually and culturally rewarding lives and careers.
But parents and students, would you knowingly buy a new car (or four new cars) with a failing engine?
As the president of the North Carolina Conference of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP), I fear that unless we work to protect the academic freedom of our public universities, we may be asking you to do just that.
More than anything that draws students to our campuses — more than winning sports teams and fancy dining halls, state-of-the-art labs and well-stocked libraries — academic freedom is what makes our universities work. It is the engine of knowledge creation, creativity, and excellence.
Yet this engine is under more strain than ever before — almost all of it unnecessary. For UNC system professors, Trump’s second term began with savage and censorious DOGE cuts to the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, and the National Endowment for the Humanities. Last spring and summer, right-wing activists ambushed our UNC campuses, targeting faculty and staff with secret recordings, and then pressured administration to fire staffers. Also last summer, our flagship institution delayed tenure votes for 33 faculty members, most of them in the humanities and social sciences, for no reason other than an objection to tenure itself. Then in December, UNC System President Peter Hans hastily announced a plan to make all our syllabi public records. Not only that, but UNC schools will also be forced to create a publicly searchable database of all of our syllabi, inviting right-wingers to target faculty for doxxing and harassment.
AAUP NC objects to and fights back against all of these attacks on academic freedom, and so should you.
We define academic freedom as “the freedom of a researcher in higher education to investigate and discuss the issues in his or her academic field, and teach or publish findings without interference from political figures, boards of trustees, donors or other entities.” Simply put, academic freedom is the freedom of teachers and researchers at colleges and universities to do the work of educating students and advancing knowledge in their fields.
It’s strongly connected to academic tenure, the indefinite appointment of faculty that happens after a set period of time, usually six years of excellent research and teaching. Tenure, which in the UNC system comes with a modest raise, allows faculty to expand their research, without fear of reprisal or job loss, in ways that are important to their department and university.
But academic freedom is also more than tenure — it’s also the freedom to discuss, without censorship, relevant issues in the classroom, to research and publish creative and scholarly work, and the freedom from institutional censorship when critiquing their institution or system (as in this op-ed) or other things happening in society. Like all freedoms, academic freedom calls for responsible and ethical use. Faculty must be respectful of the views of students as they guide their thinking, and model its responsible and ethical use.  
If you care about the reputation that backstops your child’s diploma, you should care about that institution’s commitment to academic freedom. North Carolina’s public universities have traditionally attracted some of the best professors and researchers in the world. Their work factors strongly into university rankings. These professors will not continue to come here — and, in fact, many will leave —  if they can’t access a fair and transparent tenure system, a university system invested in their protection, and university leaders unwilling to bend to politically-motivated demands.
And finally, do you want your child to finish their degree and leave the state, or to choose among opportunities offered by a thriving North Carolina economy? That’s also connected to academic freedom. UNC System schools contribute billions of dollars to our state’s economy, create thousands of jobs and hundreds of patents, attract start-ups and established companies to our state, and serve all of our one hundred counties through extension work in agriculture and healthcare, and through research and cultural programming.
As parents and prospective UNC system families, your voices matter. You can write directly to your chosen university’s admissions office. You can share your support for academic freedom — and your concerns about cuts, firings and tenure delays — through social media and parent networks. You can encourage your students to speak up, too — their voices are even more powerful, because their education is our core work and mission.
I hope your students get into their dream schools, and I also hope they know what makes those schools dreamed-of destinations in the first place. Let’s work together to protect academic freedom and keep our state universities healthy and thriving environments for all our students.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Paying ballot-question petition circulators would be prohibited in South Dakota by a bill the House State Affairs Committee approved Monday at the Capitol in Pierre.
Rep. Travis Ismay, R-Newell, introduced House Bill 1087 in response to several questions that appeared on the 2024 general election ballot with help from paid petition circulators.
“This bill that I am bringing honors the will of the people and not out-of-state interests,” Ismay said.
Petitioners in South Dakota need 17,508 signatures from registered voters to propose a law, which is known as an initiative, and the same number of signatures to put a bill passed by legislators on hold for consideration by voters, which is known as a referendum. The number of signatures required to propose a state constitutional amendment is 35,017.
Amid complaints about big-money ballot measures, new reports show $12 million spent in 2024

Under Ismay’s bill, if a court determines a campaign compensated a petition circulator — with money or gifts — the petition would be declared invalid. 
The bill passed with a 9-4 vote, which means it will go to the full House of Representatives.
Opponents said the bill would trigger a legal challenge if enacted and cost thousands of taxpayer dollars to defend. Opponents included the American Civil Liberties Union of South Dakota, South Dakota Advocacy Network for Women, and the South Dakota Education Association.
Rep. Tim Reisch, R-Howard, echoed their concerns.
“We’re not going to give our teachers a pay raise, we’re out of money, and we’re going to pass a bill that we know is going to cost the taxpayers millions of dollars,” Reisch said. “I’m going to be a ‘no’ on this.”
Rep. Spencer Gosch, R-Glenham, said the cost of potential legal battles would be worth the attempt to level the playing field, rather than allowing the ballot measure process to be a “money game.”
“I am limiting one person’s ability to have more speech over mine just because they have more money,” Gosch said. “That one individual could hire multiple entities because they can afford to do so. I could not. Therefore, my vote is less important than their vote.”
The committee also approved Senate Bill 5, which would require the state attorney general’s official ballot-question explanations to include whether a ballot question was placed on the ballot by legislators or by citizen petitioners.

(Photo by Michelle Griffith/Minnesota Reformer)Attorney Chris Madel released a blistering statement Monday about the federal government’s current surge of immigration officers as he announced he is dropping out of the race for the Republican nomination for Minnesota governor. 
Madel said in a video posted to X that he’s dropping out, in part, because he can’t stand by the Republican Party’s support of the federal immigration crackdown in Minnesota, where many U.S. citizens  walk the streets in fear and carry documentation to prove their citizenship. 
“I cannot support the national Republican’s stated retribution on the citizens of our state, nor can I count myself a member of a party that would do so,” Madel said, whose defense of a state trooper charged with murder raised his profile in recent years. “Operation Metro Surge has expanded far beyond its stated focus on true public safety threats.” 
His statement underscores the increasing unease Minnesota Republicans — which now includes several swing-district lawmakers — are expressing about the surge of federal officers.
In recent weeks, Madel has performed well in local GOP party straw polls, especially for a candidate with little name recognition and no political experience. Madel pitched himself as a political outsider who could win voters over using the communication skills he’s developed from his decades as a defense attorney.
Madel’s announcement comes after federal agents fatally shot Alex Pretti in Minneapolis on Saturday — the third shooting by immigration officers in three weeks and the second to end in death. The Trump administration has called Pretti a “domestic terrorist” who wanted to physically harm law enforcement. Videos taken at the scene belie the Trump administration’s claims. 
In the video announcing the suspension of his campaign, Madel criticized U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s use of administrative warrants, which do not require a judge’s sign-off, to unlawfully enter people’s homes and “weaponizing criminal investigations against political opponents.”
“I personally have spoken to several law enforcement officers, some Hispanic and some Asian, who have been pulled over by ICE on pretextual stops. Driving while Hispanic is not a crime, neither is driving while Asian,” Madel said. “At the end of the day, I have to look my daughters in the eye and tell them, ‘I believe I did what was right,’ and I am doing that today.” 
Madel represented State Patrol Officer Ryan Londregan, who was charged with murder and manslaughter after he shot and killed Ricky Cobb II in 2023. Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty wound up dropping the charges against Londregan.
Earlier this month, Madel provided legal counsel to Jonathan Ross, the federal agent who shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Good.
In addition to his criticism of Operation Metro Surge, Madel said he was dropping out because “national Republicans have made it nearly impossible for a Republican to win.” 
Madel said he doesn’t believe President Donald Trump has been given enough credit, including negotiating a ceasefire between Israel and Gaza. He also criticized Minnesota Republicans for failing to properly investigate fraud in the state’s public programs.
Madel said he will return all the donations made to his campaign for governor.
“God bless you, and God bless Minnesota,” Madel concluded. “We certainly need it.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/P1163918-scaled-e1764617500172-1024x635.jpg,,,2026-01-26 11:58:05.727687

Gov. Tate Reeves on Tuesday will deliver his State-of-the-State Address.","The audio version of this story is AI generated and is not human reviewed. It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
The focus of the 2026 Mississippi legislative session so far has been the gulf between Republican House and Senate leaders over school choice, or, more pointedly, the House proposal to spend millions of tax dollars on private schooling.
Senate leaders vow opposition to the omnibus House Bill 2 because of this facet. But House Bill 2 is a kitchen-sink measure, with many other education proposals thrown in. And, it would appear, the Senate leadership is open to many of these. Its education panel passed a slew of them in separate bills on to the full Senate last week. These include measures to expand the state’s successful literacy and math programs into higher grades, promote prayer in school and allow homeschooled children to play in public school sports. And as for school choice, both chambers appear onboard with allowing public school students to switch schools or districts more easily.
But will the standoff over private-school vouchers prevent agreement on other measures? A full-court political press is on. Local governments and school officials continue to lobby against HB2, while some apparently well-funded and organized proponents are sending out robo-texts to constituents in home districts of Republican lawmakers who oppose the measure. Even the White House has been applying pressure on Mississippi Republicans for passage of the voucher measure.
Otherwise, lawmakers face a busy couple of weeks, with key deadlines approaching. Importantly, a first major “killing deadline,” one that will likely weed out hundreds of bills, is Feb. 3, the deadline for committees to pass or kill bills from their own chamber. 
Other major debates to watch this session are:

Ballot initiative. This has become a perennial issue since the state Supreme Court nullified this right for Mississippi voters in 2021. Lawmakers can’t seem to get together on the particulars, although many proclaim they want to restore voters’ ability to sidestep the Legislature and put measures to a statewide vote. The 2027 state elections loom, and lawmakers face pressure to resolve this before reelection time.


Online sports betting. This is a major House initiative, and its leaders have tried to sweeten the pot for a reluctant Senate, proposing to earmark tax revenue from mobile gambling to shore up the state’s government employee retirement system.


Campaign-finance reform. Another perennial issue facing more urgency with the 2027 elections looming, the state’s lax, confusing, conflicting and often unenforced campaign-finance laws leave our elections open to an unchecked flow of dark money and special interest influence. But it appears two main players in potential reform, the secretary of state and attorney general, are getting on the same page.

Quote of the Week

“I do have a little problem, Mr. House Speaker. In fact, I’ve got three problems … I’ve got a problem with my woman, with my girlfriend and with my wife …” — famed blues musician Bobby Rush, who gave an impromptu singing and harmonica performance on the House floor on Tuesday.

In Brief
Prison health reform proposed
A slate of bills from House Corrections Chair Becky Currie, a Republican from Brookhaven, would revamp the delivery of health care in state prisons.
The proposals come after Mississippi Today’s “Behind Bars, Beyond Care” series, which has documented the alleged routine denial of health care in state prisons and deadly outcomes.
Currie’s bills would establish a corrections ombudsman to investigate health care complaints, establish hepatitis C and HIV treatment programs, provide kiosks for prisoners to request medical attention and require correctional officers to wear body cameras. But most of the bills have been double-referred, meaning they would have to pass through two committees. That’s sometimes a sign that a bill doesn’t have the support of a chamber’s leadership. – Michael Goldberg
Bill would provide benefits for gig workers
A growing number of Americans are working as independent contractors and “gig” workers. 
They often do not receive employer-provided benefits such as health care and retirement.
House Bill 1072, the “Voluntary Portable Benefit Plan,” aims to help these workers access benefits. Authored by Rep. Lee Yancey, a Republican from Brandon, the bill would create a separate type of benefit that follows workers across jobs. A hiring firm could make tax-deductible contributions to the account and it would not be counted as taxable income for the worker. Similar portable-benefit accounts have been created in other states, such as Alabama and Tennessee. – Katherine Lin
Gov. Reeves to deliver State of the State address
Gov. Tate Reeves will deliver his State of the State Address to a joint session of the Mississippi Legislature on Tuesday.
The address, which will be aired live by Mississippi Public Broadcasting, will be delivered at 5 p.m. in the second-floor rotunda at the state Capitol. Read a transcript of Reeves’ 2025 address here. – Mississippi Today
DeSoto board wants power to remove member
HERNANDO — Some DeSoto County School Board members want a legal process by which an elected school board member could be ousted for concerns including malfeasance and abuse of power. They passed a resolution in November formally asking lawmakers to consider granting that authority in the current legislative session.
Sen. Kevin Blackwell, a Republican from Southaven, has filed Senate Bill 2068, which would allow a school district’s local governing authority, by majority vote, to remove a school board member for breach of public trust, neglect of duty and abuse of authority. The school board would first have to vote on a recommendation.
Rep. Kimberly Remak, a Republican from Olive Branch, is the primary author of House Bill 573, the House mirror of Blackwell’s bill.  – Leonardo Bevilacqua
Earlier teacher procurement cards proposed
The Senate Education Committee on Thursday passed a bill that would distribute procurement cards, which teachers use to pay for classroom supplies, in July instead of August.
A report from the state Auditor’s office last summer showed that the card is activated too late to be useful, and that many teachers are forced to spend their own money on supplies.
The cards provide every teacher $748.
Sen. Scott DeLano, a Republican from Biloxi, said the new date would be tight, given that the state’s fiscal year starts in July. But he said the change is necessary because school districts are starting earlier and earlier. – Devna Bose
Bill would prohibit secret government settlements
Sen. Angela Hill, a Republican from Picayune, filed a bill that would prohibit government bodies from entering into private settlements and ban judges from sealing settlements, especially if they involve tax money. 
Hill told Mississippi Today that the legislation is about promoting transparency and allowing the public to know if taxpayer dollars are paying settlements. She said government bodies can redact the identities of people involved, if necessary. 
“We’re not talking about making private identities public — this is talking about tax dollars,” Hill said.  – Taylor Vance
Truancy officers would see pay raise
A bill pending before the Senate would give truancy officers a significant pay increase.
School attendance officers, under current law, are paid at least $24,000 a year. The new bill would raise the minimum by $10,000.
The bill also expands the responsibilities of attendance officers to dropout prevention and establishes a more robust framework to combat absenteeism, an issue that Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann has said is one of his top priorities.
Chronic absenteeism, or missing at least 10% of a school year, has more than doubled in Mississippi since 2018. – Devna Bose
Boyd wants local governments to livestream
The Senate Government Structure Committee last week advanced a bill that would require all government bodies in the state to livestream meetings and post agendas on their website. 
Sen. Nicole Boyd, a Republican from Oxford, filed the legislation and told Mississippi Today that requiring public bodies to do this would not cost them a significant amount of money and should not be a significant burden on them because several agencies and local governments already do this. 
“It’s important for everyday citizens to find out what’s going on in our local boards and commissions,” Boyd said. – Taylor Vance
By the Numbers
$100 million
Amount the University of Mississippi Medical Center is asking the Legislature to provide for what hospital officials hope will become a “gold standard” cancer center. UMMC has already raised $90 million of the estimated $250 million total cost.

Sherrill says impeachment of U.S. homeland security chief ‘has to happen immediately’,Sophie Nieto-Munoz,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/briefs/sherrill-homeland-security-impeachment/,"Gov.

Mikie Sherrill said the Trump administration is ""wholesale lying"" to Americans about the fatal shooting of a Minneapolis nurse. (Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)Gov. Mikie Sherrill on Monday called for Congress to “immediately” impeach U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in the wake of the fatal shooting of a Minnesota man by a border patrol agent.
The comments from New Jersey’s Democratic governor, who took office last week, come one day after Nevada Sen. U.S. Senator Jacky Rosen (D) called for Noem’s impeachment.
“I think that has to happen immediately,” Sherrill said in an interview with WNYC. “There needs to be a stand-down from duty, because all of these agents are acting completely outside the scope of their duties. It’s dangerous, and it should not be acceptable to anyone — Democrat, Republican alike, should all be calling for this to end immediately.”
Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old nurse from Minneapolis, was shot dead Saturday during an altercation with federal immigration agents, marking the second fatal shooting by agents this month in Minneapolis. The Minnesota city has been flooded with immigration agents as part of President Donald Trump’s mass deportation effort.
After Murphy, some lawmakers want limits on clemency powers

Noem alleged that Pretti approached agents with a gun to “inflict maximum damage on individuals and to kill law enforcement,” and an agent shot and killed Pretti in an act of self-defense. Videos of the episode appear to show an agent disarming Pretti before another agent shoots him multiple times. Minneapolis officials have said Pretti was legally allowed to be carrying a firearm.
Sherrill in her WNYC interview accused the Trump administration of “wholesale lying to American people, making up stories about the people that this police force is killing on the streets.”
“Make no mistake, if you look at that video, it is hard to escape the understanding that that was a crime committed by that police force,” she said. “There’s no accountability. They are completely backed up by the president’s administration in their wrongdoing in their actions against the American people.”
Immigrant advocates in New Jersey have been pushing the Legislature to pass a package of bills aimed at limiting when local law enforcement and other public officials can cooperate with federal immigration agents. Sherrill’s predecessor, Phil Murphy, signed one of the bills last week but vetoed two others before leaving office, saying he worried they would conflict with federal law or leave the state open to legal challenges.
The advocates are now hoping the Legislature will advance the two vetoed bills and send them to Sherrill for her signature. It’s unclear whether she supports them.
One of the bills would codify the Immigrant Trust Directive, a state attorney general order from 2018 that restricts state and local cooperation with immigration agents.

The day after federal immigration agents fatally shot Minneapolis protestor Alex Pretti, Vermont Republican Gov. Phil Scott condemned the violence of federal immigration agents. 
“Enough…it’s not acceptable for American citizens to be killed by federal agents for exercising their God-given and constitutional rights to protest their government,” he said in a statement Sunday. 
On Saturday, federal agents in Minneapolis shot and killed Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse who was protesting President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown and the Jan. 7 killing of Renee Good in the city.
In the wake of Pretti’s killing, video analyses by national media have contradicted the claims of federal officials, who asserted that officers shot Pretti in self-defense after he approached officers with a firearm. Video footage shows that Pretti approached the officers holding his phone — not a gun. 
In videos of the scene, half a dozen officers wrestled Pretti to the ground in tactical gear. Though Pretti did have a semiautomatic pistol on him, officials said he was licensed to carry it. And videos show that officers knocked away his gun before fatally shooting him. Pretti was a U.S. citizen with no criminal record, according to the Minneapolis police chief. 
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security called its crackdown in the city the largest immigration operation in the department’s history earlier this month, marking a significant escalation since first targeting Somali immigrants in December. 
In his statement, Scott called on Trump to change course in Minnesota. 
“The President should pause these operations, de-escalate the situation, and reset the federal government’s focus on truly criminal illegal immigrants. In the absence of Presidential action, Congress and the Courts must step up to restore constitutionality,” he said. 
The two most recent killings of U.S. citizens in Minnesota are far from the first violent incidents involving federal immigration agents. Immigration agents also shot and wounded two people in Oregon, fatally shot one person in Chicago and shot at least eight civilians in vehicles since July. 
“At best, these federal immigration operations are a complete failure of coordination of acceptable public safety and law enforcement practices, training, and leadership,” Scott said. “At worst, it’s a deliberate federal intimidation and incitement of American citizens that’s resulting in the murder of Americans. Again, enough is enough.”

All across the country, ICE and Border Patrol agents have conducted police-state-style raids and other actions that have terrorized communities and raised constitutional issues of profound importance.
At the same time, numerous changes to immigration policy – many of them adopted without public knowledge or input – have made an already complex system more opaque and confusing than ever.
At such a challenging moment, the nation is blessed to have a small and courageous cadre of nonprofit advocates who work each day to monitor and shine a light on the system and advocate for basic American values like due process. And recently Newsline got a chance to talk with one of the most able and best-informed attorneys working in this arena, American Immigration Council Deputy Legal Director, Raul Pinto.
In Part One of our recent extended conversation with American Immigration Council Deputy Legal Director, Raul Pinto, we delved into some of the most worrisome front burner issues related to immigrants and immigration policy currently afflicting the nation – including the deeply disturbing mass raids, arrests and violence launched by the Trump administration in numerous communities across the country.
In Part Two of our chat, we dug deeper into some of these and related issues, including the matter of transparency and accountability in the immigration law system and an ongoing effort by Pinto and his colleagues to compel the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to simply provide immigrants with their own immigration records.

(Kentucky Transportation Cabinet photo)Kentucky officials are investigating three deaths that may be related to the weekend’s severe snow and ice. 
In a Monday morning press conference, Gov. Andy Beshear said at least one fatality may be a result of running a generator indoors. 
“Check on your neighbors, just make sure they’re OK,” the governor said. “What a good time to live out the parable of The Good Samaritan. All it takes is a phone call or knocking on their door, just see if they’re all right.” 
Beshear also emphasized that Kentuckians should use caution when shoveling snow, as the activity can increase risk of heart attacks. Last year, six Kentuckians died while shoveling snow.
Over the weekend, Kentucky was blanketed with snow and ice, making roads hazardous and causing power outages. Beshear said the state was down to 47,123 power outages from 73,590 at the height of the storm Sunday. 
For the week ahead, Kentucky is forecasted to have extremely cold temperatures. Beshear said that wind chills as low as negative 20 degrees statewide are expected. 
“Tomorrow morning is going to be the worst. It is going to be dangerously cold,” the governor said. “Tomorrow morning being outside for just 10 to 30 minutes could result in hypothermia or frostbite, so we need everyone to take precautions.” 
The Kentucky General Assembly had canceled its meetings Monday because of the weather. All eight of Kentucky’s public universities canceled classes or moved to online instruction options. 
Beshear said in his briefing that while all Kentucky counties had “major impacts,” Barren, Pulaski, Allen and Monroe counties were among the hardest hit by the storm. 
A few hundred Kentuckians are being sheltered, the governor added, and that number is being updated as more people are transported to assistance. About 150 people were evacuated from London hotels without power. Some guests were also evacuated from Barren River State Park. 
Secondary roads across the state were “still impassable,” as of Monday morning, Beshear said. While interstates had “significant process,” he continued, drivers should slow down while traveling.. 
Transportation Cabinet Secretary Jim Gray said a tractor-trailer had jackknifed on I-75 southbound near Clays Ferry Bridge, which is between Madison and Fayette counties. Information on injuries was not immediately available. 
“Our focus today is on priority routes, crossovers, ramps, turn lanes and secondaries,” Gray said of the road crews’ plans for Monday. “We’re taking advantage of what sunlight we have before the onset of this bitter and brutal cold tonight.” 
On Saturday, President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency for several states, including Kentucky, due to the weather. Beshear declared a state of emergency for Kentucky Friday. 
In light of the weather, Attorney General Russell Coleman’s office is taking reports of suspected price gouging at its hotline, 1-888-432-9257, or online. 
Kentuckians should call 911 in emergencies or life-threatening situations. If someone has immediate needs that aren’t life-threatening, like little to no heat or phone issues, they can complete the online Rapid Needs Assessment Form or call 502-607-6665.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-26 15:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Trump administration plans to write regulations using Artificial Intelligence,Jesse Coburn | ProPublica,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/26/trump-administration-plans-to-write-regulations-using-artificial-intelligence/,"The Transportation Department, which oversees the safety of airplanes, cars and pipelines, plans to use Google Gemini to draft new regulations.","This story was originally published by ProPublica.
The Trump administration is planning to use artificial intelligence to write federal transportation regulations, according to U.S. Department of Transportation records and interviews with six agency staffers.
The plan was presented to DOT staff last month at a demonstration of AI’s “potential to revolutionize the way we draft rulemakings,” agency attorney Daniel Cohen wrote to colleagues. The demonstration, Cohen wrote, would showcase “exciting new AI tools available to DOT rule writers to help us do our job better and faster.”
Discussion of the plan continued among agency leadership last week, according to meeting notes reviewed by ProPublica. Gregory Zerzan, the agency’s general counsel, said at that meeting that President Donald Trump is “very excited about this initiative.” Zerzan seemed to suggest that the DOT was at the vanguard of a broader federal effort, calling the department the “point of the spear” and “the first agency that is fully enabled to use AI to draft rules.”
Zerzan appeared interested mainly in the quantity of regulations that AI could produce, not their quality. “We don’t need the perfect rule on XYZ. We don’t even need a very good rule on XYZ,” he said, according to the meeting notes. “We want good enough.” Zerzan added, “We’re flooding the zone.” 
These developments have alarmed some at DOT. The agency’s rules touch virtually every facet of transportation safety, including regulations that keep airplanes in the sky, prevent gas pipelines from exploding and stop freight trains carrying toxic chemicals from skidding off the rails. Why, some staffers wondered, would the federal government outsource the writing of such critical standards to a nascent technology notorious for making mistakes?
The answer from the plan’s boosters is simple: speed. Writing and revising complex federal regulations can take months, sometimes years. But, with DOT’s version of Google Gemini, employees could generate a proposed rule in a matter of minutes or even seconds, two DOT staffers who attended the December demonstration remembered the presenter saying. In any case, most of what goes into the preambles of DOT regulatory documents is just “word salad,” one staffer recalled the presenter saying. Google Gemini can do word salad.
Zerzan reiterated the ambition to accelerate rulemaking with AI at the meeting last week. The goal is to dramatically compress the timeline in which transportation regulations are produced, such that they could go from idea to complete draft ready for review by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in just 30 days, he said. That should be possible, he said, because “it shouldn’t take you more than 20 minutes to get a draft rule out of Gemini.”
The DOT plan, which has not previously been reported, represents a new front in the Trump administration’s campaign to incorporate artificial intelligence into the work of the federal government. This administration is not the first to use AI; federal agencies have been gradually stitching the technology into their work for years, including to translate documents, analyze data and categorize public comments, among other uses. But the current administration has been particularly enthusiastic about the technology. Trump released multiple executive orders in support of AI last year. In April, Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought circulated a memo calling for the acceleration of its use by the federal government. Three months later, the administration released an “AI Action Plan” that contained a similar directive. None of those documents, however, called explicitly for using AI to write regulations, as DOT is now planning to do.
Those plans are already in motion. The department has used AI to draft a still-unpublished Federal Aviation Administration rule, according to a DOT staffer briefed on the matter.
Skeptics say that so-called large language models such as Gemini and ChatGPT shouldn’t be trusted with the complicated and consequential responsibilities of governance, given that those models are prone to error and incapable of human reasoning. But proponents see AI as a way to automate mindless tasks and wring efficiencies out of a slow-moving federal bureaucracy.
Such optimism was on display in a windowless conference room in Northern Virginia earlier this month, where federal technology officials, convened at an AI summit, discussed adopting an “AI culture” in government and “upskilling” the federal workforce to use the technology. Those federal representatives included Justin Ubert, division chief for cybersecurity and operations at DOT’s Federal Transit Administration, who spoke on a panel about the Transportation Department’s plans for “fast adoption” of artificial intelligence. Many people see humans as a “choke point” that slows down AI, he noted. But eventually, Ubert predicted, humans will fall back into merely an oversight role, monitoring “AI-to-AI interactions.” Ubert declined to speak to ProPublica on the record.
A similarly sanguine attitude about the potential of AI permeated the presentation at DOT in December, which was attended by more than 100 DOT employees, including division heads, high-ranking attorneys and civil servants from rulemaking offices. Brimming with enthusiasm, the presenter told them that Gemini can handle 80% to 90% of the work of writing regulations, while DOT staffers could do the rest, one attendee recalled the presenter saying.
To illustrate this, the presenter asked for a suggestion from the audience of a topic on which DOT may have to write a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, a public filing that lays out an agency’s plans to introduce a new regulation or change an existing one. He then plugged the topic keywords into Gemini, which produced a document resembling a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. It appeared, however, to be missing the actual text that goes into the Code of Federal Regulations, one staffer recalled.
The presenter expressed little concern that the regulatory documents produced by AI could contain so-called hallucinations — erroneous text that is frequently generated by large language models such as Gemini — according to three people present. In any case, that’s where DOT’s staff would come in, he said. “It seemed like his vision of the future of rulemaking at DOT is that our jobs would be to proofread this machine product,” one employee said. “He was very excited.” (Attendees could not clearly recall the name of the lead presenter, but three said they believed it was Brian Brotsos, the agency’s acting chief AI officer. Brotsos declined to comment, referring questions to the DOT press office.)
A spokesperson for the DOT did not respond to a request for comment; Cohen and Zerzan also did not respond to messages seeking comment. A Google spokesperson did not provide a comment.
The December presentation left some DOT staffers deeply skeptical. Rulemaking is intricate work, they said, requiring expertise in the subject at hand as well as in existing statutes, regulations and case law. Mistakes or oversights in DOT regulations could lead to lawsuits or even injuries and deaths in the transportation system. Some rule writers have decades of experience. But all that seemed to go ignored by the presenter, attendees said. “It seems wildly irresponsible,” said one, who, like the others, requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. 
Mike Horton, DOT’s former acting chief artificial intelligence officer, criticized the plan to use Gemini to write regulations, comparing it to “having a high school intern that’s doing your rulemaking.” (He said the plan was not in the works when he left the agency in August.) Noting the life-or-death stakes of transportation safety regulations, Horton said the agency’s leaders “want to go fast and break things, but going fast and breaking things means people are going to get hurt.”
Academics and researchers who track the use of AI in government expressed mixed opinions about the DOT plan. If agency rule writers use the technology as a sort of research assistant with plenty of supervision and transparency, it could be useful and save time. But if they cede too much responsibility to AI, that could lead to deficiencies in critical regulations and run afoul of a requirement that federal rules be built on reasoned decision-making.
“Just because these tools can produce a lot of words doesn’t mean that those words add up to a high-quality government decision,” said Bridget Dooling, a professor at Ohio State University who studies administrative law. “It’s so tempting to try to figure out how to use these tools, and I think it would make sense to try. But I think it should be done with a lot of skepticism.”
Ben Winters, the AI and privacy director at the Consumer Federation of America, said the plan was especially problematic given the exodus of subject-matter experts from government as a result of the administration’s cuts to the federal workforce last year. DOT has had a net loss of nearly 4,000 of its 57,000 employees since Trump returned to the White House, including more than 100 attorneys, federal data shows.
Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency was a major proponent of AI adoption in government. In July, The Washington Post reported on a leaked DOGE presentation that called for using AI to eliminate half of all federal regulations, and to do so in part by having AI draft regulatory documents. “Writing is automated,” the presentation read. DOGE’s AI program “automatically drafts all submission documents for attorneys to edit.” DOGE and Musk did not respond to requests for comment.
The White House did not answer a question about whether the administration is planning to use AI in rulemaking at other agencies as well. Four top technology officials in the administration said they were not aware of any such plan. As for DOT’s “point of the spear” claim, two of those officials expressed skepticism. “There’s a lot of posturing of, ‘We want to seem like a leader in federal AI adoption,’” one said. “I think it’s very much a marketing thing.”

Maura Healey's 2026 State of the Commonwealth speech. They compare her tone and policy position to earlier years, review reactions to the speech, and look ahead at what this says about Healey's run for reelection.","EPISODE INFO
HOST: Jennifer Smith
GUEST: Chris Lisinski






MAURA HEALEY’S FINAL State of the Commonwealth speech in her first term as governor, delivered last Thursday, had to do several things: burnish her record as she runs for re-election, reassure the state that she has made progress on systems in crisis like housing and transportation, roll out a few policy proposals, and set the stage for a year of unpredictable federal actions after President Trump spent his first year back in office taking direct shots at Massachusetts priority areas like green energy and higher education. 
This week on The Codcast, CommonWealth Beacon senior reporters Chris Lisinski and Jennifer Smith dig into Healey’s speech, comparing the governor’s tone and policy position to earlier years, reviewing reactions to it, and looking ahead at what it says about Healey’s second run for the corner office. 
Affordability was the theme of the evening, but Healey also devoted a good chunk of the speech to taking aim at Trump and the impact his policies are having on the state.  
“The first and most striking thing for myself, and frankly, I think most of the other attendees and those in the press corps, was not so much about policy or promises, but about tone,” Lisinski said. After a year of Trump’s “never-ending stream of impacts causing headaches for Massachusetts,” Healey’s speech was a departure from her 2025 State of the Commonwealth, delivered days before Trump’s return to office, in which the governor did not say his name once.  
This year, Lisinski noted, “She really sought to contrast herself from the federal government, and to pitch Massachusetts as, I guess, a bulwark or a shield against overreach by the Trump administration.” 
While groups including Planned Parenthood lauded the governor for her commitment to reproductive choice, progressives bristled at the lack of specific policy promises to address what Healey described as needlessly aggressive US Immigration and Customs Enforcement action chilling entire communities.   
Jonathan Cohn, policy director of Progressive Massachusetts, said after the speech that “the governor offered nothing. Let’s be clear: reining in ICE violence is a kitchen table [matter], as there is no such thing as affordability when families are being broken apart and workers are being kidnapped on the way to work.” 
On affordability, Republican gubernatorial hopefuls savaged Healey’s plan to reduce utility bills during the costly heating season, which depends in large part on utility companies simply delaying payments until spring and summer. 
“Gov. Healey’s ‘plan’ for energy relief is basically a payday loan scam,” Mike Kennealy said in his response. He called the speech a “masterclass in political spin” and slammed Healey’s commitment to a “climate agenda” that he blamed for the state’s high utility rates.  
On energy, Healey touted the now-operational high-voltage transmission line bringing hydroelectricity from Quebec into the Bay State. But Smith noted the absence of comment on wind power, after the governor in 2024 touted the state as “leading the clean energy revolution” with the Vineyard Wind project and looked ahead at reviewing offshore wind proposals that “could equal up to 25 percent of our energy needs.”  
Trump has identified offshore wind as a target, halting construction on major projects by citing national security concerns and throwing offshore wind plans across New England coasts into limbo. 
“Those sorts of pivots aren’t always apparent in the speech itself in front of you,” Smith said of the governor’s wind omission this year and last, “but when you can track it year over year, you can tell that since 2024, Healey has sort of seen that it’s going to become a lot harder to promise wind projects going forward.” 
Healey gestured at the difficult path ahead, even while declaring the state of the Commonwealth to be strong, saying there’s “no doubt it may get worse before it gets better.” Her plans to “do what we have to do to make it better” should come into sharper relief this week as the governor rolls out her annual budget proposal.

(Photo: Nevada Gold Mines presentation to investors)The price of an ounce of gold traded for more than $5,000 an ounce for the first time in history Monday.
The milestone was the latest in a series for precious metal markets that have been on a tear. Less than a year ago, in March, gold’s price surpassed $3,000 an ounce. Then it broke the $4,000 threshold in October.
The price of silver, which increased by an even larger percentage than gold in 2025, has also continued to soar in 2026, and topped $100 an ounce Friday.
Since the start of the year the price of gold has increased by 17%, and silver’s climb continues to outpace it, rising 55% since January 1.
Nevada is the nation’s largest gold producer, and the second largest producer of silver, after Alaska.
The rush to precious metals over the last year has been attributed to a so-called “sell America” trade wherein investors are seeking shelter amid geopolitical volatility, fear of inflation, and the declining value of the world’s dominant currency, the U.S. dollar, which dipped to a four-month low early Monday.
Financial market nervousness has only been heightened so far in 2026 by a steady stream of tumult, including Donald Trump rupturing relations with Europe with his intentions to gobble Greenland, his continuing on-again off-again tariff threats, and his Department of Justice launching an investigation of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell as part of Trump’s effort to effectively seize personal control of the the world’s most powerful central bank and with it, the power to set U.S. interest rates.
The share prices of Nevada’s largest mining corporations were also boosted in early trading Monday. That too is a continuation of last year, when global economic anxiety helped Newmont Corp.’s share price to soar by more than 180%, and Barrick Mining Corp’s to shoot up more than 200%. Newmont stock is already up 26% since the start of the new year, while Barrick’s was up slightly more than 20% year to date as of Monday morning.
Barrick is the operator of Nevada Gold Mines, a joint venture with Newmont. Last year, the venture accounted for more than two-thirds of the gold mined in Nevada.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Image-3-10-25-at-5.49-PM-1024x612.jpeg,,,2026-01-26 10:58:51.209138

Cole County Circuit Judge Christopher Limbaugh after a hearing on Wednesday promised he would rule by Feb. 10 on whether to issue a preliminary injunction to block elections on property tax caps that must be held in April in 97 counties.
A second hearing in the case, originally filed by two taxpayers, six school districts and a fire district, will be held next week as attorneys for the plaintiffs seek a summary judgment in their favor.
And in a Jan. 16 decision certain to be appealed, Limbaugh denied standing — the right to sue — and dismissed a case brought by two lawmakers and a conservative activist arguing the wide-ranging legislation violated procedural rules for passing bills.
The bill approved by lawmakers in a June special session offered up to $1.5 billion in incentives to keep the Kansas City Chiefs and Royals in Missouri. It also expanded a program of tax credits as an incentive for major amateur sports competitions, offered tax credits for disaster relief and set the property tax caps in 97 of the state’s 114 counties.
In 75 counties, voter approval would limit future increases in tax property tax bills to 5% or the rate of inflation, whichever is greater. For 22 counties, voter approval would mean individual property tax bills could not increase.
The tax base would be reset when a property changes hands. The caps allow tax bills to increase when a new or increased tax is approved by voters.
Feb. 10 is a key date because that is when April ballots must be certified by local election authorities. Twenty-seven counties joined the lawsuit after it was filed, arguing that the cost of the election is an unfunded mandate that violates the Missouri Constitution.
Attorney Jim Layton, who represents several of the original plaintiffs, said Limbaugh must decide whether the property tax caps are improperly passed special laws or violate constitutional provisions requiring uniformity in taxation and equal rights.
Lawmakers opted their counties into the legislation during a late-night floor session, deciding what level of relief they wanted for their area. Many of the state’s largest counties were excluded, leaving Boone, Greene, Jackson, St. Louis County and the city of St. Louis out of the law.
“There’s no rational basis for the lines that it drew, or for designating some counties, particular counties, as 0% or 5% or unaffected counties,” Layton said in an interview with The Independent.
The state is defending the law by saying it will provide cover to local assessors who have been reluctant to bring property values up to the current market because of its impact on tax bills, Layton said.
Neither the original plaintiffs nor the intervening counties challenging the tax caps are asking Limbaugh to throw out the entire law. That was the goal of the lawsuit that was dismissed Jan. 16, filed by state Sen. Mike Moon, a Republican from Ash Grove, and state Rep. Bryant Wolfin, a Republican from Ste. Genevieve, and Ron Calzone, a conservative activist who has challenged several laws for violating procedural rules in the Missouri Constitution. 
Moon and Wolfin “claim that they have legislative standing to challenge (the law, but) this court is unaware of any Missouri statute or case law conferring such standing upon petitioners Moon and Wolfin,” Limbaugh wrote.
Calzone, who claimed standing as a taxpayer who would be damaged by having public funds spent, failed in that argument, Limbaugh wrote. Tax credits to promote major amateur sporting events are not a “direct expenditure to be made by the state,” and payments for bonds on stadiums are subject to appropriation, which means they are not automatic.
“There is no ‘direct expenditure of funds generated through taxation’ that could confer taxpayer standing,” Limbaugh wrote.
Calzone, in an interview, said Limbaugh made a mistake because the tax credits for amateur sporting events are refundable — meaning the state will write a check if the credits exceed what the taxpayer owes the state.
The ruling also cited an incorrect version of the law on amateur sporting event tax credits, he said. The section cited is the one that existed, with lower credit amounts, before the special session law was enacted.
The options for the plaintiffs are to ask Limbaugh to reconsider based on what they believe are errors in the decision or take the case to higher courts on appeal, Calzone said.
“That is something we are still trying to determine,” he said. “But absolutely, one way or another, we will end up in the Missouri Supreme Court.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/092623_colecountycourt2-scaled-e1757967844893-1024x614.jpg,,,2026-01-26 10:58:51.209138

Tim Walz, a Democrat with whom the president has often clashed, around midday Monday.“It was a very good call, and we, actually, seemed to be on a similar wavelength,” Trump said of the conversation. “The Governor, very respectfully, understood that, and I will be speaking to him in the near future. He was happy that Tom Homan was going to Minnesota, and so am I!”White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during an afternoon briefing that Gregory Bovino, the U.S. Border Patrol commander-at-large, would “continue to lead” immigration agents across the country, but did not address whether he would be active in Minneapolis once Homan arrived. CNN reported Monday afternoon  Bovino and some of his agents were set to depart the city. Homan “has not been involved in that area, but knows and likes many of the people there,” Trump wrote on social media. “Tom is tough but fair, and will report directly to me.”Leavitt repeated throughout a 20-minute White House press briefing the administration’s position that Democratic state and local officials were responsible for the situation in Minneapolis, but declined to endorse the harshest descriptions of Pretti that administration leaders, including top White House aide Stephen Miller and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, have used.Border czarEarly in his second administration, Trump tasked Homan with carrying out the president’s mass deportation campaign, which has faced significant pushback in Minneapolis.Homan, who is expected to be in Minnesota by the evening, is the former ICE head of removal operations during the Obama administration and served as acting ICE director during the first Trump administration. Leavitt said Monday that Homan will be “the point person for cooperating with state and local authorities in corresponding with them, again, to achieve this level of cooperation to subdue the chaos on the streets of Minneapolis.”Homan’s arrival comes while thousands of Minnesotans mourn and protest Saturday’s killing of Pretti, an intensive care nurse who appeared to be acting as a legal observer when Border Patrol agents tackled him to the ground, pinned him and shot him multiple times.His was the second fatal shooting of a U.S. citizen by immigration officers in Minneapolis this year. Federal immigration officer Jonathan Ross killed 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, a mother and poet, Jan. 7. Multiple videos captured the killings of both Good and Pretti, further sparking outcry from the community. Investigation underwayLeavitt said an investigation into Pretti’s killing is underway with the FBI, Customs and Border Protection and Homeland Security Investigations. Noem, who oversees HSI and CBP, labeled Pretti “a domestic terrorist,” the same term she applied to Good.“The administration is reviewing everything with respect to the shooting, and we will let that investigation play out,” Leavitt said. Bovino said on CNN Sunday that the agents involved in the shooting of Pretti, are still on duty and while they will be taken off the streets of Minneapolis, they will still be allowed to conduct immigration enforcement.The top Democrat on the House Committee on Homeland Security, Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, said in a statement Monday that those officers still being on duty is contrary to CBP’s use-of-force policy, which requires three days of paid leave after an agent uses deadly force either on duty or off.“It defies commonsense – and is completely inexcusable – that the agent who killed Alex Pretti Saturday is already back in the field terrorizing our communities and believing – as Greg Bovino has so wrongly asserted – that he is the victim,” he said. “At a minimum, the agent should be on Administrative Leave.”Congressional responseSaturday’s killing could have far-reaching consequences on Capitol Hill.Several congressional Democrats over the weekend coalesced to oppose any funding for the Department of Homeland Security’s immigration enforcement, increasing the chances of a partial government shutdown at the end of the week. The shooting also appeared to prompt a handful of congressional Republicans to adjust their position on Trump’s year-long immigration crackdown. The chair of the Senate Committee on Homeland and Governmental Affairs, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, called Monday for the heads of ICE, CBP and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to testify for a hearing by Feb. 12.House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Andrew Garbarino, a New York Republican, also called on the same officials to testify in front of his committee. Sen. John Curtis of Utah was the latest of a handful of Senate Republicans calling for a thorough investigation into the killing and for “those responsible—no matter their title—” to be held accountable.“I disagree with Secretary Noem’s premature DHS response, which came before all the facts were known and weakened confidence,” he wrote on social media. “I will be working with a bipartisan group of senators to demand real oversight and transparency, including supporting calls from @RandPaul for leaders of these operations to testify, so trust can be restored and justice served.”White House’s terms for MinnesotaFor nearly two months, 3,000 federal immigration officers have descended on Minneapolis, dwarfing the city’s police force of roughly 600. The Trump administration deployed the officers for immigration enforcement after right-wing media influencers resurfaced instances of fraud in Minnesota’s social service programs. Leavitt said Monday the Trump administration would only end immigration operations if state and local leaders instructed police to cooperate closely with federal immigration officers.Immigration enforcement is a federal responsibility, and states and localities are not required to assist.Some localities and states have agreements that local police will notify federal immigration officers if a person they arrest is an immigrant without legal authorization. But some jurisdictions don’t participate because the practice can divert resources or can open law enforcement up to lawsuits for unlawfully detaining an individual for an immigration violation, unless there is a judicial warrant. Attorneys representing the state of Minnesota and city of Minneapolis argued to Judge Kate M. Menendez on Monday that the Trump administration was trying to bend the state to the federal government’s will, a violation of the Constitution’s 10th amendment. The suit, in the U.S. District Court in Minnesota, is attempting to block the ICE surge in the state. Trump, in his Monday social media post, blamed the massive protests in Minnesota on “Welfare Fraud that has taken place in Minnesota, and is at least partially responsible for the violent organized protests going on in the streets.”",,,,2026-01-26 17:57:36.200737

(Mark Olalde/ProPublica)The state of New Mexico is accusing three Texas oil executives of orchestrating “a fraudulent scheme” to pocket revenue from hundreds of oil and gas wells in New Mexico and offload the cost of plugging and cleaning up the wells onto the state’s taxpayers. The suit, filed in late December by the New Mexico attorney general’s office, is the latest salvo in the state’s fight against oil and gas executives accused of foisting old wells onto the public.
The 72-page complaint alleges a yearslong pattern of fraud and self-dealing in which the oil executives — Everett Willard Gray II, Robert Stitzel and Marquis Reed Gilmore Jr., all of Midland, Texas — repeatedly transferred wells among “a series of shell corporations, LLCs, and partnerships they created.” On multiple occasions, the men placed companies into bankruptcy protection, only to move their profitable wells to other companies they owned or managed outside the bankruptcy proceedings, the suit said.
New Mexico faces millions of dollars in costs to plug wells the companies shed through the bankruptcies. Unplugged oil and gas wells can emit climate-warming methane and carcinogenic gases and often leak briny, radioactive wastewater, as ProPublica and Capital & Main detailed in a 2024 investigation. The newsrooms uncovered Gray, Stitzel and Gilmore’s early business dealings and use of bankruptcy proceedings.

This story was originally published by ProPublica and co-published with Capital & Main.

“I will not stand by while bad actors take advantage of the system — avoiding responsibility, burdening the state with costly remediation, and recklessly endangering the health of New Mexicans,” Raúl Torrez, the state’s attorney general, said in a statement.
As part of ProPublica and Capital & Main’s 2024 investigation, the news organizations toured dozens of wells belonging to Remnant, the group of companies through which the men launched their enterprise. Some wells leaked such high volumes of methane that, if ignited, the air could explode; others emitted hydrogen sulfide at potentially lethal concentrations; and several were surrounded by oil and wastewater spills. At the time, the owner of an oil field services company that had worked on Remnant’s wells said that the men filed for bankruptcy protection without paying his company what it was owed.
The recent lawsuit is “meritless” and built on “baseless claims,” Gray said in a statement responding to questions from ProPublica and Capital & Main. “I have always acted ethically and never been involved in any activities to defraud the state of New Mexico. I strongly deny any wrongdoing in this matter,” he said.
New Era Energy & Digital, one of Gray’s companies named in the state’s complaint, ended up with 87 of the group’s best gas wells, and the company said in a press release that those “no longer align with the Company’s business model.” New Era is focused instead on building an AI data center powered by a yet-to-be-built nuclear power station, it said.
Stitzel and Gilmore didn’t respond to requests for comment.
The tactics alleged by the attorney general are commonly used in the industry to squeeze profits from old wells before companies go bankrupt. Oil and gas executives so frequently follow a similar pattern that environmentalists call it “the playbook.”
Oil companies and trade groups argue that most orphan wells are from an earlier era and that modern operators are helping address the problem by paying into various government-managed funds that pay for the plugging of some old wells.
The exact number of orphan wells awaiting cleanup nationwide is unknown, but the figure is believed to be in the hundreds of thousands, if not higher. New Mexico faces as much as a $1.6 billion bill to plug such wells, according to a June 2025 Legislative Finance Committee report.
“As the oil boom is aging and a lot of the wells are becoming low-producing, the risk is increasing,” said Mandy Sackett, the lead New Mexico campaigner for environmental group Earthworks. The potential for taxpayers to be saddled with plugging oil companies’ orphan wells, she said, “poses such a massive financial risk.”
 “Out of the Dark Ages”

The problem of Remnant and other companies leaving wells as orphans is informing a broader reckoning among legislators and regulatory agencies about the inadequacy of New Mexico’s safeguards.
Oil companies are required to set aside funds, called bonds, that the state can call on to pay for well plugging and environmental cleanup. These bonds are meant to protect taxpayers from shouldering such costs in the event that a company goes bankrupt or walks away.
But like all oil-producing states, New Mexico’s bonds cover only a fraction of the true cost of cleanup. A 2024 ProPublica and Capital & Main analysis found that the 15 states that account for nearly all the nation’s oil and gas production held bonds that would cover less than 2% of the projected $151.3 billion cost to plug the wells in their states.
In New Mexico, a fresh attempt at bonding reform kicked off with hearings in October, as the state’s Oil Conservation Commission began updating bonding rules. The proposed amendments, which are backed by a coalition of environmental groups, would require companies to put forward a $150,000 bond for each inactive or low-producing well. Research has shown that these are disproportionately likely to become orphans and the state’s responsibility to plug.
The proposed regulations target companies with large collections of these risky wells and would require companies whose portfolios are made up of at least 15% inactive or low-producing wells to buy bonds for each of their wells. The proposals would also place other layers of regulatory scrutiny on sales of wells to poorly capitalized companies and limit the time that wells could remain idle before needing to be plugged.

Oil Conservation Division officials said in a statement that “the interested parties are currently engaged in settlement talks” for the bonding rulemaking. The agency declined to comment on the attorney general’s lawsuit.
​​New Mexico’s State Land Office, which oversees the state’s publicly owned land, recently initiated a similar process to increase the amount of money set aside in bonds to plug wells within its jurisdiction. The agency estimates that there are 15,000 unplugged oil and gas wells on land it manages.
Ari Biernoff, general counsel of the State Land Office, said that these reforms would bring bonding requirements “out of the Dark Ages” and closer to what the agency would need to fund cleanup should companies walk away.
“Any reasonable observer would conclude we have grossly inadequate bonding,” Biernoff said.
Industry groups have expressed dissatisfaction with the proposed rules.
The New Mexico Oil & Gas Association and Independent Petroleum Association of New Mexico submitted counterproposals with significantly reduced bonding increases. The latter said in comments submitted to the state that its suggestion “will keep smaller operators from going out of business.”
“We do not believe it’s in New Mexico’s best interest for the State Land Office to kill a lot of smaller, state-based, good operators to leave only a handful of supermajors,” Jim Winchester, executive director of the Independent Petroleum Association of New Mexico, wrote to the agency.
 Remnants of the Oil Industry

Beginning in 2015, Gray, Stitzel and Gilmore aggregated several hundred wells in southeastern New Mexico under the Remnant companies, subsequently racking up regulatory violations, including having too many inactive, unplugged wells. The state’s Oil Conservation Division gave Remnant a deadline of July 2019 to plug some of its wells. Fifteen days before the deadline, the men placed the company into bankruptcy protection.
Remnant’s dissolution kicked off a complex and disputed series of transactions among the three men. According to the attorney general’s complaint, Stitzel and Gilmore created several companies under the name Acacia and purchased most of Remnant’s wells from themselves. Gray, meanwhile, created Solis Partners — a wholly owned subsidiary of Gray’s New Era — and ended up with 87 of the group’s most lucrative gas-producing wells. The bill of sale that landed the wells with Gray’s company was for $10, and Gray signed on behalf of Remnant a change-of-operator application that sent wells to Solis Partners.
Then, in December 2024, a major oil company that the state had asked to plug some of Acacia’s wells sued Acacia to force it to clean up its own mess. Two weeks later, Acacia filed to liquidate through bankruptcy.
Of Remnant’s and Acacia’s wells, 172 ended up as the responsibility of the State Land Office, according to the agency. Eleven of those have been plugged, all but one by other oil companies that hold leases with the agency and stepped up to do the work. Based on the state’s estimated per-well cleanup cost, the remaining wells could cost a total of more than $25 million to plug.
The agency was able to claim a single bond from Remnant worth $20,000.
“This is a very vivid demonstration of why we need an upgrade to the bonding rule,” said Biernoff, the State Land Office general counsel.
The most lucrative wells from Gray, Stitzel and Gilmore’s foray into New Mexico’s oil and gas industry belong to Solis Partners. But even that company appears at risk of leaving them as orphans, as it has about 120 inactive wells on state trust land, according to the State Land Office. Its parent company, New Era, which is pitching plans for a 3,500-acre AI data center campus in southeastern New Mexico, said it is selling the wells.
“Having enriched themselves with the profits from Solis Partners’ and Acacia’s oil and gas production, the Individual Defendants are once again seeking to walk away from the plugging and remediation costs,” the attorney general’s complaint alleged.
Charlie Barrett is an ecologist with environmental group Oilfield Witness who has chronicled pollution at Remnant’s and Acacia’s wells for years. “They’re old, they’re just falling apart,” he said. They are also, he said, emblematic of the small oil and gas operators that represent the final stage of the industry leaving its wells as orphans.
“I wish I could say that it’s unique,” Barrett said, “but it isn’t.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/MO-PP-IMG_6626-copy_preview_maxWidth_3000_maxHeight_3000_ppi_72_embedColorProfile_true_quality_95-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-26 09:57:06.399873

Free.,US Senate Dems probe effect of Trump administration child care cutbacks on rural families,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-dems-probe-effect-trump-administration-child-care-cutbacks-rural-families,,"WASHINGTON — Several U.S. Senate Democrats launched an investigation into how the Trump administration’s child care funding cuts and policy changes are affecting rural families, in a Sunday letter provided exclusively to States Newsroom.Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts led five of her colleagues in urging the respective heads of Rural Development at the Department of Agriculture and the Administration for Children and Families at the Department of Health and Human Services to offer up more information on their “current capacity to support child care, particularly in rural communities.” Joining Warren are Sens. Raphael Warnock of Georgia, Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico, Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland, Alex Padilla of California and Jeff Merkley of Oregon. “Despite child care being one of the biggest costs American families face, the Trump administration has taken a wrecking ball to the federal programs that aim to make child care more accessible and affordable, including ACF and USDA’s Rural Development Office,” the senators wrote to acting Under Secretary for Rural Development Todd Lindsey and ACF’s Assistant Secretary Alex Adams. USDA Rural Development and ACF work to expand access to child care in rural areas. The senators pointed to a September poll from First Five Years Fund, a federal advocacy group, which found that 4 out of 5 rural Americans “say the ability of working parents to find and afford quality child care is either in a ‘state of crisis’ or ‘a major problem.’” The group said the administration’s slashing of staff at agencies and programs that support affordable child care, including ACF and Rural Development at USDA, are raising concerns that the administration is “failing families across the country and adding to the affordability crisis facing working-class families.” Cuts from federal child care fund to Dem statesThe senators raised alarm over some of the administration’s most sweeping actions regarding child care programs, including attempts to cut off nearly $2.4 billion from the multibillion-dollar Child Care and Development Fund, or CCDF, to California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota and New York earlier in January. All are led by Democratic governors and the administration cited concerns about allegations of fraud.CCDF — administered within the Office of Child Care under ACF — provides federal funding to states, territories and tribes to help low-income families obtain child care.The five Democratic-led states sued in a New York federal court over the freeze, which also included $7.35 billion from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program and $869 million from the Social Services Block Grant — totaling more than $10 billion when combined with CCDF. A judge temporarily blocked the administration from freezing the funds earlier this month. A separate judge extended that order Friday. “States are challenging the legality of this freeze, but the consequences would be devastating should the courts permit the administration to permanently withhold the funds,” the senators wrote. Days prior to the announced freeze, the administration said states had to provide “justification” that federal child care funds they receive are spent on “legitimate” providers to get those dollars.That demand followed allegations of fraud in Minnesota child care programs, which had prompted HHS to freeze all child care payments to the state.The administration also announced earlier in January it would be rescinding multiple Biden administration child care rules that “required states to pay providers before verifying any attendance and before care was delivered.” Head Start in rural AmericaThe Democrats argued that President Donald Trump has also “attacked Head Start at every turn since his inauguration.” ACF administers Head Start, which provides early childhood education, nutritious meals, health screenings and other support services to low-income families. The senators noted that “Head Start is especially crucial in rural communities, where it is often the only licensed child care program available.” During the record-long government shutdown in 2025, scores of Head Start centers experienced lapses in funding grants as a result.  Even prior to the shutdown, Head Start already experienced chaos during the Trump administration, such as reports of delays in accessing approved grant funding, regional office closures and firings at ACF’s Office of Head Start.Flood of workers departing USDA Meanwhile, USDA saw more than 20,000 employees leave in the first half of 2025, according to a report from the agency’s Office of Inspector General. More than one-third of the agency’s Rural Development unit left during that time.  “Instead of strengthening the programs that aim to address the rural child care crisis, President Trump is firing the people who administer them,” the senators wrote. On top of that, the agency in March confirmed it would be slashing around $1 billion in previously announced funding for programs to help child care facilities, schools and food banks purchase from local farmers. USDA also faced backlash during the shutdown for refusing to tap into a multibillion-dollar contingency fund in order to keep benefits flowing for the country’s main food assistance program known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.The senators urged Lindsey and Adams to respond to their inquiries by Feb. 16. USDA and ACF did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",,,,2026-01-26 09:57:06.399873

(U.S. Army Photo by Master Sgt. Justin P. Morelli) A Democratic state lawmaker from Anchorage loudly denounced the actions of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s surge in Minnesota while speaking on the Alaska House floor on Friday.
Rep. Andrew Gray, D-Anchorage, is a military veteran and co-chair of the Legislature’s Joint Armed Services Committee. 
“The facts are that our government is out of control. Norms have been broken at an alarming rate, and the world is watching us in shock,” he said.
Gray’s remarks were met by loud desk-thumping — a form of applause — and came on a day when thousands of Minnesotans marched in subzero weather and held a general strike to show their opposition to ICE efforts in their state.
Tensions are particularly high after several shootings by federal officers, including one in which an officer killed a mother of three.
The remarks came one day before federal agents fatally shot another Minneapolis resident on Saturday, prompting nationwide protests throughout the weekend. 
On Friday, Gray questioned Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s decision to provide National Guard administrative support for ICE in Alaska and President Donald Trump’s threatened use of regular U.S. Army troops in Minnesota. 
Up to 1,500 active-duty troops of the U.S. Army’s 11th Airborne Division, based in Anchorage, have been ordered to stand by for possible deployment to Minneapolis — Minnesota’s largest city — according to National Public Radio. 
Gray and Sen. Scott Kawasaki, D-Fairbanks and the other co-chair of the Joint Armed Services Committee, have sent letters to Alaska’s congressional delegation and Brig. Gen. John P. Cogbill, commander of the 11th Airborne.
In those letters, Gray and Kawasaki say they are receiving “enquiries … from the Alaskan people” and pose a series of questions.
How long will the 11th Airborne be in Minnesota? How does a deployment fit in the division’s mission to defend the United States against foreign threats? Could soldiers be detaining suspected undocumented people? Would the 11th Airborne fight the Minnesota National Guard if Gov. Tim Walz activates it to defend protesters?
“Fifteen hundred active-duty soldiers may be sent from Alaska to Minnesota to protect ICE agents as they continue their efforts to arrest and detain suspected undocumented immigrants,” Gray said, “But who really needs the protection? Is it the ICE agents, or is it the folks who are terrified to leave their homes, to go to work, to pick their kids up from school or to actually show up at their immigration appointments?”
While Gray’s comments appeared to have the support of many legislators in the chamber — judging by the desk-pounding applause — there was at least one dissenting voice.
Rep. Jamie Allard, R-Eagle River, is a veteran, the spouse of a veteran, and a Latina, she said, explaining that she had also sent a letter to Gen. Cogbill, but her letter was to remind him that he is not legally obligated to answer the Legislature’s questions or testify in the Capitol.
Allard said she has been deployed overseas with the military and with the U.S. State Department.
“I experienced things when I worked for the US State Department, of women being abused, hit — watched them get their teeth knocked in, where I had to stand by and couldn’t do anything,” she said.
“We have a lot going on in our country, dividing, saying we’re this or we’re that. We’re all Americans, but it doesn’t mean that it’s okay to have riots across our country. If the military and the federal government and the Department of War and the 11th Airborne Division decide that it’s best to go to Minnesota, that’s what we need to do,” she said.
Allard’s comments were met by quieter but noticeable desk-pounding, with the loudest coming from Rep. Kevin McCabe, R-Big Lake.
He said afterward that he thinks Gray incorrectly described some aspects of ICE’s work in Minnesota. For example, Gray said ICE detained a five-year-old in Minnesota.
“There’s a little bit more to the story, McCabe said.
“We shouldn’t be messing around in another branch of the government in their bailiwick,” he said. “The worst people in Alaska to manage the National Guard is probably the state Legislature.”

A pilot partnership between St. Johnsbury School District and Northeast Kingdom Human Services demonstrates how school and mental health collaboration improves student outcomes, keeps children in their communities, and reduces education costs through Vermont’s Success Beyond 6 framework.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Solving student mental health and af[...]","From L to R: NKHS Lincoln Street School Team: Renee Norrie, Jennifer Thompson (STJS Special Educator), Brahms Barrett, Jennifer Alexander-Whitmore, Hannah Ainsworth
As Vermont grapples with education reform and rising property taxes, one partnership, among many in the Vermont Care Partners (VCP) network, is proving that innovation through collaboration can address both student mental health needs and affordability concerns in the Northeast Kingdom. This year, St. Johnsbury School District and Northeast Kingdom Human Services (NKHS), a Designated Agency (DA), started a pilot program – Catamount Community Connections (C3P) – a new program that demonstrates how effective school-DA partnerships can keep students in their community, improve outcomes, and generate cost savings for taxpayers.
The creation of C3P was intentional, achieved through partnership, and centered on the local community. After 18 months of collaborative development, the result is a program that embodies the kind of integrated partnership Success Beyond 6 was designed to create, where schools and mental health agencies combine their unique strengths to create something neither could accomplish alone.
In the C3P model, NKHS brings ownership and renovation of the facility, along with specialized mental health services rooted in trauma-informed, evidence-based approaches. Their Board-Certified Behavioral Analysts (BCBAs) and clinicians provide supervision and quality oversight that schools simply cannot replicate on their own. Additionally, NKHS enables the leveraging of federal Medicaid funding through Success Beyond 6, reducing costs and the local tax burden. St. Johnsbury School District contributes its special education expertise, individualized education programs, educational curriculum and instruction, and the vital connection to students’ home schools and community. Together, what’s created is an environment where students can access their education in the least restrictive setting, stay connected to their families and community, and ultimately work toward returning to their local public school – all while costing significantly less than traditional out-of-district placements.
C3P leverages Success Beyond 6, Vermont’s established framework for school-DA partnerships, which isn’t a new or untested concept, but rather an evolution of a proven model. Success Beyond 6 has been operating since December 1992 and was created specifically as a partnership between mental health, education, students, and families. By 2019, 77% of Vermont’s public schools participated in the program, which was designed from the beginning to be driven by local needs and responsive to local conditions.
The partnership model works for several interconnected reasons: Success Beyond 6 uses local education funds as a state match to draw down federal Medicaid dollars, so schools pay only a portion of the cost of each service while the federal government contributes the rest.  Beyond financial mechanics, DAs provide mental health services including behavioral intervention, trauma treatment, and clinical supervision. State oversight through the Department of Mental Health (DMH) ensures adherence to quality standards and the measurement of outcomes throughout.

Vermont faces converging crises in student mental health and school affordability that require innovative, cost-effective solutions. The statistics driving the need for a program like C3P, paint a picture that would benefit from creative intervention.

34% of Vermont high school students report poor mental health – stress, anxiety, and depression – most of the time. 
Vermont ranks first nationally among students with Individualized Education Plans (IEP) for emotional disturbance, and over five percent of Vermont students with IEPs are placed in separate schools, more than double the national average of 2.4%. 
Schools across the state report that they lack the in-house capacity, staffing, and specialized resources to respond effectively to these growing needs.

The special education and budget pressures compound these challenges. 

Students with IEPs have increased from 17.9% to 19.6% between 2019 and 2024, while the four-year graduation rate for students with IEPs has fallen to just 67%, compared to 86% for students without IEPs. 
Property tax increases have reached as high as 18.5% in some districts, driven in part by the extraordinary costs of out-of-district placements and transportation. 

These pressures are particularly acute in the Northeast Kingdom and serve as the catalyst for C3P’s creation.
Locally, the partnership with schools and NKHS has made both a financial and clinical difference. Students served through NKHS’s school-based programs have made significant progress in treatment. 
The Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths (CANS) is a point-in-time assessment designed to help educators and mental health professionals understand both the challenges and strengths of each student within the SB6 program. It enables a student’s care team to evaluate key areas such as academic performance, attendance, peer and teacher relationships, and school behavior, identifying both needs and strengths. 
An analysis of data from 2023 to the present for active SB6 students shows that 84% of NKHS school-based clients developed skills that reduced needs across one or more CANS domains.
The following data represent students who initially scored a high need and later dropped to a low need on their most recent assessment:

50% of students enhanced skills that increased academic persistence and engagement in learning.
75% of students demonstrated improvement in reducing tardiness and arriving at school/class on time.
75% of students improved skills that contributed to fewer school discipline issues.
53% of students with a high need score demonstrated improved attention skills, enabling them to stay focused more effectively.

In addition to clinical benefits for students, the partnership model can reduce costs for schools. Traditional out-of-district placements can cost up to $120,000 per year in specialized school tuition, with transportation adding up to another $100,000 per year per student. That’s up to $220,000 annually for a single student. Although not every student placement costs this much, out-of-district placements are more expensive than keeping students in their local communities. The C3P partnership model, by contrast, provides in-district alternative programming with integrated mental health support at significantly lower costs. The local placement eliminates long-distance transportation costs entirely, while Success Beyond 6 Medicaid funding provides a federal match, meaning schools pay only a portion of each dollar spent on services, with the federal government contributing the rest. Savings from this program, if expanded, could be significant. 
Currently, the C3P pilot program serves fewer than 10 students, but over the next few years, it is hoped that the capacity will increase to 30. This has the potential to support students in their local community and save an estimated $1 million – $4 million in costs.
It’s important to emphasize that C3P doesn’t replace specialized independent therapeutic schools – Vermont needs those programs, too. Rather, C3P fills a critical middle ground: intensive enough for students with significant needs, local enough to maintain family and community connections, and cost-effective enough to be sustainable over the long term.
The St. Johnsbury School-NKHS partnership through C3P is more than just one program serving a small student group. It’s a proof-of-concept for how Vermont can address its dual challenges of student mental health needs and affordability pressures. It provides:

specialized mental health expertise that schools need but cannot build alone,
creates a pathway back to traditional school settings, 
directly addresses Vermont’s first-in-nation rates of emotional disturbance, 
leverages federal Medicaid match to reduce the local burden,
creates local capacity that can serve multiple districts, 
generates measurable savings that benefit taxpayers directly. 

Innovation happens through partnership rather than isolation and creates opportunity. The C3P model is a program that other regions across Vermont could replicate.
Vermont’s challenges are real. Student mental health needs are high, special education costs are rising, and property taxpayers are strained. Singular programs are not a silver bullet, but as C3P demonstrates, effective partnerships between schools and VCP network agencies offer an opportunity to solve some of the pressing needs facing the Vermont education system. 
St. Johnsbury School District and NKHS have shown what’s possible when partners commit to working together, leverage established frameworks like Success Beyond 6, and innovate to meet local needs. This example points toward solutions that are both educationally sound and fiscally responsible. As Vermont considers education reform, the C3P model offers a critical reminder: some of our best solutions come not from choosing between quality and affordability, but from partnerships that deliver both.

She says the next step is to blend Blueprint for Literacy with the Kansas State Board of Education's literacy program known as Every Child Can Read. (Photo by Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas Legislature directed the Kansas State Board of Education and Kansas Board of Regents to implement separate laws enacted during the past four years to elevate reading skills of public school students.
Both the 2022 Every Child Can Read Act in the hands of the K-12 Board of Education and the 2024 Blueprint for Literacy organized by higher education’s Board of Regents recognized the threat of failing a majority of 450,000 students enrolled in Kansas classrooms.
“Reading and literacy, reading and writing, are the fundamental skills in which all other learning is built,” said Cynthia Lane, director of the Blueprint for Literacy. “Literacy is directly related to health outcomes and the ability to secure high quality jobs. I like to say literacy is opportunity. It’s also about justice and freedom, because in order to have true freedom you need to have the skills so that you can make decisions for yourself.”


Evidence for urgency to the state’s work on child literacy wasn’t difficult to find. Testing showed 55% of Kansas students in third through 10th grades read at the limited or basic levels, which meant they couldn’t handle the content independently. Put another way, state exams revealed less than half read at the proficient or advanced levels.
In an interview for Kansas Reflector’s podcast, Lane said she was convinced the Legislature should weave the two literacy programs into a coordinated set of policies aimed at improving reading success in the classroom. She said educators and students would benefit from coalescing around a single vision.
“We have no common plan,” she said. “No common goals. No common accountability. And, frankly, having two laws has created confusion amongst our legislators about who’s doing what and how can we know if we’re making progress. We are advocating for a comprehensive implementation plan that brings both the pre-K-12 system and the higher education system into alignment.”
Lane said she was impressed by the Board of Education’s commitment to K-12 reforms outlined in Every Child Can Read. It required school districts to make students read proficiently by third grade by relying on evidence-based instruction. It mandated universal screening of students, better communication with parents and targeted student interventions, including one-on-one tutoring or summer school classes in reading.
“The state Board of Education and the Department of Education has done really powerful work,” Lane said.
Blueprint for Literacy required discredited reading methodologies to be abandoned by Kansas universities and to be replaced by phonics-based approaches. The law created two undergraduate college courses focused on application of structured literacy by students preparing to become school teachers in Kansas. So far, nearly 2,000 students have gone through those courses at a private or public college in Kansas. Another 1,000 expect to finish by July.
The bipartisan Blueprint for Literacy law also established two graduate courses in reading literacy. All of the state’s 18,000 elementary educators in the field must pass both courses, or a comparable curriculum, to retain a professional license in Kansas. Approximately 9,000 completed the State Board of Education’s LETRS program, which has been offered for several years.
During the past nine months, Blueprint for Literacy paid the cost of tuition for 500 teachers who enrolled in the two foundations of reading graduate-level courses. In addition, Blueprint for Literacy provided each teacher with a professional mentor to help implement reforms in their classrooms.
“The resounding feedback is that the coach has made the difference in transforming what they’re doing in their classes every day,” Lane said.
The state’s goal for Blueprint for Literacy would have 90% of third- through eighth-grade students reading at the basic level and at least 50% of those students at the proficient level by 2033. In Kansas, assessments of reading placed students on a four-level, low-to-high scale of limited, basic, proficient or advanced.
“There is urgency to move because every parent wants the teacher in the classroom to have the top skills,” she said.
Lane, the former superintendent of schools in Kansas City, Kansas, said she understood at a personal level what it meant to be a low-skill reader. She said she didn’t learn to read until the seventh grade, in part because methods at that time tended to require children to memorize words based on pictures or other cues.
“It was devastating to be in an elementary school and not read,” she said.
Lane, who went on to earn a doctorate in education, said research demonstrated the brain worked in such a way that explicit instruction in phonics — sounds that letters make — did a better job of building reading fluency and comprehension among children.
“Based on all the science and the research that’s been done, we know how to teach every child to read,” she said. “But they need instruction that first identifies what kids know and where there gaps are and design the instruction specifically to what every individual child needs.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Cynthia-Lane-2-20260122_130806-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-26 09:57:06.399873

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows is arguing that the U.S. Department of Justice’s demand that Minnesota hand over its state voter information as a precondition for ending immigration operations in that state underscores that the federal government is “inflicting violence in order to create chaos and control our states and elections.”
In a letter to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Saturday, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote the state could end the federal law enforcement surge if it repealed pro-immigrant “sanctuary” policies, and turned over Medicaid and food assistance records as well as voter data to the federal government.
“I am confident that these simple steps will help bring back law and order to Minnesota and improve the lives of Americans,” Bondi wrote in the letter, sent after a federal agent shot and killed Alex Jeffrey Pretti Saturday.
Pretti’s killing, captured from multiple angles by witnesses recording on their cell phones, was the second shooting death of a U.S. citizen by immigration agents in Minneapolis during the weeks-long federal operation there. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security launched an immigration operation in Maine last week, detaining several lawful residents.
Bellows, a Democrat running for governor, has twice rejected requests to provide the DOJ with sensitive voter data, including driver’s license numbers, partial social security numbers and full dates of birth, along with names of officials who handle the list’s maintenance, the number of ineligible voters the state identified due to noncitizenship and voter registration applications from  specific time periods, among other information.  
The DOJ has argued the data is necessary to assess states’ compliance with the statewide voter registration list maintenance provisions of the National Voter Registration Act. 
Maine is now among the states being sued by the federal government over its failure to comply.
In a motion to dismiss filed last month, the state argued that the lawsuit should be discharged because the DOJ failed to support a valid legal case as to why it is justified to such information, and that its data requests violate federal privacy law. 
The motion also noted voter registration databases contain information about people’s choice of political party and in which elections they chose to vote, which are activities protected by the First Amendment. Bellows and other secretaries of state have also raised concern about the federal government using voter records for citizenship probes. 
In a statement Sunday, Bellows said, “Maine will never turn over our voter rolls as a ransom payment to get ICE to end its unconstitutional assault on our state. 
“Our founders designed a system where states and local governments, not the federal government, oversee elections to safeguard us from exactly this — a tyrannical, power-hungry president trampling on our constitutional rights,” she wrote. 
Bellows said as the state’s top election official, she will stand with Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, who described the letter as “an outrageous attempt to coerce Minnesota into giving the federal government private data on millions of U.S. Citizens in violation of state and federal law.”

Gov. Gavin Newsom on Saturday called for U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem to resign and Border Patrol chief Gregory Bovino to be fired a day after federal immigration enforcement officers shot at another U.S. citizen in Minneapolis multiple times, killing him.
Weeks after the death of Renee Good, Border Patrol agents killed Alex Pretti on Friday, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse who worked for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. During an altercation in which Pretti was observing and documenting federal agents beforehand, multiple officers tackled Pretti to the ground. Pretti reportedly had a gun, for which he had a lawful permit to carry. After one agent took away the gun while Pretti was pinned on the ground, officers appear to have fired at him at least 10 times.
Immediately after the shooting, members of the Trump administration called Pretti a domestic terrorist. First Assistant U.S. Attorney and former California Republican Assemblymember Bill Essayli defended the agents, arguing that there “is a high likelihood” law enforcement officers “will be legally justified in shooting you” if you approach them with a gun — an assertion that the National Rifle Association called “dangerous and wrong.”
On Sunday President Donald Trump also blamed Democrats and sanctuary laws, such as those in California, for the two deaths in Minneapolis.
In response, Newsom called for Border Patrol officers to return to the border, ending the militarization of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and investigations into “every single federal agent who is breaking the law.” His office also posted a know-your-rights guide for dealing with local police and immigration enforcement officers.
But the governor’s statements are part of a political calculus that is playing out as he makes a likely bid for the presidency. After Good’s death, Newsom’s team responded that ICE is “state sponsored terrorism.” Newsom eventually walked back this description during an interview with conservative commentator Ben Shapiro.
Meanwhile, as Congress weighs a spending deal that would include billions of dollars more for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Assemblymember Isaac Bryan of Culver City called for a general strike to oppose ICE, similar to the large-scale walkout organized in Minneapolis.
California Attorney General Rob Bonta also filed a brief supporting Minnesota’s lawsuit opposing the federal government’s immigration campaign in the state. Along with 19 other attorneys general, the brief argued that the “government’s unlawful conduct … infringes upon (Minnesota’s) constitutionally-guaranteed state sovereignty,” and that without legal intervention the government “will no doubt threaten other States and local communities across the nation.”

Fewer homicides in CA for second year in a row

Homicide rates in California have dropped for the second year in a row, consistent with a nationwide trend after a crime surge during the pandemic, reports CalMatters’ Nigel Duara.
In the city of Los Angeles, homicides dropped by more than 18% to 230 in 2025, and San Francisco had its lowest rates since 1954. Besides major cities, homicides have also been down in cities including Oakland, Fresno, Richmond and Lodi, though Kern County’s remains the state’s highest.
The declines mark a milestone after California experienced a rise in homicides during the pandemic, though crime in 2020-21 nationally and in California was still notably lower than the highs seen in the early 1990s.
Many factors could be at play for the falling numbers, crime researchers say. Magnus Lofstrom, policy director of criminal justice at the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California, said the pandemic-era homicide spike may have been the result of various social disruptions such as school shutdowns, unemployment and the pausing of public services.

The U.S. Department of Justice has agreed to drop its demand for medical records of more than 3,000 young transgender patients at the Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, writes CalMatters’ Ana B. Ibarra.
In July 2025 the Justice Department said it sent subpoenas to more than 20 medical providers that offered gender-affirming care for minors. Hospitals were directed to provide a wide array of documents, including ones “sufficient to identify each patient … who was prescribed puberty blockers or hormone therapy,” court documents show.
The department said it was probing doctors and clinics for potential “healthcare fraud” and “false statements.” But the department never provided evidence of fraud, said the director of one of the law firms representing families who sued the department in a class action lawsuit to stop the subpoenas. 
Under the agreement the Justice Department will rescind its requests through 2029 for documents that identify patients or their families.

Kathy Brown-Lowe 
Kathy Brown-Lowe is a crime and trauma survivor who lives in Los Angeles


Ten years ago, I hit bottom.
For more than 50 years I had been trying to work my way through traumas that had accumulated throughout my life. As a child, I, along with one of my sisters, was abused by my step-father. When I was a young woman, my mother and my biological father died, and a number of other close family members, including several sisters and brothers, also died prematurely. I’ve been a victim of extreme episodes of domestic violence. 
My pain caused me to fall into despair, ultimately using an array of drugs and, in middle-age, falling into homelessness. I became estranged from my family. I ended up staying at the Midnight Mission, in downtown Los Angeles. I cried every day.
While I was at the mission, friends told me to check out the Downtown Women’s Center, which has helped provide housing for thousands of women experiencing homelessness for nearly half a century. They offer dignity to people who too often have been deprived of any sense of their own worth. 
I started visiting the center nearly every day, talking with their case workers, eating in their cafeteria, receiving medical assistance and — eventually — getting linked with mental health therapists and counselors at the on-site Trauma Recovery Center, which provides services and support to victims of crime.
That’s crucial because nearly 3 out of 4 people experiencing homelessness in California have endured physical violence, and more than 9 in 10 are crime or trauma survivors. 
The Trauma Recovery Center provided me with a community of caregivers willing to go the extra mile on my behalf. I always said I needed a village to help me get whole, and the center staff were willing to be that village.
At the center I finally began to grapple with the pain that has haunted me since I was a child. It was in that safe space — where people didn’t judge me and didn’t make me feel small — that I was able to start talking about my fears and anxieties. I found that as I talked more about the traumas that were so deeply embedded in my life story, and that I had bottled up inside of me for so long, I began relying less on the drugs that I’d been using as a form of self-medication.
It didn’t happen all in a rush, but over time my life began to make more sense. 
There are 24 Trauma Recover Centers in other communities across California. They are places where dedicated, trained staff work tirelessly to help survivors of crime heal from the psychological traumas and damage that have accumulated over many decades and that impact their ability to function fully and happily on a daily basis. 
As anyone who’s been through the trauma I have knows, you usually don’t make good decisions if you don’t feel safe.
Sadly, after the passage of Proposition 36 last year, the funding stream for programs such as the Trauma Recovery Centers at the Downtown Women’s Center is at risk. I can’t imagine anything more shortsighted than not making sure these centers have the resources they need to get victims immediate access to the help and support they need and deserve.
I understand the frustration of voters and politicians who want quick fixes to social problems and who are angered by continual waves of crime, drug addiction and homelessness. It’s tempting to reach for punishment over treatment and crime prevention when you are angry and disappointed at the actions of other people. 
But in a zero-sum world, where more money spent on incarceration means less money available for California’s growing network of Trauma Recovery Centers, that’s a bad bargain. 
The Trauma Recovery Center has given me a second chance at life and the ability to give back to the community of which I am a part. 
Today I’m 68, living in my own apartment again. I have strong relationships with my children, four grandchildren, seven great-grandchildren and many of their friends — all of whom consider me to be their honorary great-grandmother and call me their “G.G.” I couldn’t have done any of that without the work of the people at the Trauma Recovery Center.
I hope California’s legislators and governor understand the importance of these centers to thousands of men and women like me around the state, and that they continue to allocate dollars to allow their vital work to go on.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/100824_Inside-Safe_CS_CM_41.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-26 08:56:35.583555

Homicides in California surged during the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, killings are down to historic lows in Los Angeles, Oakland, San Francisco and many other cities.


For the second year in a row, Gov. Gavin Newsom is celebrating California’s declining homicide rate while using it as a cudgel against his political foes. 
“Your state’s homicide rate is 117% higher than California’s,” he told a Missouri congressman who needled Newsom on social media last summer. 
Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders caught his attention, too. “Your homicide rate is literally DOUBLE California’s,” he wrote on social media addressing her. 
What’s been clear for the last three years is that homicides are down in Los Angeles and San Francisco — but also in Fresno, Oakland, Richmond and Lodi. 
“California cities are seeing record-low homicide rates,” Newsom said in his state of the state speech earlier this month. “Oakland, the lowest since 1967; LA, the lowest since 1966; and San Francisco, the lowest since 1954.”
After a spike during the early days of the pandemic, homicides are in fact down nationwide. 
The reason why is far less clear. To put it in the language of crime researchers, the answer is “multifactorial.” 
Magnus Lofstrom, policy director of criminal justice at nonpartisan think tank the Public Policy Institute of California, said the spike of homicides during the pandemic may have been the result of disruptions in government activities: Schools were shut down, people were out of work, community-based programs for violence prevention and many basic public services were put on pause, Lofstrom said. 
The 2020 numbers were a shock. After years of decline, the homicide rate in California surged by 31% in 2020 to 5.5 homicides per 100,000 people. In 2021, it rose again, to about 6 per 100,000 people. 
But that trend began to turn in 2022, when the number of homicides dropped by 7%, then in 2023 by 14% and in 2024 by another 12%. By the end of 2024, the homicide rate in California was down to 4.3 per 100,000 people. 
California’s population was about 20 million people the last time the state recorded such low homicide numbers, half of what it is today. 
At the same time the homicide numbers were climbing, the percentage of cases cleared by police was falling. A police department’s “clearance rate” compares the number of crimes reported to the number of arrests made. 
Lofstrom said that the homicide clearance rate statewide was 64.7% in 2019, and that it had dropped to 54.6% in 2021 – though the rates can vary dramatically among police departments.  
“What we see now in the data up to 2024 is that we’re back up over 64% for homicide clearances,” Lofstrom said. 
Half as many homicides in Oakland
Oakland Mayor Barbara Lee said homicides are down along with major gun crimes including robberies and assaults with firearms. Oakland’s 67 homicides in 2025 were its lowest since 1967. It had 134 homicides in 2021.
In Los Angeles, homicides dropped by more than 18% to 230 in 2025, according to a Los Angeles Times analysis of LAPD data. 
The numbers documenting the recent decline in homicide rates, and the earlier spike, come with a major asterisk: The way crime data is collected is inconsistent. Law enforcement agencies self-report to the FBI, which each year publishes data under the Uniform Crime Reporting Program. The California Department of Justice then produces statewide reports from those numbers. 
But not every department reports its statistics. And among those that do, some don’t report all their data — or report the information differently. For example, some jurisdictions only report crimes that lead to incarceration. 
Homicide numbers in California are provided by the state Justice Department near the end of the fiscal year in June, so the most recent statistics are from 2024. The Justice Department declined to provide CalMatters with updated numbers through 2025. 
The drop in homicide rates wasn’t as pronounced in Orange and Orange and Ventura counties, which never experienced a significant pandemic spike, and Kern County, where the homicide rate maintains a stubborn hold as the state’s highest. 
Nationwide drop in crime
A long-range look at crime statistics, particularly homicide data, shows that the 2020-21 crime rate nationally and in California was still a fraction of its highs in the early 1990s. Simply counting the year-over-year changes belies a larger truth: Crime throughout the 2020s has been down significantly compared to the rate 20 or 30 years ago. 
As with the long-term homicide rate declines, the recent tapering in California is part of a nationwide trend. A report published Thursday by the Council on Criminal Justice, a nonpartisan Washington, D.C., think tank found that among 35 major cities nationwide, homicides dropped by 21% between 2024 and 2025. 
When the FBI publishes its crime statistics later this year, Council on Criminal Justice researchers said in the report that the national homicide rate could drop to 4 per 100,000 people, which would be the lowest homicide rate ever on record. 
Shani Buggs, an associate professor at UC Davis and public health researcher, said in the report that cities with major decreases in their homicide rate tended to spend federal pandemic funds on violence prevention and have police departments that focused on people with repeated allegations of violent crimes, helping them quickly resume pre-pandemic clearance rates.
“We do not have reliable, multi-sector data or comparable contextual information available across jurisdictions to definitively identify — now or perhaps ever — what drove these declines,” Buggs said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/010318-Oakland-PD-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-26 08:56:35.583555

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)After years of waiting, several immigrants in Utah were just days or moments away from making their case for asylum in the United States. 
But before judges considered their arguments earlier this month, their cases were dealt a major blow, their attorneys said.  
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security filed motions to “pretermit” their cases, or dismiss them before the long-anticipated hearing and deport them to a “safe third country” where they don’t have ties to seek asylum there instead. 
“It’s a complete nightmare,” said South Jordan immigration attorney Carlos Trujillo.

Trujillo noted that in October, an immigration appeals board effectively ruled the burden is on immigrants to prove they are likely to be persecuted or tortured in the third country and therefore should be allowed to stay in the U.S. 
“There is no way to save the case, because there is no way to demonstrate that you will be persecuted in a country that you have never been in,” Trujillo said. 
But he will try anyway at upcoming hearings where he said he will have 15 minutes to make such a case on behalf of clients originally from Venezuela. 
It comes as the Trump administration carries out mass deportations and seeks to clear a backlog of asylum cases. More than 2 million immigrants are awaiting asylum hearings, according to Syracuse University’s TRAC database. 
The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to email requests for comment from Utah News Dispatch. It has previously said it is “using every lawful tool available to address the backlog and abuse of the asylum system.” It has also referred to “lawful bilateral arrangements” allowing unauthorized immigrants to seek legal protection in other nations that have agreed to adjudicate their claims.

The United States has a longstanding third-country agreement with Canada but signed more recent agreements with countries including Ecuador, Guatemala and Honduras.  
“They’re saying, ‘Hey, because we have the agreements with these countries, they’re not even eligible to apply for asylum here. Let’s ship them to Honduras or Ecuador and see if they’ll grant them asylum instead,’” said Utah immigration attorney Nicholle Pitt White.  
The government’s practice of filing “pretermission motions” intensified nationally in November after the appeals decision, with thousands filed. Use of the legal strategy seems to have started growing in Utah in recent weeks, according to Trujillo and Pitt White. 
The attorneys can count the number of cases in their offices on one or two hands, but suspect more are being filed. 
What we know about how ICE arrests have increased in Utah under Trump

“It’s very possible they’ve done it in other cases where people don’t have attorneys, and we just wouldn’t hear those stories,” Pitt White said. 
In and outside of Utah, lawyers are trying to get creative in how they fight against the maneuver. One argument, Pitt White said: The United States’ third-country agreement with Ecuador isn’t in full force because specific criteria for who will and will not be accepted under the accord hasn’t been set.  
Pitt White noted Ecuador has one of the highest homicide rates in South America and Honduras has in recent years had the highest rate of people fleeing and seeking asylum in the U.S. 
She believes one of her clients who’s currently being held in a detention center had a strong case before the change in the government’s strategy. 
“But because of the timing when this policy came out, the motion being filed, we got stuck in a bad spot for our client,” Pitt White said. “It feels kind of hopeless.”

And if they don't have savings, then they don't have a center.” (Courtesy Camille Bennett)When Talia Shelby heard on the radio the federal government was freezing a program that helps pay for her 3-year-old daughter’s child care, she had to turn the volume down.
“I’m scared to even think about it,” Shelby said. “That’s another anxiety for me to have. It’s hard when you’re a single parent and you’re just trying to figure it out, and then the government fights with each other.”
In a Dec. 30 X post, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced a freeze in funding that assists low-income families with child care costs and promised rules changes that could reduce payments to child-care providers in a Jan. 5 press release.
The catalyst for the announcements was an unverified, viral video by a right-wing influencer that purports to show day-care centers in Minnesota that are receiving federal funds but aren’t serving children.
Details about the federal government’s plans and how they will affect states across the nation remain uncertain. State agencies administer the federal child-care funds, and administrators in some states, including Alabama, say the federal government hasn’t notified them of any changes. A spokesperson for the Alabama Department of Human Resources said Friday the agency received a payment from the federal government on Jan. 21.
“Alabama DHR has not received any official guidance/correspondence from the Office of Child Care regarding this matter,” a  Jan. 7 statement from Alabama DHR reads. “Also, we have not received any notification of funds being frozen.”
Mississippi Today and a Georgia House of Representatives member reported similar responses from administrators in those states.
But based on the sparse information the U.S. Health and Human Services Department has shared publicly, child-welfare advocates and policy analysts in Alabama said the consequences of threatened actions could be devastating for child-care businesses and the families they serve. Employers and the state’s economy also could suffer if parents drop out of the workforce, they said.
Shelby, who lives in Florence, Alabama, and has worked at an area hotel for nine years, said if her child-care subsidy payments were interrupted or the center her daughter attends closed due to changes in how providers are paid, she likely wouldn’t be able to keep her job. Shelby’s daughter has autism and is non-verbal. The daycare where she’s enrolled full time is the only one Shelby could find that participates in the subsidy program and employs teachers trained to work with children who have autism.
“That’s hard, taking away the ability for us to pay them,” she said.
Sa-Vaughnie Johnson, senior program director of early care and education services with the Family Guidance Center of Alabama, which helps families secure child care assistance, said potential funding changes would deal a significant blow to all child-care providers in Alabama that participate in the subsidy program – and a vast majority do. Those in rural and high-poverty areas are especially vulnerable, she said.
“I don’t know if they could sustain themselves if that happened,” Johnson said. “We know that centers that take subsidy really need that subsidy to survive. They have to pay their workers, they have to feed these kids.”
The Family Guidance Center is one of a handful of nonprofit child-care management agencies that partner with the Alabama Department of Human Resources to administer the federally funded subsidized child-care program. Qualifying families receive assistance on a sliding scale based on income, Johnson said. Parents have to be working or in school full time, and they pay a portion of child-care costs. Alabama DHR covers the rest by making subsidy payments directly to providers using federal funds.
The average annual cost in Alabama for a toddler in center-based care was $8,424 in 2024, according to Child Care Aware of America.

Attempts to freeze funds met with lawsuits

The X post by HHS Deputy Secretary Jim O’Neill states: “Starting today, all ACF payments across America will require a justification and a receipt or photo evidence before we send money to a state.”
“ACF” is the Administration for Children and Families, a division of HHS that oversees the Child Care and Development Fund, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, and the Social Services Block Grant – all federal funding sources for states to assist families with children. The Child Care and Development Fund subsidizes child care for 1.4 million children nationwide and 40,226 in Alabama, according to the HHS website and Alabama DHR, respectively.
HHS announced Jan. 6 it had sent letters to the governors of five states led by Democrats – California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota and New York – notifying them that access to all three funding streams was restricted pending further review. The decision followed “serious concerns about widespread fraud and misuse of taxpayer dollars in state-administered programs,” according to a press release.
The federal government asked those states to provide data including the names and Social Security numbers of those who received benefits from some programs going back to 2022.
The five states filed a lawsuit challenging the freeze, and a federal judge ruled on Jan. 9 funding must continue for at least two weeks while arguments play out in court.
In a Jan. 13 statement to the Alabama Reflector, HHS said the department is asking for records of attendance, inspections, complaints and internal state discrepancies for centers suspected of fraud in Minnesota.
“For those centers NOT suspected of fraud in Minnesota or in other states, there is still additional verification, but not as extensive,” the statement reads. “Other child care centers will be expected to provide administrative data.”
The federal government typically distributes CCDF funds to states in quarterly installments, although the grants are awarded annually, according to the First Five Years Fund, a nonprofit that works to build federal-level bipartisan support for quality child care and early learning programs.
Any delay in payments would be a stressor for many child-care providers in Alabama, said Camille Bennett, an advocate and co-owner of two child-care centers.
“Most child-care centers depend on the child-care subsidies, if they’re taking in a lot of subsidies, to pay their staff,” she said. “And if it goes away, then they would have to rely on their savings – period. And if they don’t have savings, then they don’t have a center.”
More than 50 state and national organizations issued a joint statement Jan. 13 asking Congress members to ​​ensure federal child-care resources continue to reach eligible families.
“We urge leaders to act with urgency to ensure that the Administration for Children and Families disburses CCDF funding without further disruption, while working in partnership with states as they deliver CCDF funding efficiently and responsibly,” said the statement, submitted during a hearing of the U.S. House of Representatives Education and Workforce Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary and Secondary Education.

Attendance verification and fraud monitoring

DHR said in a statement that it implemented a child-care management system last February which, among other things, tracks attendance and includes several new safeguards to prevent fraud.
“We continue to explore other measures to ensure protocols are in place and followed,” the statement said.
The new system involves QR codes parents scan with their phones when they drop off and pick up their children, said Joycelyn Williams, director of the KinderCare center in Hoover, Alabama.
“We don’t have to do anything with it,” Williams said of the attendance data. “We just print out the code and it goes straight to DHR.”
Johnson said child-care providers receive a new QR code each day as an anti-fraud measure.
“That was just a cleaner, more efficient way of making sure that we are doing with the funds what we should be done with funds,” she said of the QR-code system.
The Family Guidance Center requires families to provide Social Security cards, birth certificates, drivers’ licenses and pay stubs through its application process, Johnson said.
Currently, if a child is absent 10 consecutive days, based on electronic attendance records, they are automatically unenrolled from the subsidy program and parents have to reenroll them to restore payments, according to Alabama DHR.
Carol Gundlach, senior policy analyst with Alabama Arise, said fraud is extremely rare in Alabama’s child-care subsidy program. She said she’s worked with DHR for 30 years in various capacities, including as an advocate, a contractor and through her tenure on the state’s child-care advisory council.
“We certainly know what children are getting funded under the child care block grant because there are contractors with DHR whose job it is to certify families and children as eligible to receive a subsidy,” she said. “So the idea that there are providers out there who just are not submitting plans or documentation or keeping records is simply incorrect.”
By law, state oversight mechanisms include internal controls, state audits and inspector general reviews, fraud detection and investigations and provider monitoring, according to the First Five Years Fund.
States essentially apply for CCDF funds through state plans they submit to the federal government, according to the statement Alabama DHR provided. Those plans include sections in which states must disclose any fraud they’ve uncovered and describe measures they take to prevent fraudulent activity.
According to Alabama’s 299-page 2025-2027 state plan, the most recent analysis found no improper payments that were a direct result of fraud in 2022. Twenty-two parents and two child-care providers were disqualified from the program for intentional program violations during 2023, per the state plan.
Proposed changes to provider pay could cause closures

In the midst of controversy over funding freezes, HHS announced Jan. 5 it was starting a rule-making process to change how providers are paid.
HHS said it was rescinding Biden-era rules that require states to pay child-care providers in advance and based on enrollment rather than attendance and that favored contract slots with providers over parent-directed vouchers.
“When controls are not in place, bad actors can bill for children who aren’t there,” said Alex Adams, HHS assistant secretary for family support. “Families and taxpayers deserve proof that services are being delivered to children. These rule changes emphasize the critical role federal investments in child care play for the American workforce.”
But child-care advocates say a switch to attendance-based billing could push parents out of the workforce and cause child-care centers to close.
In Alabama, child-care subsidies are paid to providers based on enrollment, not attendance, according to the 2025-2027 state plan.
“I’m pretty sure that we have always paid on enrollment, because paying on attendance – it just doesn’t make a lot of sense because the centers’ income would fluctuate drastically,” Gundlach said. “I don’t know how you can operate that way.”
Billing based on enrollment is vital to child-care providers’ financial stability because most of their costs don’t change when children are sporadically absent due to sickness, doctor appointments, family vacations and more, she said. Fixed costs include worker wages, rent or mortgage payments, utility, insurance and tax bills, building maintenance, food expenses and more. Providers typically charge all families, including those who don’t use the subsidy program, based on enrollment vs. attendance to cover these costs, Gundlach said.
“It would be a nightmare if a child doesn’t attend for one day or two days and we’re not getting paid for that,” said Bennett, whose centers receive subsidies for 49 of the 50 children they serve. “That’s ridiculous, because you have to think about it: We’re working with primarily children birth through five. Do you understand how much they get sick? It’s not a viable solution.”
Johnson gives an example of a center with more than five infants enrolled. By law, two teachers would have to be assigned to the infant room in a licensed center. If just three children were present on a given day, only one teacher would be required.
“So now I’ve got to make the decision whether I’m going to send this person home for the day,” Johnson said. “I don’t know how I’m going to pay her because I’m only getting paid for three kids.”
And if absences don’t affect the required teacher-child ratio, sending an employee home isn’t even an option.
If providers were paid subsidies based on actual attendance, the burden to make up the difference in monthly costs initially would fall to parents, said Anita Williams, the Family Guidance Center’s CMA director for Montgomery and Dothan regions.
“And the parent can’t afford to pay the difference,” she said. “That’s why they’re on subsidy.”
Those parents might have to remove their children from care, said Joycelyn Williams of Hoover KinderCare, which receives subsidies for 30% of children in its program. “It would mean a lot of hardship and stress,” she said. “It will cause a lot of problems.”
Alabama already faces a shortage of child-care providers. According to the Buffett Early Childhood Institute at the University of Nebraska, there’s a 41% gap in child-care supply vs. potential need in Alabama.
“That’s going to be trouble on the economy also because a lot of our parents depend on subsidy to go to work or go to school,” Anita Williams said.
The long-term economic impact of Alabama’s current child-care supply gap is between $3.9 billion and $5.9 billion per year, according to the Buffett Early Childhood Institute.
Ultimately, children would suffer if providers closed or their parents couldn’t afford care, Bennett said. Many parents can’t quit work, so their children would likely stay with relatives or neighbors – whoever was available on a given day – with no consistency or educational curriculum, which is required for licensed child-care providers, she said.










I think it would look like a crisis for children. I think it would look like children not receiving educational preparation for pre-K and kindergarten. 


– Camille Bennett, child care center operator


“I think it would look like a crisis for children,” Bennett said. “I think it would look like children not receiving educational preparation for pre-K and kindergarten. I think you’ll see behavioral issues as well. A lack of consistency for children, particularly birth through five, is never a good thing.”

Other changes not likely to affect Alabama

Paying child care providers in advance also helps with business stability, Gundlach said, and that was the reasoning the Biden administration gave for the 2024 rule change. Alabama, however, did not implement the upfront payment model, DHR said in its statement. The agency said in its 2025-2027 state plan that it had requested a waiver to give the state more time to implement the policy change.
The state currently pays providers on a three-week delay, Anita Williams said. DHR also did not implement a model to steer clients toward contract providers, the agency’s statement said.
“It remains up to the parents as to which provider they choose for their child(ren),” the statement reads.
Families using the subsidy program are somewhat limited in that they have to choose a provider that participates in the voluntary program. According to DHR, 1,675 of 1,915 licensed centers and licensed home daycares in Alabama participated in the subsidy program as of Dec. 31. Most families who sign up for subsidies have options to choose among, but their selected provider might have a waitlist, Anita Williams said. Because of a severe shortage in rural areas, some families don’t currently have a choice, she said.

What’s next

Once the proposed rules changes are published in the Federal Register, a 30-day public comment period will ensue.After HHS reviews comments, it could publish a final rule, with an effective date 30 days after publication.
Some language in HHS’s press release says states “may” require payment based on verified attendance and “may” provide payment after care is delivered. It’s possible current law doesn’t allow HHS to make the proposed changes mandatory, Gundlach said, which would leave states to decide what route to take.
Wording in the formally proposed rules should provide clarity, she said.
Alabama DHR said it would make changes as necessary to follow federal law. Alabama’s subsidy program operates pursuant to its state plan, which is written to follow federal requirements in place at the time it’s submitted, DHR said.
“If the rescissions are finalized, the state plan will be amended in compliance with the new rules,” the agency’s statement continued.
Shelby said she wishes government officials making those decisions could see things from the perspective of those who will be affected.
“They’re basing everything on money, but not considering the kids’ lives, not considering the help that this actually gives the parents to get up and go to work,” she said. “Everybody always talks about parents sitting at home. We are the working class, just needing the help. It’s our children that affect us most.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Camille-Bennett-for-Jan-26-2026-newsletter-02-1024x682.jpg,,,2026-01-26 08:56:35.583555

(Photo: Michael Lyle/Nevada Current)Clark and Washoe counties are gearing up this week to resume an early-morning count of the number of unsheltered folks in an effort to better grasp the number of people experiencing homelessness. 
Strict guidelines by the U.S. Housing and Urban Development on who should and shouldn’t be included mean the findings won’t reflect a full accounting of people experiencing homelessness and precarious housing. 
The point-in-time-count, a snapshot of homelessness on one particular night in January required by HUD, instructs cities across the country to tally street-level homelessness as well as those staying in temporary emergency shelters and transitional housing. 
Other often overlooked unhoused populations that won’t be reflected in the final numbers include those experiencing homelessness who were incarcerated at the time of the count and unhoused people in emergency rooms and hospitals. 
“There’s an even larger number of people who are in precarious or kind of less than optimal living situations that are not included in the PIT count,” said Catrina Peters, the Homeless Services Coordinator with Washoe County. 
Neither Clark nor Washoe conducted a count of its unsheltered population in 2025. HUD doesn’t require jurisdictions to conduct a full count of its unsheltered population every year, though they are required to provide data of sheltered populations.
The most recent report from HUD found in 2024 homelessness increased by 17% in Nevada, on par with the 20% increase seen across the country.
Southern Nevada’s 2024 PIT count identified 7,906 unhoused people, a 20% increase from the previous year. Washoe County found 1,760 in 2024, which was a 4% increase from the 1,690 found in 2023.
Both jurisdictions think numbers will likely increase this year. 
Even with stringent guidelines from HUD, Clark County is working with neighboring jurisdictions to ensure the number of unsheltered people counted is the most reflective of the population, said Brenda Barnes, social services manager with Clark County. 
The county has refined its counting methodology in recent years to enhance accuracy, but there will “always be an undercount,” Barnes said. 
One reason officials anticipate higher counts this year is an influx of people entering homelessness due to higher rents, Peters said.
As housing becomes less affordable, eviction rates increase, and housing insecurity becomes more prevalent.
“The one data point that continues to persist is that in communities where rent is extremely high, those are the communities that struggle with high homeless rates,” Peters said. “I think it just really brings it all back to the fact that we desperately need to increase the number of affordable housing units in our community.”
Barnes also attributes a part of the increased numbers in previous years to better methodology of counting people.
“I think this year I already assume that our numbers are going to be higher because of the time we’ve taken to do better,” Barnes said.  “If we consistently do better, we’re going to capture more individuals. It doesn’t mean that we’re failing the community in that area. It just means we’re at least doing better accounting for those who are experiencing homelessness.”
Southern Nevada is starting a portion of its count at 3 a.m. within the Corridor of Hope in the City of Las Vegas, the area of downtown Las Vegas with the majority of homeless services and congregate shelters. 
The other deployment sites around Clark County will begin counting around 5 a.m.
Clark County currently has more than 200 volunteers signed up, on par with previous years. The goal this year is to get at least 400 volunteers to ease the counting process. 
Rather than relying on volunteers, Washoe works more deliberately with nonprofits and other homeless service agencies to conduct the count, Peters said. She added this approach is needed especially for hard to reach areas of Washoe that can’t be accessed without four-wheel drive vehicles.  
Some groups of people in unstable housing won’t be reflected in the data when it’s released later in the year. 
“We have folks who are in situations like maybe they’re living in a hotel room, maybe they’re doubled up with family,” Peters said. “Those don’t meet the HUD definitions of homelessness, but are definitely folks who are in very precarious living situations.”
Members of the Southern Nevada Continuum of Care Board, a coalition of government agencies and nonprofits, are exploring doing a separate tally of those incarcerated, Barnes said. Nothing has been finalized and it won’t be conducted during Thursday’s count. 
Because HUD has specific reporting guidelines, counties usually limit data collection during the PIT count to what is specifically required or mandated. 
“We’re making sure that everything is aligned with specifically the requirements of HUD and HUD standards, not asking anything too far beyond that, just given, given the landscape that we’re in,” Barnes said. 
The Trump Administration has increased rhetoric attacking the transgender community since returning to office in 2025.
One of the HUD changes was around data collection for PIT included restricting questions around gender ideology, Barnes said.
While the question will be optional for volunteers to ask, the county won’t be including those results on trans people experiencing homelessness in their final report to HUD, Barnes said. 
Washoe also plans to ask the question and include the data in the county’s final HUD report. 
The PIT count is returning for the first count since the majority of jurisdictions have enacted  anti-homeless camping bans that restrict and criminalize people from sleeping, camping and living in cars.

I remembered this last week after the Alabama House Democrats outlined their priorities for the 2026 session. It wasn’t an explicit campaign event, but you wouldn’t be wrong to make the connection.
They talked about slashing Alabama’s nation-leading levels of gun violence. Making voting easier. And most of all, improving affordability.
This is all reasonable. The narrative is that President Donald Trump got reelected in 2024 because the price of eggs mattered more to voters than felony convictions and blatant racism. And if Democrats do well this year, the polls say, a growing disappointment with Trump’s handling of the economy will play a big role.
So Democrats, including likely Alabama gubernatorial nominee Doug Jones, are leaning into it.
And it would seem to give them an edge. Alabama Republicans, after cutting grocery taxes while blaming inflation on President Joe Biden, have fallen silent on the issue. The GOP-controlled Legislature is in a hurry to get the budgets passed and get its members back on the campaign trail. Beyond raises for state employees and some efforts to avoid cost increases in their insurance plans next year, there’s really not anything from the party addressing food prices, electricity prices or housing.
But even if these issues are popular, we all know they may not matter in November.  Republicans often need to do little more than be Republicans to win office.
This is partly structural. When qualifying closed on Friday, Democrats had candidates in 21 of the state’s 35 Senate districts and 54 of the state’s 105 House districts.  It’s fine to run on issues that matter to people. But many Alabama voters won’t hear the pitch this year.
But it’s also obvious that Republicans feel no need to talk about actual issues in Alabama. U.S. Sen. Tommy Tuberville, our supposed gubernatorial inevitability, has been spending much of his time attacking Muslim Americans. He recently criticized Virginia’s new lieutenant governor for taking her oath of office on a copy of the Quran.
And up and down the Republican state candidate list, you will find an obsession with immigration and voter fraud, two things that are not happening to any significant extent in our state.
If Republicans thought affordability would make or break the 2026 election, odds are we’d be hearing a lot more on the topic from the Legislature. But we’re not. GOP candidates have decided that they can focus on the religious convictions of Virginians more than the daily struggles of Alabamians.
And for now, it’s a good bet. Look who casts ballots in Alabama.
Over the past 16 years, Alabama voters have elected lawmakers who terrorize immigrants. Who attack transgender youth. Legislators who put pregnant women in danger. And put all of us at higher risk of getting shot.
In the face of this cruelty, these lawmakers keep returning to office.
You can say that Alabamians deserve the poor governance that results from electing leaders who prioritize baseless rage. But this is too simplistic. Most Alabamians aren’t going to the polls. Just 37% of eligible voters cast ballots in the 2022 election. The number of registered voters in Alabama who sat out the 2024 presidential election (1.8 million) was larger than Trump’s vote total in the state (1.46 million).
Some of that nonparticipation comes from the obstacles Republicans have thrown up to voting in recent years. But a good part of it stems from a lack of choices and a feeling that casting a ballot is pointless. The profoundly pathetic campaigns of 2022 — with Democrats struggling to outraise Libertarians and Republicans bullying immigrants and transgender youth — certainly gave Alabamians reasons to sit the election out.
That’s where the opportunity for Alabama Democrats lies. Not in peeling off Republican votes, which seems unlikely. Democrats have to pull those alienated voters back to the polls. To restore their faith in voting as a positive act. And to accept the Democrats as a viable vehicle for governance.
It’s a lot to ask for a party that’s still trying to find its feet in the state. All too often, a vote for a Democrat feels like a waste in a solidly red state.
But the path to an Alabama government that actually reflects the needs of the state — whatever party it may be — means pulling the disaffected voters back into the process. And taking it back from those who use the ballot as a cudgel.
Otherwise, we’ll keep our miserable disconnect between what Alabamians want and what state government gives them.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Huntsville-voters-for-Nov-8-2024-story.jpg,,,2026-01-26 08:56:35.583555
,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-26 12:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,How will CDC vaccine schedule changes affect CT residents?,Laura Tillman and Katy Golvala,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/26/cdc-vaccine-schedule-changes-ct/,The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced updates to its recommendations for childhood vaccines. Here's what to know.,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced updates to its recommendations for childhood vaccines on Jan. 5. In the aftermath, Connecticut elected officials have been communicating the implications to the public, including assuring parents who may be confused about how the changes affect their child’s scheduled vaccinations.
Here’s what to know about the changes and how they impact the way vaccinations are done and paid for in Connecticut.
What changes were made to the CDC’s childhood vaccine recommendations?
At the end of 2024, the CDC’s childhood vaccination schedule recommended 17 immunizations for all children. On Jan. 5, that changed to 11 broadly recommended vaccines: diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), Pneumococcal conjugate, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, human papillomavirus (HPV), and chickenpox. 
Some vaccines are recommended to high risk groups: RSV, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, two types of bacterial meningitis, and dengue. Finally, the CDC says that for children who are not high risk, the decision as to whether to administer vaccines for rotavirus, COVID, the flu, hepatitis A, hepatitis B and bacterial meningitis should be left up to “shared clinical decision-making,” or conversations between people and their doctors. 
The CDC’s recommendations are not requirements and families have a choice as to whether they continue to follow the previous vaccine schedule, the new recommendations, or some combination of the two.
Why were these changes made? 
Major changes to leadership have been made over the past year at the Department of Health and Human Services, including to the panel of experts that provides recommendations on vaccines. Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr has long promoted views that cast doubt on the safety of vaccines. He has also advanced the idea that vaccines are linked to climbing autism rates, although the majority of health experts say there is no proven link between vaccines and autism. 
In December, President Donald Trump directed HHS to align the childhood vaccine schedule with peer advice and the schedule of other developed countries. The new recommendations are more closely aligned with Denmark’s schedule, according to HHS, but U.S. experts say the comparison is misguided since the two countries have little in common when it comes to the spread of preventable diseases like hepatitis B.
How have Connecticut officials responded? 
Connecticut Public Health Commissioner Manisha Juthani, along with other public health officials, have affirmed that Connecticut’s vaccine recommendations have not changed. That means children must be fully up to date on the Connecticut vaccine schedule to enroll in public school, a list identical to the previous federal schedule. 
No religious exemptions are allowed; only medical exemptions via a certificate from a health care provider allow children enrolled in Connecticut public schools to forgo vaccines.
Will my insurance still pay for childhood vaccinations that are no longer recommended by the CDC? 
In short, yes. In a fact sheet published recently, the federal government clarified that, despite the recommendation changes, all vaccines would continue to be available to anyone who wants them through Affordable Care Act plans, Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program and the Vaccines for Children program. 
“Families will not have to purchase them out of pocket. Among peer nations, the U.S. will continue to offer the most childhood vaccines for free to those who want them,” stated the fact sheet.
Interim state insurance commissioner Josh Hershman reiterated this message to Connecticut residents on Jan. 6. 
“The vaccines referenced in the CDC announcement were not removed from the immunization schedule. Instead, they were moved from a routine recommendation to clinical decision-making recommendation,” Hershman stated. “Because these vaccines remain on the CDC schedule, they continue to be covered by health insurance plans regulated by the CID.”
However, KFF Health News has reported that because the CDC has changed its recommendation for the HPV vaccine from two doses to one, insurance companies are no longer required to cover the second dose. 
Why does it matter if the CDC changes its recommendations?
According to health care professionals, including Juthani, the changes to the vaccine schedule have a number of concerning repercussions. For one, some of the vaccines  that are no longer recommended by the CDC can prevent diseases that cause serious illness and even death.
There are also concerns, officials say, that the motivations for changing the schedule are misguided and based on bad science. 
While all 17 vaccines are still required for students enrolled in Connecticut public schools, some families outside of that system may opt-out. As federal authorities and states diverge on their recommendations, communities may see a resurgence of preventable illnesses like hepatitis B, which is easily spread through bodily fluids. “Remember all 17 of these diseases are worth protecting your child against,” Juthani said at a press conference on Jan. 12.
“We really don’t need to go backwards,” said Dr. Robert Dudley, a longtime pediatrician of the Community Health Center of New Britain, recalling a serious RSV season he saw at the beginning of his career. “We don’t want to see those days, nothing made me happier than seeing a vaccine come out that mothers could take, infants could take, people over 50 could take to keep them from getting this horrible disease.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP24248694401334-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-26 07:57:44.827014

(Photo by Anne-Marie Caruso/New Jersey Monitor)Two Democrats who joined the state Assembly last week are the first in decades to represent Hudson County without the backing of the powerful party organization.
Assembly members Ravi Bhalla and Katie Brennan ran for the Assembly last June in a six-person race that saw them defeating two opponents who had the support of the Hudson County Democratic Organization and one incumbent assemblywoman. They cruised to victory in November in the largely Democratic 32nd Legislative District, which includes Hoboken and parts of Jersey City.
Bhalla and Brennan say they’re focused on addressing issues like housing and transparency, rather than playing party politics.
“At the end of the day, we’re all Democrats. I want to be a team player, and I want to make sure that we can work together to advance common objectives,” said Bhalla.
Union County Democrats who flipped GOP Assembly seats eye affordability

The district is represented in the state Senate by Sen. Raj Mukherji, a Democrat who backed two of Bhalla’s and Brennan’s opponents in last June’s primary. Bhalla and Brennan say they’ve put the primary in the rearview mirror and already have several initiatives they want to work on with Mukherji, including his plans to reintroduce two immigrant protection bills that were vetoed last week by outgoing Gov. Phil Murphy.
“We’re all adults, and we’ve all had jobs. Sometimes you don’t agree with people. Sometimes it’s rough,” Brennan said. “I, believe it or not, don’t relish being a kind of flamethrower. I really just want to get things done, and I think that Raj is ready to work with us on that.”
Mukherji called Bhalla and Brennan both “intellectuals,” and said the three have the potential to be one of the strongest delegations in the Legislature.
“The world has changed so much since the politics of a primary a year ago. Our democracy is in a state of disrepair,” Mukherji said.

Bhalla is an attorney who was elected Hoboken mayor in 2017 after previously serving on the city’s council for two terms. He’s garnered national attention for the square-mile city’s Vision Zero project, which has resulted in zero pedestrian deaths since 2017.
He said his first priority now is economic justice for marginalized communities. He wants to explore whether the state could provide a guaranteed basic income, create more incentives to boost the construction of affordable housing, and build more resilient climate infrastructure across the Garden State.
For years, storms in Hudson County meant widespread flooding in Hoboken, and Bhalla says that through resiliency projects, flooding risks have been reduced so they are weeks or months apart now instead of days.
“That’s done through innovation, and that innovation can be applied through other parts of the state,” he said.

Brennan is bringing a different background to the Golden Dome in Trenton. A Jersey City resident, she built her career in housing policy and previously worked at the state Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency. She’s also been an advocate for survivors of sexual assault.
In 2018, she went public with claims that she was raped by a fellow member of Murphy’s campaign team and that the campaign and state officials failed to properly investigate her case. During the primary last year, one of her campaign ads said she would “turn my experience into our results.”
Brennan said she, like Bhalla, wants to back housing initiatives in the Assembly. The two have already worked on a bill that would call for a statewide right to counsel for housing issues, and they plan to tackle “unconscionable” rent increases. She also wants to beef up transit, particularly in South Jersey.
Brennan called herself a “proud progressive” in the Democratic-controlled Assembly, but said her experience in government agencies has also led her to be practical.
“I think there is a mandate that everybody has now of recognizing the need for affordability. And voters in general — they just want to see stuff get done,” she said. “I know that words matter, things being funded matters, and it matters how it’s being implemented.”

Chad Gibbs, College of Charleston
Joe Engel was and remains an icon in Charleston, South Carolina. Born in Zakroczym, Poland, he survived Auschwitz and several other concentration camps and fought with the resistance before landing on American shores as a refugee in 1949.
After retirement from his dry-cleaning business, Engel focused his later years on Holocaust education.
As part of these efforts, he took to sitting on downtown park benches wearing a name tag that read “Joe Engel, Holocaust Survivor: Ask me questions” — becoming the city’s first public memorial to the victims of Nazi genocide.
Knowing he would not be here to impart his message forever, Engel and his friend and fellow survivor Pincus Kolender led a drive to install the permanent memorial that now stands in Charleston’s Marion Square park.
In 2021, I moved to the city to take up my role as a professor and director of Holocaust studies at the College of Charleston. I arrived just in time to meet Engel and to teach many local students who had met him.
He died the following year, at age 95.
For years, historians, educators and Jewish groups have been considering how to teach about the Holocaust after the survivors have passed on. Few of today’s college students have ever met a Holocaust survivor.
Those who have likely met a child survivor, with few personal memories before 1945. American veterans of the war are almost entirely unknown to our present students; many know nothing of their own family connections to World War II.
Time marches on, distance grows, and what we call “common knowledge” changes.
One alarming study from 2018 revealed that 45% of American adults could not identify a single one of the over 40,000 Nazi camps and ghettos, while 41% of younger Americans believe that Nazi Germany killed substantially less than 6 million Jews during the Holocaust.
According to a 2025 study by the Claims Conference, there are somewhat more than 200,000 survivors still alive, though their median age is 87. It is sadly expected that 7 in 10 will pass away within the next decade.
With their absence near, how can educators and community members bring this history home, decreasing the perceived distance between the students of today and the lessons of the Holocaust?
Bringing history home
One method that shows promise is helping students realize the connections of their own home and their own time to a genocide that might seem far away — both on the map and in the mind.
A letter dated Dec. 27, 1938, sent from Malie Landsmann to her cousin Minnie Tewel Baum of South Carolina. (Photo courtesy of the Jewish Heritage Collection, Addlestone Library, College of Charleston)
In classes on the Holocaust, I now use a set of letters sent by a family of Polish Jews to their relatives in Camden, South Carolina.
The letters themselves are powerful sources demonstrating the increasing desperation of Malie Landsmann, the main writer. In 1938, she reached out to her cousin Minnie Tewel Baum, seeking help to escape Adolf Hitler’s Germany.
Even though the two had never met, Minnie tried everything to help her cousin and her family.
In the end, however, she was not successful.
American immigration barriers and murderous Nazi policy took their toll, with Malie, her husband, Chaim, and their two children, Ida and Peppi, all killed at Auschwitz.
These haunting letters demonstrate the connections of the war to small-town South Carolina. They give the Holocaust a real human face and a connection to places students know.
Letter collections like these are not rare. The College of Charleston holds a second, far larger group of letters, the Helen Stern Lipton Papers, which runs to over 170 pages of correspondence between family members in South Carolina, German-occupied Europe, Russia and even Central Asia.
When I was a doctorate student, I participated in classes using the Sara Spira postcards sent from a series of ghettos in Poland to rural Wisconsin. Further archives exist all over the United States. Most communities have connections to the Holocaust, whether via artifacts, people with direct ties or both.
The important thing is to teach in ways that can break down the mental barriers created by time and space. It is indeed the same reason that the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum created a traveling exhibit called “Auschwitz. Not Long Ago. Not Far Away.”
Learning from descendants
As teachers and professors attempt to bridge these divides, they often invite the descendants of Holocaust survivors to their classes to speak.
Descendants can retell the stories of their parents’ or ancestors’ perseverance and survival, but what is more important is their ability to put a human face on these events and show how they remain relevant in the lives of so many.

I take these short visits a step further in a class where students train as oral history interviewers, then conduct recorded conversations with a descendant of survivors.
These meetings encourage discussion of family Holocaust history, but only after the student asks the descendant about how they learned about what happened to their parent, grandparent or great-grandparent, and how this might have weighed on their own life years after the war.
This is truly the point here. The most impactful parts of these recordings are almost always the discussions of legacies, of how the families that students meet still live with the enormity of Holocaust trauma.
When a descendant tells students about the past, that is important. But when a descendant speaks of what that past means for them, their family and their community, that is so much more.
Students gain firsthand knowledge of intergenerational trauma; the difficulties of rebuilding; the prevalence of anxiety, worry and depression in survivor homes; and so much more.
All of this shows students in no uncertain ways how the Holocaust still has bearing on the lives of people in our communities.
History after memory: a path forward
What’s most heartening about these methods and their successes is what they reveal about what today’s students value.

In the age of artificial intelligence, Big Tech and omnipresent social media, I believe it is still — and maybe even more than ever — the real human connection.
Students are drawn in by the local connections and open up to the stories of real people, brought to them in person. Often, they launch their own research to better understand the letters.
One of my students even helped turn them into classroom materials, now used well beyond our own college.
Another did the painstaking work to have four new Stolpersteine, or Stumbling Stone, memorials installed in Berlin to commemorate the Landsmann family.
Never having witnessed them myself, I can only imagine the impact of Joe Engel’s conversations on those park benches in downtown Charleston.
Nothing will ever truly replace the voices of the survivors, but I believe teachers and communities can carry on his work by making history feel local and personal.
As everything around us seems to show each day, little could be more important than the lessons of these people, their sources and the Holocaust.

(Getty Images)Indiana’s Senate Enrolled Act 1 of 2025 delivered what many voters have wanted for years: lower property taxes. Homeowners received higher deductions, but businesses — especially those with substantial personal property — saw significant reductions in tax liability.  
Let’s compare the two. A family who owns a $400,000 house would see a $300 cut, the maximum, each year. A business that owns $400,000 worth of personal property would see their taxes cut by $12,000 a year.  
In the short run, these changes might be popular. In the long run, however, they will likely weaken municipal governments across the state and undermine the very economic growth the law was meant to encourage.
Property taxes are not simply another revenue source. They are the primary funding mechanism for local government in Indiana. Police and fire protection, street maintenance, parks, libraries, and much of public education depend on property tax revenue. When those revenues fall, local governments do not gain new efficiencies by default; they lose capacity.
SEA 1 reduces assessed values and effective tax rates across much of the property tax base. While the legislation phases in these changes, the cumulative effect is substantial. Cities and towns will collect significantly less revenue over the coming decade, even after accounting for modest economic growth. This is not speculative. Local fiscal officers across Indiana have already projected sizable structural deficits as the law takes effect.










While homeowners receive modest, broadly distributed relief, the most dramatic change are sweeping business tax cuts.


– Michael Hicks


The design of SEA 1 matters. While homeowners receive modest, broadly distributed relief, the most dramatic change are sweeping business tax cuts. In many communities, this removes a large share of the commercial tax base entirely. The result is a sharp decline in taxable value that cannot be offset by growth alone.
Supporters of the law argue that local governments can replace lost revenue through local income taxes. That option exists, but it is far from costless. Local income taxes are paid by workers, not property owners, and they are far more sensitive to economic cycles. Communities with slower job growth or lower incomes will struggle to raise sufficient revenue, even at higher rates. Others will simply choose not to increase taxes, forcing cuts instead.
These tradeoffs are not evenly distributed. Large cities with diverse tax bases may absorb some of the loss. Small cities and towns cannot. For many rural and mid-sized communities, even modest revenue reductions translate into fewer police officers, delayed infrastructure maintenance, or closed public facilities. Over time, those cuts accumulate.
The economic consequences of this erosion are well-documented. Public safety, infrastructure quality, and school performance are among the strongest predictors of local economic growth. Businesses do not locate in places with crumbling roads, understaffed emergency services, or struggling schools simply because taxes are low. They locate where public services are reliable and labor markets are strong.
Indiana school leaders warn property tax reforms are destabilizing public education budgets

The fallout of this will happen fairly soon. I expect close to 100 municipal governments will declare fiscal emergencies because personnel cuts will be so dramatic. But, there is a grimly humorous side of this. The number of Indiana local government employees is near a record low, and lower than in every year before 2020 for which we have data.  
This brings us to education. While the state now provides most operating funding for K-12 schools, property taxes still play a critical role in capital projects and transportation. Reduced local revenue means deferred maintenance, fewer facility upgrades, and growing disparities between districts. Over time, this affects workforce quality—Indiana’s most important long-term economic asset.
The lesson here is not that tax relief is inherently harmful. Indiana’s earlier property tax reforms succeeded because they were paired with stable replacement revenues and realistic assessments of local fiscal capacity. SEA 1 breaks from that tradition. It cuts deeply into the local tax base without providing a durable, statewide mechanism to replace what is lost.
Fiscal policy is ultimately about tradeoffs. Lower property taxes today mean fewer public services tomorrow. If those services are central to economic growth—and they are—then the policy choice becomes clearer. Indiana has managed to a few hundred dollars per household in the short run at the cost of weaker communities and slower growth in the years ahead.
The second grimly funny aspect of this is that with these lopsided property tax cuts, local governments are going to have to raise local income taxes.  SEA1 was hastily put together, and relied so heavily on a study that favored business interest over objective fact.  The result was a huge business tax cut that will almost surely cause an overall tax increase for most families.  
Hoosier families need to think long and hard about the fallout of SEA1, and have some frank conversations with both businesses and legislators about the state’s future.

Nine applications for Indiana sites are before the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, according to an agency tracker of Class VI permits.
They’re one of six classes of wells the EPA regulates under an Underground Injection Control program, for substances like oil, gas and now, the geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide.
CO2 capture and storage proposals have faced intense local opposition in Indiana.

A bill under consideration by the Indiana General Assembly would require the Department of Natural Resources’ autonomous board to seek primary enforcement authority over Class VI wells. House Bill 1368 also outlines a state-level regulatory scheme.
“Wherever you stand on sequestration … First of all, we want to keep Indiana competitive, bring in business and jobs,” said Rep. Ed Soliday, R-Valparaiso.
“Second of all, we want to be prepared to pivot with whatever happens in Washington, because Washington has been like a pendulum on a clock and it’s bouncing off the sides,” he said.
Soliday, the bill’s author, spoke during a committee hearing last week that featured enthusiastic industry testimony.
But some skeptics fear the state isn’t fully equipped to carry it out.
Primacy’s popularity
Six states already hold primary enforcement authority for Class VI wells, according to an EPA table: Arizona, Louisiana, North Dakota, Texas, West Virginia and Wyoming.
“They have to demonstrate that they will administer the program up to the standards that EPA, the federal government, would do it,” said Janet McCabe, a visiting professor at Indiana University and a former EPA deputy administrator.
An increasing number of states are considering joining.


As of October, Alaska was involved in primacy pre-application activities, while Colorado was working on proposed rulemaking, per an EPA graphic. Six others were in pre-application to revise their programs to include Class VI primacy: Alabama, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Utah.
Some successful Class VI applications took months, while others took years.
“Procedurally, it would follow the same steps” as other well types, McCabe said, “but how the wells would be used would dictate the kind of information that you would need.”
“If you’re going to be using a well to extract oil and gas, people have been doing that for years … and that’s a relatively straightforward and well-understood process,” she continued. “But storing CO2 underground is new, the technology is new. It just hasn’t been done as much. And there are all kinds of other questions that come into play.”
Timelines, proximity
One Indiana project has already obtained a Class VI permit: Wabash Valley Resources, which plans to produce ammonia fertilizer at a a former coal gasification plant — and pump the emissions underground. It’s a pilot with its own state laws and rules.
Others want in, too.
Sequestration would allow ethanol producers, for instance, to “fulfil(l) global and domestic demand for cleaner fuels,” said Tim Phelps, a lobbyist with Hathaway Strategies, who represented the Indiana Ethanol Producers Association in committee.
“While thorough review is vital to the public interest,” he said, the application process under the EPA has been “inconsistent,” causing “significant delays.”
“We are supportive of initiatives which seek to streamline this permitting process, to allow these projects — which involve significant investments of time and capital — to come to fruition,” Phelps said.
Association member POET, which bills itself as the world’s largest producer of bioethanol, is pursing Class VI permits at each of its five Indiana plants.

“We … support any effort to streamline permitting timelines,” said Hamilton Smith, a lobbyist for Ice Miller representing POET.
DNR has also made the case for pace.
“By accepting primacy for Class VI permitting, Indiana will be best positioned to work with all stakeholders to ensure that applications are reviewed with speed and efficiency, following all federal and state regulations,” spokesman Marty Benson said. 
“Instead of relying upon an out-of-state regulator, questions can be addressed by DNR staff in Indiana,” he added — an argument industry leaders echoed.
“Generally, we prefer working with DNR,” said Mark Shublak, a Taft law firm partner representing fuel company CountryMark.
He cited familiarity with the agency’s handling of oil and gas wells, hopes staff would process applications “timely,” and accessibility to “Indiana market participants.”
Home ties also played into DNR General Counsel Stephanie Flittner’s testimony.
Primacy would “ensur(e) these decisions are made in Indiana — closer to Indiana geology, Indiana communities and Indiana stakeholders,” she said.
Trust, resources
Others are skeptical of a switch.
Kerwin Olson, the executive director of Citizens Action Coalition, said his ratepayer advocacy organization and peers think agencies like DNR can be too lax.
“Us and many others have sort of viewed Indiana environmental authorities as, you know, nothing more than pay-to-play sort of permit-issuing agencies,” he said. They worry the “streamlined” timeline a firm may seek could come at a cost.

“There’s a reason for that bureaucracy, those regulations, because there’s significant risk with these commercial facilities, and a thorough review with expertise is a good thing,” Olson said.
That’s not to say he had the utmost confidence in even the EPA.
“There’s permits that have been issued that we thought never should have been issued,” he said. “So I don’t know that it’s that we have any more confidence, per se, in outcomes at the EPA … but it’s a matter of staffing levels, expertise, resources, time.”
DNR’s Benson said staff “do not anticipate a fiscal impact” from running a Class VI program, noting the agency already has primacy for oil and gas wells. He also cited that experience in defending personnel “expertise and professionalism.”

(Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images)The Twin Cities metropolitan area is under occupation by armed federal agents. According to the Census Reporter, there are roughly 3.7 million people living in the metro area and there may already be 3,000 militarized federal agents occupying our city. An additional 1,500 active duty troops from the army’s 11th Airborne Division are on standby, ready for deployment to Minnesota. 
Let’s put that in perspective. During the last year of his first term, President Trump negotiated a full withdrawal from Afghanistan, which at the time was a nation of 39 million people, to be completed in early 2021. In 2019, there were between 12,000 and 13,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan. At the start of the Biden administration, there were only 2,500 U.S. soldiers remaining there. 
I say this because the Trump administration has decided to send more armed federal agents to the Twin Cities than Joe Biden inherited in Afghanistan. That’s too many armed federal agents under any circumstances. 
Two U.S. citizens have already been killed who would be alive today absent the occupation. Many U.S. citizens have been detained and physically abused, and many more such instances have been endured by legally authorized immigrants. 
We are about to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. The Founders of the United States were intensely suspicious of standing armies in peace time. If they were British citizens, the colonists asked, why were the Red Coats stationed in Boston? They included, among their reasons for dissolving their ties to King George, the following:
“He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.”  
In 1787, at the Constitutional Convention, future President James Madison made the following observation: 
“A standing military force, with an overgrown executive will not long be safe companions to liberty. The means of defense against foreign danger, have been always the instruments of tyranny at home. Among the Romans it was a standing maxim to excite a war, whenever a revolt was apprehended. Throughout all Europe, the armies kept up under the pretext of defending, have enslaved the people.” 
It was clear to the nation’s Founders that federal forces were meant to fight foreign enemies and defend the United States from other nations. Among their first actions after the end of the Revolutionary War was to disband the Continental Army. Federal forces were never meant to occupy American cities and rural areas. 
Some might suggest that the millions of undocumented immigrants in the United States constitute a foreign invasion. Hogwash. The undocumented here come from many nations and arrived for as many reasons. It was not and is not an organized foreign invasion. 
U.S. federal forces are meant to protect us from foreign threats, not to occupy the streets and farms of America in unmarked cars and wearing masks and picking up people without judicial warrants based on how they look, or speak, or what neighborhood they live in, or how they get to work, or where they work. 
What is happening in Minnesota is un-American. It would make the Founders wonder what has become of their project. After 250 years, we now resemble the British more than we do the Patriots, except the Red Coats had the courage to show their faces.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-113858681.jpg,,,2026-01-26 07:57:44.827014

ORLANDO, Fla. — Texas supplied the most new residents of any U.S. state for Mississippi and eight other states, despite having the biggest population growth this decade, according to newly released figures from the U.S. Census Bureau.
Texas was the top source of new residents for Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Illinois, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico and Oklahoma, according to the 2024 state-to-state migration flows, which track where someone lived in the previous year and where they currently live. The Census Bureau released the numbers last week.
With 31 million residents, Texas ranks second in population among U.S. states. Between 2020 and 2024, Texas gained 2.1 million people.
“The obvious and primary answer is size,” said Dudley Poston, professor emeritus of sociology at Texas A&M University. “There’s got to be more people leaving Texas than leaving other states because of the population size of Texas.”
Thousands of Mississippians are also migrating to Texas. Roughly 5,500 people moved from Hinds County, Mississippi, to the Lone Star State from 2017 to 2022, according to Internal Revenue Service data analyzed by researcher Jake McGraw at Rethink Mississippi. McGraw, who conducted the analysis for Mississippi Today, said Dallas and Houston were the top destinations for the relocating Mississippians. 
Other large producers of residents who moved to other states included the nation’s other most populous states: California, Florida and New York.
California, the most populous U.S. state with 39 million residents, supplied the most new residents to the western states of Arizona, Hawaii, Nevada, Oregon, Texas and Washington. But it also was the top supplier of domestic residents to Tennessee, home to Nashville, which has established a pipeline to Southern California’s entertainment industry.
Florida, the third most populous U.S. state with 23 million residents, dominated the number of new residents in the southeast states of Alabama, Georgia and North Carolina but also Ohio. Florida has gained 1.8 million residents this decade, the second most of any state.
Although the Sunshine State’s size played a primary role, other factors may be involved too, such as Florida’s escalating real estate and homeowners’ insurance prices and the more plentiful job opportunities for recent college graduates in cities like Atlanta and Charlotte, according to Richard Doty, a research demographer at the University of Florida.
“It is no longer as affordable a relocation/ retirement option as it once was,” Doty said in an email.
New York was the top source of new residents in Connecticut, Florida, Massachusetts and New Jersey, while Illinois provided the most new residents for Midwestern neighbors Indiana, Iowa and Wisconsin.
“The states with the largest out-migration numbers — California, Florida, Texas, and New York — are also the states with the largest populations. That’s not a coincidence,” said Helen You, interim director of the Texas Demographic Center. “Large populations naturally generate large volumes of both in-and-out migrants.”
Some migration patterns were no real surprises, such as former Massachusetts residents being the biggest source of new Mainers, New Hampshirites, Rhode Islanders and Vermonters. Former Wisconsinites made up the largest number of new Minnesotans, and former North Carolinians were the biggest source of new South Carolina residents.
In most states in 2024, before the immigration crackdown of the second Trump administration, people arriving from a foreign country were the top source of new residents. Among the exceptions, where international migration wasn’t large compared to people moving from individual U.S. states, were Idaho, Kansas, Montana, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/23182418/AP26022521514192.jpg,,,2026-01-26 07:57:44.827014

(Photo by Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)Majority Democrats in the state Legislature are pushing changes they say will restore integrity to Washington’s venerable initiative process.
Opponents contend the moves will effectively block residents’ direct path to the ballot to pass laws of their own making.
Bills introduced in the House and Senate would bar paying a person for each signature they collect. And they would allow legal action against those suspected of violations.
The legislation also would add a new step at the front end of the process by requiring a person, at the time they fill out paperwork and pay the fee for an initiative, to also submit signatures of 1,000 registered voters as a show of support for a proposed measure. 
The debate, which played out in Senate and House committees last week, appears to be a byproduct of Democrats’ and their allies’ vexation with Let’s Go Washington and its multi-millionaire founder Brian Heywood.
Two years ago, the conservative political group, largely underwritten with Heywood’s money, sent six initiatives to the Legislature, each aiming to repeal or revise a major policy enacted into law by Democrats over the objections of Republicans.
Two more dealing with parental rights and transgender athletes are on track to reach the ballot this year. Democratic leaders say they won’t hold hearings on this year’s measures.
Sen. Javier Valdez, D-Seattle, said he drew up Senate Bill 5973 out of concern that this form of direct democracy has been co-opted by big money interests.
“Anyone with enough money to bankroll their way through the initiative qualifying process can force statewide votes on any issue that’s personal to them,” he said at a hearing on the bill in the Senate Committee on State Government, Tribal Affairs and Elections. Valdez is the committee chair.
The allure of making money for each signature incentivizes gatherers to use “aggressive, misleading tactics” to pad their totals to boost their compensation, he said.
Rep. Sharlett Mena, D-Tacoma, sponsor of the House legislation, said initiatives are a powerful tool of the citizenry and the bill is about making the initiative process “more perfect.” 
“It is more important to me that the initiative process remains accessible to members of the community to exercise their power and their voice,” she said at a public hearing of the House State Government and Tribal Relations Committee that she chairs. 
Former Secretary of State Sam Reed, a Republican, denounced the legislation as a “voter suppression bill.” 
“It’s an attempt to make it even more difficult for citizens to participate in the government process. You’re doing this because you think there’s fraud? Frankly, you’re wrong,” he said.
Secretary of State Steve Hobbs, a Democrat, opposes the legislation, saying it would further burden those pursuing an initiative.
He told lawmakers he’s responded to concerns about frivolous filings with steps like hiking the fee to $156 from $5. If there’s concern with misbehaving signature gatherers, increase penalties for breaking the law, he said.
On Friday, the Senate committee advanced Valdez’s bill on a 4-3 party-line vote. Before the vote, they removed the requirement for 1,000 signatures for referendums, which send bills approved by the Legislature to the ballot.
Republican senators offered 12 amendments, most seeking to remove the requirement for pre-filed signatures or prescribe limits on citizens taking legal action over alleged violations. They did not oppose the ban on paying by signature. Democrats rejected them all.
“Basically, I hate this bill with a passion,” said Sen. Phil Fortunato, R-Auburn, author of half the amendments.
Sen. Bob Hasegawa, D-Tukwila, teetered but said that while he didn’t like the mandate for providing 1,000 signatures upfront, removing the potential issues created with the pay-per-signature method needs addressing.
“I hate raising barriers to the (initiative) process but I think getting money out of politics is the most important thing right now,” he said, before voting for the bill.
Let’s Go Washington’s Heywood told the Senate panel that because Democrats have been unable to deter or derail the group’s endeavors, they came up with this bill to “destroy the process.”
There’s no evidence of fraud with signature-gatherers, he said. “We have no incentive to pay for invalid signatures because it’s wasted money.”
House Bill 2259, sponsored by Mena, received a hearing last Wednesday. No date for a committee vote has been announced.
Checking addresses
This isn’t the only Democrat-sponsored bill targeting the initiative process.
House Bill 2260 would add a requirement for individuals gathering signatures to sign each petition they submit.
It also directs the Secretary of State’s Office to verify that the residence address listed by the person signing a petition matches the address on their voter registration. Adding this chore will nearly halve the number of signatures verified per hour, according to the secretary of state.
At a hearing Wednesday, supporters said the bill will provide much-needed accountability for signature collection. Opponents, including Hobbs and Reed, said it could lead to petitions getting tossed out simply because a legal voter moved at some point after signing.
As part of the verification process, the state does a 3% random sample of submitted signatures for accuracy. Address verification would be added to that process, so not every submitted signature will need to be checked.
A fiscal analysis projects it will cost $3 million this budget and $4.78 million in future bienniums to pay for added staff and equipment.
This bill has not been scheduled for a committee vote and there is currently no companion bill in the Senate.
Hundreds of thousands of signatures are required to qualify either an initiative to the Legislature or one for the ballot. Work is now underway to verify signatures and certify two Let’s Go Washington-sponsored measures for this fall’s election. 
Supporters turned in 30,717 pages of petitions containing 418,666 signatures for IL26-001 focused on parental rights, the secretary of state’s office reported. There were 32,078 pages and 444,434 signatures for IL26-638 to bar transgender athletes from girls’ sports. 
On Thursday, the secretary of state notified lawmakers that certification of the latter measure was done.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Heywood-Hobbs-Reed-1-1024x764.jpg,,,2026-01-26 07:57:44.827014

But the 10-member caucus appears to have coalesced around a simple two-pronged strategy: absolute opposition to increasing the sales tax and a willingness to slow the Senate to a crawl (Getty Images).Let’s talk about how the first three weeks of Missouri’s legislative session are going.
In short: Gridlock in the Senate. Scandal in the House.
Senate Democrats entered the year divided after a contentious leadership fight. But the 10-member caucus appears to have coalesced around a simple two-pronged strategy: absolute opposition to increasing the sales tax and a willingness to slow the Senate to a crawl.
Normally, opposing tax increases would put Democrats squarely on Republican turf. This year, it’s the Republican governor pushing a plan that would move Missouri away from income taxes and toward higher sales taxes — a change Democrats argue would shift the tax burden onto the working poor.
Democrats have also taken aim at the Senate’s pace. So far, they have delayed the only official business the chamber has attempted this year, twice filibustering to block votes on gubernatorial appointments.
Part of the obstruction is payback. Last year, Republicans invoked a rarely used rule four times to cut off debate and push through bills repealing expanded paid sick leave, gerrymandering the state’s congressional map, changing the initiative petition process, and reimposing an abortion ban.
But Democrats are also using the gridlock to argue that the GOP supermajority has been moving too fast and making costly mistakes. A handful of examples have become staples of Democratic filibusters.
A wildly inaccurate cost estimate for legislation eliminating the capital gains tax. A Kansas City precinct placed in two different congressional districts in the gerrymandered map. A $250 million mistake in state budget estimates released earlier this month. Drafting errors in two different income tax cut proposals.
What happens next? If Democrats don’t stand down, the nominees will either have to be withdrawn by early next month or face being barred from holding those appointments for life.
Republicans aren’t naïve. They knew a smooth session was unlikely after last year. How they choose to break the logjam remains an open question.
Meanwhile, in the Missouri House, an overwhelming bipartisan majority voted last week to punish Democratic state Rep. Jeremy Dean for obscene text messages he sent to Republican Rep. Cecelie Williams.
Only 10 Democrats voted against sanctions: Doug Clemons, Aaron Crossley, Anthony Ealy, Elizabeth Fuchs, Jeff Hales, Kerri Ingle, Ian Mackey, Ray Reed, Del Taylor and Wick Thomas.
The punishment includes removal from committees, mandatory sexual harassment training and a requirement that Dean stay at least 50 feet away from Williams.
In a short speech before the vote, Williams said the sanctions did not go far enough, noting that at any other job “a message like that would be grounds for immediate termination, no questions asked.”
Dean, she said, targeted her despite knowing her history as a domestic abuse survivor. His apology was half-hearted, deflective and lacked true accountability.
“He knew my story, he knew my past, he knew my pain and he chose to exploit it anyway,” Williams said.
In the days leading up to the vote, there was talk that some GOP lawmakers would push for expulsion. But Republican leadership quietly worked behind the scenes to tamp that down.
Expulsion is rare in Missouri’s legislature, reserved for extraordinary circumstances, such as after the Civil War for disloyalty to the Union and, in 2021, for credible allegations of sexual and physical abuse of children.
Concerns about escalation also played a role. Push for expulsion, and Democrats might start scrolling through their phones and sharing messages they’ve received from GOP lawmakers.
The logic of mutually assured destruction, it seems, was enough to end any serious talk of expulsion.

Children’s Division, the section of the state’s social services department responsible for foster care and investigating child abuse and neglect, has also had seven directors since 2018 — and during that time faced intense scrutiny from state lawmakers for failing to report missing foster children and boarding foster children in hospitals because there was nowhere else for them to go.
As Gov. Mike Kehoe proposes cutting $600 million in general revenue expenditures to address a dwindling surplus and declining revenues, the Missouri Department of Social Services is not seeking funding for additional Children’s Division staff from state lawmakers.
“Our current focus is maximizing the resources we have — ensuring team members are supported, cases are managed effectively and staff have the tools they need to perform their jobs well,” said department spokesperson Baylee Watts in an email to The Independent.
The department requested, and Kehoe recommended, the same number of full time equivalent positions for division field staff in fiscal year 2027 as it received for the current fiscal year.
Meanwhile, state lawmakers have filed an array of bills designed to address what they say are lingering problems in the division. While the sponsors of those bills hesitated to recommend additional spending, other lawmakers and advocates cautioned against imposing standards that the division might not be able to meet without more frontline workers.
 Staffing challenges

Former caseworkers who spoke with The Independent in 2022 reported having up to 80 active cases — a workload that contributed to their decisions to leave the division. One former caseworker described the job as “impossible” and said that during the three years she spent training new caseworkers, most quit within four months.
Democratic State Rep. Keri Ingle of Lee’s Summit, a former Children’s Division investigator, said “there is nothing more stressful” than carrying the responsibility of a child’s safety and wondering if you missed something important when visiting a child’s home.
Investigators are required to make contact with a child within 24 hours of a hotline report of possible abuse or neglect.
“You’ll wake up at one o’clock in the morning and think, ‘I should have looked in that room’…or, ‘I’ve got to go make a phone call,’ or ‘I’ve got to go run out at seven o’clock in the morning and try to find this other kid,” Ingle said.
Staff turnover rates have improved in both the division and the wider department, though frontline staff continue to be the most likely to leave. 
Throughout the department, turnover stood at 30% at the end of fiscal year 2025, Watts said in an email to The Independent. The turnover rate in September 2022 was 35%.
‘This job is impossible’: High turnover, low morale plague Missouri child welfare agency

 
Turnover among frontline division staff, which include investigators, foster care case managers and hotline workers, was 40% at the end of fiscal year 2025. That’s down from 55% in September 2022. But it still means over a third of frontline staff working in the division at the beginning of the last fiscal year were gone a year later. 
Lawmakers last year approved a 1% pay increase for Children’s Division workers, on top of Kehoe’s plan giving state workers a 1% pay raise for every two years of service. 
Watts said the department is using savings from past vacancies in the division to establish specialized investigator positions with higher salaries. Watts said the positions “help reduce overall workload for frontline team members while offering additional support on challenging cases.”
There were 79 vacancies across the division as of the end of November, Watts said.
But entry-level salaries for frontline workers are still low. The starting salary for an associate social services specialist in the division is $44,630 and $48,509 for a social services specialist, Watts said.
 Proposed solutions

Some lawmakers don’t think these efforts are enough.
Republican state Rep. Ann Kelley of Lamar said that throughout her tenure on the House Children and Families Committee, she’s found it’s not uncommon for division workers to have 30 to 40 open cases. 
“That is just insane,” Kelley said in an interview with The Independent. “They can’t handle that. You cannot give the amount of care, the [necessary] amount of time to a child when you have that many cases.”
A bill filed by Kelley would limit division case workers to 20 active cases at a time.
Current caseload data was not immediately available from the department. But quarterly reports from the department show that the division is falling short of some of its own standards of service to kids and parents in the child welfare system.
Division policy requires that parents have at least one visit per month with their child in the division’s care, unless a court prohibits meetings. An evaluation team established after the passage of a 2020 state law on foster care set a goal of each county complying with this policy 60% of the time. Between April and June 2025, no more than 6% of counties met this goal, according to an October 2025 report.
The division also struggled to meet policies of one meeting per month between caseworkers and each of a child’s parents. Between July and September 2025, no more than 38% of counties met a goal of adhering to this policy 50% of the time, according to a January report.
Kelley said that addressing high caseloads would require the division to hire more staff.
“They’re going to have to hire more people,” Kelley said. “That’s just what they’re going to have to do.”
Kelley said that although lawmakers and the state’s social services department should explore options that would not require additional appropriations, lowering caseloads would likely mean setting aside money for additional hires.
“Yes, it’s going to be an issue,” Kelley said of the need for additional funding. “But for so long, we have passed it down, passed the buck, and nothing has changed. And so we’ve got to put money where our mouth is because everybody admits that there is a problem.”
Ingle said that while she agrees that there should be a caseload cap for caseworkers, lawmakers must also provide the division with resources to make that cap feasible.
“What do we do after the cap is met?” Ingle said. “That doesn’t [allow us to say], ‘We’re not going to put any more kids in foster care,’ or ‘We’re not going to do any more investigations.’ It just doesn’t work like that.”
Missouri child welfare agency reports increased efforts to find missing foster kids

Jessica Seitz, executive director of the Missouri Network Against Child Abuse, said that while her organization supports accountability for the division around caseloads, 20 cases is an “unrealistic expectation.”
Rather than putting a specific number in statute, Seitz suggested a requirement that the division adhere to national accreditation standards set by the Child Welfare League of America and report to the legislature annually on its ability to meet those standards.
State Rep. Holly Jones, a Eureka Republican who chairs the House Children and Families Committee, said that lawmakers “really need to look at our case managers and the workload that is put on them.”
Jones is sponsoring a bill that would require courts to order additional parenting time to make up for time a parent lost with their child due to an unsubstantiated child abuse or neglect investigation.
Kelley is also sponsoring bills that would require caseworker training for youth aging out of the foster care system and mandate guardians ad litem to talk with children they represent before important hearings to determine custody, visitation rights or support. 
Under a bill sponsored by Republican state Rep. Melissa Schmidt of Eldridge, the division would have to ensure that a child taken into its custody receives a physical examination within 72 hours rather than 30 days.
Between July and September 2025, the division met the current standard of 30 days in no more than 42% of Missouri counties, according to a January report.
Ingle emphasized the importance of adequate funding and staff to equip the division to provide quality services.
“I have not heard of any concerns specifically related to policy that wouldn’t be addressed by addressing pay and [staffing levels],” she said.
And Ingle said that if Missouri lawmakers truly value child welfare and the work of division staff, state spending should reflect that.

Critics say changes could ripple outward — delaying bills, legal mail, prescriptions and mail-in ballots

The U.S. Postal Service in Vermont has quietly implemented changes to the way mail is processed that are expected to further slow down the delivery speed of many mail categories for Vermonters. 
Vermont is the latest region to join Regional Transportation Optimization, a new strategy that ends evening collection of mail that’s more than 50 miles away from regional mail centers. 
Last week, a postal service spokesperson did not answer questions about when the new program was expected to come to Vermont. But on Jan. 16, the postal service filed data in response to questions from the U.S. Postal Regulatory Commission that shows the program has already been implemented in every zip code in the state.

Regional Transportation Optimization is one part of the Delivering for America plan, a years-long strategy of service cuts and other changes that began in 2021 under former Postmaster Louis DeJoy. 
The postal service has said the plan is essential for making its operations efficient and financially self-sustaining. But critics of the program say there’s been a lack of transparency in how the plan could affect the speed and quality of service throughout the country. 
Steve Hutkins, an advocate who runs the Save the Post Office website, said there have been no signs at post offices or other notices to customers letting them know that their mail will be sitting at the back of the post office overnight. 
“The Postal Service doesn’t want the public to pay any attention to this change in its transportation policies and the slower service standards (delivery times) that the change is causing,” Hutkins said via email. 
Postmarks now could be applied to mail a day later than customers expected — meaning that a bill payment could be considered past due, or even a mail-in ballot could be disqualified, Hutkins said. 
How does Regional Transportation Optimization work?
The closest regional processing center for Vermont isn’t in Vermont. It’s in Springfield, Massachusetts, more than 40 miles from the state border, Hutkins said. 
Previously, the postal service would send postal trucks to post offices twice per day – once in the morning, the other in the evening – to pick up mail and bring it to Springfield, Amy Gibbs, a strategic communications specialist for USPS, said via email. The new plan eliminates that second pickup, meaning that any mail that arrives at the post office after the morning pickup will stay at the post office until the following day. 
The postal service has published a map revealing the effect of this change, Hutkins said. For first-class mail, USPS has shifted many parts of Vermont from a two-day service standard to a three-day service standard, and it can take up to five days to reach other parts of the country. 
There are some exceptions, Hutkins said. Local mail in places close to Vermont’s two Local Processing Centers, located in Burlington and White River Junction, could still go to those facilities and be processed more quickly than mail going to Springfield. The postal service proposed closing the two local centers in 2024, but abandoned the plan after political pushback. 
The one-day additional delays in local deliveries come as USPS is also redefining the postmark. On December 24, 2025, the postal service changed its rules to clarify that the postmark does not “inherently or necessarily align with the date” that the piece of mail came to the postal service. 
One key concern for opponents is how both these changes could combine to affect mail-in ballots, since election officials often rely on postmarks to determine whether a ballot was received on Election Day. On January 15, 16 U.S. senators sent a letter to USPS expressing fear that this change could mean more mail-in ballots being rejected. 
In an email, USPS spokesperson Gibbs said the new postmark system does not “signal a change in postmarking procedures,” but only tries to “improve public understanding of the information postmarks convey.” 
Hutkins, a retired New York University professor, began Save the Post Office in 2011 when he learned his local post office was threatened with closure. 
How would he describe the last 15 years for the post office? 
“It’s been: Things get worse slowly, you adjust to it as things go by, and it all gets slower than it used to be,” he said. 
Much of that slowdown has been pinned to former U.S. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy. When DeJoy resigned in February 2025, U.S. Senator Peter Welch issued a statement that said “Good riddance.” 
“DeJoy’s restructuring plan has led to unacceptable mail delivery delays across Vermont, especially in rural areas of the state,” Welch said in the statement. 
Yet it remains to be seen what next steps the newly appointed Postmaster General David Steiner will take, Hutkins said. Before his appointment, Steiner served on the board of FedEx, one of USPS’ top competitors, for over a decade. 
Have these changes had an effect on on-time performance? The postal service’s own dashboard shows hardly any change to the percent of first-class mail, the cheapest category of mail for letters, postcards and envelopes, that has arrived within service standards in the Vermont-New Hampshire-Maine region. But Hutkins noted that the standards themselves have changed, making it hard to draw conclusions from the limited data available. 
For some Vermont communities, staffing levels at the post office appears to be a key reason for delays. Montpelier residents have complained about delayed mail and packages in recent weeks when four postal routes were left vacant by a staffing shortage. 
Hutkins said that the overall level of postal workers hasn’t changed much over the years, but retaining part-time workers has been a longstanding challenge. He cited a 2016 USPS report that found the annual turnover rate for non-career employees was over 40%. 
“It’s a really hard job,” he said.
Elizabeth Newman of Hinesburg said that her mail delivery has improved since 2023 and 2024, when she was only getting mail just once a week. But even now, a single mail carrier getting sick seems to lead to all the mail in town coming to a halt. 
She said she’s one of many people in town who have switched to paying her bills online whenever she can. 
“Regularly, we were having to call our credit card companies, and they hadn’t received stuff or it was delayed,” she said. 
Regarding the potential effects of the regional transport and postmark plan, she said it was hard for the average customer to understand because the postal service was like a “black box” of information. 
“You can never find out what happened or why,” she said.

Introduced by Rep. Bishop Davidson, a Republican from Republic, the legislation would require all students to participate in a minimum of 60 minutes of physical activity each school day. PE classes, additional recesses and other supervised physical activities could fulfill the new requirement, as outlined by the bill.
The bill does include caveats for students with disabilities.
Student-athletes, who are occasionally excused from physical education requirements, would not be exempt from the required 60 minutes of daily activity under the bill.
Legislators expressed concerns over the bill’s logistics — an additional hour of required learning could disrupt or extend the current school schedule. Davidson told a House committee Wednesday that he does not intend for the bill to add more time to the school day or detract from other Common Core curriculum requirements.
Haley Edwards, a senior at Republic High School in Greene County, testified in favor of the bill.
“We see the signs that tie (exercise) back to physical well-being and mental well-being, and I think that this bill really opens doors to be able to see those effects,” Edwards said.
The National Education Association has not yet determined whether legislative action is necessary to enact the proposed requirement, but a spokesman said the organization believes that increased physical activity would benefit students.
Otto Fajan, who testified on behalf of the NEA, said that the role of physical education has shrunk over the past century in American public schools.
“There’s a flow against (P.E.) caused by the structure of accountability,” Fagen said, “and standardized testing in areas that do not include physical literacy.”

(File photo by Mary Ann Chastain/ Special to The Dailey Gazette)COLUMBIA — A Richland County legislator running for governor will give the Democratic response to Gov. Henry McMaster’s final State of the State address.
Rep. Jermaine Johnson was chosen by the state House Democratic Caucus to deliver the message for his party, his campaign announced in a release Monday morning.
McMaster is scheduled to give his ninth and last State of the State before a joint assembly of the Legislature in House chambers at 7 p.m. Wednesday.
The state’s longest-serving elected governor will lay out his priorities for the 2026 legislative session that started two weeks ago. He’ll also highlight what he considers his administration’s successes for South Carolina and point to initiatives he wants legislators to continue after he leaves office. The Republican governor first ascended to the job in January 2017 when then-Gov. Nikki Haley left to join President Donald Trump’s first administration.

Johnson is among two Democrats who have announced bids to replace McMaster. Charleston attorney Mullins McLeod is also running.
Regardless of the outcome of the governor’s race, Johnson isn’t returning to the Legislature next year. South Carolina law allows candidates to seek more than one office at a time. They just can’t occupy more than one if they win.
But Johnson announced earlier this month that he’s not seeking a fourth term to the House so he can focus on his bid for governor.
It won’t be the first time a Democratic gubernatorial candidate was chosen to lay out Democrats’ vision in an election year.
In 2018, then-state Rep. James Smith of Columbia gave the Democratic response to McMaster’s first State of the State address. McMaster defeated Smith by 8 percentage points that November to win his first elected term as governor. In South Carolina, governors are limited to two elected terms.

But just how much is difficult to know. 
An internal budget document suggests that the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare doesn’t know if the governor’s proposed $22 million cuts would create “new potential costs.” And those cuts could also result in the state losing over $100 million dollars in federal matching funds that Idaho Medicaid would get. 
But on Thursday, Idaho’s top Medicaid official made it clear: The state’s public assistance program doesn’t have capacity to project how much cuts could spur new costs — unless it is directed to.

“But I also don’t want to imply that more staff would solve the problem,” Idaho Medicaid Deputy Director Sasha O’Connell told the Legislature’s Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, or JFAC. “Because I think that it’s also just an issue of not being able to predict some of these changes.”
Forecasting with big changes always carries risk, she added. The state’s estimate for Medicaid’s future budget needs often turn out wrong, she said, in part because the state projects the program’s costs well over a year before the next given fiscal year actually concludes. 
The admission comes while the Idaho Legislature grapples with which Medicaid services to possibly cut, as lawmakers brace for spending reductions after years of tax cuts. 
But some ripple effects of Medicaid cuts are already baked into the governor’s budget proposal. That’s because for every dollar in general funds Idaho pays for Medicaid, the federal government chips in at least twice as much.

 If Idaho cuts state Medicaid funding, it could lose federal funds

If Idaho cuts its spending on Medicaid, that means the state could forgo an even higher amount of federal matching dollars.

Next fiscal year, Idaho Gov. Brad Little’s proposed $45 million in Medicaid cuts would leave the state with nearly $106.8 million less federal funds, according to the Legislative Budget Book, which is produced by Legislative Services’ Office. His Medicaid plan for next year would extend cuts to doctor pay rates, and potentially cut other services like dental coverage and disability services. 
This year, Little’s cuts to doctor pay rates – set to save the state $17.2 million — would leave the state with $44.2 less federal funding. 
In 2023, the Department of Health and Welfare estimated repealing Medicaid expansion – a proposal some in GOP legislative leadership said they would consider this year – would cost the state $78 million more. 
Before the legislative session, Little cautioned that repealing expansion would spark unintended consequences. 
He also said the Department of Health and Welfare was working to figure out the true cost of repeal. It isn’t immediately clear when or if that analysis will be done. 
But in JFAC, O’Connell, the Idaho Medicaid director, highlighted a few costs the state could face if it repealed Medicaid expansion: 

Losing $38 million in revenue from a tax on hospitals, because the rate hospitals pay is based on how many Medicaid enrollees they serve. 
Driving up costs by around $20 million for state hospitals, where some services would shift from being largely federally funded back to state funded. (The federal government pays 90% of costs of Medicaid expansion.)




 Health and Welfare exempted several services from provider reimbursement rate cuts

According to the Legislative Budget Book, the Department of Health and Welfare, following a federally required review, exempted the following services from reimbursement rate cuts:

Home and community-based services, which includes certified family homes and personal care services
School-based services
Tribal providers
Federally Qualified Health Centers’ and Rural Health Centers’ final encounter rate payments
Services funded by the Idaho Home Choice grant
State-owned facilities
Hospice
And pharmacy ingredient cost




 Patients, providers turn out to oppose cuts

As lawmakers mulled the Department of Health and Welfare’s budget Thursday, advocates visited the Capitol to try to protect Medicaid services. 
Julie McConnel, a mom to 10-year old twin boys with Down syndrome, came from Nampa. She said her sons rely on a range of Medicaid services that have improved their lives – including home and community-based services, which is on Little’s list of Medicaid cut options.
Some specialists her sons see have a long wait list, and she worries that cutting their pay rates would make it even harder to get in.
“Where they are now in life is so much due to the early interventions they received for Medicaid — whether it’s general medical expenses or home and community based-services,” she said in an interview outside JFAC’s meeting room. 
Records detail Idaho Medicaid services that could be cut, but not ‘potential new costs’

Sara Bergsma owns a speech therapy clinic in Meridian called We are Better Together. She said providers are still figuring out how to navigate the state’s recent cap of speech therapy at 20 visits a year, which requires prior authorization for any more visits. 
But what worries her more is the prospect of the service being entirely cut — since it was on Little’s list for Medicaid cut options. 
“I don’t know how these clinics will stay open,” Bergsma said in an interview. “They won’t be able to take Medicaid, or they will have to close their doors if that’s the only source of income or the majority of their source of income.”
 Lawmakers mull where to cut Idaho Medicaid

In JFAC, Sen. Carl Bjerke, a Republican from Coeur d’Alene, said he’s received up to 1,000 emails from the public about Medicaid cuts. And he talked about how he was wrangling with how to cut more.
He said he wants money in Medicaid to go to “the people who are the most vulnerable.”

“I can give you many reasons why adult dental is good,” Bjerke said.
But, he said, “if I had to make a decision right here, as we’re making decisions on budgets, whether I’m going to support adult dental or taking care of a single mom taking care of a … severely autistic child, I’m going to weigh on the severely autistic child.”
Sen. Melissa Wintrow, a Boise Democrat, advocated for hearing public testimony from people affected by cuts. 
And she said lawmakers shouldn’t even be in this position.
“We’ve cut revenue too hard. And I would rather look for ways we can put revenue back, so we don’t have to make decisions on these kinds of things – like who deserves it and who doesn’t,” she said. “We’re really picking winners and losers here. And it doesn’t feel good.”
Rep. Chris Bruce, a Republican from Kuna, told lawmakers that they may not be hearing from some taxpayers.
“I’d also like to remind everyone of folks who maybe are working multiple jobs, who do not have insurance for themselves, who are just paying their taxes,” he said. “We need to remember those people who are making these decisions, and not just focus on the calls that we get all the time.”

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A legislative proposal could be one of the last hurdles facing an $800 million deal meant to leave the University of Nebraska the sole owner of Nebraska Medicine, and the bill appears to be gaining traction after a restructuring late last week of the nonprofit’s board.
Legislative Bill 1125, from State Sen. Tony Sorrentino of the Elkhorn area, would require legislative approval before NU could acquire a controlling or sole interest in any hospital or health care facility valued at more than $100 million. That could include the planned deal for NU to assume sole ownership of Nebraska Medicine from its longtime partner, Clarkson Regional Health Services, which wants out.
“I think we need some review, and we’re not trying to do or undo the transaction,” Sorrentino told the Nebraska Examiner.

The bill has gotten more attention after NU and Clarkson announced Thursday that they were immediately changing the Nebraska Medicine Board of Directors, kicking off nearly all members and appointing a few new voting members from NU and Clarkson who are explicitly friendly to the ownership change.
“They took what I consider a nuclear action and blew the whole deal up,” State Sen. Brad von Gillern of the Elkhorn area said Friday.
Of Sorrentino’s bill, von Gillern said: “It is far more interesting today than it was yesterday.”
‘Incredibly short-sighted’
Von Gillern said he was “really disappointed” in the Thursday board shakeup. He had led more than 30 of his colleagues to ask Jan. 8 that regents take more time to review before voting. The vote was delayed one week, to Jan. 15, partly because of lawmakers’ recommendations.

On Jan. 14, NU and the former Nebraska Medicine board, which organized opposition to the deal, also made separate in-person last stands to lawmakers. Clarkson joined NU at its forum.
Among the pleas was one from the then-Nebraska Medicine board chair, Lance Fritz, for lawmakers to consider stepping in, an action NU says is unnecessary.
Von Gillern said the competing forums were meant to encourage a “deeper level” of conversation and engagement between the organizations. And while he says he has “no reason to doubt NU’s or Clarkson’s authority to change the board, he still worries about the fallout.
“I think it was incredibly short-sighted, from a corporate-citizenship standpoint, from recognizing the level of engagement by the civic community in Omaha and philanthropy,” von Gillern said.
‘Nobody likes surprises’
The NU Board of Regents, at its Jan. 15 meeting, unanimously authorized the transaction. Regents anticipate it will “close” by June 30, barring any other changes or roadblocks. NU agreed to pay Clarkson $500 million for its 50% share of Nebraska Medicine and $300 million for related properties.
In return, Clarkson would donate $200 million back to NU for “Project Health,” a $2.19 billion endeavor to build up the next generation of health care.
Less than 24 hours after the unanimous vote, the Nebraska Medicine board, under its previous leadership, filed a lawsuit in Douglas County to try to stop the deal. The suit argues that the parent organizations had not followed the law and left the former Nebraska Medicine board members out of necessary negotiations, including exploring possible alternatives.
State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston, a former hospital administrator, said he was skeptical Clarkson would leave Nebraska. He pointed to Fritz’s leadership, a former CEO and president of Union Pacific, as one reason why philanthropy in Omaha could be energized to step in. 
Fritz had told lawmakers at least one philanthropist in Omaha might be interested.

Riepe said for the size of the NU-Clarkson deal, it needed a lot more communication, “maybe even up to the point of a year that says, ‘This is what’s being considered.’” The proposal was announced Jan. 2. Nondisclosure agreements went back to July 2024.
“Nobody likes surprises, and I think this was a surprise,” Riepe said of the deal. “A big surprise.”
Part of the reason for the quick action was concern about whether Clarkson might try to sell to an out-of-state or for-profit corporation. The university’s exclusive window for negotiations would have ended after Jan. 15, regents said.
As a fail safe, Sorrentino’s bill would also prohibit any hospital or academic health center that serves as the primary affiliate of UNMC — in this case, Clarkson — from selling all or part of its share to an out-of-state or for-profit entity, unless the state attorney general, in consultation with the NU Board of Regents, determines such changes are “in the public interest.”
Riepe said that in his experience, projects that don’t start well often don’t end well. He hopes that isn’t the case for the Nebraska Medicine changes.
Nonprofit board shakeup
NU and Clarkson on Thursday said the board restructuring came after “careful review” and as the owners had “serious concerns about recent actions and behavior” by board members. The two organizations also described the legal action as “extraordinary.”

The board restructuring could end the lawsuit, as the board’s now-four voting members include NU President Dr. Jeffrey Gold, interim University of Nebraska Medical Center Chancellor Dr. Dele Davies and Clarkson CEO Dr. Bill Lydiatt. All three have explicitly endorsed the transaction.
Those NU and Clarkson leaders are now, in effect, suing themselves. As of Friday afternoon, no additional legal motions had been filed in Douglas County District Court.
Should lawmakers get involved?
While von Gillern and Sorrentino want to have a deeper conversation, not all lawmakers are convinced the Legislature should get involved.
State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln, now in her 12th year as a state legislator, said she had been monitoring statements from NU, the former Nebraska Medicine board and Clarkson. She said that “like most challenging issues in public life,” each had good points.
“But I think, at the end of the day, where I am, is that I just don’t see a legislative issue or role in regards to resolution of this matter for a variety of different reasons,” Conrad said.
State Sens. Merv Riepe of Ralston and Danielle Conrad of Lincoln. April 22, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
She and Riepe both pointed to a 1977 Nebraska Supreme Court case, named after former Gov. Jim Exon, in which the high court limited how much political influence the Legislature can exert over NU because the Nebraska Constitution gives that general governing power to the NU Board of Regents.
Said Riepe: “I don’t think that we need to put in another level of discussions that take a lot more time and a lot more fuss and everything else.”
In a statement to the Examiner, the regents said their action to acquire Clarkson’s share of Nebraska Medicine “is well within the bounds of the long-established constitutional powers” of the regents and that the board acted in “good faith” at the “opportunity” that Clarkson offered.
“We will continue to move forward in the best interest of the university, Nebraska Medicine and the students, patients and Nebraskans we serve,” the regents’ statement reads. “We believe this is best achieved without legislation.”
A Clarkson spokesperson said their organization was still reviewing Sorrentino’s bill. Nebraska Medicine declined to comment Friday.
‘Cooler heads could prevail’
Sorrentino’s bill has been sent to the Legislature’s Executive Board, chaired by State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair. Hansen said Thursday’s shakeup “set a few hairs on fire” and that while lawmakers might have wanted to wait, Sorrentino’s bill might come for a hearing sooner.

Hansen said lawmakers planned to take a “breath” over the weekend and decide on scheduling soon.
While the transaction heads to “closing,” Sorrentino said he still thinks his bill could have an impact. He said the Legislature “probably owes taxpayers at least a review,” noting the price tag of the deal mirrors what state legislators have appropriated in baseline state tax dollars to NU.
“I wished that cooler heads could prevail and we could discuss this,” Sorrentino said Friday.

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – Alligators could be raised as pets and for food under an Oklahoma bill pending before lawmakers.
Senate Bill 2087, by Sen. Jonathan Wingard, R-Ada,  would allow the raising of alligators hatched from eggs in captivity without a permit.
Currently, a permit and written permission from the director of the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation are required to own an alligator, said Wade Farrar, assistant chief of law enforcement for the agency. 
Most permits issued are for alligators in zoos, he said.
He did not have numbers of how many licenses had been issued.
The state Department of Wildlife said alligators mate around June each year, and lay 20 to 30 eggs. The Oklahoma City Zoo reports that American alligators live an average of 35 to 50 years and are naturally found in Southeastern Oklahoma.
“What I’m looking at and working on is there has been some interest expressed in the food production side of this, allowing meat processing plants to raise alligators to be able to have for slaughter,” Wingard said.
He said the measure was a constituent request, and he is trying to determine if there is a market in Oklahoma for alligator meat. Alligator skin could also be sold, he said.
He said the bill he wrote is incomplete, but he needed to get something filed as a placeholder before the bill filing deadline.
The way the measure is currently written, it would allow for individuals to raise alligators as pets as long as the animal wasn’t taken from the wild, he said.
He said the measure has generated some controversy.
“At this time, it is an incomplete bill with incomplete language, so if it does move forward, there will be more put in as guardrails and protections and it would be narrowed up before it ever would even be considered,” Wingard said.
The measure directs the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation to create rules to implement it.

As they crossed the Fox River, marchers formed a line longer than the Ray Nitschke Memorial Bridge, which crosses the Fox River. 
“The only people who can defend us is us,” Daniel Castillo, a member of the Green Bay Anti-War Committee, told the crowd.

After he was shot by federal agents, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called Pretti a “domestic terrorist,” and Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino said Pretti, who was carrying a registered handgun when six Border Patrol agents tackled him, but did unholster it, appeared eager to inflict “maximum damage” on assembled federal agents. Videos taken at the scene, showing Pretti holding a cellphone camera, not a gun, and trying to help a woman who was knocked to the ground by agents, as well as  what’s known about Pretti’s background, belie the Trump administration’s claims, the Minnesota Reformer reported.
In a statement, Pretti’s parents said they are “heartbroken but also very angry” and requested, “Please get the truth out about our son.” They said that “the sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting.”
“Alex was a kindhearted soul who cared deeply for his family and friends and also the American veterans whom he cared for as an ICU nurse at the Minneapolis VA hospital,” the parents’ statement said in part. “Alex wanted to make a difference in this world. Unfortunately he will not be with us to see his impact. I do not throw around the hero term lightly. However his last thought and act was to protect a woman.”
Lori Blakeslee, communications director for the Green Bay Area Public School District, confirmed to the Wisconsin Examiner that Pretti graduated from Green Bay Preble High School in 2006.

In an interview early Sunday afternoon, Travis Vanden Heuvel told the Examiner he and Pretti were in a choir program together, and that the two were friends during elementary and middle school. 
“I think he was standing up for what was right and just, and I’m saddened and angered by what happened and how it happened,” Vanden Heuvel said. 
Vanden Heuvel said when he learned about the shooting, not knowing who the victim was, the word he had been using to describe it was tragic. His old assistant choir director had reached out to let him know Pretti had been killed. 
“And tragic became devastating, not that this happening in America or in Minnesota didn’t already make it close to home,” Vanden Heuvel said. “I mean, I think we’ve been feeling it hit closer and closer to home.”
The Examiner previously reported on a march against ICE in downtown Green Bay almost a year ago, in the weeks that followed President Donald Trump’s inauguration. 
Castillo told the Examiner this is different from last year’s event.
“It was just the random activist that approached us and said, ‘Would you like to set up some sort of event that shows that immigrants are just people too?’” Castillo said. “…This is much different, and because people are angry… they’re just mad that a man was assassinated, extra-judicially murdered.” 
Jennifer Gonzalez, communications coordinator for the Green Bay Police Department, said that “today’s demonstration, like others held in our community, was calm and peaceful, with no significant incidents.”
Protests also occurred elsewhere in Wisconsin, including in Milwaukee, Madison, Oshkosh and Superior.
State Rep. Amaad Rivera-Wagner (D-Green Bay) said in a statement that “it is not surprising that Alex was a nurse with roots in Green Bay, a place where we believe in taking care of each other and respecting human dignity.”
“We must come together to demand accountability, because hate cannot win,” Rivera-Wagner said. 
In a statement Saturday, Green Bay Mayor Eric Genrich said “another American citizen is dead as the result of the federal government’s occupation of an American city, and the victim, Alex Pretti, was a graduate of a Green Bay high school.” 
“Without knowing all the facts of the case, we can say with certainty that a full, transparent, and independent investigation must be conducted,” Genrich said. “I mourn his tragic death with his friends and family, and join the chorus of Americans who are rightfully demanding the federal government change course and enforce immigration law in keeping with local, state and federal laws and the U.S. Constitution.”

(Getty Images)If I was in need of an emergency transfusion, the last thing I would be thinking about is whether the person who donated their life-saving blood had received the COVID-19 vaccine.
In fact, I’d just be thankful that someone had stepped up to donate healthy blood.
But I guess that’s one big difference between me and Republican state Rep. Justin Humphrey, who for whatever reason fears receiving blood from donors who got  their COVID shot will do him grievous bodily harm.
Humphrey wasted state resources filing legislation that would require the State Department of Health to squander money getting into the business of running a blood bank. And not just any blood bank, but one that only stores blood that is “untainted” by the vaccine to fight COVID-19.
It’s so absurd, I wanted to laugh when I first saw the bill, figuring it was just more theatrics orchestrated to grab headlines. It is, of course, from the same lawmaker who once garnered international attention with his proposal to create a bigfoot hunting license, and who now has his sights set on the lieutenant governor’s office.
A day after Oklahoma Voice first reported on the measure and he faced a deluge of ridicule — mixed with some adoration — on social media, I ran into Humphrey in the Capitol. Humphrey told me he no longer planned to pursue this plan legislatively. He had not ruled out working to develop a national blood bank like it through private avenues because he believes there is interest in this. He said it prompted a needed conversation.
The lawmaker from Lane said he had spoken with the head of Our Blood Institute, the nation’s sixth largest independent blood center, which is headquartered in Oklahoma City. He said he’ll use his bill to promote blood donation and to spread the word that Oklahomans can donate their own blood ahead of time to be used in planned procedures that require transfusions.
That seems like a fitting end to this tale.
Even with this particular bill out of the way, though, it’s emblematic of a larger problem. Proposals like this continue to symbolize the increasingly vocal segment of our Legislature that are either against science and medicine, have no grasp on how things actually work in health care or are hoping to capitalize off people’s ignorance.
In recent years, we’ve seen Oklahoma lawmakers spend inordinate amounts of time fearmongering about modern medicine, and we’ve seen them give credence to a small but influential anti-vaccine movement through a variety of legislative proposals.
I fear this year – an election year – is going to be infinitely worse as politicians jockey for attention and votes.
I sure hope I’m wrong.
But last session, we had a state senator accuse women of murdering babies if they take birth control, and he railed against the dangers of that safe medicine..
In June, lawmakers cheered happily for Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt when he said he would pen an executive order that forbade the state Health Department from recommending fluoride in public water supplies.
Now, we’ve also got at least one lawmaker who wants to divert Tobacco Settlement Endowment Trust money that voters have specifically earmarked to improve public health to pay higher education costs for the children of teachers. 
I fail to see how that will help improve health outcomes in states, like ours, which ranks in the bottom five in access, quality and public health and has an above average rates of obesity and people without health insurance.
As someone who believes wholeheartedly in modern medicine and public health, it’s absolutely exhausting to watch these legislative shenanigans play out year after year. 
Alarmingly, it’s getting more  difficult to tell who’s joking, pandering to a base or who legitimately believes what they’re spouting while they file bills. And, it’s hard to tell which bills will die a quick legislative death and which will suddenly get reworked late in the session and charge through the opaque lawmaking process.
Unfortunately, that distracts from the good work other legislators are trying to do. It also pulls medical professionals, who are already in short supply, away from their patients as they’re forced to spend inordinate amounts of their precious time having to rebut false claims to make sure we’re all safer.
Take Humphrey’s COVID bill, for example.
Medical professionals say there is no way to differentiate between the antibodies of people who have had COVID and those who have had the vaccine. And the vaccine is safe.
Mercy Hospital Oklahoma City’s chief medical officer said they don’t routinely have patients demanding special blood.
Please believe them. 
Humphrey could have figured that out himself before filing this legislation.
At this point, pretty much everyone has probably had COVID, even if they don’t know it, since for most people it appears like a respiratory virus.
So to make Humphrey’s vision a reality, he’d need to either find people living off the grid, or he’ll need to take copious amounts of blood from newborn babies, which isn’t safe or humane.
The Legislature would be an infinitely better place if lawmakers actually trusted our health care providers and talked to them — not at them — when crafting legislation.
Hopefully moving forward, they’ll do that.

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist only entered the race for Secretary of State two weeks ago. In that time, key Democrats have been rallying around him, showing off the type of organizing and bridge-building strength he’ll certainly need to get over the edge with delegates at the party’s spring endorsement convention.
Gilchrist left the gubernatorial race on Jan. 12, citing his intention to play a bigger role against threats from President Donald Trump and federal officials to meddle in upcoming elections, and broader threats to democracy that have faced the state and nation.
That said, Gilchrist was running second fiddle to current Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, who remains the frontrunner in the governor’s race and now only faces Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson in the upcoming August primary.
Gilchrist’s entrance into the Democratic secretary of state contest, which is heavily influenced  by the state’s powerful unions and interest groups at the party’s spring and summer conventions, immediately pushed another candidate, Deputy Secretary of State Aghogho Edevbie, out of the race. Edevbie has since endorsed Gilchrist.
The race is now between Ingham County Clerk Barb Byrum, former state Sen. Adam Hollier of Detroit, and former Michigan State Lottery Commissioner Suzanna Shkreli.
On Thursday, Gilchrist unloaded a fresh round of endorsements that included more than 40 public officials, congressional districts and union groups.

— Garlin Gilchrist (@garlin) January 22, 2026

Adrian Hemond, CEO of the Grassroots Midwest consulting firm, told Michigan Advance on Friday that Gilchrist has had a pretty impressive showing right out of the gate.
“Obviously, this is a way different sort of race than a statewide primary election, because the electorate is just whoever shows up at convention and has voting rights,” Hemond said. “But endorsements matter much more in this race than they do in a statewide primary. … They matter a lot at convention because a lot of organizations that can endorse have the ability to move their members, and a lot of elected officials who endorse have reach with some of the groups who are going to show on the convention floor.”
Hemond said that Gilchrist’s new round of endorsements also show that his bid for secretary of state is already going better than his year of running for governor thus far, and that’s likely why he made the switch.
Gilchrist building bridges instead of letting them burn
Gilchrist, during his gubernatorial bid, carved out a space for himself as one of the only gubernatorial candidates to decisively support the Palestinian freedom movement and call Israel’s war on Gaza a genocide. He also said he would not accept money from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC. The lieutenant governor made that pronouncement last summer at the annual American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee national convention in Dearborn.
That stance and others, like his strong union support and his championing of the state’s Clean Slate expungement program, earned him the endorsement of U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit), who has been a leading voice for Palestinian freedom during her time in Congress.
Soon after Gilchrist dropped from the gubernatorial hunt and entered the race for secretary of state, he appeared at a candidate forum hosted by the Michigan Democratic Party’s Jewish Caucus. There, he apologized for how those remarks may have been perceived as antisemitic, although his campaign later clarified that he was not retracting his previous statements on Gaza.

Gilchrist also noted that he met with the Anti-Defamation League and the American Jewish Committee.
Despite those statements, it appears that Tlaib is still on board with Gilchrist’s campaign for secretary of state, as she is listed among his new supporters list released Thursday. The list also includes Dearborn Mayor Adbullah Hammoud, an unabashed supporter of Palestinian rights and a strong critic of the Israeli government under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Michigan Advance attempted to interview Tlaib for this story prior to Gilchrist’s new slate of endorsements, in hopes to better understand where she stood now with the lieutenant governor now that he was out of the governor’s race and after comments at the party-hosted forum.
Tlaib’s communications office did not respond to numerous text messages or phone calls seeking an interview with the congresswoman.
Hemond said Gilchrist’s maneuvering on Gaza and Israel — admitting where he might have been wrong in some respects with moderate Democrats while still sticking to his guns on a previously stated ideological position that’s important to progressives — speaks to his effectiveness as a politician within the Democratic coalition.
“Ultimately, he’s got to take his case to the general electorate, but winning these convention fights requires a different sort of politics, and he appears to have some aptitude at that,” Hemond said.
What does this momentum mean for those still in the race?
Gilchrist gaining traction so late in the game and at an accelerated rate may be tripping alarm bells for the likes of Byrum, Hollier and Shkreli, the latter of whom also joined the race fairly late into the cycle. 
Hemond expects that at least one or two of the candidates who are not Garlin Gilchrist to leave the race by the time the party holds its early endorsement convention in the spring.

“I think Gilchrist will do well at the convention, whether he wins or not,” Hemond said. “I think it depends, to some extent, on who else is in the race. I don’t expect this to go to a vote between three candidates. It’ll be a vote between two candidates, if it’s not a coronation.”
Hemond expects at least one of them to be Gilchrist, and whoever his opponent is in the final stretch.
If that person is Byrum, his momentum certainly puts pressure on her, but Hemond called Byrum a brand-name candidate due to her family history in politics and ties to organized labor.
It also puts pressure on Hollier if he’s still standing on the eve of the convention, as the party would then have two prominent Black politicians from Detroit running for the same spot, although Hollier has been working to reach out statewide for support.
Shkreli, meanwhile, has also been making the rounds of Democratic constituent groups in her bid to be the party’s nominee.

In the case of Byrum, the former lawmaker and current Ingham clerk has been in the race since last spring, and is potentially the most qualified person in the hunt for the nomination. Deep-bench qualifications, however, don’t necessarily mean an easy or expected path to victory when the nomination is decided by party fixtures and not average voters.
In an interview with the Advance, Byrum said Friday that she remains the candidate with most experience doing the job she’s campaigning for, and with the kind of early endorsements that still matter — several unions and many local clerks.
To that point, Gilchrist, at present, has backing from the powerful Michigan Education Association and Unite Here Local 24.
Byrum, on the other hand, has support from nearly a dozen union locals, including the Greater Lansing Labor Council, Lansing-based UA Local 333 Plumbers & Pipefitters, Detroit’s UA Local 636 Pipefitters, Flint’s UA Local 370 Plumbers & Pipefitters and Monroe’s UA Local 671 Plumbers, Pipefitters, HVAC & Welders.
Byrum said she wasn’t fazed by Gilchrist’s swift albeit late launch.

“I had three opponents last month; I have three opponents today,” Byrum told the Advance. “I am the only qualified candidate in this race for Secretary of State. I’m the only candidate who has run an election, 42 to be exact. I have been, for 13 years, the only one who’s a nationally certified election administrator. … None of my opponents have done anything like that.”
Byrum added that Michigan needs a secretary of state who is “ready and willing on day one to defend the integrity of our elections.”

,WyoFile,2026-01-26 11:25:00+00:00,WyoFile,"Nuclear waste, state land use top Wyoming Legislature’s energy agenda",Dustin Bleizeffer,,,,,https://wyofile.com/nuclear-waste-state-land-use-top-wyoming-legislatures-energy-agenda/,"

Recent controversies over sprawling energy development have triggered a slate of bills to empower voters and communities in state-level energy ambitions.
The post Nuclear waste, state land use top Wyoming Legislature’s energy agenda appeared first on WyoFile .","If there’s a theme among energy-related bills proposed for the Legislature’s upcoming budget session, it might be giving the electorate and local communities more say in what many residents regard as a tsunami of energy development proposals.
From a growing crop of wind turbines to mining proposals, prospective nuclear manufacturing and hydrogen energy projects, residents have clashed with one another, county officials and the state. Tensions swirl around the economic, safety and cultural ramifications of a rapidly changing energy landscape.
One bill speaks directly to the sense that, although Wyoming wants to remain the nation’s premier source of raw power, residents want to have more of a say about what’s a good fit.
A public vote on nuclear waste storage?
One of the most high-profile conflicts has centered on nuclear energy and whether the state should loosen its ban on spent nuclear fuel waste storage. 
House Joint Resolution 3, “Storage of spent nuclear fuel and waste-vote required,” aims to put the authority to decide directly in Wyoming voters’ hands. If passed, the general election ballot in November would include a referendum on whether to amend Wyoming’s constitution to proclaim:

“No storage, siting or placement of high-level radioactive waste shall be authorized under state law and occur except upon an affirmative vote of the people of the state.


“No storage, siting or placement of spent nuclear fuel shall be authorized under state law and occur except upon an affirmative vote of the people of the state.


“That the Secretary of State shall endorse the following statement on the proposed amendment: The adoption of this amendment would require an affirmative vote of the people of the state before any high-level radioactive waste or spent nuclear fuel can be stored in Wyoming.”

All 13 sponsors behind the resolution are members and allies of the Wyoming Freedom Caucus, indicative of a political divide that has already curtailed some nuclear development. In October, Radiant Industries announced it was withdrawing its plans to build a nuclear microreactor manufacturing facility in Natrona County. Radiant’s plan would have required a change to Wyoming’s ban on high-level nuclear waste storage. Though lawmakers have tried several times to do just that, the effort has met passionate opposition, including this past summer.
At stake is whether Wyoming can reap the economic benefits of high-dollar nuclear energy proposals without sacrificing public safety. While the bill’s primary sponsor, Midwest Republican Rep. Bill Allemand, says he believes storage facilities can be operated safely, it’s unlikely that any nuclear waste deemed as “temporarily” stored here would ever be removed from the state, because there are no plans for a federal repository, he noted.
Plus, Allemand said, Radiant’s proposed site was simply too close to homes and schools in Bar Nunn, and elected officials didn’t advocate for what he considered a majority of neighbors who didn’t want to take the risk.
“Their elected officials turned a blind eye and would not listen to them,” Allemand told WyoFile. “They said they might pay a price at the next election. Well, for these people in Bar Nunn, that would have been too late.”

Proponents of bringing nuclear energy projects to Wyoming say the state risks earning a reputation as unwelcoming to the industry, which has plenty of other states courting those dollars.
If such a referendum were to pass, Allemand said, it would not stop ongoing discussions about what aspects of the nuclear energy industry might be a good fit for Wyoming. “But the Legislature, the governor, the county commission — they would no longer have that right,” he said. “It will be the people, and that’s where it should be on something of this high of importance.”
Energy on state lands
Lawmakers will also consider at least two bills that would require more public engagement and allow for more flexibility regarding energy and other industrial developments on state lands.
Senate File 40, “State lands-designation of community-valued land,” would allow the Wyoming Environmental Quality Council to designate state lands, on a case-by-case nomination basis, as “lands with significant community value.” 
Senate File 42, “County zoning authority-amendments,” would specify that counties have the authority to “implement zoning regulations for specified purposes.”
“There needs to be a little bit more of a vetting process to allow for the county commissioners or the city council or communities, in general, to at least weigh in before it lands on the desk in front of the [state lands] board.”Casper Republican Sen. Bill Landon
Both bills, according to proponents, attempt to give communities and local officials more say over state-sanctioned activities on what are known as “school sections” — state-owned lands prioritized for the financial and general benefit of Wyoming public schools. Some critics say the Wyoming State Board of Land Commissioners has pursued those priorities too narrowly, failing to provide proper notice to locals when granting leases and insisting that county zoning and land use rules cannot trump the state’s authority over school sections.
Senate File 40, according to the bill’s sponsor, Casper Republican Sen. Bill Landon, “attempts to give communities an option, or at least give a little bit better vetting process to what we do on state lands, particularly state lands that are either contiguous or close to communities.”
Two years ago, controversy erupted over the state land board’s approval of mining leases on state lands at the base of Casper Mountain, where a gravel mining company proposes to set up operations. Adjacent homeowners cried foul, saying the gravel pit threatens water wells and neighborhood safety. Both homeowners and county officials were irate that the state didn’t reach out to locals before approving the leases.

Beyond Casper Mountain, residents and local officials throughout central and eastern Wyoming have said the state has approved wind and other industrial projects without considering other land values or the cumulative impacts that threaten ranching and small communities.
“There needs to be a little bit more of a vetting process,” Landon said, “to allow for the county commissioners or the city council or communities, in general, to at least weigh in before it lands on the desk in front of the [state lands] board.”
Landon noted that SF 40 doesn’t attempt to supersede the state’s authority over school sections, but prescribes a process for more public engagement and the opportunity to recognize the value of lands, on a case-by-case basis, beyond generating revenue from industrial development.
Senate File 42 flirts with the contentious issue of whether counties can impose zoning and other land use rules that might conflict with state-sanctioned activities on school sections. The measure would give counties more of a say when it comes to supposedly temporary industrial and commercial activities that can be prolonged via state lease extensions, according to co-sponsor Casper Republican Rep. Steve Harshman.

The clash over such county-versus-state authorities has generated several lawsuits in recent years, including a recent court ruling in favor of Prism Logistics, the company that wants to mine gravel at the base of Casper Mountain.
Federal minerals
Though Wyoming officials cheered the GOP-led Big Beautiful Bill, there was some regret over a provision that slashed the federal mineral royalty rate for coal, oil and natural gas — a longtime pillar of revenue to the state. The move, related to coal royalties alone, is estimated to choke the annual flow of federal dollars to Wyoming by $50 million, according to estimates.
To help make up for those losses, House Joint Resolution 2, “Federal mineral royalties-state share,” sponsored by the Legislature’s Select Federal Natural Resource Management Committee, would ask Congress to increase Wyoming’s share of federal mineral royalties from 50% to 87.5%, according to the bill draft.
The committee is also sponsoring Senate Joint Resolution 1, “State management-federal mineral leases.” The resolution would request that Congress amend the federal Mineral Leasing Act to “authorize the state of Wyoming to administer and manage mineral leasing on federal lands located in Wyoming.”
Though the production of federal minerals has been a major source of revenue and job creation in Wyoming, state leaders have bristled at past administrations’ leasing decisions, particularly when the Biden administration imposed a ban on all future federal coal leasing in the Powder River Basin — a move that the Trump administration is reversing.
The resolution claims Wyoming could administer federal leasing in the state more efficiently and at a lower cost. It also asserts that “Authorizing Wyoming to administer and manage mineral leasing of federal minerals not only respects the principles of federalism and local control but also ensures that decisions are made by those who know the land best and are most invested in its long-term sustainability.”

The proposed cuts are a form of negotiation by hostage taking, with the caucus using UW and the business council as leverage in future negotiations, writes Rep. Ken Chestek.
The post The Wyoming Freedom Caucus is playing games with the budget appeared first on WyoFile .","The budget proposal being forced out of the Wyoming Joint Appropriations Committee by its Freedom Caucus members is not a serious one. It is the opening bid in a negotiation, which promises to get very ugly and very contentious when the full Legislature convenes in two weeks. Worst of all, it shows the utter disregard that the Freedom Caucus has for the majority of Wyoming citizens. They are playing a very dangerous game.

Opinion

I teach a unit on negotiations in several of the courses I teach at the University of Wyoming School of Law. I teach my students to identify the “negotiating context” in which they find themselves, then select their negotiating strategies and tactics to match the context. 
One typical context is called a “competitive” context, in which the parties view the situation as purely a zero-sum game: For every dollar I give you, I need something of equal value in return. Competitive tactics include taking extreme opening positions, contesting every fact, making minimal concessions and using threats to belittle the opposing side, hoping to force bigger concessions from your opponent.
Everything about the bill coming out of the JAC reveals that the Freedom Caucus views the budget as a competitive context. The state’s revenue stream is level, and Gov. Mark Gordon proposed a balanced budget. Therefore, the extreme cuts being proposed by the Freedom Caucus are unnecessary; they are just cuts for the sake of cuts. 
We can afford the full funding the governor proposed for the University of Wyoming. We can afford to invest in Wyoming’s future through the Wyoming Business Council. We can afford to fund Wyoming Public Media. 
The proposed cuts or elimination of those programs amount to nothing more than hostage taking; an attempt to gain leverage in future negotiations. What the Freedom Caucus wants in exchange remains to be seen, but you can bet the concessions they want relate to the group’s extreme right-wing agenda.
The problem with all of this is that the Freedom Caucus has shown that it is willing to harm Wyoming citizens to achieve its right-wing goals. Defunding the Wyoming Business Council will make innovation and job creation in Wyoming much more difficult. The huge proposed cut to the University of Wyoming will force the school to end programs and lay off staff, and render our only four-year university less competitive in seeking enrollment. How much clearer a message could the Freedom Caucus send to our young citizens? If we don’t fund job creation and a robust education system, why should a young person stay in Wyoming?
Every concerned Wyoming citizen should contact their state legislators now and tell them in no uncertain terms that they don’t want right-wing politics to harm job creation and higher education.

In this dizzying new era of state terror, citizens and community leaders alike are trying to figure out what to do. What power do we have to face down a violent, repressive government targeting civilians in an operation aimed not at protecting public safety but at disrupting and destroying civil society? 
At a press conference with local media last week, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan promised to fight against a Minneapolis-like surge in Wisconsin, drawing a lot of probing follow-up questions from reporters. Pocan voted against $64 billion in funding for the Department of Homeland Security that passed the House and is now, belatedly, facing difficulties in the Senate. He said he would work with local law enforcement, support lawsuits filed by Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul and other state AGs against aggressive ICE deployments, and encourage peaceful protestors marching in inflatable dinosaur costumes. 
But the question of how to fight back is a tough one.
The federal government has created a massive paramilitary organization that is systematically terrorizing Democratic-led Midwestern cities. The 3,000 immigration agents in Minneapolis far outnumber the local police force there. We have never seen anything quite like this.
Minnesota elected officials seem to be struggling with the question of how to resist and how to defend their citizens. Along with strong language about the damage the federal crackdown is doing to the community, Frey and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz repeatedly admonished protesters to remain peaceful, then deployed the Minnesota National Guard to block people from visiting a memorial at the site of Pretti’s death. Bringing in local and state law enforcement and the Guard to police protesters seems to buttress the Trump administration’s false claims that Minnesotans are the ones causing the violence, and that more armed men policing civilian neighborhoods will increase public safety. In reality, federal agents are the ones who are acting violently, not Minneapolis residents, and it’s not clear that local and state police are doing anything to protect the public from this threat.
The fact is, it’s hard to figure out what to do.
In Madison, on Saturday night more than 100 of my neighbors packed the James Reeb Unitarian Universalist Church for a potluck and discussion of nonviolent action, looking for answers to the terrible questions raised by the shooting death of yet another civilian in Minneapolis. 
How do we prepare for the possibility of an onslaught of armed federal agents into our own communities, busting down doors without warrants, dragging people out of their homes and firing on the neighbors who try to protect them? What power do we have to turn back the transformation of our country from democracy to authoritarian regime? 
The Madison event, planned before Pretti was killed, was organized by a coalition of dozens of peace and social justice groups under the umbrella Building Unity for Nonviolent Action. Speakers, including my friend John Nichols of The Nation magazine and Dane County Judge and Rev. Everett Mitchell, talked about the history of peaceful resistance in the U.S. The group showed part of the documentary “A Force More Powerful” about transformative nonviolent resistance struggles in India, the segregated American South, South Africa, Denmark and Chile. 
It was restorative to gather in person, take a break from isolation, helpless rage and doomscrolling and to spend some time contemplating the heroism of the Civil Rights movement activists who faced down hatred and violence with astounding courage and faith — despite all evidence to the contrary — in the fundamental decency of other people.
The difference between the Civil Rights era and today — and even the difference between the Black Lives Matter movement against police violence of a few years ago and today — is that the federal government can no longer be counted on to enforce civil rights, due process and justice. We are in a new era. “Those protections are gone,” Rev. Mitchell told the crowd. “So the only thing that you have available to you is each other.”
That bracing realization has spurred a proliferation of nonviolent resistance trainings in Minnesota and in other states, including Wisconsin.
One salutary side effect is that peaceful gatherings that bring out our capacity for love, mutual aid and connection help us avoid drowning in anger and despair.
Last weekend we drove to Minneapolis to visit our daughter who is, alarmingly, living in the middle of the chaos there. On our way to take her out for lunch we came upon a massive group of people holding a walking vigil in the neighborhood near where Nicole Good was shot. About 600 Minnesotans were walking the streets singing, “You are not alone” and “Hold on, here comes the dawn,” as immigrant children and their parents peered out the windows of locked houses, waving. It was an unexpected moment of grace. A glimpse of the humanity and caring that are still possible. We need to hold onto that vision.

With the bill filing deadline for the 2026 legislative session looming at the end of the month, the task force plans to draft a bill creating a waste diversion council that would assist Tennessee counties with finding ways to keep recyclable waste out of the state’s quickly-filling landfills and educate consumers about what they can recycle and where.
Tennessee businesses have told lawmakers in previous meetings that they are willing to purchase more recycled aluminum and glass if Tennessee can collect, process and produce sufficient quantities of recycled material to make it worthwhile. Right now, the state’s recycling rate is too low.
This comes as the Tennessee Waste to Jobs Act returns to the legislature for consideration. The act — introduced in 2025 by Sen. Heidi Campbell and Rep. Bob Freeman, both Nashville Democrats — would establish an Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) model for packaging in Tennessee.
In EPR models, which have been in use internationally for years, companies that produce packaging products pay fees into a producer responsibility organization that uses those funds to improve recycling infrastructure and education. Tennessee’s bill would exempt small businesses that make less than $10 million in annual revenue, meaning that fees would be paid mostly by larger, national or multinational companies.

Campbell said the bill has built momentum since its introduction last year. The bill’s proponents have collected letters of support from several industry operators and a collection of Tennessee mayors from major cities and some rural communities, most recently including a letter from Dyer County Mayor David Quick.
But skepticism remains. A handful of states that have adopted EPR for packaging (many have EPR laws for specific products like batteries, paint and mattresses) are early in their implementation. 
Michael Hoffman, President and CEO of the National Waste and Recycling Association, countered that EPR does not improve recycling recovery rates or secondary markets. Hoffman told lawmakers that content commitments from producers — steady streams of recyclable materials — would stabilize secondary markets and encourage private capital investments in recycling infrastructure.
The state of trash
Regional landfill capacity and remaining life are on the decline in Tennessee, said Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation Bureau of Environment Advisor Jeremy Hooper. Attempts to create new landfills or expand existing landfills are also seeing more pushback on the local level. 
“There’s less and less space over time, as population expands, for landfills,” Hooper told lawmakers during a January Senate Energy, Agriculture and Natural Resources Committee meeting. “Those that are permitted are larger and more regional in nature, and there’s increasing demand on those, especially as landfills are denied expansions.”
Class I landfills, which accept the bulk of solid waste, currently have an estimated 10-plus years of life remaining in West and East Tennessee, Hooper said. But Middle Tennessee landfills are quickly approaching their limits. 
Middle Point Landfill — Middle Tennessee’s largest — has been a source of contention for years, with Murfreesboro leaders and residents opposing expansion plans and raising environmental concerns.
While the issue is regional now, that won’t always be the case, Hooper said.
“If a landfill closes down in Middle Tennessee, that has to go somewhere … waste going there right now could end up into the eastern or western grand divisions,” he said.
Landfills are expensive to run and time-consuming to permit, Hooper added, and as more landfills reach maximum capacity, waste will have to be transported elsewhere, adding to disposal costs.
Meanwhile, recycling markets and infrastructure are limited in Tennessee, making recycling more expensive as goods must be transported elsewhere for processing and reuse.  
“The take-home message for recycling is it has and continues to play a role in Tennessee, but the economics of recycling continue to make landfilling a cheaper disposal in many cases,” Hooper said.
Rep. Chris Todd, a Jackson Republican, has expressed his doubts about the cost of recycling compared to putting recyclable materials like cans and bottles into landfills. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
During a task force meeting on Jan. 22, Rep. Chris Todd, a Jackson Republican, asked if the value of recycled material to end users is high enough to support the cost of recycling on its own.
Memphis Solid Waste Director Philip Davis told the task force that right now, it’s not, but the dynamics are complex and depend on the volume of recycled material and transportation costs. If Tennessee had more local processors, for example, the value of the recycled material changes.
“The resource that I believe we’re conserving is the landfill airspace,” Davis said. “We’re trying to conserve that for industry,” instead of filling it up with materials that should be composted or diverted.
While Todd said it’s a “no brainer” that compostable materials should not go to landfills, he said he can’t see his constituents being willing to pay more to recycle items like cans and bottles if it’s cheaper to put them in a landfill.
Steering recycling away from landfills
The task force, created in 2025 by the legislature to plot a strategy for Tennessee waste through 2050, has heard hours of statements from waste industry professionals, county and state waste officials, think tanks, recycling advocates and more over the last several months.
“We’ve heard it time and time again with every presentation … we need consistency, we need some standardization,” committee member Donna Barrett said.
She will work with Todd and Sen. Shane Reeves to draft a bill to create the diversion council.










I may have a county that is so small that the mayor is the solid waste director … they don’t have time to interview a waste to energy (company) — a glass pickup company. They just don’t … have the bandwidth for that.


– Donna Barrett, Tennessee Solid Waste Task Force 


Barrett, whose record of service in Tennessee includes stints as a state representative and election commissioner, said the diversion council could be structured similar to the Tennessee Election Commission.
“We do not tell counties which election equipment to use, we tell them which ones are certified,” Barrett said, using the election commission as an example.
Training and education would be the same from county to county, but individual counties could use the diversion council as a “clearing house” or information repository to determine which options best fit them, she said. 
“I may have a county that is so small that the mayor is the solid waste director … they don’t have time to interview a waste to energy (company) — a glass pickup company. They just don’t … have the bandwidth for that.”
The council could be tasked with speaking with solid waste directors across the state, identifying needs and solutions, vetting vendors, setting vendor standards, providing standardized recycling layouts and signage for recycling and convenience centers, and standardizing education and awareness programs, Barrett suggested.
There are many details to work out, including the council’s size, membership, and funding. 
“I think we have an opportunity legislatively, and it’s got to happen fairly quickly,” Todd said, noting that new revenue will be tough to find this year, and looking to reassign existing money to fund a council might be more realistic.

A new class at the University of Wisconsin Law School aims to teach students about the perspectives of different people who are part of the criminal justice system, including those who are incarcerated. 
Dant’e Cottingham, one of the course instructors, was himself once locked up inside Wisconsin’s prison system. He said that according to stigma, he’s not supposed to be in the classroom.
“So I’m aware of that, and I carry that,” Cottingham said. “That’s important to me, because I want to make sure that the city, the state, the country knows that we are a lot more than our worst mistake.”
Instructing the class along with Cottingham is Adam Stevenson, a clinical professor and director of the Frank J. Remington Center, which houses the law school’s prison-based clinics as well as the public defender and prosecution externships. While Cottingham has the experience of being incarcerated in the prison system, Stevenson brings to the course the legal expertise of a law professor, and one who has worked with a program focused on legal assistance to incarcerated people. 
The Wednesday class, which has 19 students enrolled this semester,  counts for two credits. It’s titled “Criminal Justice System: A Lived Experience Perspective.” The class, examining how theory, policy and practice line up with reality — or diverge from it, according to the syllabus, may continue in the future depending on how this semester goes. 
In 1996, Cottingham was convicted of being party to a crime for first-degree intentional homicide for an offense that occurred when he was 17. While incarcerated, Cottingham applied to UW Madison’s program for legal assistance for incarcerated people and was assigned two law students who worked to help him win his release, he said. He was paroled in 2022. 
Cottingham served as interim associate director of the group Ex-Incarcerated People Organizing, and spoke publicly about Green Bay Correctional Institution, where he spent some of his imprisonment, and which has been the subject of criticism for inhumane conditions and calls to close the facility. Now 47, Cottingham is the reentry and outreach support specialist for the Remington Center. He said he helps men and women who are transitioning from incarceration.  
“I sit with people, build a rapport, get some insight and understanding to what their needs are,” Cottingham said. A person’s needs might involve housing, employment or medical care. 
Cottingham said that when he gave presentations in classes in the past,  students engaged with his description of his own experience, and he saw a need for the course he’s teaching now.
The experience of re-entering society after prison is one topic on the course schedule Cottingham shared with the Examiner. The arrest process, the trial process, sentencing, systemic inequality in criminal justice, and incarceration, and advocacy for reform and future directions are among the other course topics.
Guest speakers in the class range from Wisconsin Department of Corrections Secretary Jared Hoy, to Wood County District Attorney Jonathan Barnett, to Sharmain Harris, whose book “Rising Above the Odds: My Journey from Pain and Prison to Power and Purpose” is one of the required materials for the course. Requirements include book reports that analyze autobiographies of people who have experienced incarceration.

Jini Jasti, a spokesperson for University of Wisconsin Law School, said UW Law’s motto is “Law in Action.” She said the school does not only teach the law on the books but also encourages students to see how it works from different perspectives, such as those of prosecutors, defense attorneys, victims, defendants and prisoners.  
“This unique class complements our other offerings, allowing students to hear about our trial, appellate and prison systems from someone who’s lived it,” Jasti said in a statement. 
State Public Defender Jennifer Bias and Robert Taliaferro, who was formerly incarcerated, visited the class on Wednesday. 
Bringing in these different perspectives helps  “tease out topics that we should be discussing when we’re talking about what the law is, how the law should operate etc.,” Stevenson said in a Jan. 16 interview with the Wisconsin Examiner. “One person’s perspective is definitely great in doing that, but having multiple perspectives and the potential disagreement, or the clash, if you will, can also give rise to some really rich conversation.”  
Stevenson said students will be graduating and working with clients as attorneys, and understanding the perspectives of people in the criminal justice system is important. 
Lara Hendrix, a third year law student, is planning to be a public defender after graduation. She said she thought the class would be valuable for her future career. 
Hendrix hopes that eventually people who don’t plan to practice criminal law take the class. 
“These are real people with families, and people that love them, and other people that are affected,” Hendrix said, “and that needs so much more attention than it gets.”

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)Colorado schools that rely on workers from other countries could face staffing difficulties under the Trump administration’s implementation of a $100,000 fee for the visa those workers must obtain.
H-1B visas allow U.S. companies to employ foreign workers in tech and other specialized jobs. In education, they could include teachers, professors and researchers. 
President Donald Trump in September issued a proclamation implementing a $100,000 fee for new H-1B visa applicants. The fee does not apply to current H-1B visa holders. Historically, the visa fees paid by companies ranged from under $1,000 to a few thousand dollars. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Trump called for American companies to rely on American workers for these roles, making unsubstantiated claims of “abuse” in the H-1B visa program.
The top H-1B employer in Colorado is the University of Colorado system, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services data, though CU spokesperson Michele Ames said it is unclear exactly what the USCIS numbers reflect, since it appears only to list the university’s Denver campus.  
CU has 328 H-1B visa holders across all campuses and system offices in Boulder, Denver, Aurora and Colorado Springs, Ames said. Those people serve in various faculty, staff, research and clinical roles. 
“Each one of our visa holders are a valued member of our CU family,” Ames said in a statement. “Our ability to deliver world-class education to our more than 67,000 students, successfully compete for $1.7 billion in research funding each year, deliver life-saving treatment to thousands and provide $12.2 billion in economic impact to our state and nation rely — in part — on the contributions these individuals make every day.”










Our district will not be able to pay this fee for these visas.


– Scott Pribble, spokesperson for Denver Public Schools


Schools and universities use H-1B visas to hire for positions that can be difficult to fill, according to Dan Berger, a senior attorney with Path2Papers, a clinic at Cornell Law School that works to connect people who came to the U.S. as minors without authorization with employer-sponsored immigration options. 
“I think most colleges and universities want to hire the most qualified person for the position, and often it’s something that’s very specialized,” Berger said. “So it may be that you have the top five people in the world who work on a particular topic are spread out all over the world, and so what it does is … it takes away a potential pool of talent.” 
‘Confusion and harm’
H-1B visa holders support K-12 education as well. Denver Public Schools is the fifth biggest employer of H-1B visa holders in the state, according to USCIS data. The district’s internal tracking system based on school years shows that the district had 117 H-1B visas approved for the 2024-25 and 2025-26 school years.
The fee proclamation has caused “confusion and harm” in the district’s recruitment and hiring strategies, district spokesperson Scott Pribble said. The district’s visa holders fill high-demand positions, including Spanish bilingual elementary, math, science and special education teachers, and certain special provider roles. 
“Our district will not be able to pay this fee for these visas,” Pribble said in a statement. “It creates a problem recruiting qualified professionals, often holding multiple advanced degrees and bringing decades of classroom experience.”
With over 6,000 teachers in the district, the H-1B visa holders represent just under 2% of classroom staff. Over 30% of students in the district are English-language learners, and 34% of its students are Spanish-speaking. 
Maintaining an appropriate staffing level “is critical for the success of our students,” Pribble said, adding that the H-1B visa program has been imperative in supporting positions that teach students and offer legally mandated student services. 
“DPS competes in a constrained labor market for qualified educators and specialized staff,”  Pribble said. “In that environment, the district relies on all lawful recruiting pathways, including the ability to recruit and retain qualified candidates through the H-1B program for certain hard to fill roles.”
Graduate would have to leave
Colorado State University employs 131 H-1B visa holders. Most of those employees are facility or research associates, though some hold staff positions, CSU spokesperson Tiana Kennedy said. 
While initially it was unclear what the $100,000 proclamation covered, Berger said, it has since been clarified that it only applies to someone being hired directly from abroad. So, for example, if someone graduates with a Ph.D. from a university in the U.S. and a university wants to hire them, that would be considered a “change of status”and wouldn’t require the $100,000 fee.  
But the government still has discretion to approve status changes, and while Berger said it previously would do that “pretty freely,” it is “looking much more carefully at those cases.” 
“If a change of status is denied here, then the person would have to leave, and then the $100,000 fee would have to be paid,” Berger said. 
Since universities hire for the academic year, it is too early to tell how the changes from the Trump administration will affect CU’s hiring process, Ames said.  
“We will understand much more after we have been able to experience a full hiring cycle under the changes,” she said. 
The new visa fee is “just one of several hurdles” Denver schools have faced under the Trump administration, Pribble said. 
“The frequency of these policy shifts has created a climate of uncertainty, leading many of our teachers to seek urgent guidance,” Pribble said. “They are rightfully concerned about how these constant changes affect their professional standing and their families’ futures.”

Commissioner Sheri Haugen-Hoffart announced earlier this month that she will seek reelection to a six-year term. 
Haugen-Hoffart was appointed to the PSC in February 2022 and won the election for the seat the same year.
There also is a two-year term on the ballot. Julie Fedorchak was elected to a six-year term in 2022 but she gave up the seat when she was elected to Congress in 2024. 
Jill Kringstad, who was appointed in January 2025 to fill Fedorchak’s seat, announced last week that she will run for the two-year portion remaining on that term.  
Deven Styczynski of Enderlin says he also intends to run, but has not yet decided which term he would run for. 
Styczynski and other potential candidates must declare which seat they are running for when they file for candidacy with the North Dakota Secretary of State’s Office. The filing deadline is April 6. 
Haugen-Hoffart, Kringstad and Styczynski are all Republicans. 
Neither Haugen-Hoffart nor Kringstad committed to seeking the nomination at the North Dakota GOP convention. Without a party nomination, candidates must gather petition signatures to get on the ballot. 
Styczynski said he would seek the party nomination for the seat he decides to file for. 
Other candidates could emerge before the April 6 deadline.
In 2024, Tracey Wilkie announced her candidacy at the Democratic-NPL state convention. She lost to incumbent Republican Randy Christmann, receiving about 30% of the vote. 
Wilkie told the North Dakota Monitor that she has not considered running this year and encouraged other candidates to come forward. 
The three-person commission oversees rates for-profit electric utilities, issues permits for infrastructure such as pipelines, powerlines and wind turbines, and manages the state’s coal mine reclamation program, among other responsibilities.  
Styczynski said he’s running for the PSC in part due to concerns about rate increases from power companies. 
He called a compromise plan to allow Xcel Energy to increase electric rates by 10% for North Dakota customers “ludicrous.” 
Haugen-Hoffart defended the pending rate increase, saying it was the first request to raise rates in four years and electric rates. 
Kringstad said abundant, reliable and affordable energy is a top priority. 
Haugen-Hoffart and Kringstad both pointed to federal reporting that says North Dakota has the lowest electricity rates in the country.

As it turned out, home improvement projects boomed and so did requests for the couple’s FabriPlas Metal products that range from fun fence toppers to deck panels featuring trees, wildlife and other nature scenes.

“Demand really went up,” Sheila told the Nebraska Examiner, “Like, it’s not stopped.”
A new state manufacturing modernization grant, authorized under a 2025 Nebraska law, will add a plasma cutting machine and a painter/welder to the business’ seven-person staff, allowing quicker response to custom orders coming from across the country.
FabriPlas Metal is among five small manufacturers selected from more than 50 applicants that will share $250,000. Winners are to use the state funds to develop innovative approaches to building their operations and boosting productivity, according to a statement last week from the the Nebraska Department of Labor, which oversees the program.
“I am so impressed with the commitment from businesses across the state to utilizing technology in ways that will grow and sustain their companies while also providing new employment opportunities,” said Commissioner of Labor Katie Thurber, who said her agency received over 50 applications.
Each recipient of a Nebraska Manufacturing Modernization and Workforce Development Pilot Investment Act grant, provided under last year’s Legislative Bill 265, is to receive $50,000 and provide matching funds to complete their project, the department said.

The legislation, sponsored by State Sen. Tony Sorrentino of the Elkhorn area, was described as a one-time grant program to increase integration of smart technologies. Winners had to have at least three years of operation, at least three full-time employees and derive 51% of revenue from manufactured goods. 
At FabriPlas, Sheila Johnson said finding skilled workers is among the biggest challenges for the couple’s shop, whose registered name is PAJ Industries LLC. She also handles marketing and manages design work. Her husband has three decades of fabrication experience, cutting, sanding and finishing parts.
Their customer base is homeowners taking on do-it-yourself projects. But Sheila said more architects and developers are seeking their products. “We are so backed up,” she said.

Today, workers in all those states are bringing home paychecks that are far fatter than those of Michigan workers. That’s because those states made the transition to a knowledge economy that largely bypassed Michigan, according to a study by a University of Michigan economist.
“We were so concerned with keeping auto jobs that we missed the stuff that was coming,” said Don Grimes, who has forecast Michigan’s economy for decades and who counts himself among those who initially didn’t fully grasp how the economy was fundamentally shifting to high-wage, high-education-attainment service jobs.
The wage gaps between Michigan and what Grimes described as benchmark states are startling. Adjusted for cost of living, real wages in Massachusetts last year were an average $16,116 per worker higher than in Michigan, while Texas wages were $5,513 higher.
In 1990, North Carolina workers earned an average $8,598 less than Michigan workers. Today they bring home $566 more than their Michigan counterparts.
North Carolina’s economy has largely shifted away from employment in tobacco, textiles and furniture to higher-wage jobs in financial services, pharmaceuticals and various technologies.
“North Carolina used to have a higher concentration of manufacturing than Michigan did,” Grimes told me. “They’ve made the transition to a knowledge economy really well.”

And it’s not just those states that became far wealthier than Michigan over the past four decades. In 1990, Michigan’s cost-of-living adjusted wages were 9.5% higher than the national average, the sixth highest in the nation.
Today, the state’s wages are 4.2% lower than the national average despite Michigan’s relatively low cost of living, the U of M study said.
For decades, Michigan prospered from a healthy wage premium in manufacturing and other blue-collar jobs. But that premium has fallen from about $11,500 above the national average in 1990 to just $3,051 in 2024. Plus, the share of blue-collar jobs to total Michigan jobs has fallen from 32.9% in 1990 to 27% percent in 2024.
“We’re getting relatively poorer,” Grimes said. “We want to see our glory days. Now it’s a new formula.”
That new formula is a big concentration of high-wage jobs in areas such as information technology and financial services that can lift wages overall. Those are areas where Michigan lags far behind.
The state does possess thousands of good-paying engineering jobs. But many of those are connected to the auto industry, which pay far less than in other high-tech industries.
Michigan’s efforts to protect those positions, as well as auto factory jobs, have not succeeded. Michigan has lost about half of its auto manufacturing jobs since 1990. And many white-collar auto technology jobs have moved to Silicon Valley, Tennessee and other places, Grimes said.
“That’s really sort of depressing,” he said.
Michigan also has fallen far below the nation and benchmark states in wages paid in private-sector, high-wage service industries. Those jobs paid an average $88,655 in the state in 2024, about $11,000 less than the national average.
Those Michigan wages were an average $27,855 less than in Massachusetts, $10,494 less than in North Carolina and $9,377 behind Texas.
Closing those gaps will require a “massive revamp” of economic development efforts and attitudes by residents and policymakers about how Michigan can regain its wealth standing, Grimes said.
“It’s astounding what Michigan did in the ‘40s, ‘50s and ‘60s,” he said. “But we’re still looking backward. Everybody’s got to think differently.”

That’s a tall order at a time when politicians on both sides of the aisle are preaching the gospel of manufacturing as economic salvation, and when universities that produce high-wage workers are under attack by the Trump administration and many Republicans.
Grimes said the reality is that Michigan needs to attract more rich people who can boost the state’s wealth with their own incomes and the wages their companies provide. He’s blunt about that view, which he admits that candidates for political office this year are unlikely to embrace.
“Michigan should only give subsidies for jobs that pay over $100,000, and that should go up over time,” he said. “We need to eliminate the idea of trying to bring in factories” to create wealth. “You have to focus on jobs that pay a lot.”
While Grimes is not particularly confident that Michigan can catch up to other states that have transitioned to a knowledge economy any time soon, he said the state has powerful economic development tools — “extraordinary” water resources and world-class universities it can promote to attract the best and brightest.
West Michigan is outperforming the rest of the state in part because of its proximity to Lake Michigan, which is attracting investment from wealthy Chicagoans, Grimes said. The state could step up efforts to attract more wealthy job creators from the Windy City, among other places, he said.
“We need to go after people we’re not going after now,” he said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/computer-chip-getty-images-1024x6831680787758-1.jpeg,,,2026-01-26 06:57:06.815397

(Photo courtesy of Joy Holmes)Joy Holmes, a mother from Conway who homeschools her two children, has depended on PBS’ content over the past several years. Beloved characters Clifford the Big Red Dog and Wild Kratts are like family for her kids, who are on the autism spectrum.
While her children struggle to connect with people, “it’s much easier to connect with a show and connect with characters” from those long-running programs, Holmes said.
“It’s a fundamental part of our day,” Holmes said. “We don’t have a day where we’re not using the [PBS] kids’ programming.”
As Arkansas prepares to become the first state in the nation to disaffiliate from PBS, leaders of the rebranded Arkansas TV insist they’re keeping viewers in mind as they replace Big Bird, Ken Burns and Daniel Tiger with locally-made productions.
“What we have the opportunity to do now is to march boldly forward with a business model that can work for the long term,” Carlton Wing, the former Republican lawmaker who is now Arkansas TV’s CEO, said at a Little Rock Rotary Club meeting this month.

But interviews with parents like Holmes and feedback the state has received show the challenges the public television network faces in winning over those viewers. 
If the agency breaks away from PBS headquarters on July 1 as planned, the shows Holmes’ children enjoy will be available online and on the free PBS KIDS app, but no longer on television.
The Arkansas PBS Commission voted 6-2 in December to cut ties with the national network. The decision came as a shock to PBS headquarters and to Arkansans throughout the state, according to correspondence with Arkansas TV that the Arkansas Advocate obtained via a public records request.
In his Rotary Club address, Wing said the same thing he told the PBS Commission: No longer having to pay PBS dues was the only way to keep the network afloat. The network lost $2.5 million in programming and operational funds after the Corporation for Public Broadcasting lost federal funding last summer, and CPB officially shut down this month.
Holmes called the disaffiliation “an ideological move.” Dozens of Arkansans made similar comments in emails to Arkansas TV.
“As an Arkansas educator, I am profoundly concerned that the shortsighted desire to eradicate PBS that was driven by Republican leaders nationally and led by President [Donald] Trump deprives children across the nation of the wonderful programming that explores history, culture, and diverse voices,” one viewer wrote.

Public Comment 20 
Another viewer said the availability of PBS kids’ shows exclusively online is untenable because “many families do not have a dedicated computer/laptop for their child/children to use.” 
 Financial concerns

Katie Cramer, Wing’s executive assistant, answered many frustrated emails with the same response. She repeated Wing’s financial argument and said the network’s “attempts to negotiate lower annual dues were, unfortunately, unsuccessful.”
Some viewers who complained noted Arkansas’ growing budget surplus.
“If this was a priority, it would be taken care of by the legislature and the governor,” a viewer from Fayetteville wrote.
Cramer wrote in response that Wing would support rejoining PBS if the network were able to negotiate lower dues and that he “has been a genuine supporter of PBS for a long time.”

Wing was a Republican state representative from 2017 until September, when he resigned to take over the public television network. He was among the lawmakers who urged their colleagues to pass the network’s appropriation bill in 2024, when the bill passed after three attempts. The appropriation took five attempts to pass the House in 2025.

Due to this years-long struggle, asking the state to give the network more spending authority “is not realistic,” Wing said.
The network has caught the ire of some Republican state lawmakers, including Jonesboro Sen. Dan Sullivan, who last year unsuccessfully pushed for abolishing the Arkansas PBS commission.
Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders appointed Sullivan’s wife, Maria Sullivan, to the PBS Commission in 2024. She was among the commissioners who voted to cut ties with PBS.
 Projected viewership losses

Holmes spent years in Japan as part of a military family, and her PBS Passport subscription allows her to watch Japanese TV programs that remind her of her childhood, she said.
Those who pay $60 per year can access PBS Passport’s full library of programs, including Antiques Roadshow and Masterpiece Theatre. Wing has repeatedly said Passport will allow Arkansans to keep watching shows that will no longer be on TV, but Holmes said the cost is significant for her single-income household.
Some viewers are threatening to not just tune out, but no longer give.
“As I grew up, my worldview expanded with shows such as Rick Steves’ and Ken Burns’ numerous documentaries,” one person wrote to Arkansas TV. “After a decade in a neighboring state, I moved back to Arkansas and my wife and I are raising children in this great state. We are also new contributors to Arkansas PBS… However, I am disgusted by this decision and I will not be giving to this new entity.”
The Arkansas PBS Foundation, which manages donations to the network, provided a one-time emergency fund of $1.5 million last year to support both operating expenses and about half of the national dues. Wing and Cramer said this effort is unlikely to be repeatable.

Arkansas PBS Foundation CEO Marge Betley told viewers in an August 2025 marketing email that enough support from donors would allow the network to “continue delivering the trusted, inspiring programming that you value” despite the loss of CPB funding.
Holmes said she will continue subscribing to Passport via another state’s PBS station even though the app’s selection of programs varies state by state. Several viewers who contacted Arkansas TV about the disaffiliation said they will similarly redirect their subscriptions and donations.
“I’m 71 and have faithfully watched PBS my entire life,” wrote a viewer from Harrison. “Please reconsider the decision to leave the PBS system. I will switch viewership to another PBS station otherwise.”

Public Comment 34 
 Programming alternatives

Arkansas TV’s mission is to produce original, Arkansas-focused programming, and some content creators in the state have already contacted the network about potential collaborations, Wing said.
“We are bringing it back home to educational content for Arkansans so that we can grow and make sure that this public television model works for the next generation,” he said.
When asked if Arkansas TV has any processes to ensure its original programming is unbiased, Wing said the network will work with the state Department of Education to “make sure that anything that goes through our educational content matches Arkansas standards.”
The education department did not have any documentation related to those efforts, a spokesperson said in response to a public records request from the Advocate.
PBS programs will continue airing on Arkansas TV until June 30 unless the commission votes to reverse its decision to disaffiliate. 
A viewer from Jasper said PBS shows are providing “a positive alternative to graphic violence and sex seen on mainstream television.” Holmes agreed that PBS’ kids’ shows can’t be replicated anywhere else.
“The other stuff that’s free is just crap and not good for brains, and especially not good for autistic brains,” Holmes said. “So this loss is really big for us.”

(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)After North Carolina’s two largest medical providers halted gender-affirming care for patients below the age of 19, trans youth in the state are left with few options for treatment.
Ahead of a looming Trump administration crackdown on treatments like hormone replacement therapy — which substitutes sex-related hormones like estrogen or testosterone to physically transition patients’ bodies to align with their gender identity — for patients 18 and younger, Advocate Health and UNC Health have ended such gender-affirming care for anyone under 19.
“It’s very disappointing that they would do this,” said Ivy Johnson, an attorney with the ACLU of North Carolina. “It’s completely ignoring the fact that 18-year-olds are adults in this country, and I think it’s irresponsible to discontinue care for people who’ve already been under a certain course of treatment.”
The restrictions adopted by UNC Health and Advocate Health exceed a North Carolina law passed in 2023 over then-Gov. Roy Cooper’s veto that barred minors from receiving gender-affirming care, but exempted patients already undergoing treatment due to health risks associated with halting care.

Just eight days into his second term, President Donald Trump issued an executive order directing the Health and Human Services Department to crack down on medical interventions such as puberty blockers, hormone replacement therapy, and other treatments aimed at facilitating gender transition for patients under 19.
That manifested in December as a set of HHS regulations that would condition Medicare, Medicaid, and Children’s Health Insurance Program for hospitals on compliance with federal restrictions on gender-affirming care, among other measures intended to pressure health care providers.
Now, trans youth in North Carolina who are not yet 19 will be forced to halt their care, find alternate providers in a state with dwindling options, or leave the state for treatment.
Heron Greenesmith, deputy director of the Transgender Law Center, stressed that the proposed HHS restrictions are not set to take effect for months, and that hospitals choosing to end care early are doing so voluntarily. “Right now, there is no ban.”
“Pre-compliance has been a problem for trans-supporting, trans-inclusive organizations and agencies across the country, not just for trans-affirming care,” Greenesmith said. “It could be fear for funding or for retribution from the federal government.”
While federal opposition to gender-affirming care focuses on health risks of procedures — with Trump’s executive order warning that some recipients “will never be able to conceive children of their own or nurture their children through breastfeeding” — Johnson and Greenesmith both warned of complications from suddenly stopping gender-affirming care.
“You’ll have physical changes that can be rapid,” Greenesmith said. “The return of dysphoria is going to be a big impact and that obviously has mental health impacts, including an increased risk of suicidality and suicidal ideation, and then the other kind of emotional and mental health crises, anxiety, depression, PTSD.”
Advocate Health, which oversees state provider Atrium Health, implemented the restrictions in August. UNC Health began notifying patients in September that care would be discontinued, though no public announcement accompanied the policy shift. Both hospital systems have been connecting affected patients with support resources, including a newly established 24/7 hotline at Advocate aimed at providing counseling.
UNC Health spokesman Alan Wolf said in a statement that concerns over the federal regulatory environment prompted the decision to restrict care.
“UNC Health follows state and federal law related to medical services around gender transition. While state law limits these services to patients 18 and older, given the unsettled state of federal guidelines, last year we began limiting these services to individuals age 19 or older,” Wolf said. “UNC Health remains committed to caring and treating all patients.”
In comments to NC Health News last year, Advocate Health raised similar concerns: “This new policy allows our hospitals, clinics and pharmacies to continue caring for all patients’ health needs in the changing federal environment.”
Duke Health, whose policy on gender-affirming care for minors remains unchanged according to their website, now has a several-months wait for those wishing to switch to their services.
“Due to increasing demand, we are currently booking new patient appointments several months out,” the page for the Duke Child and Adolescent Gender Care Clinic reads. “We are working on strategies to accommodate this increased demand. Thank you for your patience.”
Duke Health did not respond to multiple requests for comment on their gender-affirming care policies or whether patients who have lost access to care from other providers may receive expedited appointments.

The HHS restrictions are the subject of a federal lawsuit led by Oregon and joined by 18 other states, including the District of Columbia. At the state level, hospitals themselves are facing litigation. In Colorado, several families sued Children’s Hospital Colorado in state court over its suspension of gender-affirming care for minors, which has halted treatment for around 800 patients.
But North Carolina officials have declined to take action. Attorney General Jeff Jackson did not join the challenge to the administration’s policies, despite participating in a series of high-profile lawsuits against Trump executive actions last year, meaning state providers will not benefit from any injunction against the HHS restrictions.
North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services spokeswoman Summer Tonizzo said in a statement that “gender dysphoria care is not covered by any NC Medicaid plans,” citing the 2023 state law, when asked about the department’s response to hospital restrictions.
Johnson, the ACLU NC attorney, said she believes hospitals may be illegally discriminating against patients on the basis of sex by suspending gender-affirming care.
“This seems unconstitutional and dangerous on the part of these hospitals, whose functions are otherwise supposed to be to provide medically necessary care to their patients,” Johnson said. “I would encourage people to reach out to us.”

(Greg Jordan | Bluefield Daily Telegraph) After two widespread flooding events hit communities in both southern and northern West Virginia last year, taking lives and wrecking numerous structures, the Legislature is eyeing changes to how money could be disbursed following such catastrophes.
Two similar bills — House Bill 4018 and Senate Bill 390 — are advancing through the Legislature’s separate bodies. They would revise the rules that dictate how money is given out from the state’s Flood Resiliency Trust Fund and what projects or individuals qualify as being a priority for funding.
While it’s early in the session, those two bills — plus one to require dredging in flood-prone waterways to lower the likelihood of flooding — are the only ones introduced so far this session related to flooding. Meanwhile, flooding disasters are likely to become more commonplace in the state as floodplains grow and as prevention efforts stall.
Both HB 4018 and SB 390 would give the State Resiliency Officer authority to disburse funds to individuals, local governments, state agencies or other organizations after a flooding event as long as the projects align with the state’s official Flood Resiliency Plan.
They would require that at least half of all money given through the trust fund goes toward “nature-based solutions,” including restoring wetlands and improving floodplains, buying out flood-prone properties or helping residents relocate out of high-risk areas. A portion of the funding would be specifically set aside for property acquisition and similar mitigation efforts.
Local governments seeking funding would need to adopt or commit to flood-related standards, including hazard mitigation planning, emergency operations plans and, in some cases, participation in the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Community Rating System.
Overall, any dollars distributed through the trust fund must be used to enhance flood prevention, with particular emphasis on low-income communities and those that have experienced repeated flooding.
But even if new guidelines for spending are adopted by the Legislature, the fund they apply to — the state’s Flood Resiliency Trust Fund — remains empty as it has never been allocated money since its inception in 2023. Neither has the state’s Flood Recovery Trust Fund. 
While Gov. Patrick Morrisey is asking to move $10 million to the Flood Resiliency Trust Fund in his proposed state budget, that money would go toward developing a warning system to give residents in flood-prone areas more notice and, hopefully, save lives.
Money to help with recovery and prevent devastating flooding in the first place, however, would still be lacking.
Under former Gov. Jim Justice, the Republican-controlled Legislature repeatedly opted against sending money to the trust fund despite requests from Justice, even while leaders boasted about record-setting revenue coming into the state.
In the House of Delegates this past legislative session, only 19 lawmakers — every Democrat in the House and 10 Republicans — voted in support of an amendment to the proposed state budget that would have put $50 million in the fund.
Last June, after flooding in northern West Virginia cost nine people their lives, Morrisey said he planned to have “additional discussions with the Legislature and others about the importance of flood prevention.”
But in his State of the State address earlier this month, the only flood measure mentioned by Morrisey was the early warning system; overall flood prevention or recovery was not made a priority and funding for either initiative remains lacking.
Earlier this month, disaster recovery experts told members of the Legislature’s Joint Committee on Flooding that a lack of funds were making it difficult for case managers to help individuals with long-term recovery, including issues related to housing, rebuilding and more.
Lora Pierce, a disaster recovery specialist with Catholic Charities West Virginia, said that acute recovery — mucking out buildings, removing fallen trees, meeting immediate resource needs for those impacted by flooding — isn’t much of a problem in the state because there are so many groups that volunteer.
“It’s that long-term recovery, six months after the fact when all of the immediate needs may have been met,” Pierce said. “The biggest challenge and hurdle is having disaster case managers work with these people on their recovery to get them back to a safe and secure home.”
Pierce said nearly all long-term recovery efforts are taken on by volunteers. In some events — including last year’s flooding in Southern West Virginia — Pierce said there are “no disaster case managers at all” to help with recovery. Part of this, she said, is because there is little money available to pay people for these necessary services. 
Because there is not any state money put aside for flood recovery, Pierce said any funds that do come in for communities are either from local charities and nonprofit organizations or from the federal government.
Pierce said she would like to see the state remodel its trust funds to reflect the federal government’s to ensure that families receive money directly, but also that case managers and other necessary positions can be filled and compensated.
Nearly $41 million was distributed federally to families affected by flooding in the coalfields last February. That money was necessary, Pierce said, but she questioned how things will look in the future given the instability at the FEMA.
Catherine Carr Clinch, president of Tidal Basin, a disaster service provider, told lawmakers in the same meeting they should be aware that “it’s unclear what the future of funding for the federal government (following disasters) looks like.”
“FEMA’s role is changing, and the agency may no longer have the same capacity or ability to support the states,” Clinch said. “… We strongly advise you to consider funding (the Flood Resiliency Trust Fund and the Flood Recovery Trust Fund).”
HB 4018 is currently under consideration by the House Committee on Government Organization. SB 390 will be on first reading in the Senate on Monday.

(Getty Images)Wolverines in the Lower 48 states were trapped, hunted and poisoned to near extinction in the late 1800s and early 1900s and have not recovered, just the opposite in fact. It took court action by the Alliance for the Wild Rockies and other conservation groups to finally get the dwindling population listed as “threatened” under the Endangered Species Act in 2023.
The federal government is legally required to designate “critical habitat” to protect ecosystems for the recovery of threatened and endangered species, but has failed to do so for wolverines, which are hanging on by the thinnest of threads. To stave off extinction, we need to protect the habitat in which they can survive — a challenge now further exacerbated by an increasingly hot climate diminishing the deep snows they require for denning and food storage.
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service noted that wolverine populations are relatively small, fragmented and isolated from larger populations in Canada. The Fish and Wildlife Service estimated that roughly 50 wolverines occupied the Idaho/Montana linkage area at the time of listing. They also estimated that roughly 63 wolverines live in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.
It’s estimated there are only 318 wolverines remaining in the entire Lower 48 states. Scientists believe the “effective population,” which is the number of individuals capable of reproducing and contributing to the next generation, is likely less than 40.
You read that right, fewer than 40 wolverines are currently capable of keeping the species from going extinct in the contiguous U.S. And what is the U.S. Fish and Wild Service doing to recover wolverines as required by law? Not much.
To protect the ecosystems upon which wolverines depend, the Endangered Species Act requires the Fish and Wildlife Service to designate “critical habitat” — the areas that provide the secure habitat where they are protected from threats like incidental trapping and can successfully reproduce.
The designation of “critical habitat” includes those areas occupied by the species at the time of listing that possess the physical and biological features such as food, water and shelter needed for survival and recovery. These areas may also include areas not yet occupied but needed for future population growth.
Because critical habitat designation is essential to the conservation of the species, special management consideration or protections may be required. The designation also guides federal actions to prevent destruction or modification of this habitat, thereby increasing species’ chances of recovery.
Unfortunately the Fish and Wildlife Service has not followed the law, has not designated critical habitat, and is shirking its duty to keep wolverines from extinction — which is why the Alliance for the Wild Rockies and our fellow plaintiffs recently filed a lawsuit in federal district court in Montana.
Although the majority (95%) of wolverine habitat in the Lower 48 states is federally owned and managed by the U.S. Forest Service, there are no regulatory mechanisms or standards in Forest Service Land and Resource Management Plans to protect wolverines and their habitat. Not only is nothing being done to protect and restore wolverines and the ecosystems upon which they depend, the Forest Service has announced a massive 25% increase in national forest logging, in effect, destroying what critical habitat may be left on public lands.
The Fish and Wildlife Service has failed — and continues to fail — to comply with its mandatory, non-discretionary, duty to designate critical habitat for wolverines as required by Section 4 of the Endangered Species Act. To maintain and recover the species our choice was either take the delinquent agency to court or watch wolverines dwindle into extinction. We sided with the wolverines and are being represented by the Western Environmental Law Center.

,Mississippi Today,2026-01-26 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Mississippi retains law firm to monitor prison-health contract after reports of alleged denial of care,Michael Goldberg and Gwen Dilworth,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/26/prison-health-care-mississippi-law-firm-monitor-contract-denial/,The company has increasingly come under scrutiny after a state lawmaker raised the alarm about numerous inmates suffering from treatable illnesses and Mississippi Today began investigating the alleged routine denial of health care in Mississippi prisons.,"The audio version of this story is AI generated and is not human reviewed. It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
The Mississippi Department of Corrections quietly entered into an agreement with a powerful law firm last summer to monitor its private medical contractor after Mississippi Today reports of alleged denial of health care in state prisons. 
The move comes after the state Legislature instructed the department to deliver a report on the contractor’s performance and nearly a year after the agency entered into a medical services contract worth hundreds of millions of dollars it was responsible for overseeing. The Corrections Department hired Butler Snow, a politically connected law firm in Mississippi that has defended prison systems and private prison health contractors in civil rights lawsuits alleging health care failures in several states, to monitor its prison medical contract, a letter obtained by Mississippi Today reveals. 
The letter, which has not previously been reported, from Corrections Commissioner Burl Cain to Senate Appropriations Chairman Briggs Hopson, a Republican from Vicksburg, says a Butler Snow attorney will manage a team “experienced in correctional healthcare management” to conduct contract oversight. The state Personnel Board approved the agreement with Butler Snow in August, the letter says.  
Kansas-based VitalCore Health Strategies, LLC, holds a three-year contract worth over $357 million to provide medical services to people incarcerated in Mississippi prisons. The company has increasingly come under scrutiny after a state lawmaker raised the alarm about numerous inmates suffering from treatable illnesses and Mississippi Today began investigating the alleged routine denial of health care in Mississippi prisons. 
Mississippi Today’s Behind Bars, Beyond Care series has documented potentially thousands of people living with hepatitis C going without treatment, an untreated broken arm that resulted in amputation and delayed cancer screenings one woman said led to a terminal diagnosis. One ex-corrections official said people are experiencing widespread medical neglect in Mississippi’s prisons and turned over internal messages bemoaning the contractor’s care to Mississippi Today. 
In a statement, VitalCore spokesperson Timothy Keck said the company would comply with the new team monitoring its work.
“VitalCore’s commitment to our patients is the same regardless of any oversight,” Keck said. “We will comply with any audit and inspection and will fully engage with the MDOC in that process.”
MDOC spokesperson Kate Head did not respond to a request for comment. 
The agreement with the Department of Corrections tasks Butler Snow with compiling a team that includes a licensed physician, a licensed mental health professional and a person with experience in correctional health care management. The team will complete an initial review of health and mental health services, identify urgent performance issues and develop tools to monitor the contractor’s work. It will also recommend clawbacks — or the recovery of funds already paid — for contract requirements that are not met. 
Many of the issues the monitoring team will review, such as infectious disease control and infirmary operations, mirror concerns raised by Rep. Becky Currie, chairwoman of the House Corrections Committee, who has been attempting to pass new legislation forcing the Corrections Department and VitalCore to improve their delivery of medical care to prisoners. 
Currie, a Republican from Brookhaven, tried to introduce a sweeping set of reforms in 2025 that included giving the Mississippi State Department of Health the authority to monitor prison health care. The bill was defeated, in part due to opposition from the Office of Gov. Tate Reeves, who wanted to award monitoring authority to a private firm, according to Currie. 
“Yet, we spend $700,000 on a report,” Currie previously said to Mississippi Today. 
Butler Snow received a one-year contract worth $687,000 for these services. According to the letter to Hopson, the Department of Corrections held an orientation meeting with the compliance team Nov. 10 and crafted a site visit schedule, beginning with a visit to the Central Mississippi Correctional Center in “early 2026.”
Butler Snow has been paid about $249,000 so far for its monitoring work, according to state records. 
The initial contract year with Butler Snow does not include review of dental, dialysis, vision, discharge planning or long-term care. In a December report, the state’s legislative watchdog agency found that Mississippi prisoners were likely left without adequate dental care for months as the state’s private prison health care contractor failed to meet staffing requirements and the Department of Corrections failed to document the problem.
A bill passed by lawmakers in 2025 ordered the Department of Corrections to use $690,000 of funds clawed back from VitalCore to monitor and review the health contract and provide a report to lawmakers by Dec. 15. 
Currie believed she would have a completed audit in hand heading into the 2026 legislative sessions. But she learned in late December that the monitoring team had only just been retained, and their work had not begun, she said.
“Everyone left thinking that we were getting an audit and we appropriated money to do it,” Currie said. “Not getting an audit that we were promised has haunted so much.”
Currie has again introduced a wide range of reforms in 2026. 
This year’s bills would establish a corrections ombudsman to investigate health care related complaints, establish hepatitis C and HIV treatment programs, provide kiosks for prisoners to request medical attention and require correctional officers to wear body cameras. But most of the bills have been double-referred, meaning they must be passed by two committees before a full vote. That is sometimes a sign that a bill doesn’t have the support of a chamber’s leadership.
William “Bill” Lunsford, the Butler Snow attorney MDOC tapped to lead the contract monitoring team, has represented the Alabama Department of Corrections in civil rights cases, defending the agency against claims of inadequate health care. Since 2018, the corrections agency has paid him over $40 million for legal services, according to Alabama Department of Finance online records. 
Lunsford has defended the department in Braggs vs. Alabama Department of Corrections, a lawsuit filed in 2014 by people incarcerated in Alabama and the Alabama Disabilities Advocacy Program that alleged the agency denied health care. The lawsuit alleged prisoners were denied hepatitis C treatment, echoing claims from people incarcerated in Mississippi, and that prisoners lost the use of their arms and legs after medical treatment was denied or delayed. A similar case played out in Mississippi when a man with a broken arm had a limb amputated after he was allegedly denied care. 
Lunsford previously sat on the board of YesCare, a Tennessee-based private prison medical contractor formerly called Corizon Health, Inc. He also defended Corizon in a class action lawsuit filed by people in Idaho Department of Corrections custody living with hepatitis C who alleged the agency refused to administer treatment in line with standards of care. 
In July, Lunsford and two of his colleagues at Butler Snow were disqualified by a federal judge in a case where he represented former Alabama Department of Corrections Commissioner Jeff Dunn, after one of Lunsford’s colleagues admitted to inadvertently including made-up citations generated by artificial intelligence in court filings. 
Lunsford has litigated and resolved numerous class actions against correctional agencies and vendors and regularly advises clients on compliance and liability issues related to correctional health care standards, according to his profile on Butler Snow’s website. 
Butler Snow also wrote the Mississippi Department of Correction’s request for proposals for the medical contract. 
Lunsford did not respond to Mississippi Today’s request for comment. 
The agreement with Butler Snow raises questions about whether MDOC was monitoring the medical contract before it retained the law firm last summer. 
The contract executed by the agency in October 2024 tasked the department with monitoring the contract, including reviewing service levels, quality of care and administrative practices, meeting with VitalCore to address issues, conducting site visits and inspections and reviewing third-party reimbursements, according to the contract. The agency did not respond to Mississippi Today’s questions about its prior monitoring activities. 
In the agency’s request for proposals for a medical contractor in 2023, it wrote that the agency “does not employ any licensed personnel responsible with oversight of its contracted healthcare provider,” but said it planned to reestablish a medical compliance office within three to six months of executing the contract. 
At that time, VitalCore had served as the agency’s medical contractor since 2020 after being awarded four no-bid emergency contracts worth $324 million for the services. Combined with its current role, VitalCore has been awarded about $682 million in Mississippi corrections contracts.
This year, the agency requested an additional $250,000 in funding from the state Legislature to fund five program auditor positions to provide oversight of the contracted medical provider. 
“The presence of Program Auditors will instill confidence in both our organization and the public that we are fulfilling our duty to provide essential care and safeguard the health and well-being of the inmates entrusted to our care,” the agency’s budget request said.
VitalCore has struggled to meet the terms of its contract. According to documents obtained by Mississippi Today, the Department of Corrections clawed back $4.6 million from VitalCore during the 2025 fiscal year. Mississippi Today reported in June that even as the agency was clawing back funds for unmet requirements, VitalCore requested and received an additional $4 million to cover the increased costs of providing health care.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/17162611/MT-Prison-Health-FeatImage-02.jpg,,,2026-01-26 06:57:06.815397

Read that again. Thank you, Anitra Hamilton and Kayla Young. Wish there were 132 more of you. 
On the other side of the aisle, there’s nine Republican women in the House and four in the Senate.
Some facts: The Mountain State has the lowest percentage of Democrat and female lawmakers in the nation. Democrats — about 8%. Women — about 11%. 
Is that why we rank dead last in nearly every metric of family prosperity and wellness? Hmmm. Let me think. I’ll get back to you on that. Just kidding. 
Women are half the population. Yet their voices fall on many deaf ears. West Virginia has yet to have a female governor. And only one female member of the U.S Senate or House. 
It was inspirational watching Virginia elect their first female governor this year. 
Good news: Our five largest cities all had female mayors at one time. Morgantown has had six. They currently have Mayor Danielle Trumble. 
Charleston’s first female mayor is the current one: Amy Shuler Goodwin. She’s adroitly captained a Charleston revival of sorts. Emphasizes outdoor activities and fitness, arts, music and entertainment. 
Goodwin brought the much beloved Sternwheel Regatta festival back from the brink. And found a way for Charleston to host the five-year USA Cycling Pro Road National Championships. 
Her vision has strengthened West Virginia families. This is telling. Statistically, female politicians put forward more pro-family policies. 
And we’d be remiss not to praise Charlene Marshall in Morgantown. Now in her 90s, she moves like a spry 80-year-old, mind sharp as a quill. She was Morgantown’s mayor from 1991 to 1998, as well as West Virginia’s first Black mayor. She also served over a decade in the House of Delegates as a Democrat. 
So why so few women in politics? Here’s one reason: many women are taught to fear their own voice. Taught to “make nice.” Believe that a difference of opinion is bad. 
The reality? Healthy discord is fantastic. Honest, decisive opinions are signs of strength and female autonomy. Woman as their own person apart from men. In contrast, passive agreement is the devil’s dogma. It makes women invisible. 
Sometimes silence is a choice. Other times men simply talk over women or ignore them. Shameful. 
Some interesting research findings: Men and women speak and write in about the same amount, just under different circumstances. Women tend to talk more in personal and social settings. Text more. Men often speak more in business, formal and hierarchical settings. They also statistically dominate online forums and debates. Women are no less intelligent. Do not have less merit. Much is the result of sexism.
Studies also reveal the success of visibility bias. This means, the loudest voice is listened to first. Loud does not equate with smart. But we give those voices more airtime.  
Conservatives, steeped in more patriarchal values, are fragile as cicada wings. Snow. The fragility is visible in the numbers. Do they not believe women capable of leading men? Apparently not. In the U.S. House of Representatives, there are more than twice as many female Democrats as female Republicans. In the U.S. Senate, female Democrats are three times more common than their Republican counterparts. I mean, wow. 
At the state level, as of 2024, across America, women comprised 31% of Democratic legislators — and only 15% of Republican ones. That’s bananas. 
Here’s the thing: Women run the world — dominating fields in health care and education, having and rearing babies — but men rule it. Often with an iron fist. Think Donald Trump, Xi Jinping, Kim Jong Un, Vladimir Putin. I could go on. You get the idea. 
But societies are changing. More men are dismantling sexism. Some good old boys clubs are gender integrating. Businesses are hiring and promoting more women. 
Bottom line? Times are evolving. Slowly. Surely.  Women: Run for office. Speak up. Support other women. Cheer them on. Don’t go along to get along. And men? Stop and listen.

Weisman/Rhode Island Current)When teams of volunteers fan out across Rhode Island after dark Tuesday on a mission that will take them through parks, alongside highway ramps, and into alleyways and parking lots, they will need to dress warmly.
The weather forecast calls for the temperature to drop as low as six degrees in Providence. But the number that will matter the most is how many people are spending the overnight hours outside.
At least 60 volunteers are signed up to conduct the state’s annual Point in Time Count, a federally mandated census that creates a snapshot of how many people are homeless on a winter’s night. The data collected from every state is used to determine federal funding.
Jessica Lachey, director of development at Thrive Behavioral Healthcare in Warwick, will be participating in the annual census for the third consecutive year. But she and other volunteers stop by encampments all year long. During cold weather, they often pass out blankets and propane tanks to keep homeless Rhode Islanders warm. 
“We basically do this every day,” Lachey said. “We’ll bring a lot of warming gear.”
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) requires every state’s Continuum of Care program — the network of agencies and nonprofits that manage a state’s homelessness response — to conduct the annual Point in Time Count.
The date of the count varies from state to state — HUD’s only requirement is that it be done within the last 10 days of January — but the goal is the same all over the country: create a snapshot of the number of individuals experiencing homelessness on a given night during the coldest time of the year when people are more likely to use shelters.
“That does typically make it easier to count, but we’ll still be outside,” said Partaja “PJ” Spann, director of Rhode Island outreach for Newport Mental Health.
Both Newport Mental Health and Thrive are Rhode Island Continuum of Care member agencies.
Unlike prior year counts, the state’s Executive Office of Housing is responsible for overseeing volunteers — a job previously handled by the Rhode Island Coalition to End Homelessness.
State steps in to coordinate R.I.’s 2026 homeless census

The coalition will continue to clean, validate and analyze the data to submit the estimate of the state’s unhoused population to the federal government.
The final numbers will likely be submitted in April, Jenna Thomas, the coalition’s data coordinator of the state’s portion of the Homeless Management Information System, told the Rhode Island Continuum of Care board during its Jan. 7 meeting.
That’s earlier than last year when Rhode Island’s final count was submitted in June and formally presented before the state’s Continuum of Care board in September. Volunteers counted at least 2,373 unhoused individuals across the state on the night of Jan. 21, 2025 —  representing a 2.8% decrease from the record high of 2,442 in 2024.
Volunteer training is still the primary responsibility of the coalition, which produced a 17-minute video detailing how to use the state’s database. When locating unsheltered clients, volunteers must note the person’s living situation, their location, and how long they’ve been outside.
The methodology on how to approach the count follows core guidelines established by HUD. The guidelines cover how to remove duplicate data, ensure direct interaction with homeless persons, and where surveyors should go the census night.
Thomas said guidance has usually been updated on an annual basis. But during a December call with homeless data administrators from across the country, she said HUD confirmed no new notice was coming for the 2026 count and that continuum boards should use last year’s guidance.
HUD did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
7 p.m. start
Surveys for the Point in Time Count can be done for a week following the “blitz” night taking place Tuesday — as many teams likely can’t get into every encampment. The coalition’s guidance allows surveyors to visit shelters and other warming centers where they can ask where clients were during the night of the Point in Time Count. 
Emily Marshall, spokesperson for the state’s Executive Office of Housing, said about eight teams have been assembled to go out starting around 7 p.m. They’ll cover Providence, Pawtucket, along with municipalities in northern Rhode Island and in Bristol, Kent, Newport, and Washington counties.
“Teams are built intentionally to balance experience and local knowledge, ensuring coverage of both highly visible locations and more hidden or remote areas,” Marshall said in an email.
Lachey said her team expected to wrap up their survey by 11 p.m. Thrive’s outreach team is constantly out around Kent County connecting with people at known encampment locations to ensure they’re comfortable the night of the count.
“People who are unhoused have a lot of distrust in the system,” she said. “But when you see these people day in and day out — now we have a relationship, and they talk.” 
It’s the same approach Spann’s team of volunteers in Newport have taken. While the center’s outreach team likely won’t get to every encampment on Aquidneck Island Tuesday, she said individuals and their locations are fairly well-known ahead of time.
“They’re familiar faces,” Spann said. “It’s very rare we come across an encampment or an individual we have never had contact with.”
Some people are more willing to discuss their living arrangements or other personal identification than others. Spann said surveyors honor the privacy of those who don’t want to share information.
“We’re just trying to get a head count for numbers,” she said. “Data drives the narratives, the grants and the funding — getting accurate data is the first step so we know how to support the exact number of people we need to support.”

Wes Moore (D) greets Fred Hoover, then-chair of the Maryland Public Service Commission, following an executive order signing in Annapolis, on Dec. 19, 2025. (Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)The recent leadership shake-up at Maryland’s Public Service Commission came as Gov. Wes Moore (D) was seeking a fresh direction for the board, which regulates gas and electric utilities in the state.
The governor announced earlier this month that he had selected Kumar Barve, a longtime state delegate who has served on the Commission since 2023, after a resignation from Chair Fred Hoover, a former director of the Maryland Energy Administration and assistant people’s counsel.
“In high-performing organizations, rotating leadership at regular intervals is a smart and normal practice,” wrote Ammar Moussa, a spokesman for the governor, in response to questions from Maryland Matters about the change.
To the Moore administration, the goal of the swap is to better address continued high electric bills for Maryland consumers.
“At a time when too many families are struggling with skyrocketing utility costs, we look forward to the Commission continuing to act with urgency to protect Marylanders and ensure no one is pushed to the brink — or bankrupted — just to keep the lights on and their homes warm,” Moussa wrote.
Some argued the governor’s decision was unsurprising, given his continued dissatisfaction about high electric bills, as an election year dawns.
But other observers, including consumer and environmental advocates, called the move a rare and troubling intervention by the governor in the dealings of a body that is largely independent from the executive branch.

The governor has the power to nominate commissioners and nominate the chair, but can only remove people from the commission for incompetence or misconduct. Notably, Hoover will continue serving on the commission, with his new term extending through 2029. But he will no longer hold the noteworthy agenda-setting powers of the chair.
In a statement, Hoover said it has been “a tremendous honor to serve the people of Maryland as chair of the Public Service Commission.”
“I look forward to continued collaboration with Chair Barve and my fellow commissioners in this new capacity. We have been and will continue to be strong, unified partners in the important work of the Commission,” Hoover said.
Both men appeared side-by-side during an energy hearing Tuesday before the House Environment and Transportation Committee, though Barve took a leading role.
Since they swapped terms, both Barve and Hoover must be re-confirmed by the Maryland Senate.
The timing of the move raised some eyebrows among advocates, who noted that the PSC under Hoover recently made several consequential decisions that went against gas and electric companies.
In late December, the commission denied BGE’s request to collect an additional $152.3 million from ratepayers for a “true-up,” citing the company’s “substantial overruns” of approved budgets. Instead, it let BGE collect about half that amount, which will still add 72 cents to the average household’s monthly electric bill, and $1.95 to the average home’s gas bill, starting next month.
Earlier in 2025, the PSC issued a policy requiring new gas customers to pay the full cost for pipeline extensions to their properties, instead of letting companies spread the cost among existing ratepayers.
It is rare to see state officials intervene with the sitting members of their public utilities board, who are traditionally seen as separate from politics, said Matt Kasper, deputy director for the Energy and Policy Institute. But when it does happen, there is an “elephant in the room” — the utilities, who wield immense influence and retain ranks of lobbyists, Kasper said.
“You’re left wondering: Did the utilities pressure the legislature, or pressure the governor, to make that change?” Kasper said. “That’s what I’m left wondering here.”
Barve pushed back on that notion.










We have become much more keenly aware of costs, and we’ve been micromanaging to a degree that previous Public Service Commissions may not have. I certainly anticipate that we’re going to continue that diligence into the future.


– Kumar Barve, acting chair of the Maryland Public Service Commission


“This is about serving the ratepayers in the state of Maryland,” Barve said. “We’re honest brokers. We don’t have to raise campaign contributions. We don’t have to run for office. We have fixed terms to do what we believe is the right thing.”
Barve argued that the PSC will continue to closely scrutinize utilities’ spending plans under his leadership.
“We have become much more keenly aware of costs, and we’ve been micromanaging to a degree that previous Public Service Commissions may not have,” Barve said. “I certainly anticipate that we’re going to continue that diligence into the future.”
Christine Pendzich, a steering committee member at Maryland Third Act, a climate and democracy group for people over 60, said she found the leadership change unusual.
“From everything I understand, it’s very unusual for a Public Service Commission chair to step down before the end of his term,” said Pendzich, who has focused on energy issues and the PJM grid as co-chair of Maryland Third Act’s energy working groups.
It is “notable,” Pendzich said, that Hoover didn’t share an explanation for his departure. “One does think that the governor must have weighed in,” she said.
“The sense of the community is that he [Barve] is a little bit more politically inclined to do probably what the governor would want, rather than really balancing costs and benefits between utilities and ratepayers,” Pendzich said.
Moore, other PJM governors push for changes at the nation’s biggest electric grid

Jorge Aguilar, southern region director for advocacy group Food and Water Watch, said, “The new PSC needs to tackle these eye-popping electricity bills while rejecting the insane pro-data center frenzy that will burden ratepayers with the cost of new gas and nuclear power plants.”
Adding to Kasper’s concern are documents he recently uncovered from the governor’s office, using a public information request, that showed that American Gas Association official Juan Alvarado was the only nongovernmental employee allowed to sit in on Moore’s interviews of possible PSC appointees after he took office in 2023.
“I’ve published some information to show that the Moore administration has allowed utility influence behind the scenes,” Kasper said. “I’m left wondering … is there a coziness here?”
The Moore administration defended the involvement of the association, a trade group representing gas companies, arguing that it was purely informative. Moussa wrote that “it was not uncommon for industry experts to serve as consultants or references during the board or commission placement process.”
“Highly technical knowledge, like that required to serve on the PSC, requires appropriate insight to ensure appropriate placement. Serving in a separate capacity, consultants or references have no decision-making role and no vote on placement.”
Moore nominated Alvarado to the PSC in February 2023, but Alvarado withdrew from consideration, citing “personal reasons,” amid concerns from climate groups.
To Emily Scarr, senior adviser for Maryland PIRG, the gas industry’s presence at the meeting was “entirely inappropriate, and raises serious concerns.”
“The concern is when there is a perception that only certain people are in the room, or when things are happening behind closed doors the public isn’t aware of,” Scarr said.
Josh Tulkin, executive director of the Maryland Sierra Club, said he asked the Moore administration to attend the meetings, and was “told that non-government officials were not invited.”
But for some in Annapolis, the PSC’s recent moves aiming to rein in electric and gas utility spending may have come too little, too late.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In an interview after the leadership change, Maryland Senate President Bill Ferguson (D- Baltimore City) argued that the commission lost its way, and did not do enough to anticipate and slow down rate hikes.
“I want them to have a laser-like focus on affordability,” Ferguson said. “The pendulum swung away from from affordability, and really was exclusively on reliability and and climate purposes.”
Ferguson said, though, that the commission should “absolutely” take continued steps to scrutinize utility costs, like they did in the BGE decision in December.
“I think certainly BGE is still doing fine without the reconciliation from the last three-year rate hike,” Ferguson said. “We need in-depth analysis to make sure that any request of any additional dollars — and the potential of reducing rates — is the driving focus of the work moving forward.”
Del. C.T. Wilson (D- Charles), who worked closely on energy policy last session during his time as Economic Matters chairman, agreed. He argued that a commission leadership change was “bound to happen” amid continued blowback about high electric bills from voters. The commission also came to “repeated loggerheads” with the General Assembly, Wilson said.
He said the commission was acting more as a “rubber stamp” at a time when decisive action was needed to curtail rates before they became too high a burden. And last January, prices became a political flashpoint as legislators arrived in Annapolis.
“As a state, we’ve become wholly unprepared for what’s getting ready to hit us,” Wilson said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC02777-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-26 07:57:44.827014

The Trump administration’s abuse of the state has caused anguish and loss for its residents, including those who voted for President Donald Trump. He has obliterated trust with the state, and it no longer makes sense for Colorado to treat the federal government as a partner.
The state would better serve its people if it took aggressive steps to disengage from the federal government, protect residents from Trump’s malevolence, and assume more responsibility for serving Coloradans.
In other words, it should pursue a “soft secession.”

Individual and allied states soft secede when under federalism they leverage their autonomy to practice noncooperation with federal authority, which they substitute with their own systems.
Federal abuse in the past year is hard to exaggerate. Trump’s mass deportation program has resulted in newsmaking abuses in Minnesota, California, Illinois and Oregon, for example, but it has also disrupted lives and trampled rights in Colorado. In just one representative example, federal authorities targeted Denver immigrant rights activist Jeanette Vizguerra over protected speech, then they kept her locked up for nine months until a judge ruled she was entitled to a bond hearing.
Immigration arrests in Colorado dramatically increased in the last year, and the cases often involve scant due process. More than a third of arrests in 2025 involved people who had no criminal charges or convictions.
In addition to the harm he’s caused generally across the country, Trump has inflicted many forms of retaliation specifically against Colorado. He denied the state disaster recovery funds for wildfire and flooding. He froze federal funds in Colorado for food and child care, prompting a lawsuit from the Colorado attorney general. He vetoed a bipartisan bill that would have supported a clean water project in the southeastern part of the state. He is relocating Space Command from Colorado Springs to Alabama. He’s breaking up the world-class atmospheric science hub NCAR in Boulder.
As U.S. Rep. Joe Neguse of Colorado said, “The president has declared war on our state.”
What can Colorado do?
The state can reinforce or forge alliances with other like-minded states. A model for this cooperation was established by the Democratic-led states, including Colorado, that formed the Governors Public Health Alliance in response to anti-science federal policies.
Conversely, the state can withdraw from alliances that have turned counterproductive, such as the National Governors Association, which includes the influence of Republican-led states whose leaders supported Trump’s deployment of military troops to Democratic-led cities.
Elected officials and state agencies in Colorado can strictly limit their cooperation and data-sharing with the federal government and step up the state’s own capacity to fill gaps where it previously relied on federal resources. It could start by abandoning the Colorado Information Analysis Center, one of the nation’s so-called fusion centers. These are anti-terrorism information-sharing hubs for state and federal partners under the Department of Homeland Security. Since the Trump administration labels virtually any American who opposes it a terrorist, and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem zealously bases her work on that perspective, the state’s participation in the center puts every Coloradan in danger.
Gov. Jared Polis has long been eager to share other forms of information with federal authorities, such as personal data about residents who live in Colorado without authorization. This posture not only puts members of the Colorado community at risk, it’s a form of complicity.
The state has billions of dollars it invests, and how it invests matters. The state treasurer’s office and the state pension plan, the Colorado Public Employees’ Retirement Association, can allow public money to support interests that boost authoritarianism or not. Millions in public money in Colorado backs such corporate bootlickers as Palantir, Amazon, Meta and Alphabet. A state can’t say it’s opposed to fascism if it funds fascism’s accomplices.
When federal agents commit crimes in Colorado, district attorneys and other state legal authorities can hold them accountable, including through prosecution. Federal agents are protected by the Constitution if the act in question is reasonable and performed as part of official duties. But they do not enjoy absolute immunity. Attorney General Phil Weiser took a step in this direction last week when his office launched an online complaint submission form through which community members can report misconduct by federal agents.
Earlier this month, Trump said the federal government will stop making payments to “sanctuary cities or states having sanctuary cities,” which includes Colorado. But revenue obligations go both ways.
Colorado sends billions more to the federal government than it gets in return. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has suggested his state — which is also deemed a sanctuary jurisdiction by the administration and also sends more money to the federal government than it receives — could cut off money from California to Washington. Newsom’s office has not explained how the state would do that.
But there are ways. Some have suggested that multiple states could enter a compact and hold federal taxes in trust until the administration ceases to attack them.
This could be among the most powerful measures in a program of soft secession.

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)As federal immigration enforcement activity increases in Democratic-led states across the country, immigrant advocates and civil rights groups are warning that Virginia — which recently flipped full control of state government to Democrats — could be next. 
Gov. Abigail Spanberger, sworn in earlier this month as Virginia’s 75th governor, has moved quickly to draw a line between state law enforcement and federal immigration enforcement, while acknowledging that much of the authority still rests outside her control.
Just hours after taking the oath of office on Jan. 17, Spanberger fulfilled a promise she made in an August interview with The Mercury, rescinding former Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s Executive Order 47. 
The order had directed Virginia State Police and the Department of Corrections to enter into so-called 287(g) agreements with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, effectively deputizing state officers to assist with federal immigration enforcement and encouraging local cooperation with ICE to identify and remove noncitizens accused or convicted of crimes.
Spanberger’s executive action marked a sharp policy reversal after years of Republican leadership in Richmond and came as immigration enforcement has intensified in blue states under President Donald Trump’s renewed push for large-scale deportations.
“My executive order, repealing Executive Order 47, was an important first step in ensuring that we are not moving or reallocating state and local resources away from the first-responder duties, whether it is investigating crimes or being ready to support a community in need,” Spanberger said last week.

She emphasized the prior order “had created some real challenges.”
“Ultimately, I am looking to every step forward that we can take as a commonwealth to ensure that our communities are safe and protected,” Spanberger continued, adding that confusion around law enforcement authority has fueled fear in immigrant communities. 
“Frankly, the fear and concern that we’ve seen in other places where people without any sort of designation — unannounced, wearing masks — are taking people off the streets, the level of fear that that’s created and the level of distrust and confusion is certainly not contributing to any strengthening of our communities, let alone keeping our communities safer.”
On Friday, members of Virginia’s Service Employees International Union chapters gathered outside a U.S. federal courthouse in Richmond to protest ICE enforcement, underscoring growing opposition from labor and immigrant advocates.
About 50 people attended the demonstration, where speakers criticized federal detention practices and read aloud the names of individuals who have been killed during ICE operations over the past year.
“We’re seeing the ICE escalate everywhere from from Minneapolis all the way here to Richmond,” said Violeta Vega, an SEIU member serving as an emcee for the gathering.
 State action, limited reach

While Spanberger’s order ends the requirement that state agencies enter into 287(g) agreements, it does not terminate existing contracts between ICE, state and local governments, regional jails or sheriffs’ offices. Nor does it prohibit new agreements at the local level.
All state and local agreements “remain in force until terminated” by one or both parties, a new Legal Aid Justice Center analysis found. There has been no evidence to date that any existing contracts between ICE and state or local law enforcement have been ended as a result of the governor’s action.
The report details how dozens of agencies across Virginia — including state agencies and regional jails — have contracted with ICE to perform duties that may exceed their authority or conflict with state law and the Virginia Constitution.
The analysis further found that at least 223 state and local personnel have been nominated to participate in 287(g) agreements, including two school resource officers and a behavioral health advocate. One facility — the Riverside Regional Jail in Prince George County — receives more than half of its revenue from holding people for ICE.
“Those local law enforcement agencies with 287(g) agreements now have a massive financial incentive to abandon their mission to protect communities in favor of terrorizing immigrant populations,” said Alex Kornya, LAJC’s director of litigation. 
“Contracts with ICE, often shrouded in secrecy, are not only a misuse of time and resources, but they also open these agencies up to significant liability, liability that Virginia taxpayers will ultimately pay.”
LAJC said many of the agreements were negotiated quietly, with agencies declining to provide information in response to public records requests — in some cases saying ICE instructed them not to respond.
According to ICE’s own website, there are currently at least 32 active 287(g) agreements in Virginia involving the state and local governments, and correctional facilities. Five are with state agencies, while the remainder involve local law enforcement.
ICE did not respond to a request for comment from The Mercury.
 Fear, trust and public safety

Civil rights groups, including LAJC, say the impact of these agreements extends beyond immigration enforcement, undermining trust between immigrant communities and local law enforcement.
“Governor Spanberger’s action to rescind EO 47 on her first day was an important step, as these contracts do nothing to make people safer,” said Rohmah Javed, legal director of LAJC’s Immigrant Justice Program, adding that immigrant communities across the state are terrified.
“These agreements erode trust, making it much less likely immigrants will seek out needed services, report crimes witnessed or crimes they have experienced as victims, or participate in their communities,” Javed said. “But we need to see immediate action at both the state and local levels to officially end these abusive agreements.”
The ACLU of Virginia called the order a first step toward ensuring state law enforcement is not used for federal immigration enforcement, while cautioning that existing contracts and federal authority remain unchanged.
“Governor Spanberger’s executive order recognizes that blurring the line between Virginia law enforcement and federal immigration agents not only diverts Virginia resources away from public safety priorities, but erodes public trust by terrorizing communities and breaking apart families,” ACLU of Virginia Executive Director Mary Bauer said.
 Republicans warn repeal of ICE order threatens public safety

Virginia GOP leaders, meanwhile, sharply criticized Spanberger’s decision, arguing that rescinding Youngkin’s order weakens cooperation with federal authorities and threatens public safety.
Youngkin himself told The Mercury in an interview earlier this month that rescinding his Executive Order 47 would be “a huge mistake,” calling it a necessary tool for combating violent crime and gang activity, particularly in Northern Virginia.
“That partnership has made Virginia safer. We arrested the number-three guy in MS-13; the number three guy in MS-13 was just living in Virginia that otherwise would have never been arrested,” Youngkin said.
In a post on X, formerly Twitter, former Attorney General Jason Miyares called Spanberger’s move “a disaster for the public safety” of the commonwealth. “Mark my words, there will be Virginians who will be robbed, raped and murdered as a result of this anti public safety executive order. No one should be surprised.”
House Minority Leader Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, also warned that ending mandated cooperation with ICE could lead to increased crime. 
“Folks need to be able to walk their street at night without fear of being either shot or kidnapped or raped. It’s the wrong way to move with public safety in Virginia,” Kilgore said. When Governor Youngkin had the agreement, we were able to catch all those MS-13 gang members up in Northern Virginia. If we’re not cooperating with ICE, folks are going to get harmed in Virginia.”
However, federal data show that immigrants without criminal records now make up the largest share of people held in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention, despite repeated assertions by some political leaders that enforcement is focused primarily on violent offenders.
According to ICE’s own figures, roughly 73% of those in detention as of late 2025 had no criminal conviction, and only a small fraction were held for violent offenses — many others had only minor or civil immigration offenses. 
In Virginia, too, officials have not substantiated claims about the criminal histories of people rounded up by the state’s task force. Last summer, Youngkin claimed his administration had arrested more than 2,500 immigrants who were “violent criminals,” but Miyares at the time declined to provide evidence that those individuals were in fact violent offenders when pressed by The Mercury.

 Local leaders respond

In Richmond, Mayor Danny Avula — the city’s first immigrant mayor — issued a statement addressing community concerns following reports of ICE activity in the region, including recent activity in Chesterfield County and Petersburg.
“I understand there is tremendous fear in the community right now,” Avula said. “Fear in completing everyday tasks, such as showing up for work, taking your children to school, or buying groceries, and I want you to know I hear you.”
Avula emphasized that Richmond does not coordinate with ICE on deportation activities and that the Richmond Police Department has not entered into a 287(g) agreement.
“Our officers are here to focus on their core mission: community policing, protecting all neighborhoods, and reducing crime,” Avula said, urging residents to call 911 if they need law enforcement assistance.
“I reject any approach that creates fear, confusion, or division,” he added. “Those tactics undermine public safety and erode trust, making our communities less safe, not more secure.”
Meanwhile, immigration enforcement concerns intensified last week after Hanover County officials confirmed receiving a letter from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security outlining plans to purchase and operate an ICE processing facility in a warehouse on Lakeridge Parkway.
County officials said the project was not initiated by Hanover and that the county has 30 days to respond. The Board of Supervisors had not convened to discuss the proposal as of Thursday and is expected to address the matter at its Jan. 28 meeting.
Virginia currently has two major long-term ICE detention centers — the Farmville Detention Center and the Caroline Detention Facility — along with regional jails that hold detainees under contract, including the Virginia Peninsula Regional Jail. 
Advocacy groups say any expansion of processing or detention capacity could deepen fear in surrounding communities.
 A broader political test

The debate over federal immigration enforcement underscores a broader challenge for Democratic governors in states where ICE activity remains governed largely by federal authority and locally negotiated contracts.
In Minnesota, Gov. Tim Walz publicly condemned a federal immigration operation in Minneapolis that sparked widespread protest after a federal agent fatally shot a 37-year old woman through her car window earlier this month. Following the killing, Walz demanded that the state must play a role in the investigation of the incident. 
Coverage of the fallout has highlighted the limited tools Democratic governors have to rein in enforcement carried out independently by ICE or through local arrangements.
Similar tensions have surfaced in Illinois and Massachusetts, where Democratic governors back sanctuary-style policies but continue to face criticism when ICE makes arrests in jails and courthouses governed by local practices rather than state law. 
In Illinois, confusion over the state’s TRUST Act has left sheriffs and the governor caught between immigrant advocates and federal officials. In Massachusetts, renewed attention to ICE courthouse arrests has put Gov. Maura Healey under pressure to respond to enforcement decisions she does not control. 
Against that backdrop, Spanberger has emphasized that the stakes in Virginia are about trust — particularly whether immigration enforcement policies discourage people from calling police when they need help. 
“Ultimately, how we will determine how Virginia proceeds is that — and I say this as someone who grew up in a law enforcement family and began my career in law enforcement — the idea that any community member would be afraid of calling police in a time of need, if there’s an emergency in their home, is a tragedy in and of itself,” Spanberger said.

(Photo by Bill Hinton/Getty Images)A proposal to create a volunteer cybersecurity incident response team, investigating and troubleshooting threats targeting digital systems around the commonwealth, will be considered again in this year’s General Assembly session. 
The legislation, carried by Del. Michael Feggans, D-Virginia Beach, would authorize the Virginia Information Technologies Agency to select people to serve as Virginia Cyber Civilian Corps volunteers and corps advisors, and to deploy such volunteers across the commonwealth to provide rapid-response assistance under the direction of VITA upon request from a client, or government agency, affected by a cybersecurity incident. 
The proposal would also create an advisory board within VITA to review and make recommendations regarding the creation and administration of the corps.
This comes as public data suggests cyber attacks are increasing. In many cases, reporting lags and transparency vary due to reputational or security concerns.
“The problem today is that localities are ‘soft targets’ these days,” said Tijay Chung, an associate professor in the computer science department at Virginia Tech. “Hackers have shifted (their) focus from hard and corporate targets to schools, hospitals or municipalities.”
He said House Bill 83 is a smart idea and that hackers are aware that local governments don’t have the budgets for a state-of-the-art security system or dedicated 24/7 monitoring teams.  
“That’s why these days hackers, in my opinion, think that (attacking) localities are easy targets —  low risk, high reward,” Chung added.
In 2024, Feggans introduced a similar proposal, which cleared the General Assembly during his first term. However, former Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed the bill. Youngkin believed creating a civilian cybersecurity corps is premature, costly and legally unclear under Virginia’s current cybersecurity setup.
According to the Department of Planning and Budget, an estimated $410,000 is projected for the Virginia Information Technology Agency to create and fund an advisory board for the Virginia Cyber Civilian Corps. Funds would also be allocated to the Virginia State Police for fingerprinting volunteers.
Feggans’ interest in introducing the legislation stems from his time as a cybersecurity intern for former Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s administration and their research on potential legislation. He also saw the success of similar proposals in other states like Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin. 
“This wasn’t just something that came up out of the blue,” Feggans said at the start of the General Assembly session. “It’s a model showing that we can increase our cybersecurity resources without adding a large bill to the state. We’ve seen cyber attacks happen in Virginia, and we just need to continue to increase our intellectual abilities to be able to assist in that, and this is my way to address our cybersecurity resources within the state.”
In December, Campbell County was targeted by a cyberattack on its emergency notification system, OnSolve CodeRed, for weather and emergency alerts. 
The county says the system has been decommissioned. An initial investigation found that an organized cybercriminal group damaged the CodeRED platform. The group may have removed subscriber data and posted some of it online.
Chung said lawmakers will need to consider vetting volunteer experts in their implementation plan.
Chung said that having a certification does not necessarily mean you can stop an active ransomware attack.
“You really have to have real experience. Conversely, some of the best white hat hackers may not have a formal degree. VITA needs to balance bureaucracy with actual technical capability.”
If Feggans’ bill is to have any success in passing to the Senate, it will have to clear the House of Delegates before crossover on Feb. 18. Gov. Abigail Spanberger would be responsible for signing the legislation.

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/ Virginia Mercury)Incarcerated people in Virginia can contact their friends and family by phone call or a special email service for prisons, but those who previously served time say in-person visits helped them keep morale high and incentivized good behavior.
Former and current inmates and criminal justice advocates are calling for clearer visitation standards in Virginia facilities, a challenge a new legislative measure is designed to address.
House Bill 173 by Del. Bonita Anthony, D-Norfolk, would require that the Virginia Department of Corrections provide extended visitation access for long-distance travelers who live at least 150 miles outside of the correctional facility, minors under 18 years old, and infrequent visitors who have not been to see their loved one in more than 90 days. Each visit for these types of guests would be at least two hours, unless the visitor or inmate requests to shorten it. 
Before the standards become applied broadly to VADOC, the bill stipulates that the department conduct pilot programs of the revised visitation rules at three or more prisons with different security levels to evaluate the staffing and safety impacts. This will help the department sort through how to best implement the new visitation standards. 
The bill also outlines how visitation privileges could only be suspended for conduct occurring during the visitation that “presents a direct and substantial threat to the physical safety of participants or the security of the correctional facility.”
Finally, it would create an appeal process for suspension of visitation rights and would require VADOC to collect and publish related data in an annual report to state lawmakers. 
Christine Via, whose husband Blake was previously incarcerated at Dilwyn Correctional Center, said she has been turned away when trying to visit him due to her attire, despite her attempts to follow the visitation rules and clothing policy. 
VADOC policy outlines that clothing must cover people from neck to kneecap, must not contain “inappropriate language or graphics,” watches and other wearable technology are prohibited, and that administrative duty officers “will make the final decision” on whether or not someone is allowed into the visitor room.
No matter what she wore, Christine said occasionally authorities at the center told her she needed to change for security reasons.
So, she’d “run to the nearest store and get something because I don’t want to skip my visit,” she said.
After several such interactions, she said she didn’t always bring the couple’s young son along to the facility, an hour and a half from their home, concerned that he would “get his hopes up,” only to not see his father. 
Another time, Blake said his visitation privileges were at risk of being revoked because apparently he and Christine shared too long of a kiss. 
“It’s inconsistent with treatment between (correctional officers’) shifts,” Blake said, adding that Anthony’s bill could help create consistent standards.
Humanization Project co-founder Taj Mahon-Haft also supports the bill. The organization, spearheaded by formerly incarcerated people like himself, advocates to the state legislature on behalf of bills like Anthony’s. 
During Mahon-Haft’s incarceration his mother and his now-wife were two of the people he was in touch with most, each leaning on the other for emotional support. With his mother living in New Mexico, she saved up money and took time off work to visit at least twice a year. This entailed paying for flights, a hotel and a rental car. 
In late 2021, as COVID-19 pandemic restrictions were easing up, Mahon-Haft said he’d filled out the required documentation to arrange for his mother to visit him. She was told to leave the prison after just an hour, he said, despite the waiting room being empty. 
It was the last time she visited him before he was released. 
“She couldn’t put herself through that again,” he said. “She’d spent thousands of dollars, come thousands of miles and wasted five days of her PTO.”
He and the Vias feel that the treatment by prison staff has “basically discouraged away visits” at times. 
Anthony’s bill must work its way through various committees before it may clear both chambers of the legislature and ultimately face Gov. Abigail Spanberger’s final approval, amendments or rejection.

(Photo by Vicki Jauron, Babylon and Beyond Photography via Getty Images) Menhaden, the controversial oily fish, are making waves early in the General Assembly legislative session.
Three bills have been filed that would curb menhaden catches by the only reduction fishery allowed in the Chesapeake Bay and to study the population, which some conservation groups have said is declining in the Bay and spurring suffering among other species. 
Ocean Harvesters, which contracts with Omega Protein, is a purse seine reduction fishery in Reedville, Virginia. They are the only reduction fishery allowed in the Bay, as surrounding states have banned that kind of industrial scale fishing. They frequently are blamed for the challenges posed to the menhaden population within the Bay.
Conservationists have been sounding the alarm over starving osprey populations, which researchers use as a proxy for menhaden as they are a key part of the birds’ diets. 
Maryland members of the Atlantic Menhaden Management Board have also claimed that fewer menhaden have been able to travel up to their shores for fishermen to harvest in years past, a point that Ocean Harvesters has fiercely denied and said data does not support.
Del. Betsy Carr, D-Richmond, sponsored House Bill 1048 that would halt all purse seine fishing of menhaden in the Virginia portion of the Chesapeake Bay until it can be scientifically proven that the fishery does not negatively impact other fisheries or species that depend on the forage fish to survive.
Ocean Harvesters said that broad language could mean the fishery shutters permanently.
“The cost would be real and immediate in the Northern Neck, where these measures threaten hundreds of jobs for fishermen and plant workers, along with paychecks, benefits, and health insurance in a rural region with few comparable, full-benefit alternatives,” Ocean Harvesters said. “These bills would disproportionately hit a largely minority, union workforce and punish working families while ignoring the science-based management already in place.”
Carr’s other bill, HB 1049, would implement quota periods so that the amount the fishery is allowed to harvest, which is already limited by a specific cap of 51,000 metric tons, would be spaced out over certain times so that the menhaden could potentially move through the Bay. 
The proposal is similar to a suggestion by the Maryland representative in the menhaden management board, which opted to restrict menhaden harvests by 20% along the entire East Coast.
“HB 1049 goes further than the Maryland delegation proposal by restricting rollover of unused quota between periods and layering on an observer requirement for a portion of trips, which are additional operational burdens without a clear conservation payoff,” Ocean Harvesters said.
Carr could not be reached for comment on her bills.
The General Assembly has attempted and failed to pass legislation in the past to conduct a Bay- specific study on the menhaden populations. There’s another attempt on the docket this year.
Sen. David Marsden, D-Fairfax, proposed Senate Bill 474 to establish the Atlantic Menhaden Research Fund to be used by the Virginia Institute of Marine Science to conduct the menhaden population study and report to the General Assembly each year.
“Directly and indirectly, menhaden are essential to the livelihoods of countless Virginia small businesses, families, and communities. Responsibly managing the fishery protects the menhaden industry’s own workers, who have the most to lose if the fishery collapses,” said Will Poston, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation forage campaign manager.
The three bills have not yet come up for hearings in the General Assembly.

More people in the legal field are using AI to automate repetitive tasks and save time, but hallucinations have led to fake cases and false information in legal documents. (Photo by Madyson Fitzgerald/Stateline)Last spring, Illinois county judge Jeffrey Goffinet noticed something startling: A legal brief filed in his courtroom cited a case that did not exist.
Goffinet, an associate judge in Williamson County, looked through two legal research systems and then headed to the courthouse library — a place he hadn’t visited in years — to consult the book that purportedly listed the case. The case wasn’t in it.
The fake case, generated by artificial intelligence, came across Goffinet’s desk just a few months after the Illinois Supreme Court’s policy on the use of AI in the courts took effect. Goffinet co-chaired a task force that informed that policy, which allows the use of AI as long as it complies with existing legal and ethical standards.
“People are going to use [AI], and the courts are not going to be able to be a dam across a river that’s already flowing at flood capacity,” Goffinet said. “We have to learn how to coexist with it.”
As more false quotes, fake court cases and incorrect information appear in legal documents generated by AI, state bar associations, state court systems and national law organizations are issuing guidance on its use in the legal field. A handful of states are considering or enacting legislation to address the issue, and many courts and professional associations are focused on education for attorneys.
Federal judge mulls sanctions for attorneys who used AI in court filing

From divorce cases to discrimination lawsuits, AI-generated fake content can cause evidence to be dismissed and motions to be denied.
While some states urge attorneys to lean on existing guidance about accuracy and transparency, the new policies address AI concerns related to confidentiality, competency and costs. Most policies and opinions encourage attorneys to educate themselves and to use proprietary AI tools that prevent sensitive data from being entered into open source systems. Since AI tools could also increase efficiency, several policies advise attorneys to charge less if they spend less time on cases.
Some states, such as Ohio, also ban the use of artificial intelligence for certain legal tasks. In Ohio, courts are prohibited from using AI to translate legal forms, court orders and similar content that may affect the outcome of a case.
Several states have also advised legal professionals to adhere to the American Bar Association’s formal opinion of ethical AI use in law.
Artificial intelligence can help attorneys and law firms by automating administrative tasks, analyzing contracts and organizing documents. Generative AI can also be used to draft legal documents, including court briefs. Experts say the use of AI productivity tools can save legal professionals time and reduce the risk of human error in everyday tasks.
But law professionals nationwide have faced fines and license suspensions, among other consequences, for submitting legal documents citing false quotes, cases or information.
Many legal professionals are likely to not notice instances in which an AI system is “hallucinating,” or confidently making statements that are not true, said Rabihah Butler, the manager for enterprise content for Risk, Fraud and Government at the Thomson Reuters Institute. The institute is a research subsidiary of the Thomson Reuters company, which sells an AI system meant to help lawyers.










AI has such confidence, and it can appear so polished, that if you're not paying attention and doing your due diligence, the hallucination is being treated as a factual piece of information.


– Rabihah Butler, manager for enterprise content for Risk, Fraud and Government at the Thomson Reuters Institute


Courts and law organizations will need to consider education, sanctions and punitive actions to ensure law professionals are using AI appropriately, Butler said.
“AI has such confidence, and it can appear so polished, that if you’re not paying attention and doing your due diligence, the hallucination is being treated as a factual piece of information,” she said.
Since the beginning of 2025, there have been 518 documented cases in which generative AI produced hallucinated content used in U.S. courts, according to a database by Damien Charlotin, a senior research fellow at the HEC Paris business school.
“So far, if we’re looking at the institutional response, there’s not a lot because people are not very sure how to handle this kind of issue,” Charlotin said. “Everyone is aware that some lawyers are using artificial intelligence in their day-to-day work. Most people are aware that the technology is not very mature. But it’s still hard to prevent a mistake.”
State guidance
As of Jan. 23, state bar associations or similar entities have issued formal guidance on the use of AI in at least 10 states and the District of Columbia, typically in the form of an ethics opinion. Those aren’t enforceable as law, but spell out proper conduct.
In February, for example, the Professional Ethics Committee for the State Bar of Texas issued an ethics opinion that outlines issues that may arise from law professionals using AI. Texas lawyers should have a basic understanding of generative AI tools and guardrails to protect client confidentiality, it said. They should also verify any content generated by AI and refrain from charging clients for the time saved by using AI tools.
Legal professionals must be aware of their own competency with AI tools, said Brad Johnson, the executive director of the Texas Center for Legal Ethics.
“A really important takeaway from the opinion is that if a lawyer is considering using a generative AI tool in the practice of law, the lawyer has to have a reasonable and current understanding of the technology because only then can a lawyer really evaluate the risks that are associated with it,” he said.
Court systems in at least 11 states — Arizona, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, New York, Ohio, South Carolina, Vermont and Virginia — have established policies or issued rules of conduct regarding AI use by law professionals.
Illinois, for instance, allows lawyers to use artificial intelligence and does not require disclosure. The policy also emphasizes that judges will ultimately be responsible for their decisions, regardless of “technological advancements.”
“The task force wanted to emphasize that as judges, what we bring to the table is our humanity,” said Goffinet, the associate judge. “And we cannot abdicate our humanity in favor of an AI-generated decision or opinion.”
Former lawyer seeks reinstatement after sanctions, arrest and contempt findings

Some state lawmakers have tried to address the issue through legislation. Last year, Louisiana Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed a measure that requires attorneys to use “reasonable diligence” to verify the authenticity of evidence, including content generated by artificial intelligence. The law also allows parties in civil cases to raise concerns about the admissibility of evidence if they suspect it was generated or altered by artificial intelligence.
California Democratic state Sen. Tom Umberg also introduced legislation last year that would require attorneys to ensure confidential information is not entered into a public generative AI system. The measure, which was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, also would require attorneys to ensure that reasonable steps are taken to verify the accuracy of generative AI material.
Attorney education
It’s also important for state bar associations and law schools to provide education on artificial intelligence, said Michael Hensley, a counsel at FBT Gibbons and an advocate for the safe use of AI in California courts. AI has the ability to reduce research time just like online legal research systems, but it requires training, he said.
“I would hope the state bar would have training for this,” Hensley said. “And I think it’s absolutely imperative that law schools have a session on AI.”
In a Bloomberg Law survey conducted last spring, 51% of the more than 750 respondents said their law firms purchased or invested in generative artificial intelligence tools. Another 21% said they planned to purchase AI tools within the next year. Attorneys reported using generative AI for general legal research, drafting communications, summarizing legal narratives, reviewing legal documents and other work.
Of the law firms that were not using generative AI, attorneys cited incorrect or unreliable output, ethical issues, security risks and data privacy as the top reasons.
While attorneys and law firms have become more comfortable with AI tools, courts have been more apprehensive, said Diane Robinson, a principal court research associate at the National Center for State Courts. Robinson is also project director at the Thomson Reuters Institute/NCSC AI Policy Consortium for Law and Courts, an association of legal practitioners and researchers developing guidance and resources for the use of AI in courts.
AI has the potential to improve case processing and can allow people needing legal advice to find information by using AI chatbots, she said. But, she added, courts are still struggling with evidence altered by AI and briefs littered with hallucinations.
“Fake evidence is nothing new,” Robinson said. “People have been altering photographs as long as there were photographs. But with AI, the ability to create videos, audio and pictures has become very easy, and courts are really struggling with it.”
Charlotin, of HEC Paris, said most courts and professional associations will continue to focus on education right now.
“You cannot prevent a mistake just by telling people, ‘Don’t make a mistake,’” Charlotin said. “That doesn’t work. It’s more about setting up processes to make people aware of it, then they can set up processes to work on dealing with it.”

Jessica LaMontagne became interested in natural funerals after witnessing a loved one’s home burial in Vermont. “I was really quite moved by the experience,” she said Thursday, Jan. 23, addressing the House Committee on Executive Departments and Administration.  The experience set LaMontagne, a Dover Democrat, down a path of learning about alternative f[...]","Traditional cremation and burial remain the two major paths for disposition chosen by most people nationwide. Here, a cemetery in Henniker. (Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)Rep. Jessica LaMontagne became interested in natural funerals after witnessing a loved one’s home burial in Vermont.
“I was really quite moved by the experience,” she said Thursday, Jan. 23, addressing the House Committee on Executive Departments and Administration. 
The experience set LaMontagne, a Dover Democrat, down a path of learning about alternative funerals. Under certain circumstances, natural burials, in which a person’s body is interred without chemical embalming, are permitted in New Hampshire, she found. But some other natural funeral practices are not currently legal for practice in-state.
One of those methods is “natural organic reduction,” sometimes called “human composting.” In this process, a person’s body is placed in a specialized container and surrounded with plant matter, like hay and wood chips. With assistance from microbes, warmth, and movement, the body is aided in breaking down into nutrient-rich organic material, similar to compost or soil, over a period of weeks or months.
House Bill 1457, which LaMontagne sponsored, would legalize natural organic reduction in New Hampshire and lay out guidelines for regulation of the practice, mirroring state regulation of cremation and cremation facilities.
This session marks the third time such legislation has been introduced. LaMontagne first introduced House Bill 1324, which would have legalized natural organic reduction, in 2024; that bill was sent for interim study, where it died in committee. Sen. Daniel Innis, a Bradford Republican, introduced a similar measure as Senate Bill 53 in 2025 that was also left in interim study. 
Innis is a co-sponsor of this year’s bill, along with Nashua Democratic Rep. William Darby, Stratham Democratic Rep. Allison Knab, Dover Democratic Sen. David Watters, and Manchester Republican Sen. Keith Murphy.  
“We’ve joined forces, and hopefully three times will be the charm, because natural organic reduction is growing across the country,” LaMontagne said.
Rep. Jessica LaMontagne, a Dover Democrat, presents a bill to legalize organic reduction of human remains before the House Committee on Executive Departments and Administration on Thursday, Jan. 22. People may choose natural organic reduction for the similar reasons they would choose cremation, LaMontagne said. “They want to just go back: ashes to ashes, dust to dust. This is earth to earth, a more ephemeral and ecological way.” (Photo by Molly Rains/New Hampshire Bulletin)
The practice was first legalized in Washington State in 2019, and 13 other states have since followed suit, including Vermont and Maine. A bill to legalize the practice in Massachusetts is currently before the state legislature. 
Some companies will transport deceased individuals out of states where natural organic reduction is illegal to undergo the process elsewhere. But legalizing the method in-state would ease that process for New Hampshire families and support local funeral providers, said LaMontagne.
About 61.4% of Americans are interested in exploring “green” funeral options, according to a 2025 estimate from the National Funeral Directors Association. Besides natural organic disposition is the low-emission practice of liquid cremation, or “aquamation,” which some lawmakers attempted to legalize in New Hampshire in 2013; the measure was ultimately voted down.
Despite widespread interest in alternatives, traditional cremation and burial remain the two major paths for disposition chosen by most people nationwide. Flame cremation is most common, with about 63.4% of people choosing that option in 2025, according to the National Funeral Directors Association. In New Hampshire, nearly 80% choose cremation.
Cremation is less land-intensive than traditional burial and less expensive. Opting for a burial typically adds about $2,000 to the cost of a funeral, according to the National Funeral Directors’ Association, which estimated the median cost of a funeral with burial in the United States at around $8,300 in 2025.
“I think many people choose (cremation) as a more ephemeral means of leaving this world, not to claim a piece of Earth forever in a cemetery,” LaMontagne said. 
But, she said, there are also some environmental drawbacks to cremation. It is energy-intensive and typically uses fossil fuels, LaMontagne said, and it generates particulate air pollution. The resulting ashes also contain large amounts of salt and other inorganic material, which can be harmful to plants and animals.
LaMontagne views natural organic reduction as a solution to some of those issues. The soil-like remains that are produced through the process are safe for plants, and families may confidently use them to plant a tree or scatter on a forest floor, she said.
The variety of possible destinations for reduced remains, however, was one topic of concern at the Thursday hearing. The process produces a large volume of material, about one cubic yard, according to LaMontagne.

That could pose a challenge for funeral directors and others who provide the reduction service, said David Grant, president of the New Hampshire Funeral Directors Association. Families may not want to take the material, unsure where to put it, he said.
Others wondered how the provision forbidding the use of the soil on crops would be enforced.
Bob Dunn, director of public policy for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Manchester, cited dignity and tradition in his testimony opposing the bill.
Dunn said the church viewed reduction as an undignified treatment for the human body. The production and possible use of compost-like soil, he said, was also problematic.
“That process … is something that reduces human remains to a utilitarian end. If we look at the human body as something that can be treated in the utilitarian way, then that sends the message that living people can be looked at in a utilitarian way as well,” he said.
The Catholic Church supports cremation, Dunn said, adding that he viewed natural organic reduction as different from cremation in its production of usable soil and its novelty.
Darby said he would be personally interested in the process in order to have a “green burial” without converting a portion of his property into a cemetery. 
The committee did not take action on the bill, short-titled the “Live Free and Die Free Act”. Members will consider whether to recommend it for passage at a future session.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/hennikercemetery-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-26 05:57:44.161149

Republish photo only with original article.)While redistricting reform might not be on the ballot again this election season, the people who bring about initiatives and constitutional amendments aren’t sitting on their hands. The result of the 2024 campaign informed how advocacy leaders are moving forward, they say.
“I actually think right now is a critically important time for any future redistricting initiative, to keep talking about these issues, and to keep linking this problem to all the other problems around the country,” said Collin Marozzi, advocacy director for the ACLU of Ohio.
Ballot initiatives serve as an important part of making governmental change, one that many around the state see as one of the only ways, currently, to bring about change on which a Republican supermajority won’t budge, like reproductive rights or marijuana.
While an initiated statute on marijuana succeeded (though the legislative success is still to be determined), and reproductive rights were solidly approved to enter the Ohio Constitution, the most recent pass at redistricting reform to change to a citizen-run method rather than one run by elected officials didn’t fare as well.
While there were lots of reasons given on the defeat of the issue, the concept of bringing up a renewed effort amid a heavily populated and highly fundraised 2026 election doesn’t strike the right chord with participants in the previous effort.
“Though our resolve to bring fair maps and a transparent process to Ohio has not wavered, we are considering the strategic and political hurdles that stand in the way of a successful ballot campaign,” Marozzi told the Capital Journal.
Many things go into the process of putting a constitutional amendment or other measure on the ballot. First comes the motivation to circumvent the legislature if an issue hasn’t risen to the level advocates think it should, often after years of attempting to persuade lawmakers.
“Unfortunately, there are times that the legislature will not move and so the ability of every day Ohioans to pull out their clipboards and get something on the ballot is transformational,” said Jen Miller, executive director of the League of Women Voters of Ohio.
Often times, as Ohio has seen with property tax debate, just the shadow of an impending ballot measure could be enough to bring about at least some action with elected officials.

  The language of change 
When the needle doesn’t move, initiative leaders get to work, with the help of policy and legal experts, to put together the language that will frame the issue.
The idea has to be easy for voters to digest, but also legally enforceable, and able to extend change after the measure is approved by voters.
“We can spend all the money in the world on advertisements, in terms of what they see on TV, or what they see on their phones, but at the end of the day, the last thing that they see before they vote is that ballot language,” said Jeff Dieringer, political and research strategist with the labor union SEIU 1199. “And more times than not, that is going to be the determining factor of whether they check yes or no.”
It doesn’t help that issues that have failed recently statistically fare worse on future attempts, and a change to the constitution is going to start with a higher level scrutiny before the issue has even hit the table.
“If an issue is highly contested, voters are most likely to say no,” said Catherine Turcer, head of voting rights organization Common Cause Ohio. “Voters who aren’t sure are likely to say no.”
The 2023 reproductive rights amendment is one advocates point to as a good example of being easily understood, unlike the complicated and lengthy changes in the redistricting proposal.
“That was instructive, in that it was short, but is also tangibly understandable to the public,” Miller said. “(Voters) knew the rights we had before Roe v. Wade was gutted, and that this preserved those rights.”
Even with the right collection of words, whether or not the language remains the same from the advocates’ table to the official ballot is the source of struggle nowadays.
“Now we have to factor in … kind of the institutional role, and what is the worst ballot language that could be presented,” Marozzi said.
The Ohio Ballot Board, which has final say on what amendments end up on Ohio ballots, received a lot of flack for the changes they made to the redistricting reform amendment in 2024, in which they inserted language saying the redistricting commission would be “required to gerrymander” maps that establish the voting districts in the state.
The Ohio Supreme Court upheld most of the changes, including that particular change, to the surprise of many.

“The language was so Orwelllian that I couldn’t imagine they would go along with it,” Turcer said.
But because of the success they saw within elected official-led institutions like the Ohio Ballot Board, even with moves they say were misleading and deliberately one-sided, those leading the charge for change see the need for a more comprehensive change.
“We’re not necessarily ripe for big systemic change at the beginning of 2026,” Turcer said. “But we deserve to participate in a democracy that is not rigged by things like gerrymandered district lines and ballot board shenanigans.”
While changing those who are in office could be a step forward, Turcer said the environment for change in Ohio has grown to include more than just individual elected officials.
“Lying has now become part of the process, and changing the guard could disrupt the system for a few years,” Turcer said. “But that doesn’t mean that one side or the other couldn’t just go back to dirty deeds fairly easily, because one political party is in power.”
  Then comes the money 
The art of bringing together a battalion of volunteers to gather the more than 400,000 signatures over more than 40 counties needed to even get the measure in the hands of those who might approve the language has seen its own changes over the years.
“You’re obviously not just submitting that amount, usually the goal is to aim for about double that,” Dieringer said.
Volunteers usually aren’t enough these days, advocates say, and money needs to go to entities who verify the signatures.
“I don’t think I’ve ever seen a ballot measure that was wholly volunteer based that successfully was able to qualify (for the ballot),” Dieringer said. “It’s just not possible, given the timeline that you’re doing.”

Like it or not, money is a driver for ballot initiatives to receive signatures, for information to make it in front of the eyes of voters, and in the end, for voters to make their decision.
“The language isn’t enough, and it’s not enough just to think about ‘can you collect enough signatures in time,’” Turcer said. “It’s not enough just to get on the ballot, you need to actually get people to vote for it.”
Getting across the finish line means marketing in the media, even through Indiana and West Virginia where markets overlap with Ohio. Radio campaigns work better in rural areas like Southeast Ohio, where broadband isn’t as reliable as in other areas. Social media campaigns are rampant now, and supporters and opponents alike need to get creative in how they go about pushing their view.
“Ohio is incredibly expensive (for elections), you have a very large population, and you have multiple media markets,” Marozzi said. “You really have to do a full landscape analysis to see where and how you’re going to raise the necessary amount of money.”
Also playing a factor in how advocates persuade donors and voters is whether or not the election could see a big turnout, like in presidential years, or during an off-year with not much in the way of other candidates or issues to attract voters.
“Donors don’t want to give large sums of money to an effort that is a coin flip if it’s going to win or not,” Marozzi said. “But also they don’t want to spend money on communication that’s ineffective.”
For now, Marozzi and other advocates say that means a less-than-favorable path to success for something like redistricting reform. But it doesn’t mean other ways of bringing about change are off the table.
“The League of Women Voters is not going to stop until we have stopped partisan gerrymandering,” Miller said. “But right now we are focused on making sure every Ohioan has what they need to participate freely and fairly in every primary and general election.”
Voters should put their eye toward the future by asking candidates what they will be doing to represent voter interests, and tell the candidates what voters need.
“It does feel like change is in the air, but when we think about politics, we shouldn’t just be thinking about the next election,” Turcer said. “We should think about the ways we can support each other and engage, everything from book clubs to attending public hearings.”
Talking with those in book clubs, and coffee shops, and congregations brings about the idea that there is agreement about what is right and wrong in Ohio, Marozzi said. Conversations happening outside the ballot box are important as voters wait to cast their votes.

(Photo illustration by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)A million people talk to ChatGPT about suicide every week. That’s the estimate Open AI released in late October while announcing new safety measures for people in crisis. When a software program becomes the place young people go to say they want to die, we have crossed into dangerous territory. 
AI companies are filling a mental health gap without meeting the safety expectations we require from licensed clinicians. That’s why Rhode Island needs to establish guardrails before more teens are put at risk.
A recent Brown University study examined how large language models like ChatGPT respond when asked to act like therapists. Even when prompted to use evidence-based techniques like cognitive behavioral therapy, the bots studied routinely violated core counseling ethics. In hundreds of test conversations, they offered false reassurance, overvalidated negative thoughts, and failed to recognize suicide language. The researchers ultimately identified 15 categories of serious ethical risks — lapses that, if made by a human counselor, would trigger oversight boards or malpractice liability. 
For chatbots, there is nothing but a disclaimer.
The consequences are no longer hypothetical. In April 2025, 16-year-old Adam Raine died by suicide. His parents didn’t know how much he was struggling until they looked through his phone and found long exchanges he’d had with ChatGPT, according to the testimony of his father Matthew Raine before a Senate subcommittee hearing on the harms of AI chatbots. In those messages, Adam told the chatbot about his suicidal thoughts and plans. But instead of urging him to reach out for trusted help, the bot discouraged him from doing so and even offered to write his suicide note, according to the testimony.










When a software program becomes the place young people go to say they want to die, we have crossed into dangerous territory. 


Adam’s death has drawn national attention to a larger trend: Young people are increasingly turning to chatbots for emotional support. A national survey by Common Sense Media found that 72% of teenagers have used an AI chatbot as a companion, and about one in eight have sought it for mental health concerns. 
It’s not difficult to see why a teen would do so, considering that nearly half of young adults showing symptoms of anxiety or depression received no treatment last year, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. To compound the issue, parts of the brain that manage impulse control, emotional regulation, and risk-taking aren’t fully developed until age 25. That developmental gap leaves teenagers especially sensitive to reward and approval, and less able to question what they’re told. The same vulnerabilities that social media companies exploit to make them scroll endlessly works just as well within a chatbot.
AI has become a lifeline for young people seeking help, but its reach has far outpaced regulation. Rhode Island has a chance to lead the country by building the guardrails that national regulators have been slow to implement.
The state already has the right infrastructure to act: Brown’s researchers are helping steer the national conversation on ethics in technology, and the Rhode Island AI task force, created in February 2024, could set the first standards for mental health safety. State lawmakers should require companies to prove their products are safe before teens can use them, the same way we expect new drugs or medical devices to be tested before they’re used by the public. That review should test whether chatbots can recognize harmful phrases and automatically route users to the 988 Lifeline when necessary.
Second, the Rhode Island Department of Health should treat mental health chatbots as a form of health-related service. The state can then require transparency about what happens to the data after conversations end, who can access it, and whether it is used to train future models. Parents, schools, and clinicians cannot protect kids if they have no idea how these tools actually work. Moreover, the Attorney General’s office can use its consumer-protection authority to prohibit AI companies from making unverified therapeutic claims. If an AI tool markets itself as providing guidance or coaching, it should be held to the same standard of truthfulness that we demand from any medical or counseling service.
The question isn’t whether AI will shape the future of mental health care; it already has. My generation learned to navigate adolescence through platforms that were never built with wellbeing in mind, and we cannot repeat that mistake with AI. Rhode Island has the chance to show that states can act faster and with more responsibility than tech giants. By setting clear standards now, lawmakers can ensure that AI remains a support tool, not another witness to a preventable tragedy.
If you are in crisis or need someone to talk to, you can call or text the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline on 988, chat on 988lifeline.org, or text HOME to 741741 to connect with a crisis counselor.

Getty ImagesGeorgia’s teenagers could soon be doing significantly less scrolling, swiping and tapping on weekdays.
The state Legislature is poised to consider expanding the state’s classroom cell phone ban for elementary and middle schools to high schools. Under the plan passed last year with bipartisan support, school districts had until Jan. 1 to come up with a policy for keeping phones out of student hands during classroom time for kindergarteners through eighth graders, and they have until July to start enforcing it.
Rep. Scott Hilton. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
The author of the ban, Peachtree Corners Republican state Rep. Scott Hilton, said he introduced the high school expansion as House Bill 1009 near the start of this year’s legislative session after he said educators gave high marks to what Hilton calls “distraction-free education.”
Districts across the state have implemented their own bans ahead of the state deadline.
“I’ve just been blown away at the positive reaction across the board from all different constituencies, teachers, administrators, parents and even in a lot of cases, students who have experienced a difference and said, ‘Oh, wow, I kind of like this,’” Hilton said.
If the new bill passes the House and Senate and receives Gov. Brian Kemp’s signature, high schools will be required to ban cell phones starting in July 2027.
As of August, 35 states have some form of classroom electronics restriction in place, according to technology news site Techspot. Some states, like Georgia, have banned the devices entirely from the beginning of the day to the end and others have taken more permissive approaches such as allowing phones during lunch or between classes.
Hilton said Georgia is the only state to have started with the lower grades before moving up to high schoolers.
“I think it allowed folks to kind of socialize it, get used to it, and it’s made the transition a lot easier,” he said. “What I love, too, is that a lot of schools have seen the writing on the wall that we were addressing this and have proactively done it themselves already, and so we’ve got some real-world data and anecdotes, not only from across the country, but even inside of Georgia.”
A recent survey from the Professional Association of Georgia Educators found that nearly 72% of teachers in the state say the elementary and middle school ban will improve student learning, and about 71% say high schools should also be cell phone-free zones.
When only high school teachers’ responses were counted, support for a high school ban grew to 83%, the survey found.
School safety
Given the current bill’s popularity with teachers and bipartisan support from last year, the expansion seems likely to find favor in the Legislature this year.
House Speaker Jon Burns, a Newington Republican, has indicated that he wants to see action on a high school cell phone ban, but speaking to reporters ahead of the start of the session, he added that he also expects lawmakers to consider parents’ and students’ concerns about safety.
Worries about students being unable to contact their families in case of a shooting or other emergency have been a central argument against the cell phone bans, especially in the wake of the deadly 2024 shooting at Apalachee High School in Winder.
Supporters of classroom cell phone bans have emphasized that school emergency plans include procedures for communicating with families and for returning students’ phones to them when it is safe to do so.
House Speaker Jon Burns. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
“What we’ve learned from some of the tragic situations we’ve had, like in Barrow County, is that some of that communication certainly is good for the parent to understand that the child is safe, but also interferes with the safety protocols in the school,” Burns said. “So we believe that’s a part of that whole discussion, but you’ll see us move this session, I do believe, to ban cell phones in high schools, because so many jurisdictions around the state have already done that as well, and I think we’re all aware of that.
“I believe that will be something we will certainly have a lively discussion about, but certainly want to respect parents and their feeling of security for their students,” Burns added.
Last week, Apalachee was one of three Barrow County Schools that received called-in threats. The Barrow County Sheriff’s Office placed the entire district on soft lockdown until determining the calls were hoaxes and the schools were safe.
“It raised up a lot of hysteria and a lot of those PTSD triggers and everything because they even brought the choppers out and there was police presence at all the schools, all the schools were locked down and the whole county was pretty shaken up,” said Layla Renee Contreras, an Apalachee High School graduate whose mother and sister were at the school during the 2024 shooting.
Contreras is lead organizer for Change for Chee, an organization pushing for safety improvements in the wake of the shooting.
“I can’t imagine what it’s going to be like when the high schoolers don’t have their cell phones on them,” she said. “Because other places in Georgia, they don’t understand our perspective. We’ve lived through this nightmare already.”
‘The sweet spot’
Speaking to reporters at a media symposium earlier this month, State School Superintendent Richard Woods, who is a Republican, said he supports removing cell phones from high school classrooms because he said they lead to distraction and can harm students’ mental health, but he said he is also cognizant of safety worries.
Superintendent Richard Woods. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
“I have a student that’s on my student advisory committee, and this young student was at Apalachee,” Woods said. “This student was shot at Apalachee. And I think, listen, there’s a concern that how we deal with this does have an impact. That young person said ‘my phone helped me.’”
“Do I support this? Absolutely,” Woods added, referring to the cell phone bans. “But I think we have to find a sweet spot and not move to the extremes.”
Woods said the specifics of plans should be left to districts. He said instructional time should be completely free of personal electronic devices, but he added that he may be open to districts allowing high schoolers to use their phones during other times like in between class periods.
“We have 181 school districts, over 200 when you think about charter schools, close to 2,400 schools in the state of Georgia,” he said. “So blanket-wise, yes, we need to preserve and put guidelines on how this should be used, but let the districts find out what’s working for them.”
Contreras said she thinks banning phones during classroom time is reasonable, but high school students should learn to be responsible for their own activity before they head off to college or enter the workforce.
“It should be on their person, on their body, in their book bag or something, accessible to them,” she said.
Schools commonly use devices like special locking bags to secure phones during the day or require students to put their devices in a container at the start of the day.
Hilton’s bill would require schools to restrict access entirely from the morning bell until the dismissal bell with the only exceptions being for activities that do not take place on school grounds like field trips, dual enrollment or apprenticeship programs.
“The best practice really is beginning of the day to the end of the day, and the reason being is if you allow for portions of the day, you get right back kind of where we are right now with teachers having to be cell phone police and discipline issues, and we really don’t want that,” Hilton said in a phone call.
Margaret Ciccarelli, an attorney and director of legislative services for the Professional Association of Georgia Educators, said their educator surveys show teachers also favor the so-called “bell to bell” approach, likely because of the challenges intermittent phone use creates during transitions on campus.
“During non-instructional periods like lunch, students are distracted by phones and social media and less likely to engage positively with one another in a face-to-face setting,” she said.
Ciccarelli said surveys also show that educators are expecting parental push back on phone bans – 71% reported anticipating “strong parental or caregiver resistance.”
Hilton said he understands parents wanting to be able to get in touch with their children during the day, but eliminating the distraction of cell phones entirely is best for their education.
“I’ve got kids in school as well, and I catch my own self wanting to text them something,” he said. “I think the parents, in some respects, are part of the challenge, as we’ve got to understand and adapt ourselves to the fact that kids need to be learning and focused on that in school.”

(Photo by David DeWitt, Ohio Capital Journal.)A group called Washington County for Safe Drinking recently filed an ethics complaint with the Ohio Joint Legislative Ethics Committee against Republican Ohio state Sen. Brian Chavez over alleged oil and gas conflicts.
The ethics complaint argues Chavez’s alleged conflicts of interest and voting record as the Ohio Senate Energy Committee Chair shows he has prioritized personal financial gain.  
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“The complaint alleges Chavez’s conflicts of interest regarding undisclosed business entities and fast-tracking legislation that could benefit these interests,” the complaint said. “When public officials with financial ties to an industry shape laws that directly benefit that industry, it undermines public trust across the entire state.”
Buckeye Environmental Network, Save Ohio Parks, and FaCT Ohio also signed the letter, which calls for an investigation. 
“This is a fundamental crisis of public trust that impacts every Ohioan’s right to safe drinking water and ethical governance,” Washington County for Safe Drinking Water spokesperson Hillary Royster said in a statement. 
Ohio law prohibits Joint Legislative Ethics Committee members or staff from confirming or denying receiving a complaint or allegation, said Ohio Joint Legislative Ethics Committee Executive Director Tony Bledsoe. 
“Therefore, I am unable to provide any further comment,” Bledsoe said in an email. 
When the Capital Journal reached out to Chavez for comment, John Fortney, spokesperson for the Ohio Senate Republicans, responded. 
“These radicalized local groups could care less about ethics, much less safe drinking water,” Fortney said in an email. “This is another baseless, desperate, and hollow attack funded by billionaire California special interests with the single goal of killing the oil and gas industry in Ohio.”
Chavez — who was appointed to the Ohio Senate in December 2023 after Frank Hoagland retired and was elected to a four-year term in 2024 — has many connections to Ohio’s oil and gas industry.
Before becoming a senator, he was a member of the Oil and Gas Commission, served as a trustee for the Ohio Oil and Gas Association, was on the board of the Southeast Ohio Oil and Gas Association, and managed and owned Reno Oil & Gas, Inc.
Chavez resigned as vice president of Heinrich Enterprises, Inc — his wife’s family’s oil and gas business — in 2024, according to Chavez’s 2024 Financial Disclosure Statement.
He was CEO of DeepRock Disposal Solutions, a wastewater disposal company that uses deep-well injections, until 2024. Chavez, however, was listed as a DeepRock Disposal Solutions manager in its 2025 annual report filed with the state of West Virginia, according to the complaint. 
Chavez “does not disclose ownership in DeepRock Disposal Solutions LLC in either his 2023 or his 2024 financial disclosure forms,” according to the complaint. 
“Signing documents as the CEO of DeepRock Disposal Solutions LLC, but failing to disclose employment, or any other interest, with respect to that specific company at any point in the past, is not a standard that the Ohio Ethics Commission should want to set,” the complaint says. 
DeepRock is currently facing litigation in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas. Brine injected into a DeepRock well migrated underground and erupted to the surface in an abandoned well in Noble County in 2021. DeepRock did not have to pay for clean-up and the state spent about $1.3 million to plug the leak and clean it up. 
Chavez did not disclose his or his immediate family members’ interest in Heinrich Property LLC, Horizon Partners Investments LLC, Funds Protection Investment LLC, Condevco Operating LLC, and DeepRock Disposal Solutions LLC, according to the complaint. 
“Failing to list a single LLC for which you have an interest on a state financial disclosure form is a problem,” the complaint says. “Failing to fully disclose interests in as many as five or even six LLCs … is more than a simple oversight.”
The ethics complaint also alleges Chavez fast-tracked a bill that could financial benefit him. 
Ohio Senate Bill 219 would change the state’s orphan well program by proposing a dedicated fund for plugging orphan wells and streamlining notice requirements before work would begin. An orphan well is an abandoned oil and gas well that has no owner, meaning no one is able to properly plug the well.
It also makes it easier for drillers to get expedited review of projects, limits liability after a well owner sells one of their wells and gets rid of a requirement for drillers to make road-use agreements with local governments. 
The bill was introduced in June by Republican Senator Al Landis, passed the Senate in November, and is now in the Ohio House. 
Chavez Well Service has bid on five orphan well contracts since Chavez became a senator and won one contract worth more that $200,000, according to the complaint.  
“Should Senate Bill 219 become law, the injection well industry will be set to make more money with less oversight,” according to the complaint. “Consequently, Senator Chavez, with both his disclosed and undisclosed interests, could stand to profit from the provisions in Senate Bill 219.” 
Ohio’s Orphan Well Program has plugged approximately 2,300 abandoned wells since its inception in 1977.

(Getty Images)As a family doctor, I have been trained to ask questions, and after years of study and practice, I’ve become pretty good at it.
The question I find myself asking about a recent article published by The Guardian (“‘A bombshell’: Doubt cast on discovery of microplastics throughout human body,” Jan. 13), calling into question the relevance of micro- and nanoplastics to human health is, why? Why would a publication known for its journalistic commitment to robust and factual evidence give oxygen to aspersions on a well-established quorum of scientific consensus?
This is a confounding question in light of the plethora of articles that The Guardian has previously published to the contrary regarding micro- and nanoplastics and human health.
Just two weeks ago, for instance, The Guardian ran an article highlighting the widely agreed upon finding that “burning plastic releases noxious compounds such as dioxins, furans, and heavy metals” (“Household burning of plastic waste in developing world is hidden health threat, study shows,” Jan. 8). This research surveyed 1,000 respondents across 26 countries. The “bombshell” article fails to provide similar significant quantitative objections.
In New Hampshire, where the literal downstream health and environmental impacts of micro- and nanoplastics are readily apparent, The Guardian’s assessment grossly undervalues the lived experience in favor of weak general claims of insufficient scientific rigor.
Included in the long list of noxious compounds associated with the production of plastics are the “forever chemicals” colloquially known as PFAS. These chemicals contaminate air, soil, and water, and have been shown to cause a variety of cancers, thyroid and gastrointestinal disease, and cardiovascular disease. They have been banned because of their toxicity.
The Guardian rightly acknowledges a few facts in its risky article: There is too much plastic in the world, it is a growing problem, it has microscopically made its way into our bodies, and we should probably try to avoid a lot of it.
For reasons that are unclear, The Guardian chose to publish an article of distraction, diverting attention and credibility from this very serious and well-established problem. While the science showing exactly what this means for human health does have room for improvement and growth, it is morally reprehensible to conflate this natural level of uncertainty with a lack of actionable evidence.
The Hippocratic oath is the foundation of medicine, and first doing no harm is the foundation of my care for every patient. So again I ask, why is this fundamental tenet now being challenged?
We all, doctors, health care providers, scientists, journalists, corporate CEOs, and individuals, need to remember this for our own well-being. Part of doing no harm means assuming a conservative approach when it comes to exposure to toxic substances, which we have not always done well.
We don’t put our seatbelts on at the start of a collision, we put them on before we start the car. We should be buckled in for this entire journey in plastics, not years from now when the science is more clear, but now because we are in the car, and we know that there is always a chance of an accident.
We have nothing to lose and everything to gain by putting safety first.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/plasticpollution-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-26 04:57:16.760364

This story was originally reported by Amanda Becker of The 19th.  Meet Amanda and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.
SPRINGFIELD, Ohio — Margery Koveleski didn’t know it at the time, but her life’s work began in 2018, when her former pastor asked the mother of six if she could interpret Sunday services for a group of recently arrived Haitians. Church services led to teaching English classes, which led to interpreting at a community health clinic, which led to opening an office in the back of a Haitian grocery store.  There, for nearly five years now, Margery has helped Haitians settle into this midwestern city of 60,000 that became a flashpoint for the country’s immigration debate during the 2024 presidential campaign.
At first, a lot of Margery’s work revolved around setting things up: utilities, cell phones, health care. Then, as President Donald Trump escalated his immigration crackdown to unprecedented levels, her focus shifted to winding things down. Margery is now a lifeline for her Haitian neighbors as they fight to stay in a country where fewer and fewer legal pathways are available to them. Without a last-minute reprieve, the clock has likely run out on many of their American journeys.
Margery has called Springfield home since she moved here about 24 years ago from New York, where she was born and raised. She learned Haitian Creole as a child by translating for her maternal grandmother, who joined them in New York from Haiti. Now, she shares the language of her ancestors — and her calling — with her 27-year-old daughter, Laura Koveleski, who moved home to Ohio from Florida about three years ago.
Margery’s work, done from a desk in a closet-sized storeroom an arm’s length from where her daughter now sits, sometimes demands long hours, produces little income and isn’t the type of job you leave behind when you go home for the day. They know their clients are depending on them, now more than ever, and they’re willing to give them whatever they need most: a ride to court, a sympathetic ear, a call to an employer to negotiate family leave.

Lately, supporting clients as they try to sort out their immigration cases takes up more and more of their time. Margery’s massive desk calendar notes the increasingly frequent all-day trips they make with Haitians to Ohio’s main immigration court in Cleveland, about a three-hour drive. On one such day last autumn, Margery’s alarm went off at 3 a.m. She made her way to the guest bedroom downstairs to make sure Laura was awake. Within the hour, they were out the door to pick up a man on Springfield’s south side, where most of the city’s Haitian immigrants live. A soft rain fell as Laura merged their rental car — picked up the night before, to spare their own from the wear-and-tear — east on I-70, then north on I-71, past the soggy corn and soybean fields that line the interstates most of the way to Cleveland.
Mother and daughter talked quietly as their client caught up on sleep in the back seat. They all knew they were making the journey, which clocks in at least nine hours from pick-up to drop-off, despite near certainty that the man’s asylum claim would be denied. During a prior court appearance, a judge gave him 30 days to produce proof of personal persecution in Haiti, with the type of evidence that is all but impossible to get in a country where armed gangs rule the capital and routine government services barely exist.
It’s a now-familiar predicament for so many in his community.
The man was one of some 330,000 Haitians in the United States under a program known as Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, which gives people from certain countries in conflict or facing natural disasters the ability to live and work in the United States for a set period of time. He was seeking asylum because barring action from the federal courts, TPS for Haitians ends February 3. Less than two weeks now remain for hundreds of thousands of Haitians to make an impossible choice: go back to an unstable, violent and desperately poor country where they fear they might die; leave and start again in another new country; or slip into the shadows in the United States, unable to work or live freely.
It all has Margery, a no-nonsense nurturer whom many clients call “manman” — Haitian Creole for “mother” — rethinking whether her city and country are the type of places where Haitians should try to put down roots and build lives.
“I went through a process of grief, but I’m now at acceptance,” Margery said.
Margery and Laura arrived back from the trip to Cleveland in the last light of the grey day. On the ride home, their client said he’d likely go to Mexico ahead of the TPS end date; other Haitians have told them they plan to leave for Brazil or Chile. After dropping him off at home, mother and daughter headed to Eat Greek and More, a favorite spot by the reservoir in Springfield’s northeast suburbs. They ordered at the counter, then slid into a booth. Their falafel arrived in plastic baskets lined with red-and-white checkered paper. Now that they’re regulars, the owner often makes eating there all the more enticing by sending over fries or dessert on the house. Margery first tried Greek food with Laura in Cincinnati, and she was thrilled to find such a good option a couple of miles from home. It’s become their go-to place to bring visitors, an introduction to their city that defies preconceived notions about small towns in red states far away from the country’s coasts.
It also serves as yet another reminder of the good that immigration has brought to Springfield at a time when the issue threatens to tear their city — and their country — apart.

Springfield has been on edge since the final months of the 2024 presidential election, when now-President Trump and Vice President JD Vance, who was then one of Ohio’s U.S. senators, spread the lie that Haitians in Springfield were eating their neighbors’ pets — a convenient internet fable that bolstered their ticket’s call for mass deportations. Vance grew up just an hour’s drive away, in similarly sized Middletown, Ohio, which did not take the same steps to welcome Haitian immigrants as Springfield did and has also not experienced a recent economic resurgence. When CNN’s Dana Bash confronted Vance about his role spreading the pet-eating lie, he said that it was OK to  “create stories” that drew attention to issues his constituents cared about, like immigration.
But much of the attention directed at  Springfield was negative and laced with violence. Neo-Nazi and white nationalist groups like Blood Tribe and Patriot Front disrupted community events and protested in front of City Hall. Phoned-in bomb threats forced the temporary closure of schools. Local charity leaders helping Haitians were doxxed; business owners employing Haitian workers were threatened. To many in Springfield, it started to feel like their community, where leaders had taken great lengths to help Haitians assimilate by amping up translation services and securing training systems for new drivers, was starting to come apart at the seams.
It wasn’t that Springfield absorbed the estimated 12,000 to 15,000 immigrants that arrived in Ohio’s Clark County in recent years without issue. Though Haitians began immigrating to the area more than a decade ago, their numbers increased during the early years of the COVID-19 pandemic, when staffing agencies recruited them for jobs that paid as much as $20 an hour — jobs that employers couldn’t seem to fill. The rapid influx stressed local resources, particularly housing, because Haitian workers often rented bedrooms in shared homes and could therefore collectively pay higher rents than many longtime local families. It created some resentment.
Tensions worsened in August 2023 when a Haitian immigrant driving without an Ohio license crashed into a school bus, killing an 11-year-old boy on the first day of school. The next year, a jury convicted the driver of aggravated vehicular homicide and involuntary manslaughter. Trump and Vance seized on the tragedy as further evidence that Haitians were criminals, cherry-picking crime statistics to present Springfield as a city under siege. The student’s devastated parents pleaded at city meetings for people to stop invoking their son’s death to justify anti-immigrant hatred.
What the vitriol obscured, according to Margery and many other longtime Springfield residents, were the improvements that followed the most recent wave of Haitian arrivals: formerly boarded-up houses were renovated and filled, employers expanded in the region thanks to a reliable workforce, and small businesses like restaurants and grocery stores opened to serve Haitians nostalgic for home.
Springfield’s Republican mayor worked to dispel the pet-eating myth. Ohio’s GOP governor, Mike DeWine, also tried to turn down the temperature, promising to send more resources to the city where he was born. DeWine was familiar with conditions on the ground in Haiti: He had made dozens of trips there over the years to visit a school named for a daughter who died in a car accident when she was 22; the school was forced to close in early 2024 due to worsening violence. “Haitians are — culturally, my wife, Fran, and I have seen this when we’ve been down in Haiti — education is prized,” DeWine told ABC’s “This Week.” “So when you look at all of these things, people who want to work, people who value their kids, who value education, you know, these are positive influences on our community in Springfield.”
Trump’s second administration has attempted to move up the TPS end date for Haitians (the effort was blocked by the courts) and cut off other avenues for Haitians to obtain different types of legal immigration statuses. Over his first year in office, Haitians have become less visible on Springfield’s streets and foot traffic is down at businesses serving Haitian immigrants, like the grocery store that hosts Margery’s office. As scenes of armed and masked immigration agents breaking down doors in Minneapolis homes began to unfold on smartphone screens in Springfield in recent weeks, Haitians — and their American neighbors — grew more and more afraid. Charities and churches have developed meal-delivery systems so Haitians do not need to leave their houses.

DeWine, who has privately told local charities that his hands are tied when it comes to federal immigration policy, recently warned that if there is no reprieve on TPS, it could jeopardize Springfield’s recent economic upswing, which also boosted fortunes in the larger rural region.
Sometimes, Margery wonders whether it’s time to close up shop.
“Is it worth it to fight to stay in America, now? That’s a question I ask myself,” she said as she and Laura finished their dinner of falafel and owner-proffered fries. “If our government is changing, if more than half of the population is okay with what’s happening, is it really worth it?”
“Changing drastically, so as far as deportations, could be good news, bad news, who knows,” Laura added.
“I used to live in fear of all this mistreatment,” said Margery, “and I’m seeing what’s happening, and because I believe in God, and I know that God is sovereign, if they’re deporting them, who’s to know that is not the best thing?”

Margery’s faith in God is what drew her to Springfield in the first place.
When the Koveleskis were living in New York City, they would travel the country in their motor home, visiting other congregations affiliated with their own conservative, majority-Black Christian church, including one in Springfield. On September 11, 2001, Margery’s husband was at work when two planes flew into the World Trade Center; they couldn’t reach each other for hours. Their fear compelled them to move their young family to safety. A church friend who had hosted them during their Christmastime trips asked, “Why not Springfield?” They moved the next year.
By the time Haitians were arriving in Springfield in earnest, Margery had soured on her church. There was a sex scandal involving a pastor in a neighboring state, and then reports of financial improprieties in another congregation. The church embraced divine healing — the belief that you can recover from illness and injury through the healing power of God without medical intervention — around the same time that Margery needed life-saving caesarean sections to deliver her two youngest children. That, she said, was when she finally “lost the faith.” She now describes herself as spiritual but not religious.
Still, in 2018, when her former pastor asked if she would put differences aside and step up to interpret Sunday services for a group of Haitian congregants, she did not hesitate. She also started teaching them English in the evening.
“I remember the first night they saw snow,” Margery recalled. “They were laughing and opening their mouths, and they were praising God, seeing snow for the first time in their life; this was magical for them.”
One of the students was an older man named Moses. “He had a t-shirt on, and it was snowing, and I said, ‘Moses, you have no coat, aren’t you cold? You should wear a sweater.” She remembered him responding: “No, I’m in America. I’m in America. I’m gonna learn to be content. I’m gonna train my body to be grateful and happy, and so if I’m cold, I’m not going to complain. I’m going to give God thanks because I’m able to be in America, I’m able to work, and I have security, I have a church. What else do I need?”
Margery knew that Moses would nevertheless need a coat to get through Ohio’s winter. She asked the congregation if they could collect cold-weather apparel one Sunday for their Haitian worshippers and was disappointed when church leaders said they would need to hold a special meeting to discuss what seemed like a routine effort, and one they’d done before for other groups in need.
But, she said, God found another way. The principal at her younger son’s school, where she volunteered, overheard her talking about working with the Haitians at church and wrote a no-strings-attached $1,000 check. Margery and her husband used it to buy dozens of coats, gloves and hats, and distributed them to the Haitians after a Sunday service. It was like Christmas arrived early, she said.
Then came her breaking point.
At the end of another church service, when congregants had the opportunity to talk about something God had done in their lives, a debate erupted over whether the Haitians, who were dutifully and enthusiastically paying their tithes, were truly full congregants and able to offer testimony. One American congregant, she said, asked if the Haitians attending church alongside them were “legal.”
When it was Margery’s turn to testify about God’s work in her life, she took the microphone and walked her fellow congregants through passages of the Bible related to persecution and forced migration, and she talked to them about the Underground Railroad.
“I burnt the church with my tongue,” she recalled. “I rebuked the church and the minister, everybody, and I didn’t come back after that.”
But it didn’t take her long to find other ways to continue what had become her own ministry.
For several months, after she and her husband were forced to shutter their high-end furniture store during the pandemic, Margery interpreted for Haitian Creole-speaking patients at a community health care center. Then, a friend from church who knew about her work with the Haitian community called to tell her she’d seen a small grocery store on the city’s south side with a Haitian flag displayed in its window.
Margery wrote down the address, then went to check it out. The owner was a Haitian American with a green card who had recently moved to Springfield from New York, sensing a business opportunity when he heard that Haitian workers were settling in the city. She introduced herself; he said she could help his customers set up their phones and utilities and figure out their dates in immigration court from his grocery.
Margery started out at a little table, set up among the bins of cassava and coolers of Cola Couronne, an amber-colored Haitian soda that tastes like an effervescent fruit punch and is fondly called “Caribbean champagne.” At first, she worked entirely for free. Then, she started accepting small payments to cover supplies like stamps and envelopes. It became clear that her work would require its own designated space — to keep the aisles clear in the grocery store, but also for privacy. Many of Margery’s clients had traveled the harrowing migration route through the Darién Gap, the remote, dense rain forest that links Colombia and Panama. It was not uncommon for their stories to include details of their own sexual assaults or the family members they lost to sickness or injury along the way. They needed a quiet space to unburden themselves. They needed a quiet space to pray.

Now, a slightly larger storage room in the rear of the grocery acts as a waiting area for Margery’s clients until it is their turn to take a seat in the closet-sized storeroom office she shares with Laura. Clients got to know Laura from the small trinkets and jewelry she gifted them, like sheets of earrings from the budget mall shop Claire’s. The gifts helped inject a little joy into the otherwise dreary experience of dealing with the U.S. immigration system.
Laura learned Haitian Creole by listening to clients’ migration stories. Some, she memorialized in paint. One painting, above Margery’s desk, depicts a father and young son holding hands as they face the jungle; the client’s wife and the son’s mother did not survive the trip. The painting above Laura’s own desk shows Haiti’s La Citadelle, a 19th century fortress honoring the successful slave rebellion that led to the country’s independence from France. In the painting, a young boy stands with his mother at the base of the winding, uphill road that leads to Haitian independence, with earthquakes and other obstacles along the way.
“We hear a lot of stories of what it took for people to get here. People who walk from Chile, people who walk from Brazil, people who maybe took a flight from Haiti to Nicaragua, but walk from Nicaragua. All of those people, walking up to the U.S.-Mexico border, hoping to get some sort of permission to enter the country,” Laura said. “During that route, you’re walking through the jungle with your family. A lot of people don’t make it. People fell from mountains. People drown in rivers. If you break a leg, you can’t keep walking, and you can’t have somebody carry you the whole way through, so you hope something will take you out.”

Margery and Laura now work out of their grocery-store office three or four days a week. Each day brings a little bit of everything. A sign in Haitian Creole hanging in the waiting area clarifies what the women can — and cannot  — do for their clients.
Laura translated the words as Margery gently corrected her grammar: “I’m not a lawyer; I’m not an immigration officer; I’m not a U.S.C.I.S. officer; I’m not a judge; I can’t make any decision on your case or process your case; I can’t call or check your status without you; I can’t call immigration without you; I can’t guarantee the results; I can assist you, I can help you with your application, I can write a letter, I can help you get information; I can’t do a miracle, only Jesus can.”

On a chilly day in December, the task at hand was wedding planning. Laura had already gone with the client to weigh in on the dress — intricate lacing, dramatic back, short train — and was now ordering a suit for the bride’s infant son on Amazon. While the client had the money to pay for the suit, she did not have a credit card, so Laura used theirs for the purchase. Once the suit was ordered, they started brainstorming beautiful and free indoor spots in Columbus for wedding photos. Several feet away, another mother met with Margery because she needed help asking her employer for time off work after giving birth.
A couple of months earlier, on a sunny day in October, most of the people who stopped by had questions about a new immigration fee that the Trump administration had announced without explaining how people should pay it. Haitians wanted to comply with the new rule to improve their chances of staying in the country, so they waited in folding chairs against shelves of cassava bread, coconut milk and cases of mango-strawberry juice. Among them was a man with a red folder of documents and a woman bouncing a baby on her knee.
Margery’s cell phone did not stop ringing.
“Alo,” she answered in Haitian Creole. “Yes, you’ll see a Haitian flag in the window,” she said once it was clear that the man on the other end of the line spoke fluent English.
Soon, a master sergeant in his U.S. Army fatigues poked his head into the office to make sure he was in the right place. He held his elderly mother’s purse as she and her husband, dressed in their Sunday best, settled into chairs in the waiting area. His mother and stepfather had called him the night before, he explained, ahead of a court appearance that day because they needed his help interpreting. He drove more than 15 hours overnight from Louisiana to meet them at court in Columbus, only to find out family members could not act as interpreters; the interviews would need to be rescheduled. A lawyer overheard the exchange and shared Margery’s phone number, so the master sergeant, his mother and stepfather got back the car and drove the hour-plus to see her in Springfield.
“They’re frantic right now,” the master sergeant assured Margery, gesturing to the prim and stoic elderly couple sitting outside her office door.
It only took minutes — the master sergeant didn’t even sit down — for them to work out that Margery would assist his mother and stepfather at their rescheduled interview. The master sergeant bought a Couronne, then took his parents to lunch. He would take a short nap before driving back to Louisiana.
“You’re a good son,” Margery said,  then turned back to help the new mother.
Margery and Laura’s work navigating the morass of the U.S. court and immigration systems has only become more essential in recent weeks as the TPS end date looms for Haitians. They said that many are hoping that a federal court intervenes and extends the program. Clients are banking on a judge ruling that since TPS was created to protect people who cannot safely return to their home countries, they cannot be sent back to Haiti — where many of them do want to return someday — until conditions improve.
Margery said she can’t help but think sometimes about one of her favorite musicals, “Fiddler on the Roof.” In it, Tevye is a poor Jewish milkman living in early 1900s Russia. He and his family decide to flee anti-Semitic pogroms in their Jewish village of Anatevka, and the final scene shows them on a ship headed to safety in New York. In Margery’s present-day reimagining, Springfield is Anatevka, Haitians are the persecuted people and the United States is the country they must consider leaving to find safety.
Margery is trying to accept that the country that offered her own parents safe harbor in the 1960s, then the city that offered her own growing family refuge after 9/11, are no longer the beacons to newcomers that they once were. She is trying to make peace with what that means — for her clients, for herself, for her country.
“We’ve made so many enemies in the world. If the world is turning away from America, who could know the consequences that America is going to reap?” Margery asked.
“We may need to lose everything,” she added, “in order to be put back together again.”

Josh Shapiro vowed on Saturday to take legal action against the federal government for a decision to remove an exhibit on slavery at Independence National Historic Park in Philadelphia.

During his book launch of “Where We Keep the Light” at the Parkway Central Library in Philadelphia, Shapiro delivered pointed criticism at President Donald Trump’s administration for the Department of Interior’s actions on Thursday to remove the exhibit about the nine people enslaved by George Washington at the President’s House Site. He accused the federal government of attempting to divide people, while whitewashing the nation’s shared history. 
Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker’s administration, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer, filed its lawsuit on Thursday and said that in 2006, the city and federal government signed a cooperative agreement that may require advance notice for changes to the site and added that the city is reviewing its options.

Shapiro said he is working closely with the Parker administration and will be filing an amicus brief to support them. 
“We are exploring ways in which we can get those displays back up either on city or state owned property nearby,” Shapiro said. 
Noting that the nation is celebrating its 250th birthday, Shapiro emphasized the importance for acknowledging history. 
“How can we go forward if we don’t know our history,” Shapiro. “How can we go forward if we don’t remember where we came from?”
“Those signs aren’t just signs. It’s not just metal and ink,” he added. “What that is, is our shared history.”
ABC News reported on Friday that a spokesperson for the Department of the Interior said the move complies with Trump’s executive order in March 2025 to remove “divisive, race-centered ideology” and narratives from federal cultural institutions.
However, U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick (R-Pa.), an ally of Trump, also voiced his disagreement with removing the exhibit, while likening it to his opposition to the changing of names of some military bases.
“Our history is our history. It is our willingness to learn from it that makes America exceptional and the greatest country on Earth, on our journey to become a more perfect union,” McCormick wrote, in part, in a social media post on Saturday.
Shapiro expressed confidence that they will be successful in getting the display back up.
Shapiro says he’s prepared to protect the vote ahead of midterm elections
Shapiro said he “fully expects” Trump to “continue to try and undermine our elections,” ahead of the 2026 midterm, in response to a question submitted to the moderator by an audience member. 
“We continue to have free and fair, safe and secure elections,” he said. “I will do everything in my power to stop anyone from taking away your vote in the midterms.”
Shapiro, who was elected governor in 2022, is seeking a second term in November. His likely opponent is Republican state Treasurer Stacy Garrity, who supports Trump.
He referenced his time as the state’s attorney general during the 2020 election when Trump sued the state 43 times in an effort to overturn the election, but was unsuccessful.

“Suffice to say we are on it. We are prepared,” Shapiro said. “We will do everything in our power to protect your vote. That is your power and we will protect it.”
Throughout the event, Shapiro delivered pointed criticism of Trump on a wide variety of matters, including his administration’s actions with Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. 
Outside of the event, protesters gathered to call on Shapiro’s administration to not cooperate with ICE.
However, he also said Democrats have to do more than just fight against Trump, but have to make an effort to improve the lives of citizens. Shapiro touched on usual themes from his speeches about the importance of investing in education and public safety, while working across the aisle with Republicans, who hold a majority in the state Senate.
Recalling arson attack, Shapiro highlights power of prayer
For a sizable portion of the program, Shapiro, alongside Salem Baptist Church Pastor Marshall Mitchell, talked about how faith has shaped his life and career. 
Shapiro said he was five months into writing the book when Cody Balmer, a Harrisburg man, firebombed the Governor’s Residence while his family and guests were sleeping after Passover.

He said the power of prayer from people of all walks of life lifted him and his family up in that difficult moment. 
Shapiro also described growing up in a home that was structured around religion in Montgomery County, noting he attended a faith-based school, and celebrated shabbat dinner on Friday with his family. He said he and his wife, First Lady Lori Shapiro, raise their children to be connected to their faith.
Following the Oct. 7, 2023, attack in Israel by Hamas, Shapiro said he heard from those who were Jewish who were scared and said he felt a responsibility to be more open about this faith, as antisemitism and other forms of bigotry were on the rise.
Vice President Kamala Harris, who is mentioned in the book, considered Shapiro as her running mate in 2024 and reportedly asked if the governor had ever been an agent of Israel. CNN reports Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who Harris selected to run as vice president, was also asked if he had ever been an agent of China. Shapiro did not mention her during the event.
Multiple elected officials were in attendance, including U.S. Rep. Dwight Evans (D-Philadelphia), state Sen. Sharif Street (D-Philadelphia), multiple members of the state House, and a representative from Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker’s office. 
State Rep. Chris Rabb (D-Philadelphia) was spotted outside at the immigration protest. 
2028 on the horizon
As Shapiro seeks a second term as governor, he is being mentioned as a potential candidate for the White House in 2028. 
Mitchell, who served as the moderator, ended the event by noting that Shapiro often talks about basketball in the book and referenced an analogy about how the governor wants the ball in his hand so he can take the shot. 
“There’s a lot of people in this room and a lot of people who are listening who are counting on you taking your shot,” Mitchell said. “Now and in the not-so-distant future.”
The next stops along the book tour for Shapiro include New York on Tuesday, Boston on Wednesday, and Washington D.C on Thursday.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/slavery-exhibit-philly-1-1024x661.jpeg,,,2026-01-26 04:57:16.760364

Statehouse scraps
Opinion editor Clay Wirestone’s weekly roundup of Kansas legislative exploits. Read the archive.


You’ll hear phrases like these if you spend time following state government. One of its biggest purposes — if not its single-most important — consists of spending money for schools, roads and other public services. But budgets sound dull. Dealing with columns of figures puts many Kansans to sleep. It’s understandable.
It’s also dangerous. 
As I learned during my years in the nonprofit world, budgets are moral documents. What you choose to spend money on reveals what you prioritize. What you choose to cut reveals what you dismiss.
Just look at funding for public schools and universities.


Educational institutions with more resources can offer students more programs, more skilled teachers and more enrichment opportunities. Schools with fewer resources struggle to cover the basics. Kansans grasp this. Many move to Johnson County and other privileged communities for “good schools” supported by property taxes.
If the state doesn’t support public schools and universities adequately, what kind of judgment does it make about our state’s children and young adults? What kind of judgment does it make about our society and our future?
The Kansas Legislature’s annual budget debate is set to kick off with a Monday hearing. I urge you to pay attention, to actively track where the money goes. Watch what lawmakers actually do with the billions of dollars that comprise our state budget. Are they using those dollars to support the people of Kansas — especially those most in need of assistance — or are they handing out freebies to favored groups?
You will hear one claim at some moment that they have to go along with a cut they don’t like or a long-term reduction they hope to reverse in the future. Treat them with the utmost skepticism.
Every lawmaker, Republican and Democrat, conservative and liberal, has free will. They have the ability to choose. They will all make moral judgments in the days and weeks ahead. Let’s see what they do.

Higher education chatter
I dropped by the weekly press conference held by House Minority Leader Brandon Woodard and Senate Minority Leader Dinah Sykes, both Lenexa Democrats, on Thursday. The two chatted with reporters about the budget rush (see above) and life in the opposition party.
One question raised was whether the Legislature would take dramatic steps to reduce spending. And by dramatic, I mean closing Emporia State University.
Woodard told me in a follow-up email: “There has been talk of that my whole time in the legislature, but I haven’t seen any action steps to actually make that a reality. I think with a new leader, they can restore the faith and enrollment in Emporia State University.”
As I wrote last month, let’s hope thats true.
Former Emporia State president Ken Hush, meanwhile, has been brought on as a budget consultant for the Legislature. But Woodard told the assembled reporters Thursday that he hadn’t seen hide nor hair of the man.
“As one of his eight bosses, I haven’t had a conversation with him since they allegedly hired him for $10,000 a month,” the House minority leader said. “I haven’t seen him in any of the budget committees.”
I have spotted Hush hurrying through the Statehouse hallways, but apparently he wasn’t going to meet Democrats.
Woodard told me he hoped lawmakers would soon have a broader conversation about Kansas higher education. That doesn’t mean closing Emporia State, but it could mean considering tough steps. As demographics change and fewer students enroll, problems will inevitably follow.
“I do hope we can start strategic planning for what our university system looks like two decades from now after the enrollment cliff, and whether it is feasible to maintain six institutions or not,” he wrote.

Friendlier vibe detected
I’ve detected a slightly different tone at the Kansas Statehouse this session. Maybe the upcoming primary and general elections are the cause, maybe folks have just showed up with different dispositions.
In either case, I’ve noted a generally lower temperature and slightly friendlier vibe. This doesn’t mean the Legislature will get around to serving everyday Kansas anytime soon, mind you, but perhaps that accelerated schedule and a desire to avoid looking like extremists in front of voters has sanded the rough edges off a handful of legislators.
Budget hearings this week will be a test, as will the ongoing partisan shadowboxing in Rep. Pat Proctor’s House Elections Committee. Can even lower-key lawmakers restrain themselves when the chance to undercut Democrats or poor people arises?
We’ll all have to wait and see.

Kansas Reflector funding
The question of how Kansas Reflector is funded comes up every year or two. We’ve always been open and honest about the process, but in case you haven’t heard our explanation before, here it is.
We’re part of States Newsroom, a national nonprofit devoted to providing state news coverage of issues that otherwise would go underreported, or unreported. When Kansas Reflector launched on July 21, 2020, we were the organization’s 18th outlet. States Newsroom now oversees newsrooms in 39 states and has content-sharing agreements with nonprofits in the other 11. In other words, we have boots on the ground in every state of the nation.
Based in North Carolina, States Newsroom handles high-level fundraising and human resource duties for all of these outlets. You can read our parent’s tax returns and browse a list of everyone who has contributed more than $1,000 at statenewsroom.com/support.
If you want to know more about the organization, feel free to read these pieces from The Washington Post and the Columbia Journalism Review.
In recent years, Kansas Reflector has focused more on local fundraising. In 2025, we’re proud to say that we brought in a record amount from folks across the state, who donated an average of $38 apiece. In total, you all contributed an amount that equates to about 40% of our yearly budget.
Folks at the town halls we’ve held across the state sometimes ask how solid we feel about our funding model and our future.
The answer? We feel good about both.
Admittedly, the news media faces challenges from every front. But as long as we do our jobs to the best of our ability, and as long as Kansans support our work as strongly as they have in recent years, I expect us to be around for a long time to come.
Kansas lawmakers should take note.

(Photo by U.S. Department of Agriculture)Last year, Congress rushed to push through all of the president’s wish list as H.R. 1, the “Big Beautiful Bill Act,” while the new president’s honeymoon poll numbers were still intact. 
The bill enacted a range of policies, including making President Trump’s 2017 tax cuts permanent, exempting tips and overtime from federal income taxes, and requiring new work requirements for safety net features like Medicaid.
One item that flew under the radar for many but has been reported by the Cleveland-based Center for Community Solutions since last year is a provision that changes the funding structure for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, previously known as “food stamps”). 
The new law enacted new requirements on states, requiring them to reduce benefit provision error rates or be required to pick up larger parts of the tab for SNAP.
The problem with this requirement is that Congress set the required error rate so low that only seven states would have achieved it in 2024.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
According to the Center for Community Solutions, Ohio’s error rate was 9% in 2024 and if Ohio’s rate is that high in 2026, the state will be on the hook for $318 million in SNAP payments that it previously did not have to pay.
An estimate by the Georgetown Law Center on Poverty and Inequality in September put that number at closer to $390 million. 
It seems like whomever you ask, Ohio will be on the hook for hundreds of millions of dollars if it wants to keep its SNAP program.
To understand the scale of this, a $318 million new SNAP obligation would make Ohio’s new SNAP obligation on its own as expensive as a top-10 agency in the state government. 
That would make continuing to fund SNAP as expensive as Ohio’s entire Department of Natural Resources, Department of Health, and Department of Transportation combined according to Legislative Service Commission data.
$300 million or more is no tiny line item, even for a large state like Ohio. 
Ohio has previously balked at proposals for $300 million food programs, so there is a strong scenario that Ohio ends up with a $300 million tab from the federal government later this year and state legislators balk at it, leading to the end of the SNAP program in Ohio.
SNAP is a big deal. 
It is one of the largest antipoverty programs in the country, pulling an estimated 3.6 million Americans out of poverty. 
In our 2024 study of poverty in Ohio, we estimated that over 1.5% of the state population is kept out of poverty by SNAP. That means that under a conservative scenario, 180,000 Ohio residents would be plunged into poverty by dropping the program.
SNAP is a program that reduces poverty, reduces food insecurity, and supports local grocers. 
Losing the $260 million a month that the federal government finances in grocery spending in Ohio through SNAP will mean the closing of grocery stores that serve low-income households across the state, especially considering the low margins grocery stores run on. 
This could be especially devastating for low-income, rural communities like Vinton County, Ohio, which endured a stint a decade ago where it had no grocery store throughout the entire county.
Ohio is on the precipice of facing the consequences of H.R. 1. 
Hopefully federal policymakers realize the dangers of playing chicken with the U.S. safety net and decide to pump the brakes, otherwise hundreds of thousands of low-income residents in Ohio will suffer.

Or even an average one.  While […],"(Getty Images)Fun fact: Knowing the three branches of government or the legal basis for Brown vs. Board of Education or the exact number of square miles in Nebraska or any of a number of questions on a civics test is no guarantee one will be an effective Nebraska state senator. Or even an average one. 
While knowing how and why government works is a good start, elected leaders need much more to steer any ship of state and keep it from running aground on everything from debilitating partisanship to undue special interest influence to wing-nut conspiracy theories. 
That said, please do not confuse the broadside above with me finding Legislative Bill 1066 wholly disagreeable. The proposed legislation would require Nebraska state senators to take a 20-question civics test and post their scores on the Nebraska Legislature’s website.
Support for civics emphasis
Holding political office without a grounding in civics is a poor look, one that eventually comes to light. Cases in point: A U.S. senator from Alabama and now candidate for governor there famously did not know the aforementioned three branches of government. Another U.S. senator publicly confused the Constitution with the Declaration of Independence. The Secretary of Homeland Security didn’t know the meaning of habeas corpus.
While a nominal civic education assures nothing, it is critical to be an effective office holder. LB 1066 hopes to remedy potential failings among those who represent us in the Unicameral.
Should Nebraska legislators be tested on civics knowledge? New bill says yes.

A state senator would have 90 days after taking office to tackle LB 1066’s 20 questions on civics and U.S. history, which could be the same as those administered to individuals hoping to become naturalized American citizens. 
I hate to pick nits, but the timing seems a little strange. Some voters might want to see test results before an election rather than after. Just saying.
While knowledge of civics and U.S. history are important, for my money an effective senator provides leadership despite the room’s temperature and the political pressure gauge’s reading; has a penchant for thinking critically lest unintended consequences derail what seemed like a good idea at the time; displays a willingness to use proven science rather than political expediency in writing laws; and rocks an attitude of collegiality without being a doormat, carrying someone else’s water or hiding in the smallness of ad hominem attacks. 
Otherwise special sessions get called to undo a safe haven law, an abundance of medical research, and experience gets ignored for political purposes. Name-calling passes for argument and wisdom.
Communism and more
The Legislature also will be thinking about communism this session or, more to the point, a duplication of communism. Senators will be debating LB 1024, which would require Nebraska public schools to add teaching the dangers of communism to school curricula, although it’s already part of the state’s social studies standards.
New bill would require Nebraska K-12 schools to teach anti-communist lessons

Aside from the duplicative nature of LB 1024, a reading of its seven pages reveals at best a set of curricular guidelines and at worst a class syllabus, neither of which seem to be in the Legislature’s charge, let alone its wheelhouse. Plus, nowhere in the introduced legislation is definitive evidence of “the increasing threat of communism in the United States …,” the basis on which LB 1024 is being proposed. 
Research shows some young Americans have looked at ideas more aligned with democratic socialism than communism, but it, too, is already covered in the state standards. Some might remember when we liked Ike, swiveled hula hoops around our waists, hard passed on the Edsel and at least a few people checked under their beds for commies. 
Aside from LB 1024’s communist focus providing a twinkle of the past, it might also provide a good civics test question: Who said and to whom and why, “Have you no sense of decency, sir?”
Voting knowledge
Finally, even though state senators would already be in office when they saddled up for a LB 1066 civics exam, the value of a knowledgeable class of political leaders extends well beyond the Nebraska Capitol and into the voting booth. 
Political and social scientists call those poorly informed who cast ballots, “low-information voters.” No term that I know of captures the phenomenon for those already in office and writing laws.
Finally, if LB 1066 passes, senators airing their “academic” laundry on the Legislature’s website deserve props. Never mind that Nebraskans would know the senators’ scores. Each of us has our own responsibility to be fully and factually informed, making good on that whole watchfulness in the citizen idea. 
It is indeed our salvation. Which also just might make another good question.

(Sarah Ladd/ Kentucky Lantern)An Oldham County mother has filed a lawsuit against Kentucky child welfare officials, alleging they violated state open records law by failing to provide records related to child deaths and serious injuries from neglect and abuse.
Jennifer Mortenson, who has 12 children, six of whom are adopted, said she is seeking the records to determine whether there are gaps in Kentucky’s system when it comes to protecting children.
While the Cabinet for Health and Family Services has provided thousands of pages of the records, it hasn’t fully complied with her request, has missed deadlines set by state law, provided incomplete files and has heavily redacted the material, according to the lawsuit filed Dec. 23 in Franklin Circuit Court.
“I’m not trying to make things difficult but open records are what they are,” Mortenson, a longtime child advocate, said in an interview. “You’re legally entitled to them.”
A Health and Family Services spokeswoman responded that the cabinet is complying with Mortenson’s request and continues to do so on a “rolling basis” as it reviews case files for release and redacts some information for privacy reasons.
“Following its commitment to transparency, the cabinet has provided extensive records in response to the open records request and has continually informed the requester of its ongoing review of records and the time needed to complete the review,” spokeswoman Beth Fisher said in an email. “At this time the cabinet has provided about 8,800 pages of records with necessary redactions and is reviewing between 12,000 and 14,000 additional records.”
As for potential gaps in child protection, Fisher said the cabinet’s “top priority is the health and safety of the Kentuckians we serve — especially children — and we remain committed to doing that work transparently and in accordance with our state laws.”
Access to some child protection records have been well-established by the courts in recent years.
In 2016, after a seven-year legal battle with the Louisville Courier Journal and the Lexington Herald-Leader, the state conceded that files it keeps of child deaths and near fatal-injuries are public records. The cabinet settled the legal battle by agreeing to pay the newspapers nearly $700,000 in penalties and legal costs.
The Todd County Standard, in a separate case, also won the right to obtain records related to the 2011 death of a child in that county who was fatally beaten after the cabinet placed her in an adoptive home.
The records of the case involving Amy Dye, 9, of Todd County, were particularly damaging. It became a symbol of systemic failures after records the state released showed state social service officials had disregarded repeated abuse allegations from teachers at her school.
No longer confidential
The cabinet for years had argued all such records were confidential but eventually agreed to abide by court rulings that found that cases in which a child dies or nearly dies from suspected abuse or neglect are subject to open records law.
There have been about 200 or more such cases per year in Kentucky over the past several years.
An outside panel that reviews all child deaths or severe injuries from suspected abuse or neglect reported in its most recent annual report that it examined 70 child deaths and 149 near-deaths in the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2023. It reviewed 68 deaths and 134 near deaths of children the previous year.
Mortenson said she wants more details about how the cabinet identifies and investigates such cases.
Mortenson said she and her husband, Matthew, became foster-adoptive parents in 2016. (Such parents provide temporary care for children with the goal of reuniting them with their parents but are prepared to legally adopt.) She also helps operate Hope’s Closet, which provides free children’s clothing and other items for foster, adoptive and kinship families.
She serves on the cabinet’s Trusted Advisors Council, a panel of individuals who have been involved with the foster adoptive system that recommend changes and identify areas of concern.
Mortenson said she first began requesting records in September 2025 of all child deaths and near-deaths from abuse or neglect for 2024 and the first eight months of 2025 but doesn’t believe the cabinet is fully complying.
Mortenson’s lawsuit has been assigned to Franklin Circuit Judge Phillip Shepherd, whose previous rulings upheld public access to such records in the cases brought by the newspapers starting in 2009.
Mortenson also has filed a complaint with the Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services outlining her concerns.
‘Plan of safe care’
Mortenson said she has become increasingly concerned about several areas where she sees gaps in protection for children and hopes to use the information to encourage lawmakers to strengthen laws.
One such area is how state social services staff oversee cases of newborns exposed to substances such as drugs or alcohol including those born with neonatal abstinence syndrome — in withdrawal from drugs, usually opioids, but often more than one substance.
Federal law requires state child welfare workers to create what’s known as a “Plan of Safe Care” for such newborns, meant to ensure the health and safety of the baby and support parents and caregivers.
Yet an outside panel that reviews child abuse deaths and near fatalities in Kentucky last year found in more than a third of the cases it reviewed of infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome, no record of such a plan could be found. The Child Fatality and Near Fatality External Review Panel concluded that was likely an “underestimate” of newborns without such plans.
Even as cases of infants born exposed to substances or in withdrawal have risen steadily in recent years, its report found the safety plan “is rarely available to most Kentucky families who are in dire need.” Such infants are at greater risk for health problems as well as abuse and neglect, the report said.
The panel noted that last year was the second year in a row it has recommended improving the system to provide such safety plans for infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome, noting that they are at risk of health problems as well as injury and death from abuse and neglect.
“Year after year, the panel has documented that these children are at serious risk of maltreatment,” the report said.
A state health office that tracks such births found a slight decrease in 2024 in the number of infants born with neonatal abstinence syndrome.
In 2024, there were 741 cases of babies with signs and symptoms of the syndrome versus 792 cases reported in 2023, according to the Kentucky Public Health Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome Reporting Registry 2025 annual report.
Among its recommendations: “Every infant, including those prenatally exposed to drugs or alcohol, should leave the hospital with an appropriate plan of safe care.”
But Mortenson said she doesn’t believe that’s happening, based on records she has collected and reviewed so far.
Her complaint to the federal health agency states that she believes safety plans are only documented in “a small percentage of cases” of newborns with neonatal abstinence syndrome. Her complaint said that appears to result from failure of a health provider to diagnose and report the condition to child welfare authorities as well as the failure of Kentucky Child Protective Services (CPS) to investigate and follow up on all such cases brought to its attention.
Cases ‘screened out?’
Mortenson also said she’s concerned that in many cases of child abuse and neglect, perpetrators are not prosecuted. She’s also concerned that Child Protective Services “screens out” too many reports of suspected abuse or neglect as not meriting an investigation, a concern also highlighted by the outside panel in its most recent report.
“Screening out of CPS referrals has been a concern addressed by the panel for many years and continues to be the most frequently identified area of concern,” its report said.
The cabinet, which investigates and decides whether to substantiate suspected abuse or neglect of children, says that while reports of suspected abuse have risen over the past several years, substantiations have “steadily decreased” over the past five years.
In 2024, 127,342 suspected cases were reported while 43,668 were accepted for investigation — the rest screened out. Of those, 8,196 cases of abuse or neglect were substantiated, according to an annual report by the cabinet.
Mortenson said she believes cases may be falling through the cracks of a chronically overworked and understaffed child welfare system.
Mortenson is not a lawyer but is representing herself in her open records lawsuit. She also plans to contact state legislators and enlist their support.
“My goal is to help identify the gaps and push legislation that will help protect children,” she said. “If I can help create the rules, maybe we can save some lives.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3810-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-26 00:56:59.235826

In 1975, a utility company needed a small legal favor, so they wrote a draft opinion and slipped it to him.
The late Justice Joseph Boyd Jr., via Florida Supreme Court
That is not, as I’m sure you are aware, normal.
Boyd said he did nothing improper: Indeed, he said, he promptly hopped to the gents’, tore the thing up, and flushed it.
This sounded sufficiently odd to the Florida Legislature that they threatened to impeach him, only backing down when he agreed to a psychiatric exam.
He convinced the doctor he was not, in fact, as nutty as a fruitcake.
These days, you wouldn’t be blamed for thinking psychiatric exams might be in order for some in Florida’s political and legal establishment.
Or, even better, a moral compass: Many of the judges appointed over the last seven or eight years seem to have misplaced theirs.
Florida has just acquired a new Supreme Court justice, appointed by the governor.
There is no suggestion, however, he’s mentally ill. As for a moral compass, well, that remains to be seen.
Justice Charles Canady recently vacated the bench to parachute into a sweet gig directing the University of Florida’s new Hamilton Center for Classical and Civic Education.
White males
There were six Federalist Society candidates on the governor’s shortlist, raring to take Canady’s place: all male, all white.
One hopeful used to work for Liberty Counsel, an outfit that advocates for laws adhering to “Christian and biblical” principles.
One was on the First District Court of Appeals, where he ruled to dilute Black voting power by abolishing a North Florida congressional district.
One had an unremarkable practice in civil litigation; another wasn’t known for having a significant impact on the legal profession, but did gain some notoriety with distinctly un-clever X quips accusing late night hosts Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel, and Jimmy Fallon of having “Low T” and snickering like a third-grader at a “gross” picture of President Joe Biden kissing his wife, to which he added a cartoon of skeletal elderly folks having sex.
This is what passes for “judicial temperament” in Ron DeSantis’ Florida.
And how about this fellow John Guard, formerly Florida’s chief deputy attorney general?
He defended the state against Planned Parenthood and other Jezebels who think women should have control over their own bodies.
Donald Trump had planned to nominate Guard for a federal judgeship, but put that on “indefinite” hold after Guard was subpoenaed in connection with the Hope Florida investigation.
In case you’ve forgotten, Hope Florida is a program spearheaded by Casey DeSantis to bypass Big Gubmint nonsense like healthcare for children, housing assistance, and SNAP benefits, hooking up the Deserving Poor with churches and charities.
In 2024, Hope Florida was mysteriously given a nice hunk of cash from the $67 million settlement in a Medicaid over-billing case.
It should all have been returned to the taxpayers, but somehow Hope Florida got $10 million off the top.
Gingrich acolyte
The money went to a couple of PACs working against the proposed constitutional amendment to legalize recreational marijuana.
One of the PACs was controlled by James Uthmeier, then the governor’s chief of staff, now Florida’s attorney general and former boss of John Guard.
To many in the Legislature, that looked like money laundering.
The House of Representatives investigated; now the whole mess has been given to a grand jury to see if anybody needs indicting.
You will not be surprised to hear, given the circumstances, DeSantis didn’t choose Guard for the state Supreme Court.
You might be surprised to hear Guard got a nice consolation prize: an appointment to the Florida Second District Court of Appeal.
Adam Tanenbaum, via Florida Supreme Court
But the winner of the Supreme Court stakes is Adam Tanenbaum, a very conservative judge with a very impressive resumé: top of his class at UF, former intern for Newt Gingrich, stellar student at Georgetown, law professor, lots of experience working in the Legislature, and, most recently, First DCA judge.
Tanenbaum joins a court comprising three Latino men, one Black woman, and two white women. Canady was the lone white fellow.
So, Tanenbaum adds what DeSantis no doubt thinks is appropriate “diversity” to the court.
As the president reminds us, white people, especially white men, white people, especially men, have been “very badly treated” in America.
But with the new justice, the court can be proud of its ethnic diversity.
Its ideological diversity, however, is pretty much non-existent.
Six of the seven justices are DeSantis picks.
Six of the seven can be relied upon to rule the way DeSantis would like.
Sole dissent
In 2025, the court upheld the state’s six-week abortion ban and gutted Florida’s Fair Districts amendment.
Never mind that 63% of Florida voters approved the 2010 ballot measure to stop partisan gerrymandering and protect minority voting rights.
This court blew it off: How dare ordinary citizens choose to enshrine fairness in the Florida Constitution? What do they know?
For that matter, what does the American Bar Association, the 147-year-old group of legal professionals dedicated to upholding ethics and standards and promoting equal justice, know?
The court has now dumped the ABA as the state’s exclusive law school accrediting body, saying, “The Court is persuaded that it is not in Floridians’ best interest for the ABA to be the sole gatekeeper deciding which law schools’ graduates are eligible to sit for the state’s General Bar Examination and become licensed attorneys in Florida.”
Ron DeSantis loathes the ABA, calling it “a very, very partisan activist organization” because it promotes racial and ethnic diversity in law schools.
(See discrimination against white men above).
This would be the same radical Democratic Party ABA apparatchiks who gave U.S. Supreme Court justices Brett Kavanaugh and Samuel Alito their highest rating of “Well Qualified.”
As of right now, there isn’t really an alternative to the ABA.
Perhaps the Association for Biblical Higher Education can step up until the Federalist Society can create its own Law School Inquisition.
Who needs an independent judiciary? So 20th century.
The (sort of) good news is retrograde decisions weren’t unanimous: one justice, Jorge Labarga, appointed by Gov. Charlie Crist, cast a dissenting vote in each case.
Channeling slaveholders
The bad news is Labarga only has another 18 months on the bench: When he turns 75 in 2027, he’ll have to retire.
Tanenbaum’s record indicates he’s unlikely to join the court’s last moderate in voting against the majority.
When he was an appeals court judge, he ruled in favor of eliminating minority-access voting districts and penalizing school districts for enforcing mask mandates during the COVID pandemic.
He’s an out-and-proud “originalist,” one of those people who confuse the United States Constitution with holy writ — a trait he shares with six members of the U.S. Supreme Court — a sacred text that can only mean what it meant in 1789, law as set in stone as the Code of Hammurabi.
In 1789, women couldn’t vote and almost all Black people resident in the 13 states were enslaved.
Indeed, 25 of 55 Framers were slaveholders.
Unless these 18th century landed gentlemen had the prophetic talents of Nostradamus, a magic mirror, and time travel technology, they could have no idea what America would be like in the 21st century.
Yet the likes of Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Adam Tanenbaum insist they hold the key to what the Framers intended and/or what everyone understood to the Constitution to mean at the time.
Originalism is, as the prominent legal scholar Eric Segall says, “dangerous nonsense.”
It’s intellectually dishonest, too: Surely, “well-regulated militia” in 1789 meant a trained group of citizens who could protect the community against some tyrannical force, not (as the conservative court would have us believe) a nation of armed individuals empowered to shoot anyone who “threatens” them.
Stare decisis
As for stare decisis, the principle that courts should give a certain deference to precedents, it’s not popular with Federalist Society types.
Justice Tanenbaum has dismissed stare decisis as an excuse for what he sees as incorrectly decided cases.
Many of those supposedly bad decisions constitute “legislating from the bench,” which is nothing more than “judicial activism.”
(The overturning of Roe v. Wade and giving the president unlimited immunity — that’s not “judicial activism;” it’s just the intuited wisdom of 237 years ago).
The language of the Constitution should be paramount. If the judge will simply do what it says, no one can say they’re legislating from the bench.
Tanenbaum has written: “elevating the text of the Constitution over prior erroneous judicial reasoning could not fairly be labeled as ‘judicial activism.’”
You might want to ask how he’s so sure he knows what reasoning is “erroneous.”
You might also wonder if this is merely a convenient way to dismiss previously settled law because it offends the judge’s politics.
The United States Supreme Court will soon issue a decision on the 1965 Voting Rights Act, the core of civil rights in our democracy. Chances are better than even they’ll eviscerate it.
Ron DeSantis is counting on it. That’s why he’s demanding a special session in April.
He wants the Legislature to draw new congressional maps — maps to finally finish off most districts that might elect a Black or Latino or, God forbid, Democratic representative.
If the new map gets through the Legislature, it will undoubtedly end up before the Florida Supreme Court — and the governor’s hand-picked justices are waiting.
We’ll soon find out how sane and how moral they are.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_009825873-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-26 00:56:59.235826

FRANKFORT — Brittany Herrington missed her son’s first time catching the flu, his first time riding a bike, his bout with chickenpox and the way his toddler “fat face” came in because she was incarcerated. 
Herrington had asked to be court-ordered to a residential treatment program but was denied. Outpatient treatment, too difficult to reach from her rural Kentucky home, was not fully effective for her. 
Without that rigorous, inpatient care that she sought, Herrington didn’t know how to get sober, which she desperately wanted so she could show up for her child. 
The Eastern Kentucky woman, now 41 and a mom of two, finally got access to effective treatment, but said “it came years too late.” 
Once in a residential program, she wrote little Gavin letters — “Mommy loves you more than pepperoni pizza,” one said — and drew small pictures to mail him. 
“He knew that I was fun and I loved him enough to draw pictures, and I wasn’t a stranger,” she said. “I was really scared he’d forget me.” 
Herrington is now advocating for a bill introduced by Kentucky lawmakers this week and backed by a slew of advocacy organizations that could change the incarceration landscape for Kentucky parents by considering alternatives to detention. 
The Family Preservation Act 
Rep. Nick Wilson, R-Williamsburg, said his goal is keeping more families together, teaching parents how to parent and reducing child trauma through the state. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd)
Filed as House Bill 464, the Family Preservation and Accountability Act would allow judges to consider an alternative sentence for parents charged with low-level, nonviolent crimes to keep families together. Violent crimes, including child abuse, are banned for consideration. Alternatives to detention as outlined in the bill may include parenting classes, substance use treatment, family counseling and more. It has not yet been assigned to a committee. 
Rep. Nick Wilson, R-Williamsburg, the bill’s sponsor, said his goal is keeping more families together, teaching parents how to parent and reducing child trauma through the state. 










Kentucky kids should not serve their parents’ sentences


– Amber Duke, the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky


Having a parent incarcerated is an adverse childhood experience that can negatively impact a person’s life over the long term. About 12% of Kentucky children have or previously had a parent incarcerated, according to the American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky. That’s about 150,000 children across 120 counties. 
“I’m a kid of the ’90s, and I remember in Little League baseball, and around that age, basically everybody who got a backache was getting prescribed an OxyContin,” Wilson said. “I think we are still seeing the detrimental effects of what happened for that 10, 15, 20-year period of time.” 
One of those key impacts, Wilson said, “has been the deterioration of the family union.”  
Sen. Julie Raque Adams, R-Louisville. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd)
Even though overdose deaths have declined over the last three years, Kentucky still has one of the highest rates of opioid use disorder in the United States, costing the state about $95 billion, with an average cost per case of $709,441 across all systems, the Lantern has reported. 
Sen. Julie Raque Adams, R-Louisville, plans to file the bill in the Senate. She said Wilson’s measure is “practical, responsible and important.” 
“These situations (low-level, nonviolent crimes) still demand accountability, but they also allow parents to remain connected to their children when it is safe to do so,” she said. “This approach is fiscally responsible. It costs so much less than incarceration. It reduces repeat offenses, and, most importantly, it produces better outcomes for our kids.” 
Amber Duke, the executive director of the ACLU of Kentucky. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd)
Kentucky incarcerates women at one of the highest rates in the world, according to the ACLU, and the state reports the second highest rate in the nation for children who have parents behind bars. 
Amber Duke, the executive director of the ACLU of Kentucky, said this is hurting family stability. 
“Kentucky kids should not serve their parents’ sentences,” Duke said. “Accountability is something that is important. Accountability is not something that should destroy families. It should not come at the expense of our children’s well being, and kids should not be punished for their parents’ mistakes.” 
Wilson said he believes there is substantial legislative support for this bill: “I think everyone’s in favor of this bill,” he said.  
“This bill does not excuse wrongdoing. It does not weaken public safety, and in fact, it improves it,” Raque Adams said. “We know that stable families are one of the strongest foundations for a healthy society.” 
‘I did the best I could’

Herrington, of Argillite, developed an addiction to OxyContin as a teenager. 
“During my years in high school … that’s what you did. You went and you did Lortabs together,” she told the Lantern. “The cheerleaders, the band kids, the average Joes. We all just got high. In high school it was Lortabs, Xanaxes and Valium, but it quickly moved to OxyContin.” 
Gavin was 2 years old when she had her first felony arrest in 2009 for drug possession, wanton endangerment, receiving stolen property and other related charges. 
Herrington said she asked the judge to send her to residential treatment. She knew she couldn’t afford rehabilitation on her own. 
Instead, the judge sent her to an outpatient program 25 miles from her home. With only one car between her, her husband, her parents and brother, getting to treatment four days a week was “an impossible task.” 
“I was court ordered to a treatment center I couldn’t really even get to,” she said. “I did the best I could for as long as I could, to make it there four days a week, and I just couldn’t.” 
She only lasted a few months.

In March 2010, a failed drug test sent her back to jail. She asked for rehab again, she said. She was denied and spent the next nine months — out of a three-year sentence — incarcerated. 
During that time, she saw her son once. During his visit, she borrowed clothes from a fellow inmate so she could be in “street clothes” to see him. 
“He was just different,” she recalled. “His face was different, his body. I picked him up, and he weighed, like, a million pounds. He was a different kid. He was in a different growth stage.” 
She thinks he only changed in weight 12-15 pounds, but his “fat face” had come in, and he looked different. She’d missed a lot, she realized.  
“You feel like an a**hole,” she said. “You can’t function because you feel worthless. You feel not worthy of anything. You’ve left your son. Your choices have separated you, you just feel like a crappy, crappy human. The worst. You just feel despicable, like, who does that?” 
But, for so long, addiction controlled her, she said. 
“I hated getting high,” she recalled. “Oh, I hated it.” She hated the sickness that came after, the feeling of no control. 
Herrington was paroled that December and went to the Women’s Addiction Recovery Manor, an inpatient recovery center in Henderson. There, she took parenting classes and started a journey of long-term recovery and advocacy. The experience was “overwhelming,” though. 
“Anytime I talked about leaving, I was scared to death,” she said. “Like, ‘oh my God. I was so serious about staying sober before, and I didn’t do it … What if I can’t?’” 
But, she said, while there: “Every day, I got to watch women get their kids back.” 
Before long, she and her husband, John, and Gavin were settling in together under the same roof. She could be an active parent, and “we were family again.” 
She is still sober 14 years later and an active advocate for women going through experiences similar to the one she survived. 
After jail, finding her own Healing Place
Jessica Ashby, 41, was prescribed Oxycodone after the birth of her daughter, a treatment for standard pain that “unleashed a monster” of addiction in her life.

“When I took home that prescription, I didn’t know that they were highly addictive,” Ashby said. “I thought it was going to be OK. It was from my doctor. Why would he give me something that is going to turn around and make me sick later?” 
She spent three years “doing anything and everything I could to support that habit,” she told the Lantern. She was arrested on a theft charge in 2014 and spent 17 months in and out of jail. 
She said she lacked access to treatment and resources that could have helped her begin to get sober. She lost her job and custody of her daughter. 
“I just couldn’t get clean,” she said. “Most people don’t really commit felonies unless there’s … an underlying issue.” She wanted help, though, and finally got it. 
In 2019, Ashby drove herself to The Healing Place in Louisville, where she still attends — and teaches — classes. 
“I finally started to feel like I was in a community. I was in a community with people like me,” she said. “They help people write resumes. They did all of those things that were critical in early sobriety.” 
She’s been sober about seven years thanks to The Healing Place, support she received from her 12-step program and other organizations geared toward early stages of sobriety. She graduated with a bachelor’s degree in December and has begun work toward a master’s degree. 
Ashby just bought her first house in Louisville.
If something like the Family Preservation and Accountability Act that Wilson is proposing had been in place when she was first arrested, Ashby believes she and her daughter “would still be together.” 
“I completely understand that … people like me, if we had committed the crime, I understand that we still have to be punished,” she said. “I understand that wholeheartedly, but our kids are the one that’s being punished, so we have to find a way to deal with the crime while addressing whatever’s going on in that parent’s life. And I think that this bill does that.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-26 05:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,The Gen Z gender divide in politics,Rosemary Bonadies,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/26/the-gen-z-gender-divide-in-politics/,"I fear as Gen Z becomes older, there will be less social cohesion and greater risks to democratic consensus.","In recent years, young men and women in Generation Z have moved in opposite political directions, producing a gender gap unlike any other generation before. Young men have increasingly leaned towards the conservative, Republican party while women have moved towards the liberal, Democratic party. While gender gaps are a feature in every generation, none have been as stark as Gen Z. 
Who is the main driver? Women. They are now the force pushing Gen Z towards the left politically and socially, and becoming increasingly more civically active compared to any other generation. There are divides not just about how they feel about political candidates, but cultural issues which could deeply affect America.



Generation Z, which I am a part of, is the cohort born between 1997 and 2012. My generation has been shaped by rapid technology growth, social media, witnessing financial crises, wars, and climate change. 
Contrary to the conventional wisdom that young voters support progressive candidates and policies, in the most recent presidential election, men between the ages of 18 and 29 showed immense support for the Republican candidate, Donald Trump. However, women have become a cohesive force for the Democratic party, with about 65 percent voting for Biden in 2020 and Harris in 2024. 
This gender divide is complex, rooted in differences in politics and social issues. In terms of politics, only 26 percent of Gen Z women approve of the job that Donald Trump is doing in office compared to 47 percent of Gen Z men. On the question of abortion, 76 percent of women believe that abortion should be legal, whereas 59 percent of men believe it should be legal.

Women’s activism is now amplified by the fact that we make up around sixty percent of college students, contributing to the trend that higher educated individuals tend to be liberal. With greater access to higher education and economic opportunity, women are now more empowered to play a larger role in political activism and voting, while men have fallen behind women in civic engagement. 
Alongside this increase in engagement, there is the fact that women’s rights are being increasingly threatened under the Trump administration. After movements like #MeToo and the fall of Roe v. Wade, many women feel a sense of urgency and personal investment, whereas Gen Z men don’t have the same sentiment. Moreover, this reflects both differences in priorities and experiences. 
Many men feel that their rights and lifestyle are being infringed upon so they seek validation from communities online. The feeling of losing influence in many aspects of society has led them to turn to misogynistic social media influencers like Charlie Kirk, Andrew Tate, or Adin Ross who have created a mass following. They have become pillars of hypermasculinity and misogyny by promoting hate and violence against women. 
Additionally, these influencers have become prominent recruiters for the right wing Republican party by framing politicians like Trump as an empowering figure who will restore male power. With social media algorithms and echo chambers, podcasters, YouTubers and other online influencers, can easily engage young men and boys – some as young as middle school – to promote conservatism rooted in male dominance, and a community of men who have common ground.
Algorithms turn everyday interests like fitness, relationships, and gaming into gateways to the manosphere. They thrive on male loneliness and insecurity about themselves and the world around them and move the blame to women.
These political shifts also go beyond just political candidates, they have put a strain on romantic and platonic relationships, as women and men are no longer spending time together, rather they are spending time in their separate echo chambers – creating their own sense of reality on social media. As young men are holding onto the belief in more traditional gender roles and family structures, Gen Z women are valuing independence, their careers, and progressive reform.
As a member of Gen Z, I have experienced this divide. I and many other women my age have become concerned with issues like abortion, the environment, gun laws, and equality while many of our male counterparts don’t feel the same or prioritize other issues. 
Why is this important? Who does it affect? It is important because this signals deepening polarization that has shown to put a strain on relationships. As Gen Z becomes older, there will be less social cohesion and greater risks to democratic consensus. With the effects of social media algorithms and echo chambers, there will be irreversible polarization and instability. 
Polarization has effects on housing, jobs, welfare, social relationships, mental health, and families.
What can we do? In short, educate. 
As Gen Z, we can develop our media literacy and learn to combat misinformation. Introduce media literacy in school curriculum; parents can educate their children on media influence – young boys about misogynistic language and media, and young girls about self confidence. We can foster better empathy and understanding for personal gender struggles including women’s underrepresentation and hardships and men’s mental health struggles. Men with large platforms must promote equality, emotional intelligence, and mental health resources. We can focus on common struggles that we have experienced like economic opportunities, housing, and anxieties about the future.
Understanding the causes and consequences of this political and social split helps us navigate the lasting effects of social media, misinformation, the need for education, and relationships. Ultimately, Gen Z’s historic gender divide is not a myth, but a tangible reality shown in activism, ideologies, and voting across the country. 
As a generation, we can work towards a better cohesive force that focuses on growth and positive change.

Wes Moore and U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy jump-started talk of public-private funding to replace the American Legion Bridge, federal officials were already moving in that direction.","Gov. Wes Moore (D) said he and federal officials agree on the importance of moving forward with the rebuild of the Francis Scott Key Bridge as well as a potential new American Legion Bridge. (Photo Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Even before this month’s meeting between Gov. Wes Moore and U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy jump-started talk of public-private funding to replace the American Legion Bridge, federal officials were already moving in that direction.
In a Federal Register post Dec. 11, the Federal Highway Administration solicited “public input and proposals on innovative project delivery methods to ensure cost-effective and efficient reconstruction of the American Legion Memorial Bridge.” The post noted that the state cannot fund the project on its own, before noting that a public-private partnership (P3) could do the trick.
Just over a month later, Moore and Duffy announced they had agreed on “the need to speed up the reconstruction and leverage innovative approaches like a public private partnership (P3) that will ensure Maryland, Virginia, and D.C. commuters can soon experience some much needed traffic relief from the most congested corridor in America.”
It was a change of course for Moore who inherited the framework of a P3 deal from his predecessor, Gov. Larry Hogan (R), for the American Legion Bridge and additional toll lanes on the Capital Beltway. But the state and Transurban, the company behind the proposed P3, were not able to finalize the deal, and P3 funding fell by the wayside.
In a meeting with reporters Jan. 16, Moore said he was never “against P3s. I’m against dumb P3s.”
“And I think we had dumb P3s that were put in place before,” Moore said. “I’m for P3s. Yes, there is going to be private-sector involvement, but the entire upside can’t be on the private sector while the public sector gets hooked.
State reopens door to private funding for American Legion Bridge reconstruction

“And so, we’re just going to make sure that we’re thinking smartly about ways we’re going to apply the P3 into this. But I do think that P3s are necessary and required for a lot of the major projects that we want to get done in Maryland,” he said.
The meeting with Duffy also touched on replacement of the Francis Scott Key Bridge.
In the days after the bridge was struck by a loaded container ship and collapsed into the Patapsco River in March 2024, then-President Joe Biden pledged that the federal government would fund 100% of its replacement. Congress put that pledge into law in late 2024, a legal promise that Maryland lawmakers have repeatedly cited when President Donald Trump makes threats about federal funding for the project.
But in the days after the collapse, state officials also said it would cost just under $2 billion for the bridge replacement, which could be done as early as 2028. The latest estimates say the project could cost up to $5.2 billion and take until 2030, opening the door to new criticism from the Trump administration.
Duffy and Trump have also been critical of the use of contractors based on race or sex. Moore this month dismissed those complaints, saying increases in the estimated cost of the bridge replacement had nothing to do with choice of contractors and everything to do with required changes to the bridge design for safety reason, additional materials to go with those changes and higher costs of those materials as a result of tariffs and inflation.
State officials have long said that they will put any money they win in lawsuits against the owners of the Dali, the ship that struck the bridge, toward the bottom line on the project. In the joint statement after their meeting, Moore and Duffy said they “made significant progress on cost sharing … to ensure fairness” on the Key Bridge.
But that wording left some, like Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) confused.
Ferguson called the joint announcement “very promising” and said he was “looking forward to hearing the details” of the meeting. But he seemed surprised when asked about the possibility of “cost sharing” mentioned in the Moore-Duffy statement.
“I have to look more into that,” Ferguson said. “My understanding is that cost sharing is not a component of it. It’s 100% covered. So, I have to get back to you on that.”

“The good news is that the repaying, or the payment for the rebuild of the Francis Scott Key Bridge is in federal law. It’s in statute,” Ferguson said. “It is not through executive order or regulation that can be waived by the stroke of a pen and would require an act of Congress to restrict that funding.
“Should we be wary? I think we have to be. I think every assumption of what we thought or we could assume about the relationship between the state and the federal government is now up for question.”
Moore did not elaborate on the discussions regarding federal funding for the Key Bridge replacement.
“I think our teams are working very closely, and we are ensuring that in this time, we are going to be able to do something that’s not just going to make the people of the state of Maryland proud, but we’re going to do something to make the people this country proud,” Moore told reporters a day after meeting with Duffy.
It’s also not clear how the American Legion Bridge Project will progress. It is also unclear what role, if any, the Virginia Department of Transportation will have in a new American Legion Bridge.
Moore, in statements following the meeting with Duffy, described the American Legion Bridge project as “stalled.”
“We want to get this done quickly. And the thing that we both acknowledge is that when I first came on board, what we inherited were just stalled projects. Right?” Moore said. “The Purple Line was a stalled project, the ALB [American Legion Bridge] was a stalled project. And I told the secretary, and I think, you know, he agreed, we’re going to work together, because I refuse to hand off stalled projects to my successors.”
Doug Mayer, a spokesperson for Hogan, rejected Moore’s characterization of the American Legion Bridge project as stalled when he came into office. Mayer said Moore is “not misrepresenting the truth. He’s lying.”
Hogan had announced a plan to widen the bridge along with Maryland sections of Interstate 495 before Moore took office under a P3 agreement with a consortium led by Australia-based Transurban. The Transurban-led consortium was to expand the bridge and highway using managed toll lanes.
Mayer said the Hogan administration left the project “on the 99-yard line.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“He inherited a project that the former administration had spent years fighting for and had finally gotten to a place where all it needed was to go in front of the Board of Public Works,” Mayer said. “He (Moore) said he was going to pause it and get more feedback and for silly things like equity and the rest of that nonsense. What’s been going on for the last three years?”
Critics at the time complained that the proposal would benefit wealthy motorists and harm the environment. The project was similar to one Transurban constructed in Virginia.
Moore, responding to a question from a reporter, called the project a shared interest of both states and one that both states should share responsibility.
“I think for a lot of things that were done before, there was not a mutually shared both interest, ambition or incentive to be able to get the work done,” Moore said. “I will be working very closely with our friends in the Commonwealth of Virginia to make sure that the p3 that is done, that Maryland actually has a proper seat at the table when we’re looking at what those proper and those final dynamics look like.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/260116MoorePC-1024x681.jpeg,,,2026-01-26 07:57:44.827014

(Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)The lone candidate — so far — for state comptroller is amassing a sizable war chest.
Comptroller Brooke Lierman is finishing out her first term as the state’s top tax collector. Her campaign announced this week that she raised nearly $3 million in the current cycle. She has $2.2 million in cash on hand.
“Every donation represents someone who believes we can work together to make Maryland more equitable, more resilient and more prosperous for all,” Lierman said in a statement announcing her campaign haul. “That faith helps motivate me to give my absolute best as our Comptroller and on the campaign trail every single day.”
Moore’s new federal lobbyist 
Alexis Covey-Brandt has taken over as the state’s new federal lobbyist.
Covey-Brandt took over Tuesday after Matt Verghese abruptly left his position.
“Over the past three years, Matt Verghese has played a pivotal role leading our state’s federal engagements during a volatile political climate in Washington,” the governor’s office said in a statement sent in reply to a reporter’s inquiry. “The Governor’s Office is grateful for Matt’s service in the Administration, and we wish him well as he transitions from his role.”
Verghese’s departure was effective immediately.
Covey-Brandt served as chief of staff to Rep. Steny Hoyer, a position she held for more than a decade. She left the post to become a senior adviser to Moore in June 2023.
Another race, another Democrat
After being passed over when the Democratic central committees in a three-county area chose Kevin Harris to fill the vacant District 27 Senate seat in November, Jason Fowler has decided to take his case to the voters.
Fowler filed the paperwork Friday to run for the Senate seat that includes parts of Charles, Calvert and Prince George’s counties.
Fowler, 37, who ran unsuccessfully for the District 27C House seat in Calvert County in 2018, said he “just can’t sit on the sidelines” as his district and the state experience “an affordability crisis.”
District 27 candidate Jason Fowler
“Too many people have been priced out of our state. We’re a high-taxed state with some of the most expensive housing, energy costs, grocery prices in the country,” Fowler, an attorney from Calvert County, said in a recent interview. “One of the main problems that we see in Annapolis, there is not vigorous debate over policy. It’s people just voting on bills without either reading them or thinking about the long-term effects of these policies.”
Fowler would have to unseat Harris, who was chosen overwhelmingly by the  Democratic central committees in the three counties represented by District 27, and later appointed by Gov. Wes Moore (D). Harris replaced Democrat Michael Jackson, a former Prince George’s County sheriff who left the Senate on Nov. 11 to become the Maryland State Police superintendent.
Fowler and Del. Jeffrie Long Jr. (D-Prince George’s and Calvert) were the two other candidates who sought the appointment to replace Jackson.
Trone staffs up
Turns out David Trone doesn’t just want his old job back — he wants his old staff back, too.
Trone, the former 6th District representative who lost his seat in an unsuccessful, and costly, bid for U.S. Senate in 2024, announced in December that he is running for his old job in the House. To do so, he will have to unseat Rep. April McClain Delaney (D-6th), who has no intention of giving up the seat, in a Democratic primary.
Trone last week announced a campaign staff that is heavy with staff from his time on Capitol Hill, including three who are coming over from McClain Delaney’s office.
Campaign manager Sonny Holding was McClain Delaney’s chief of staff, had been Trone’s deputy chief of staff and was district director to former Rep. John Delaney — McClain Delaney’s husband, who held the seat before Trone. Former Trone director of outreach Sarah Dreyer, who served until last month as McClain Delaney’s district director, will be deputy campaign manager. Sasha Galbreath, a former communications director for Trone who served in that role for McClain Delaney until October, will be senior strategic adviser to the campaign.
Trone also said that his former director of operations, Tyler Jessee, will come over from Rep. Johnny Olszewski’s (D-2nd) office to be another deputy campaign manager and Nathaniel McCarthy, who “worked for Congressman Trone since 2017 in various roles,” will be communications director and chief of staff.
Trone has already turned the race into a referendum on Trump and is already peppering the airwaves with ads touting his two impeachment votes against Trump in the president’s first term. McClain Delaney has responded with a video saying she has regularly taken on Trump over policies that harm the district and touting endorsements from virtually every top Democrat in the state.
It is also likely to be an expensive race: Trone, the millionaire owner of Total Wine & More, loaned himself almost $63 million for his unsuccessful Senate bid against Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.) and has already loaned $5 million to his latest campaign, according to a year-end report with the Federal Election Commission. McClain Delaney’s year-end report has not been posted yet by the FEC.

Wes Moore (D) meets at the state's Emergency Operations Center Sunday with Maryland National Guard troops called up for the weekend's snowstorm. (Photo by Joe Andrucyk/Governor's office)Maryland was one of 10 states declared disaster areas by President Donald Trump over the weekend as a result of the winter storm that stretched from the Southwest to the Northeast.
The declaration means that assistance is available from the Federal Emergency Management Agency as the state responds to the storm, with impacts beginning Saturday .”Specifically, FEMA is authorized to identify, mobilize and provide, at its discretion, equipment and resources necessary to alleviate the impacts of the emergency,” the agency said in a statement announcing the declaration.
It comes a day after Gov. Wes Moore (D) declared a state of emergency in Maryland and asked for federal assistance responding to the storm that dumped anywhere from 6 inches to a foot of snow and ice on the state, beginning Saturday and continuing through most of the day Sunday.
State offices were closed Monday as crews continued to dig roads out from under the snow, and schools across the state were closed Monday with several already announcing Tuesday closures. Federal offices were closed and most workers granted leave Monday, but emergency workers were expected to report and telework and remote employees were expected to work their regular hours.
The General Assembly canceled House and Senate sessions Monday, but said that previously scheduled committee hearings could continue virtually.
Other states to get a disaster declaration in response to the winter storm were Virginia, West Virginia, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee.

I am despondent about the cold and snow that have locked me into my home for a long weekend. No, I’m not writing about the presence of armed federal forces on the streets of U.S. cities turning their vast firepower on protesters protecting their neighbors.
And yet, I know that as much as the cold and snow trouble me, they will pass.
I know that warmer weather will come and the snow and cold and ice will melt. Please understand I am not using any metaphor here. I am not writing about our current administration in Washington, D.C., or outrage toward American immigration enforcement policies.
I’m writing about the weather caused by a nationwide storm, one that meteorologists call unprecedented.
And the weather will change.
It can be tempting over a long weekend like this — with days of subfreezing temperatures behind you and days of subfreezing temperatures ahead — to believe otherwise. We suspect the chill will never retreat. Our fingers will always stiffen in the biting cold air outside. We will remain inside our homes wrapped in blankets and avoiding slippery roads. The world will spin as a we remain locked inside.
I’m definitely not saying that this works as a metaphor for our current political situation, when authoritarians in waiting stalk the hallways of the White House. I’m not saying it applies to vile lies spread about people including Renee Good and Alex Pretti by officials who yearn to crush political dissent and silence opposing voices.
I’m not saying either of those things. I’m dealing with the weather, and the irrational fear that bad weather will never change.
Even in the coldest temperatures, that’s not true.
The sun will come. It will shine. The snow will melt in into water and flow into drains and make its way to the river. The ice will retreat and disappear in water vapor that floats up into the atmosphere to create clouds. 
No season lasts forever. Spring will come and the air will warm and the flowers bloom and the wheel turn. The rains will come and nourish green grass and trees, and world around us will flourish once again. No one who bets on winter lasting forever will win his or her wager. 
Change always prevails.
I write this knowing that words have limits. Thoughts from one opinion editor in Kansas can only do so much, even in this interconnected age. My fulminations and broadsides — against the weather of course, not anything else going on right now — might shift attitudes a percentage point or two. At most.
On the other hand, concrete actions help. Hardy souls can plow the roads and shovel sidewalks, check on elderly friends and family, help dig cars out of snow drifts. That helps. That clears the way for the next season, whenever it inevitably arrives.
If we learn anything from the weekend, let it be this.
Change will come. Seasons will shift. Warmness will replace the chill. But we can also learn from the repetition. We can prepare ourselves for the inevitable changes. Knowing now how much cold, how much ice, how much snow can warp an entire region, we can be on watch in years to come.
For so long, many of us suggested that it can’t happen here. I refer to winter weather. Now we know better. Now we can pass that knowledge to the generations who follow.

,Mississippi Today,2026-01-25 23:54:52+00:00,Mississippi Today,Two Mississippi prisons temporarily lose power amid freezing temps from winter storm,"Leonardo Bevilacqua, Jerry Mitchell and Michael Goldberg",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/25/two-mississippi-prisons-lose-power-winter-storm/,The winter storm that pushed through the state Saturday and Sunday temporarily knocked out power at the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman and Delta Correctional Facility in Greenwood.,"The winter storm that pushed through the state Saturday and Sunday temporarily knocked out power at the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman and Delta Correctional Facility in Greenwood, even as temperatures plunged below freezing.
This photo taken by an inmate in Unit 29 of the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman shows a fire set by another inmate down the hall from his cell at around 3 a.m. on Sunday, January 25, 2026.
“At Parchman, we had a limb fall on a line,” Corrections Commissioner Burl Cain told Mississippi Today on Sunday afternoon. “The power is coming back on.”
Entergy workers spent about three hours fixing the problem, he said.
Parchman is in rural Sunflower County near Tutwiler and has about 1,900 inmates. Delta Correctional is in Greenwood and houses about 300 women. Both are in areas that received snow and ice.
Generators were supplying power Sunday at Delta Correctional, Cain said. “The only place we’ve had a problem is at Parchman.”
“I just had a mama tell me that the inmates were banging on the wall all night, that they were cold and hungry,” Cain said. “All that’s bullshit.”
Inmates had sack lunches Sunday, Cain said, “and we should be able to cook supper. We have water and everything.”
House Corrections Committee Chairwoman Becky Currie said Sunday that she asked prison officials if they had checked generators at Parchman before the ice storm.
“They said no,” Currie said. “I’m raising hell, but it is an emergency. This is another major mistake for the Department of Corrections.”
Currie told Mississippi Today that she spoke to a staff member at Delta Correctional on Sunday afternoon who told her the generator was working but was only keeping some lights on. It was not sufficiently heating the building, the staff member told her.
“I can’t imagine being in a tin can with no heat,” Currie said. “We all plan for storms in Mississippi. That’s why there is not a loaf of bread on the shelf (in the grocery store). They are responsible for thousands of lives. There are hospice patients, dialysis patients. And they can’t make sure the generators are going to work in time of need?”
Temperatures at Parchman fell to 19 degrees Sunday.


An inmate in Parchman’s Unit 29, who asked not to be named for fear of retribution, said he awoke at 1 a.m. Sunday to the lights flickering on and off. He said that at 3 a.m., a fire was set down the hall from his cell. He said inmates were trying to get the attention of correctional officers after the power went out, and the temperature inside the block got “too damn cold.”
The only light visible was coming through the windows, he said. “The officers aren’t doing anything, they’re not checking to see if inmates are cold or anything.”
This photo taken by an inmate at the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman shows the view out a window on Sunday, Jan. 25, 2026.
Inmates were hollering for warmer clothes after the temperature dropped, he said. A warden later announced to inmates that “nothing could be done,” he said.
Mississippi Today was able to review photos of both the inmate’s icy window and the fire that was set in his block. Dark cells and hallways can be seen in an additional photograph obtained. Parchman’s fields are blanketed with white snow in another.
At around noon Sunday, the inmate said he was given a cold breakfast. It’s unclear, he said, when the next meal could be served. Security checks that usually happen every half hour had ceased since early Sunday morning, he added. Besides breakfast at noon and a nurse making a medication drop at a nearby cell, he said no guard or other person had come by his cell Sunday.
Stephen C. McCraney, director of the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency, said Sunday he received a phone call about three to four days ago that three generators at the Delta Correctional Facility were “iffy.” He said he sent three extra generators to the prison.
Parchman is a new problem, he said. When power went out there, it became a priority, he said.
 “Sometimes things break in the middle of the night. Those customers within those facilities, they can’t go home for the weekend, they can’t go to the neighbor’s house and we realize that,” McCraney said of the prisoners in Parchman and Delta Correctional.
Mississippi Today obtained text messages from a Parchman guard, who wrote: “Most of their stuff doesn’t work. What does work is rigged up. They don’t have a maintenance team that actually knows what they are doing.
“And our heaters work well,” the guard wrote. “They just aren’t turned all the way up because we don’t want to burn them up and then be without them all together. They are set at 65 or 68 I can’t remember. So inmates probably still want a blanket to keep comfortable but they definitely are not freezing.”
At a Sunday news conference, Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves said he was “aware” of the prison problems. “I’m confident that we will get that back online via a generator if not already, then very soon,” Reeves said.
Facebook entries by people concerned about prison conditions alleged that Parchman inmates were suffering without heat or food. 
When someone made a joke on Facebook about inmates freezing to death, Drea LaSha responded that they are “still human beings that breathe the same air we do. They are not dead but will be in such conditions and you joke about it … Could be you.”
Terell Harris added, “These are humans and not animals, and let’s be honest, the animals get protected in these conditions. Everyone in prison don’t deserve to be there, and some are actually innocent. Either way, these are humans, and we all have family that has been to prison.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/06073847/Parchman-front-gate.jpg,,,2026-01-25 18:56:39.627178

(Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)The assault of a Florida congressman at a Sundance party is being investigated as a possible hate crime after police say a man sneaked in, made racially charged remarks, and punched the lawmaker in the face.
Rep. Maxwell Frost, D-Fla., said in a social media post that the man who assaulted him late Friday “told me that Trump was going to deport me before he punched me in the face. He was heard screaming racist remarks as he drunkenly ran off.” 
In a statement, the Sundance Film Festival condemned the assault and said it abhors “any form of violence, harassment, and hate speech.”
“The safety and security of our festival attendees is always our chief concern, and our thoughts are with Congressman Frost and his continued well-being. We encourage anyone with additional information on this matter to contact the Park City Police Department,” the statement said.
According to a police affidavit, Christian Joel Young, 28, had approached Frost and a friend at a private party at High West Distillery in Park City, Utah, and began “making weird conversations and comments referring to their race.” When they went to step away, the affidavit says, Young put his arms around their necks like he was hugging them and pulled them in close, saying “we are going to deport you and your kind.”

Shocked, the two pushed Young away, who then yelled a racial slur and punched Frost in the face before running into the crowd, the affidavit says.
The affidavit says Young then approached a woman and her friend by the bar, but when the two stopped engaging with him as the conversation became “inappropriate and racially charged,” Young grabbed her shoulder, pushed her against the bar and yelled “You are the kind we are going to deport. You’re being deported.”
A man who witnessed the encounter caught Young and held him until event security arrived. Security members told police Young had been denied entry to the bar, then was seen jumping a fence set up for the private event. When security approached, he jumped back out and ran away. Security members didn’t know how he sneaked back in. 
Police who questioned Young said he told them he didn’t remember what happened and that he didn’t know his name, but when officers called him by his name he responded, “indicating his answers were intentionally evasive and not due to impairment,” according to the affidavit. Staff at the bar told police Young had ordered only two drinks before they stopped serving him due to erratic behavior.
Police also confiscated a Sundance Film Festival administrative access pass in someone else’s name from Young.
Young was booked into Summit County Jail under investigation of assaulting a government official and assault of the woman at the party, with both “racially charged” incidents being screened for a hate crime enhancement, according to the affidavit. Young is also being investigated for aggravated burglary for allegedly entering the bar unlawfully.
An attorney for Young was not listed. He is being held without an option to post bail.

(Photo by Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)A crowd of over a thousand demonstrators gathered at the Colorado Capitol and marched through downtown Denver on Sunday to protest the Trump administration after another fatal shooting by federal immigration agents in Minnesota.
“Again we gather to express our outrage over a lawless regime terrorizing communities,” activist Darlene Rivera told protesters from the Capitol steps. “It is clear that this regime is waging war against the people that do not agree with their racist policies and actions.”
The demonstration came one day after Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse, was shot and killed by Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis, just two weeks after the fatal shooting of Renee Good by Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agents. The two killings have sparked nationwide outrage, even as President Donald Trump’s top advisers have rushed to spread false information about Pretti and Good, both of whom were smeared as “domestic terrorists” by the administration within hours of being killed.

Multiple videos that surfaced Saturday showed federal agents opening fire on Pretti while he was restrained and on the ground. Pretti was lawfully carrying a handgun, which had already been secured by agents before the shots were fired. While Trump officials baselessly called him a “would-be assassin” who intended to harm immigration agents, videos show the encounter began with Pretti filming the agents with his cell phone.
“Renee Good and Alex Pretti were murdered in broad daylight while being filmed by numerous people,” Rivera told the crowd. “The videos we have all seen make it clear that Renee and Alex were murdered.”
Joining protesters on the Capitol grounds were a handful of Colorado Democratic elected officials, including state Sen. Jessie Danielson of Wheat Ridge and Attorney General Phil Weiser, who is a 2026 candidate for governor.

Carol Wiemann, a demonstrator from Boulder, stood on a street corner west of the Capitol and waved an American flag at passing cars, many of which offered supportive honks throughout the protest.
“Tears. Tears,” she said of her reaction to hearing of Pretti’s death. “I’ve had enough. This is the fourth or fifth time I’ve been down here. Trump is evil — he’s evil, and we’ve lost our democracy.”
Pretti’s parents, Michael and Susan Pretti, are Colorado residents. They released a statement Saturday calling him “a kindhearted soul who cared deeply for his family and friends.”
“The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting,” their statement said. “Alex (was) clearly not holding a gun when attacked by Trump’s murdering and cowardly ICE thugs.”
“Alex wanted to make a difference in this world,” they said. “Unfortunately he will not be with us to see his impact.
The federal presence in Minneapolis is part of the Trump administration’s mass deportation efforts.
Colorado reaction
Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, called the shooting “tragic and unacceptable” in a statement Saturday afternoon. He called for an impartial investigation into the incident and affirmed people’s right to protest.
“To anyone peacefully exercising your First Amendment rights, Colorado stands with you. Americans are experiencing violence and intimidation by our own government. It is unacceptable and must end. Americans are not blind and can see the dangers of the current approach and tactics from ICE,” he said.

The six Democrats in Colorado’s congressional delegation condemned the shooting online. As of Sunday afternoon, the four Republicans who represent Colorado in Congress had not spoken or issued statements about the shooting.
In a social media post, Rep. Diana DeGette, a Denver Democrat, called ICE a “rogue agency” out of control, and said ICE needs to be “dismantled” and U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem should be impeached.
Rep. Brittany Pettersen, a Lakewood Democrat, said in a statement that she grieves the “senseless loss of life and the terrifying leadership that has created this reality.”
“Our country is at a breaking point because of the illegal and fascist actions of this administration. The American people have had enough. Some Republicans have started to call for ICE oversight, but we need more,” she said.

Sen. John Hickenlooper wrote in a post that he will vote against an upcoming bill in the Senate to fund Homeland Security. The bill which includes $10 billion for ICE. It is expected that Senate Democrats will not provide the votes necessary to advance the bill, which passed the House last week.
“ICE is out of control,” Hickenlooper wrote. “Killing people, separating families and terrorizing communities.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)In the wake of a massive winter storm that rolled across Tennessee, covering the state with a glaze of ice and leaving hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses without power, President Donald Trump approved on Saturday a request for emergency aid. 
Gov. Bill Lee issued a state of emergency for all 95 counties on Friday, ahead of the storm, and on Sunday, Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell declared one, urging people to stay home if possible. 
“Try to shelter in place, help neighbors who are in walking distance, be careful if you do have to go outside,” said O’Connell.

As of Sunday afternoon, more than 225,000 Nashville households lack electricity, according to the Nashville Electric Service and O’Connell. Middle Tennessee Electric Corporation, which covers portions of Middle Tennessee, reported 13,000 outages. Cumberland Electric Membership Corporation, which serves portions of northern Middle Tennessee, including Montgomery, Stewart, Sumner and Robertson counties, reports 35,000 of its 110,000 members are without electricity. 
Memphis, which in 2022 had long term outages after a major winter storm, escaped the worst of the ice. 
Activation of an emergency declaration gives state and local government agencies access to federal support for emergency protective measures, direct federal assistance and coordination of federal resources.
Trump’s quick approval of the request for emergency support contrasts the much slower response from the federal government after severe storms battered West Tennessee in the spring. 
This is the third time in less than two years Tennessee has had to access federal emergency funds for climate disasters. Prior to the spring tornadoes and flooding in 2025, in September 2024, flooding caused by Hurricane Helene caused catastrophic damage to parts of East Tennessee.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The federal killing of a U.S. citizen in Minneapolis this month, captured from multiple angles by witnesses recording on their cell phones, kicked off a dizzying day here and in Washington. Democratic politicians and ordinary Americans reacted with a mix of outrage and incredulousness, backfooting the Trump administration as the federal operation Democratic Gov. Tim Walz has called an “occupation” approached its third month.
By late Saturday, a Trump-appointed Minnesota federal judge appointed had ordered the Department of Homeland Security and other federal agencies to refrain from “destroying or altering evidence.” 
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said his party would block a must-pass government appropriations package — and partially shut down the government next week — if it contained additional funding for the Homeland Security Department. 
As it did earlier this month after a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot and killed 37-year-old Minneapolis resident Renee Nicole Good, senior Trump administration officials worked swiftly on Saturday to blame the incident on the victim. 
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called Alex Jeffrey Pretti a “domestic terrorist,” echoing language used by Vice President JD Vance to describe Good. Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino said Pretti appeared eager to inflict “maximum damage” on the federal agents assembled near the intersection of Nicollet Avenue and 26th Street Saturday morning. Stephen Miller, President Donald Trump’s chief domestic policy advisor, called Pretti an “assassin.” 
Videos taken at the scene — as well as what’s known about Pretti’s background — belie the Trump administration’s claims. Pretti was a lawful gun owner with a concealed carry permit and no criminal record, according to Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara. 
Moments before he was shot, Pretti could be seen on video with his phone — not a gun — recording federal officers, as has become standard practice among anti-ICE activists. 
A cell phone video shows a gaggle of Border Patrol agents wrestling him to the ground and beating him; an agent removes Pretti’s holstered gun, and Pretti appears to pose no threat to the officers surrounding him. Moments later, about 10 shots ring out. 
In a sworn affidavit filed Saturday evening, a physician who lives nearby said Pretti had no pulse when they arrived at the scene. The physician, whose name and identity were not made public, said agents did not appear to be rendering lifesaving aid and initially refused the physician’s offer to help. Pretti was pronounced dead at the scene a short time later.
Pretti’s name had emerged in media reports by early afternoon. It’s unclear whether federal, state or local officials attempted to notify his next of kin beforehand. Michael Pretti, his father, said he first learned of the shooting from an Associated Press reporter.
“I can’t get any information from anybody,” Michael Pretti told the AP, detailing a runaround with the Border Patrol, local police and area hospitals. He said the Hennepin County Medical Examiner eventually confirmed they had Alex Preti’s body.
“We are heartbroken but also very angry,” Pretti’s parents said in a statement released later on Saturday that described Pretti as a “hero” who “wanted to make a difference in this world.”
“The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting,” they said. “Please get the truth out about our son.”
Meanwhile, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said DHS officials blocked their investigators from the crime scene even after they returned with a judicial warrant. The details of the warrant are unclear, as is the BCA’s recourse if Homeland Security continues to stymie its efforts. Federal officials said Saturday that Homeland Security — not the FBI or the Minnesota BCA — would lead the investigation.
The names of the agents involved in the shooting have not been released. Bovino told CNN on Sunday that he did not know whether more than one agent fired shots.
Minnesota officials questioned Homeland Security’s handling of the shooting’s aftermath and indicated they did not trust the department to conduct a fair investigation.

The Minnesota Department of Corrections unveiled a new website this weekend to combat “ongoing misinformation” from Homeland Security. In a lengthy statement on Saturday, the department called into question Bovino’s initial explanation for the operation that led to Pretti’s death. The statement said the individual named by Bovino as the target of the operation did not have a significant criminal history, as Bovino alleged, and was previously released from immigration custody in 2018 — during the first Trump administration.
A recent article by Stateline, which is a States Newsroom outlet like the Reformer, found that eyewitness testimony and other evidence often contradicts DHS’ initial description of incidents involving its agents.
On Sunday, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said he expects Homeland Security to heed Saturday’s court order to preserve evidence to support the state’s own investigation.
“We’ve had to threaten them with contempt a few times, but open defiance of court orders is not something that we’ve experienced,” Ellison told the Star Tribune.
Signs had emerged by Sunday that at least some elected Republicans and gun rights groups were uncomfortable with the official line that Pretti posed a clear and present danger before his death. Few elected Republicans wholeheartedly endorsed the administration’s narrative, and even some right-wing influencers who typically hew to the party line recoiled.
Republican Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, who faces a primary challenge from his right this year, called Saturday’s shooting “incredibly disturbing.”
“The credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake,” he said on Sunday. “There must be a full joint federal and state investigation.”
The Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus also issued a statement calling for an independent investigation.
“Every peaceable Minnesotan has the right to keep and bear arms — including while attending protests, acting as observers, or exercising their First Amendment rights. These rights do not disappear when someone is lawfully armed, and they must be respected and protected at all times,” the group said.
Kevin Stitt, the outgoing Republican governor of Oklahoma, hinted in a Sunday interview with CNN that the administration should rethink its immigration enforcement efforts.

“And so what’s the goal right now? Is it to deport every single non-U.S. citizen? I don’t think that’s what Americans want,” he said. “We have to stop politicizing this. We need real solutions on immigration reform.”
Dozens of Minnesota business leaders released an open letter that gently called for a change in approach by the federal government, risking the ire of Trump, who is known for his retribution against those who oppose him. 
“With yesterday’s tragic news, we are calling for an immediate deescalation of tensions and for state, local and federal officials to work together to find real solutions,” the CEOs wrote. 
Among them were top officers of Medtronic, 3M, Target and the sports franchises. This is notable because as the Reformer previously reported, the state’s biggest companies had been publicly silent until now. Business leaders, the chamber letter asserts, have been “working behind the scenes” since the federal siege began. 
Some in the Trump administration may be looking for an escape hatch, even if on their terms.  On Saturday, Attorney General Pam Bondi said Minnesota could end the federal law enforcement surge if it repealed pro-immigrant “sanctuary” policies and turned over its voter rolls to the federal government. (Minnesota is not a “sanctuary state”; an effort to pass a sanctuary law the last time Democrats controlled the Legislature went nowhere.)

That Bondi made such an offer at all is notable. But it’s unlikely to lead to a resolution. On Sunday, Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon brushed off the idea of providing state voter information to the federal government in a caustic statement.
“The answer to Attorney General Bondi’s request is no. Her letter is an outrageous attempt to coerce Minnesota into giving the federal government private data on millions of U.S. Citizens in violation of state and federal law,” Simon said.
False claims of voter fraud have become a staple of the Trumpist political movement. A group of right-wing activists led by Mike Lindell — the pillow mogul currently running for governor as a Republican — claimed widespread voter fraud after the 2020 election.

(Photo by Madison McVan/Minnesota Reformer)Following the killing of Minnesota nurse Alex Pretti at the hands of a Border Patrol officer on Saturday, Michigan’s U.S. Senate candidates are now laying out their plans on how to deal with increasingly violent federal immigration enforcement actions that have resulted in three shootings in three weeks, with two now ending in death.
Local and state Democratic officials in Minnesota immediately condemned Saturday’s shooting as protests ramped up, while Republican President Donald Trump threatened again to send military forces to Minnesota, according to reporting from Michigan Advance’s sister publication, Minnesota Reformer.
In Michigan, the three Democrats in the Senate race followed suit, but they each have slightly different policy contemplations to either rein in, curb or abolish the executive branch’s increasingly troubling immigration force.
Former health official and Bernie Sanders-wing progressive Abdul El-Sayed has called for the outright dismantling of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a position he’s held since 2018, a message he has amplified in the wake of the government killings of Pretti on Saturday and Renee Good on Jan. 7.
“The murderers of Renee Good and Alex Pretti were eight-year and ten-year agents — training isn’t the issue,” El-Sayed said in a statement issued Sunday. “ICE is a paramilitary force deployed against and our Constitutional order for the service of one would-be dictator. How many more people do they need to shoot? Ask the families of Renee Good or Alex Pretti — both American Citizens — if ICE is protecting us. There can be no justification for lawlessness in the name of the law. And now is not the time to put political convenience. Trump is trying to normalize military force on peaceful streets, tearing apart our constitutional rights one by one. Our tax dollars are being used to kill Americans on our streets rather than save lives in our hospitals like Alex did.”
El-Sayed added that the U.S. must work to secure its border and work toward comprehensive immigration reform through legislation, and not through continued executive action. ICE, in that regard, has been shown to be “irredeemable,” he said.
“Retraining won’t fix it,” El-Sayed said. “And the only reason to deny this is political cowardice. … Rather than protecting us, it has become the thing from which we need to be protected. Abolishing this agency is the only safe path forward.”

While El-Sayed stated his belief that this stance sets him apart from his opponents, state Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak) has called for denying further funding for ICE and has demanded the immediate and sweeping overhaul of the agency. She says the upcoming vote in the U.S. Senate would be a good place to start for Democrats to assert leverage.
“Another person was killed by ICE in Minneapolis, after state leaders told them to leave, local officials told them to leave, and local law enforcement told them to leave,” McMorrow said in a statement on Saturday. “But Trump’s ICE continues on its collision course making our communities LESS safe — not more. Congress: not one more penny until we get the same oversight and accountability we demand from every law enforcement agency.”
McMorrow and her Democratic colleagues in the Michigan Senate are working on a game plan to respond to ICE tactics in the Great Lakes state, and that includes legislation prohibiting officers from being masked on operations with full identification. News that ICE has been distributing memos indicating that the agency does not need a judicial warrant — but rather a Fourth Amendment-bucking administrative warrant signed by an ICE official — has also led state Democrats to consider banning entry by law enforcement without a warrant.
McMorrow has also called for strict, codified use-of-force policies on the federal level to give courts a clear line for when an officer has abused their station if it ends in a preventable violent encounter. Vetting of recruits and vigorous training is part of McMorrow’s plan, as well as a demand that ICE stop detaining American citizens.
“Continuing to provide funding to this agency without a complete overhaul to return it to its duty will be a failure to meet the moment,” McMorrow said in a statement released prior to the death of Pretti this weekend. “The leverage is there. And Democrats should force Republicans to the table to demand that Congress use its power of the purse to end this nightmare and restore the community safety that Americans are demanding.”
U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham) on Sunday said she was joining as a co-sponsor for H.R. 7163, which would divert ICE’s $75 billion slush fund, created with the passage of last year’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, to state and local law enforcement agencies.
The bill would hire and train an estimated 200,000 local police officers across the nation, reverting funds to what Stevens called “proven law enforcement personnel who have real ties to the communities they serve.”
“Donald Trump’s ICE is out of control — this situation requires real reform and real accountability. Trump’s ICE Agents have now killed two American citizens in broad daylight and they are putting more Americans in danger every single day,” Stevens said in a statement. “Not one penny more should go to ICE. Kristi Noem must be impeached. It’s past time for Donald Trump to listen to state and local officials and call off his lawless federal agents. We’ve heard today from law enforcement leaders in Minnesota who want to keep their communities safe, but are being blocked from accessing evidence and information about these crimes.”
Other aspects of the bill include:

Reallocating $29.85 billion in funds for ICE’s enforcement and operations to the COPS Hiring Program (and waive the program’s traditional matching contribution requirements for small jurisdictions); and
Reallocating $45 billion in funds designated for ICE’s detention capacity to the Byrne JAG program, which provides funding to support training, crime victim assistance, and crime prevention.

Stevens voted against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill, which did pass in the U.S. House last week, and last year co-sponsored the VISIBLE Act to ban ICE agents from wearing masks and concealing their identities. Stevens has also called for U.S. Department of Homeland Security Kristi Noem to be removed from office and co-sponsored articles for Noem’s impeachment.

What about Republicans?
The main Republican in the race, former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, as of Sunday afternoon, had not issued a direct statement on the killing of Pretti. Rogers, who is endorsed by Trump, did issue several statements following the killing of Good, saying Democrats, and more specifically his Democratic opponents in the race, were persistently supporting “criminals over cops and America’s safety.”
“The Left’s never-ending war against law enforcement is an assault on Americans’ safety,” Rogers said in a statement issued Jan. 22. “These brave men and women protect our streets so that Michigan families can drive to work and walk to school without fear. But when you have Democrats releasing violent offenders onto the streets, and siding with criminals over cops, that all goes out the window.”
The only other Republican in the race, former Michigan Republican Party co-chair Bernadette Smith, has not issued any public statement on either Pretti or Good’s deaths.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7744-2048x1536-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-25 16:56:59.715795
,DC,2026-01-25 21:13:53+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Deadly shooting in Minneapolis could lead to partial government shutdown over ICE funding,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/deadly-shooting-minneapolis-could-lead-partial-government-shutdown-over-ice-funding,,"A partial federal government shutdown appeared Sunday to unexpectedly be on the horizon, after another fatal shooting by federal immigration agents in Minneapolis led key U.S. Senate Democrats to say they will oppose a spending package that includes immigration enforcement funds.Senators have until a Friday deadline to clear a package of six House-passed funding measures, including the $64.4 billion Homeland Security appropriations bill that includes funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the U.S. Border Patrol.Republicans hold a majority in the chamber but would need at least seven Democrats to join them in voting for the package in order to clear the chamber’s 60-vote threshold to advance legislation. The agreement had appeared to be on track for easy passage by the Senate by Friday, when a stopgap spending law expires. But after Saturday’s killing of 37-year-old Alex Jeffrey Pretti, the second by Homeland Security Department officers in Minneapolis this month, key moderate Democrats, appropriators and leaders said they would not support the package if it includes the Homeland Security legislation in its current form. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer also said his caucus would not provide the votes needed, citing the killings of Pretti and Renee Good in Minneapolis on Jan. 7, and called for the DHS bill to be split from the five spending bills with broad bipartisan support.“Senate Democrats will not allow the current DHS funding bill to move forward,” Schumer said in a Sunday statement. “The appalling murders of Renee Good and Alex Pretti on the streets of Minneapolis must lead Republicans to join Democrats in overhauling ICE and CBP to protect the public. People should be safe from abuse by their own government.“Senate Republicans must work with Democrats to advance the other five funding bills while we work to rewrite the DHS bill,” he added. “This is (the) best course of action, and the American people are on our side.”A complicating factor is the DHS bill also includes funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, even as a major winter storm swept through a large swath of the nation Saturday and Sunday, triggering disaster declarations in multiple states.President Donald Trump and key administration officials committed to a robust media strategy over the weekend, defending the officers involved and smearing Pretti, despite contradictory evidence in available video.Some elected Republicans backed the administration's account, but an unusual number of GOP members of Congress and at least one governor called for accountability.Latest shooting a turning pointFive of the eight Democrats and independents who voted with Republicans to end a shutdown in November have said they will not support the package if it includes DHS funding.Maine independent Angus King, who caucuses with Democrats, said on CBS News’ “Face the Nation” that he would vote against the package.“I hate shutdowns,” King said in a video interview on the Sunday morning show. “I’m one of the people that helped negotiate the solution to the end of the last shutdown, but I can’t vote for a bill that includes ICE funding under these circumstances.”Nevada Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto, a former federal prosecutor, criticized Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and called for blocking the funding package.“The Trump administration and Kristi Noem are putting undertrained, combative federal agents on the streets with no accountability,” she said. “They are oppressing Americans and are at odds with local law enforcement. This is clearly not about keeping Americans safe, it’s brutalizing U.S. citizens and law-abiding immigrants. I will not support the current Homeland Security funding bill.”Cortez Masto called for the DHS bill to be split off from the rest of the package. “We have bipartisan agreement on 96% of the budget. We’ve already passed six funding bills,” she said. “Let’s pass the remaining five bipartisan bills and fund essential agencies while we continue to fight for a Department of Homeland Security that respects Americans’ constitutional rights and preserves federal law enforcement’s essential role to keep us safe.” Fellow Nevada Democrat Jacky Rosen, who also voted to end the shutdown in November, said “enough is enough” and that she would oppose a funding package that did not “rein in ICE’s out-of-control conduct.”“As a member of the U.S. Senate, I have the responsibility to hold the Trump Administration accountable when I see abuses of power — like we are seeing from ICE right now,” she said. “That is why I’ll be voting against any government funding package that contains the bill that funds this agency, until we have guardrails in place to curtail these abuses of power and ensure more accountability and transparency.“My personal guiding principle has always been ‘agree where you can and fight where you must,’” she added. “And I believe this is a time when we must fight back.”Virginia’s Tim Kaine said in a Friday statement — before Pretti’s killing — that he would oppose the package for several reasons, including as a check on ICE.“We are not living in normal times,” he said. “The President is acting chaotically and unlawfully and we shouldn’t give his deranged decisions the imprimatur of congressional approval by passing this legislation without significant amendment.”Democratic Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois also said after Pretti’s killing early Saturday — the third shooting by immigration officers in Minneapolis in three weeks — that he would vote against the package. Durbin is a senior member of the Appropriations Committee.DHS fundingThe House last week passed the DHS funding bill, with seven Democrats voting to approve it, and a separate package of three other appropriations bills that passed with broad bipartisan support. House members passed two other funding bills the week before.The fiscal 2026 Homeland Security spending bill cuts funding for Customs and Border Protection by $1.3 billion, and maintains flat funding for ICE at $10 billion.The bill attempts to put guardrails around immigration enforcement by allocating $20 million for body cameras for ICE and CBP officers. But even if the funding bill doesn’t pass or gets held up, the immigration enforcement agencies are still flush with cash after the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that Republicans passed last year allocated $190 billion for DHS. ICE is slated to receive about $75 billion over four years, or $18.7 billion a year.Path forwardAny Senate amendment to the House-passed package would require another House vote. The House is scheduled to be out this week and the chamber, narrowly controlled by Republicans, may be unwilling to cooperate with Senate changes.Senate Appropriations Chair Susan Collins, a Maine Republican up for reelection this year in one of the nation’s most closely watched races, did not dismiss the possibility of changes in the spending bill package, telling The New York Times on Saturday she was “exploring all options” for passage.The major winter storm also hit Washington, D.C., and could further complicate the Senate vote or potential House consideration. All flights into Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport were canceled Sunday as snow and sleet covered the region. A handful of GOP officials, including Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska called for more scrutiny into Pretti’s killing and ICE’s conduct more generally. “There must be a thorough and impartial investigation into yesterday’s Minneapolis shooting, which is the basic standard that law enforcement and the American people expect following any officer-involved shooting,” Tillis said on social media.“For this specific incident, that requires cooperation and transparency between federal, state, and local law enforcement. Any administration official who rushes to judgment and tries to shut down an investigation before it begins are doing an incredible disservice to the nation and to President Trump’s legacy.”Cassidy posted on social media: “The events in Minneapolis are incredibly disturbing. The credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake. There must be a full joint federal and state investigation. We can trust the American people with the truth.”Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican who is a former chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said on social media he was “troubled by the events that have unfolded in Minneapolis.”“As an attorney and former federal prosecutor, I believe a thorough investigation is necessary—both to get to the bottom of these incidents and to maintain Americans’ confidence in our justice system,” he said.Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, a Republican, was among those who said he was troubled by the shooting.“I think the death of Americans, what we’re seeing on TV, it’s causing deep concerns over federal tactics and accountability,” Stitt said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “Americans don’t like what they’re seeing right now.”Administration, some allies defend shooting Many others, including Republican senators and Trump administration officials speaking on Sunday talk shows — Noem, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche — defended the agents involved and blamed Pretti and state and local Democrats in Minneapolis. “Democrats are now backing out of a bipartisan agreement to fund DHS, which makes sure our border is secure and our immigration laws are enforced,” Senate Budget Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., wrote on social media.“This is reckless and quite frankly, very disappointing. It appears that Democrats are so wedded to supporting people carrying guns trying to interfere with a lawful arrest that they will shut down the government.”Patel, on “Sunday Morning Futures” on Fox News, said DHS is investigating the shooting but the FBI is processing physical evidence. “No one who wants to be peaceful shows up in a protest with a firearm that is loaded with two full magazines,” Patel said, referring to reports that Pretti was carrying a handgun for which he had a concealed carry license, according to Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara.Spokespeople for Collins, Schumer and Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota did not return messages seeking comment Sunday. Senate Democrats were set to meet virtually on Sunday night, according to multiple media reports.",,,,2026-01-25 16:56:59.715795

Jeff Landry at a news conference Sept. 13, 2024, on the recovery from Hurricane Francine at Signature Aviation in Kenner. (Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)U.S. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said “sanctuary city” policies and a lack of cooperation from local authorities in Minnesota created the situation that led to Saturday’s shooting death of Alex Pretti, after a confrontation with federal immigration officers.
Scalise appeared on the CBS program “Face the Nation” Sunday morning, where host Margaret Brennan sought his reaction to the third shooting by federal officials in Minneapolis in three weeks and the second death.
Multiple video accounts show Pretti, 37, an ICU nurse at a Veterans Affairs hospital, intervening after a Border Patrol agent shoved a woman to the street. A group of agents then forced Pretti to the ground, after which he was shot multiple times. U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Pretti was in possession of a handgun and two clips when he encountered federal agents. Noem told reporters Saturday it appeared Pretti “arrived at the scene to inflict maximum damage on individuals and to kill law enforcement.”
Some 3,000 federal agents have carried out sweeps in the Minneapolis area over the past two months. Grassroots organizers have tracked their efforts in an attempt to warn targeted immigrants, and the two sides have clashed on several occasions. 
Scalise, a Republican, said officers with Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement have seen far greater cooperation from local police in other states, including Louisiana. Operation “Catahoula Crunch” from Homeland Security, which focused on the New Orleans region, totaled 370 arrests as of early January before Border Patrol Director Greg Bovino redirected the 200 agents to Minneapolis.
Violent criminals are being apprehended where ICE and Border Patrol agents work in collaboration in local authorities, according to the majority leader.    
“You’re seeing that on the ground in many, many cities where they are cooperating with ICE, where they don’t have sanctuary city policies,” Scalise said, “and where you don’t see, by the way, people going in the streets breaking the law to interfere with law enforcement, which is a felony.”


Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara confirmed that Pretti held a permit to carry a concealed firearm, and videos from Saturday’s confrontation show Pretti holding only his cellphone to record video. 
O’Hara and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said the 2nd Amendment allows Pretti to have his weapon with him at Saturday’s demonstration, but Scalise said that right is effectively revoked if a permit holder is in the act of committing a crime. Federal officials have said grassroots efforts in Minnesota to monitor and disrupt immigration enforcement efforts are unlawful.    
Scalise noted that, as a state lawmaker, he authored the Louisiana law to create concealed-carry permits.
“You are not allowed to carry a gun while you’re committing another crime, and interfering with law enforcement is a felony,” said Scalise, who prefaced his statement by saying he wasn’t familiar with Minnesota’s concealed-carry permit law. 
As in Louisiana, concealed weapon permit holders in Minnesota can face additional charges if they have their firearm in their possession during a criminal act. Louisiana has since approved the concealed carrying of a firearm without a permit, eliminating the need for training to possess a firearm.

Soon after Pretti’s fatal shooting, U.S. Rep. Clay Higgins, R-Lafayette, posted social media comments similar to those Scalise would make Sunday morning. Cooperation between local police and federal immigration authorities in other cities has prevented the “encroaching, interference and provocation” seen in the “sanctuary city” of Minneapolis, he said.
“This sanctuary city BS raises stress levels in ways that it’s difficult to explain, but I can tell you that pulling the trigger will happen more frequently when things go FUBAR, and sanctuary city policies most definitely create FUBAR situations,” Higgins wrote, citing the military slang acronym for “f—ed up beyond all recognition.” 
In contrast to his fellow GOP members in the Louisiana delegation, U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy made a measured call for accountability after Pretti’s death in a social media post Saturday night. 
“The events in Minneapolis are incredibly disturbing,” Cassidy said in an X post. “The credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake. There must be a full joint federal and state investigation. We can trust the American people with the truth.”
This is Cassidy’s first public statement out of sync with the Trump administration since the president urged U.S. Rep. Julia Letlow, R-Baton Rouge, last weekend to run for his seat this fall. Letlow announced her candidacy Tuesday.  
O’Hara, who appeared on “Face the Nation” right before Scalise, said federal officials have yet to share complete details of what led to Pretti’s death with his agency. The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which investigates all police-involved shootings in the state, was denied access to Saturday’s shooting scene by federal authorities, despite having a warrant from U.S. District Judge Eric Tostrud, a Trump appointee.     
The Bureau of Criminal Apprehension was also turned away from the scene of the Jan. 7 fatal shooting of Renee Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer.
U.S. Rep. Troy Carter, D-New Orleans, was more pointed in his reaction to Saturday’s incident, saying in an X post it took place less than a month after Good’s death. 
“This violence we’re seeing is sanctioned by the dangerous rhetoric and reckless policies of Donald Trump and Kristi Noem,” Carter said.

Snow and ice left widespread damage across northern Mississippi as a massive storm moved across large parts of the U.S., creating dangerous travel conditions. Trees split open and dropped heavy branches, and power lines crashed down in some areas.
Though the biggest damage was in the northern part of the state, areas as far south as Natchez saw icy conditions.

About 10% of Mississippi customers were without electrical service at midday Sunday, and the hardest-hit areas were in the northern part of the state, according to the tracking site poweroutage.us. 
“The situation is expected to get worse before it gets better,” Gov. Tate Reeves said, warning that restoring power could take days.
Like many other Oxford residents, Lee Ragland said he and his wife, Jana, were without power Sunday. He said some trees and large limbs fell in their yard, but luckily none had hit their house.
“Laid in bed last night listening to transformers blow and trees snapping and falling up and down street,” Lee Ragland said in a text message. “Not a good feeling. Now need to find a chainsaw crew to clear my driveway.”

Holly Springs resident Pat Stubbs said his home lost power Saturday night, and trees were down all around his neighborhood.
“I’ve got gas logs and a gas stove and oven. I’m better off than most,” Stubbs said Sunday. “Looks like it’s gonna be a few days before all this melts.”
In Clarksdale, Shawn Thomas-Erving said Sunday he helped six people who were stuck in the storm Saturday evening, including law enforcement. He said he used a shovel to get tires out of areas thickly blanketed with snow and ice. 
Thomas-Erving said afterward that he was tired, but “I felt like it was my duty.”
He said wintry conditions haven’t been this bad in Clarksdale since the early 2000s. He described the situation Sunday as “unbearable,” with cars still sliding and getting stuck.

Lafayette County, home to Oxford, had about 20,000 customers without electricity at midday Sunday, about 75% of the customers in that county.
Lee County, home to Tupelo, had nearly 13,000 customers without electricity, about 35%.
Reeves said power outages were expected to increase as ice accumulates and trees continue to fall.
Tippah Electric Power Association reported that TVA, one of the largest power providers in northeast Mississippi, had “catastrophic damage” to one of its main distribution lines “and because of that, it could be a lengthy time before they are able to get power to every customer,” Reeves said.

Jackson firefighters extinguished flames Saturday night at what was supposed to be a vacant building at Chapel Ridge apartments. The Jackson Fire Department’s chief investigator, Charles Felton, said the building was being used by people “without permanent housing.”
Oxford Mayor Robbyn Tannehill said on social media Sunday that crews were working to clear streets for emergency vehicles. She implored people to remain home and to stay away from downed power lines.
“It looks dire right now, I know, but Oxford’s a community that takes care of each other and comes together when things are most challenging,” Tannehill said. “And this challenge will be no different.”

The Legislative Research Commission announced on social media that lawmakers will now convene Tuesday at 4 p.m. in Frankfort. The capitol annex will be closed Monday, but most LRC employees will telework and can be reached by email. 
Communities across the commonwealth have been blanketed with snow and ice over the weekend, making roads hazardous and causing power outages. In a Sunday morning press conference, Gov. Andy Beshear said more snow, sleet and ice is expected throughout the evening. 
Beshear said that the state had no reports of deaths or significant injuries because most Kentuckians were prepared and had stayed off roads Saturday. 
“To the people of Kentucky, thank you. You’re helping everybody out there do their very best in responding. You’re protecting one another and yourself,” he said. “But snow and ice totals are expected to increase today and tonight, so we still have a long road ahead of us.” 
At the time of the press conference, Kentucky had more than 50,000 outages reported with more expected. The state has set up 113 warming centers, and local information can be found on the Kentucky Emergency Management’s website. Eighteen state parks have set up warming centers. 
The governor and emergency management officials strongly urged Kentuckians to avoid travel unless absolutely necessary. Beshear also emphasized that when shoveling snow, take breaks, as the activity can increase risk of heart attacks. Last year, six Kentuckians died while shoveling snow. 
President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency Saturday for several states, including Kentucky, due to the weather. A Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) press release said the declaration allows for federal assistance to aid response efforts. 
Beshear declared a state of emergency for Kentucky Friday. 
Attorney General Russell Coleman’s office is taking reports of suspected price gouging at its hotline, 1-888-432-9257, or online. 
Beshear also reminded Kentuckians to call 911 in emergencies or life-threatening situations. If someone has immediate needs that aren’t life-threatening, like little to no heat or phone issues, they can complete the online Rapid Needs Assessment Form or call 502-607-6665.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota regularly disenrolled one of the highest percentages of Medicaid patients in the country each month last year, contributing to one of the largest yearly decreases in the state’s Medicaid enrollment in the last decade.
The state often switched places with Oklahoma last year for the first and second highest-percentage of disenrollments in the nation, according to national Medicaid data, with disenrollment rates regularly over one-third of patients up for renewal. Medicaid, which is funded jointly by the federal government and states, provides health insurance for people with disabilities or low incomes.
Overall, South Dakota Medicaid enrollment dropped by about 9,000 people from February to November last year, primarily among traditional Medicaid for adults and children, and has since stabilized around 141,000. That number includes expanded-eligibility Medicaid for adults ages 19 through 64, approved by South Dakota voters in 2022, which has stayed relatively stable at around 30,000 people enrolled.
Department of Social Services Secretary Matt Althoff spoke to South Dakota Searchlight after he presented Medicaid enrollment information to the legislative budget committee on Wednesday at the Capitol in Pierre. He said the reason for the higher disenrollments was a combination of South Dakota’s use of an automatic renewal process known as ex parte, and the lingering impact of post-COVID pandemic removals.


Althoff told lawmakers that while Medicaid is a “big spend” in the department’s budget, it is “super impactful in our efforts to lift people who are downtrodden and facing bad times up.
“Without our ability to work pain free or feel confident that ‘I’m not going to die’ or ‘I’m having my personal health in good order,’ we don’t go forward ambitiously, we don’t take risks, we don’t find jobs that we need,” Althoff said.
The decrease could also be due to a healthy economy, said Jennifer Tolbert, deputy director of the Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured for KFF. The nonprofit health policy organization researches and reports on major health issues in the United States. South Dakota reported one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation over the last year. 
The decrease in enrollment throughout the year matches nationwide decreased enrollment, Tolbert added.
State predicted enrollment decrease
A year ago, Althoff told lawmakers there would be a decrease in enrollment as the department implemented ex parte, or automated renewals, to identify enrollees no longer eligible for the program. At the same time, the process allows states to simplify Medicaid renewals, eliminating the need for people to resubmit eligibility information to the state.
SD Medicaid officials say enrollments will decline as they cross-reference for eligibility

South Dakota was not able to use ex parte until it upgraded to a new online enrollment system, Althoff told lawmakers at the time. He said that once the state was able to use ex parte in late 2024, it used external databases to reference and remove South Dakotans who were “no longer eligible” for enrollment, for reasons such as finding a job that put them outside income limits.
The state is required by law to first attempt to renew patients by crosschecking with other data sources, within the state or through a third party. If a state identifies an ineligible patient on the rolls, patients are sent notification and paperwork to prove otherwise.
But an average of 9% of patients up for renewal were terminated because they were no longer eligible, according to state data. The majority of disenrollments were “procedural terminations,” due to missing and improper paperwork.
Tolbert said for a majority of people who lose Medicaid access, it’s not because they are no longer eligible or because their income exceeds the limit, but rather because they “weren’t able to navigate the renewal process.”
Procedural disenrollment can be due to unreliable mail, and the disenrollment often leads to confusion and a lack of insurance for people who need health care, said Shelly Ten Napel, CEO of Community HealthCare Association of the Dakotas.
Increases in automatic renewals prevent “time consuming” paperwork for patients and the state, and it means fewer people are “showing up for care who have unknowingly lost coverage,” Ten Napel said.
Althoff predicted that fiscal year 2025 average monthly Medicaid enrollees would drop to just under 140,000 by June of last year, a drop of about 8,000 enrollees, before climbing back up. 
Medicaid enrollment in reality dropped to 144,310 by June of last year and continued to decrease through September, to 141,012 average monthly enrollees. Enrollment has since plateaued, with 141,151 average monthly enrollees in November, according to the latest Medicaid enrollment report.
Change in ex parte could ‘stabilize’ enrollment
South Dakota’s high disenrollment rate changed after the state Department of Social Services changed its automatic renewal labeling and process, due to modernized enrollment software. The latest national Medicaid report dropped South Dakota’s disenrollment standing to 22nd highest in the nation, at a disenrollment rate of about 20%.
Since July, the state’s number of terminated Medicaid recipients due to procedural disenrollment — often due to failing to fill out required renewal, financial or residential documents — dropped to an average of 17%.


Althoff told Searchlight that the department recognized its comparatively high procedural disenrollment rate and made changes.
Starting in July, the department started retaining “categorically eligible recipients” in the Medicaid program, which includes children in Child Protective Services custody or adults who are older or disabled who receive supplemental security income from the Social Security Administration.
“We changed how we define those administrative functions, and that’s what led to the radical change,” Althoff said.
Many Medicaid cases up for renewal in the first half of 2025 weren’t able to go through the ex parte process as well, according to a state Department of Services spokesperson, because of the modernization of the state’s Medicaid enrollment software. The state continued its standard practice of mailing renewal forms, which historically result in higher procedural disenrollment rates.

It wasn’t until September of last year that all Medicaid cases were in a “ready state” for ex parte with the state’s new enrollment software, according to the department. Department officials expect Medicaid enrollment to stabilize over the next year, due in part to the ex parte process and changes regarding the “categorically eligible recipients.”
More than half of Medicaid recipients up for renewal since July were automatically renewed — over 60% in September and October.
Between ex parte reapproval and approvals through submitted renewal forms in the last three months of reports, over three-fourths of recipients due for renewal are being renewed.

Our state must act now, guided by data, employers and long-term planning.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Amy Spear and Megan Sullivan: Vermont trails the nation.","This commentary is by Amy Spear, president of the Vermont Chamber of Commerce, and Megan Sullivan, vice president of government affairs for the Vermont Chamber of Commerce.



Each year, the Vermont Chamber of Commerce sets legislative priorities grounded in one core objective: advancing the Vermont economy. As we enter the 2026 session, Vermont stands at a defining moment. 
Affordability pressures, demographic decline and rising operating costs are converging just as our state needs more workers, more housing and greater predictability to sustain economic growth.
Our work toward long-range strategy began with the Vermont Economic Action Plan, a statewide blueprint shaped in consultation with more than 5,000 Vermonters. 
The plan established a clear vision for a stronger and more affordable future, grounded in data, pairing community insight and measurable targets. 
It also signaled a pivotal shift in how Vermont approaches economic decision-making. Instead of reacting to problems as they arise, we now have a long-term framework that can guide policy choices and align efforts across the public and private sectors.
This alignment is urgently needed. The Vermont Futures Project’s new competitiveness dashboard shows Vermont trailing most states in economic performance. 
Vermont ranks 51st out of 51 in economic momentum, 49th out of 50 in economic outlook, 51st out of 51 for effective business tax rates, 43rd out of 51 for cost of living, and 50th out of 51 for residents aged 25 to 44 as a percentage of the population. 
This means we have a small and shrinking tax base, shouldering an ever-increasing cost burden, and our ability to improve affordability through growth is hampered by a policy environment that is not conducive to expanding economic opportunity relative to other states. 
Without a substantial immediate commitment to economic stewardship and growth, the data point toward a future of higher costs or significant cuts to critical services.
Results from this year’s Business Climate Survey reinforce this landscape, too. Employers identified taxes, regulations, labor shortages, health care costs and housing challenges as the most significant barriers to growth. 
Many employers consulted in the survey voiced concern that the state’s policy direction is disconnected from Vermont’s economic reality and said they do not feel heard in Montpelier. 
When employers were asked how confident or concerned they were with elected officials’ understanding of economic pressures facing businesses, about 85% said they were either somewhat concerned or very concerned.
Business leaders shared with us examples of policy decisions advanced without a clear understanding of operational impacts. This sentiment reflects a growing disconnect at the precise moment Vermont needs alignment around affordability, stability, and long-term economic strategy. 
It also underscores the essential role the Vermont Chamber plays in bringing employer perspectives to the policy and regulatory tables and ensuring economic policy aligns with economic reality. Addressing Vermont’s challenges requires sustained commitment to coordinated, data-informed action.
While there is difficult work ahead, progress was made last year on housing infrastructure, workforce programming and slowing the growth of health care costs. These advances were important, but they are not enough on their own. 
Vermont must shift from episodic decision-making to a consistent, long-range economic strategy. The Economic Action Plan provides that roadmap. Paired with disciplined and transparent leadership, it offers a path toward measurable improvements for both families and employers.
Our 2026 legislative agenda reflects this approach and focuses on four core areas aligned with statewide priorities and employer needs. 
With state spending up more than three billion dollars in five years, Vermont must adopt predictable fiscal practices that control cost growth and strengthen affordability for families and employers.
A modernized regulatory system must support timely housing and economic development. Streamlined permitting and clearer rules will reduce costs, shorten timelines and restore Vermont’s competitiveness. 
Employers report that workforce pressures and housing shortages remain among their highest concerns. Strengthening recruitment and retention requires connecting training strategies, talent attraction and coordinated housing solutions. 
Finally, manufacturing, tourism, health care, technology and small businesses all face rising pressures. Strategic investments in infrastructure, innovation, and cost containment will strengthen these key sectors.
As we begin the 2026 session, Vermont faces a choice. The path forward requires courage, collaboration, and a commitment to measurable progress. Employers are ready to be partners in this work. Policymakers must be equally ready to align decisions with long-term strategy and economic reality.
Vermont’s future is not predetermined. It is shaped by the choices we make — together.

It is also a moment to underscore what defines our profession: a commitment to truth, transparency and patient safety.
Physician anesthesiologists do far more than “put patients to sleep.” We are responsible for managing pain, vital functions and life-threatening complications before, during and after surgery. That level of responsibility demands trust, and trust is built on honest communication and informed consent. At the Michigan Society of Anesthesiologists (MSA), which represents nearly 1,000 anesthesiologists statewide, these principles guide everything we do.
That’s why MSA is proud to advocate for Michigan Senate Bills 475 and 476, which prohibit pelvic, prostate and other intimate exams on patients under anesthesia without their explicit, informed consent, except in emergencies. This legislation sends a clear message: patients have the right to know what will happen to their bodies and to say yes or no beforehand. There is no room for ambiguity when it comes to consent.
Transparency also means being clear about who is providing medical care. MSA has been a strong supporter of medical title transparency so patients understand the training and credentials of the professionals who are treating them. This is not about professional labels; it is about honesty and patient confidence.
Throughout the past year, MSA has also become a leader in educating Michiganders about emerging safety issues. We have warned patients about hospitals replacing anesthesiologists with other clinicians for certain procedures without clearly explaining the change. We have urged patients to tell their anesthesiologist about recreational marijuana or psychedelic mushroom use, which can significantly affect anesthesia and surgical outcomes. We have helped raise awareness about the warning signs of cardiac arrest and the importance of knowing CPR, skills that save lives long before an ambulance arrives.
In addition, MSA has supported efforts to curb the recreational misuse of nitrous oxide while preserving its appropriate medical use. This is another example of how anesthesiologists look beyond the operating room to protect patients and communities.
Physician Anesthesiologists Week (Jan. 25-31) focuses on recognition as well as accountability. Michigan’s anesthesiologists take seriously the trust patients place in us. Through advocacy, education, research, innovation and daily patient care, MSA will continue to put truth and transparency first this week and every week.

It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
While Speaker Jason White said he did not pressure House members for their support to garner the narrow 61-59 margin to pass his massive school choice/voucher bill, he at the least had a laser-like understanding of how representatives were going to vote.
Normally, during final passage of a bill in the House, the speaker opens the voting machine and then asks three times “has everyone voted” before closing the machine.
When it came time to vote on the controversial school choice/voucher bill, White opened the machine, which displays on two giant boards on the House floor how members are voting, and asked twice “has everyone voted?” Before he repeated that phrase the third and final time, he took the unusual move of interjecting, “waiting on the gentleman from Grenada,” presumably Republican Kevin Horan.
White then asked, “anyone else?”
Without the momentarily delayed vote of the gentleman from Grenada, the bill would have passed by a one-vote margin instead of the two-vote difference. A tie vote would have been a rejection of the bill.
The bottom line is that White can say he did not apply pressure, as he told reporters after the vote earlier this month, but it was obvious he had a clear understanding of the members’ votes he needed to pass his signature bill for the 2026 session.
Being able to see the members vote on the giant screens can be a powerful influencer. Former House Speaker Billy McCoy used to say he lost only one vote as Education Committee chair. It was on a bill that allowed public schools to offer preschool classes. He said he lost the vote because then-Speaker Tim Ford held the machine open an unusual length of time and a handful of members got cold feet and changed their votes before Ford closed the machines. It is not likely that Ford was intentionally trying to sabotage the bill from McCoy, a fellow Democrat. After all, Ford voted for it.

After the closeness of the recent vote on the school choice/voucher proposal, it became questionable whether the bill would ever leave the House and advance to the Senate, where opposition to sending public funds to private schools seems even more intense.
The Mississippi Constitution gives any member the authority to hold a bill – after a final vote – on a procedural move called a motion to reconsider. The voucher bill was held on a motion, meaning it would require another majority vote to pass and advance to the Senate.
There was at least a little uncertainty on whether the bill could garner another majority. After all, two Republicans did not vote. One of them, Rep. Price Wallace of Mendenhall, said he was absent because of commitments on his family farm, but if he had been there he would have voted no. The other – Rep. Clay Deweese of Oxford – was apparently in the Capitol or close by, but did not vote.
It is not known for certain how he would have voted. But Bradley Roberson, the school superintendent in Deweese’s hometown of Oxford, has been a vocal opponent of spending public funds on private schools.
In the end, though, the motion to reconsider was disposed of on an anticlimactic voice vote and the bill was sent to the Senate.
It was a bit surprising to many that the opponents of the bill – all of the Democrats and 17 of White’s Republicans – did not demand a recorded vote that would have been visible on the two giant boards in the House chamber.
But, perhaps the thought was that at this point it was better to keep the coalition opposing the bill publicly together and not give someone, though White says it would not be him, the opportunity to twist arms to get additional votes for the bill.
The bottom line is if the bill passes the Senate there will be at least one other vote – perhaps multiple votes – on the bill in the House, and members already have taken a tough vote on the measure.
It is likely that if the Senate does kill the bill, White and his allies will attempt to amend another bill and reintroduce the school choice effort. Knowing that, perhaps members thought there was no need to have another tough vote this early in the session. Additional tough votes would come later.

Ask Julia Kern about her upcoming trip to Italy and she’ll talk up the appetizers and savory scenery. Then comes the main course — the one where she’ll compete alongside more than a dozen other athletes with Vermont ties at the 2026 Winter Olympics.
Like a majority of the state’s qualifying skiers for Alpine, biathlon, cross-country and freestyle events, Kern has attended the games before. But this time, the 28-year-old member of Stratton’s SMS T2 elite Nordic training team will be able to partake of the host country more easily than in the past.
“The last one was in lockdown during Covid,” Kern recently told VTDigger about her 2022 Olympic debut in Beijing, China. “All of us agree that wasn’t a normal experience.”

Alpine skiing will offer Vermonters the best chance to see a familiar face ascend a podium at the games Feb. 6-22 in the Italian competition centers of Milan and Cortina d’Ampezzo:

Mikaela Shiffrin, a 30-year-old graduate of Burke Mountain Academy, is aiming for a comeback after winning slalom gold in Sochi, Russia, in 2014 and giant slalom gold and alpine combined silver in Pyeongchang, South Korea, in 2018, only to fail to medal in 2022 and fall during the 2024 Killington World Cup.

Shiffrin has told the press she won’t compete in all six Olympic races like she did four years ago, but instead will focus on her current strongpoints: going down and around the gates in the slalom, giant slalom and team combined events.

Ryan Cochran-Siegle, 33, of Starksboro — whose mother, Barbara Ann Cochran of Richmond’s Cochran’s Ski Area, won slalom gold in 1972 — is returning to his third Olympics after scoring silver in the super-G (super giant slalom) in 2022.


Paula Moltzan, 31, a former University of Vermont NCAA champion, will be competing in her second Olympics, having just purchased her first house in Waitsfield.


Nina O’Brien, 28, a graduate of Burke Mountain Academy, will return to the games after scoring the sixth-fastest time in the first round of the 2022 giant slalom, only to crash and break her leg in the second run.


And Mary Bocock, a 22-year-old Dartmouth College graduate, will be making her Olympic debut as the daughter of a member of the Sullivan family of skiers from the Mount Snow region.

In cross-country skiing, Kern will be joined by four other athletes with state connections:

Jessie Diggins, a 34-year-old SMS T2 team member, is seeking to add to her medal count — she won U.S. Nordic’s first-ever gold in 2018 and a silver and bronze in 2022 — before wrapping up her racing career this March.

Diggins is expected to compete in all six Olympic cross-country events, which will require her to ski as little as 7.5 kilometers in one race and as many as 50 in another.

Ben Ogden, a 25-year-old University of Vermont graduate, will be representing his Bennington County hometown of Landgrove, population 177, for his second games. He’s expected to focus on his sport’s shorter sprint races.


Jack Young, 23, of Jay, will ski as part of Craftsbury’s Green Racing Project.


And Lauren Jortberg, a 28-year-old Dartmouth College graduate, will participate as a member of the Mansfield Nordic Pro Team.

Biathlon — a sport mixing skiing and shooting — will see the most Vermont representation, with four of the team’s eight racers connected to the state, including three who belong to its Army National Guard:

Deedra Irwin, a 33-year-old guard staff sergeant from Jericho, placed seventh in the 15-kilometer race during her first Olympics in 2022 — the best-ever finish for an American in an individual biathlon event.


Sean Doherty, a 30-year-old guard member, will be attending his fourth Olympics.

Two biathlon teammates will be making their Olympic debuts:

Margie Freed, a 28-year-old University of Vermont graduate, is a member of Craftsbury’s Green Racing Project.


And Maxime Germain, 24, is a guard aviation operations specialist.

(Biathlon alternates are Jake Brown, 33, of Craftsbury’s Green Racing Project, and Chloe Levins, 27, of Rutland.)
And in freestyle skiing:

Mac Forehand, a 24-year-old Stratton Mountain School graduate from Winhall, is set to offer acrobatic tricks, flips and spins in his second Olympics.


And Olivia Giaccio, 25, will hit the moguls course, having grown up skiing at Killington.

After the Covid-confined 2022 games, many Vermont athletes are planning to travel to Italy with family and friends. Kern is ready to show them her top speed.
“Then I’ll make sure to slow down,” she said, “to appreciate and share this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.”

In one Franklin County community, “everyone's got a story” about child care, a parent said.

Theo Wells-Spackman is a Report for America corps member who reports for VTDigger.
Nicole Streeter thought she’d had it tough when she found only minimal child care options for her daughter while living in North Hero. Then, she and her husband moved to Franklin County.
“There were no openings,” she said of child care operations around her new home in St. Albans Town. “We actually had to keep (our daughter enrolled) in Grand Isle County, so we were commuting over half an hour every day.”

To her, it seemed like word of mouth was now the only way to snag a decent spot for her child — and the place she finally found was a long time coming. Now, at 28, she’s expecting again, and options continue to be sparse. Toward the end of last year, she decided to quit her job (a decision also influenced by both care costs and return-to-office mandates for state employees, she said) and stay home with her daughter in preparation for the new baby. 
Streeter’s experience is far from unique, according to a study released this month by Vermont First Children’s Finance. While the state as a whole is showing clear progress in closing the gap between supply and demand when it comes to child care, a few counties — particularly in more rural areas — are lagging substantially. 
Since the passage of Act 76 expanded the state’s child care tuition assistance program in 2023, 50% more families are making use of its aid, according to a recent monitoring report from Building Bright Futures. Experts also told lawmakers this week that Vermont has seen 100 new child care programs open in the past three years, and 1,700 new child care slots have become available.
But Franklin and Essex counties, in Vermont’s rural Northeast Kingdom, show outstanding need more than double that of counties further south; both show that demand is over three times higher than the supply of child care slots. Orange County is also an outlier at more than 2.5 kids per available slot, compared with Chittenden or Bennington counties with less than 1.5.
In keeping with past reports from Let’s Grow Kids, the advocacy nonprofit that closed its doors this fall, First Children’s Finance sought data that focused on the gap between supply and demand in child care with a focus on workforce implications. The count of care slots only included full-time, year-round programs that would allow their parents to remain in the workforce. The team calculated need in each county based on the number of children in the appropriate age range who do not have a stay-at-home guardian.
Erin Roche, who leads Vermont First Children’s Finance, acknowledged the scale of regional imbalance was “a little surprising,” and said the causes may be complex. It’s something her office has been specifically working to solve recently, she said, as it distributes development grants to individual providers on behalf of the state.
“We have prioritized counties that have larger gaps than others in terms of funding,” she said. 
Her team also plans to begin more targeted promotion of those opportunities in areas like Franklin County.
For parents like Chris Carter, 42, such efforts are welcome.
Both of Carter’s children experienced issues with the quality of their care after moving from center to suboptimal center in the St. Albans-Fairfax area as infants, he said. A yearslong search he called “a nightmare” involved the Colchester-based Little Saplings being shut down by the state amid fraud allegations in late 2024, as was reported by Seven Days.
“I think a big part of the problem here is staff — finding quality staff,” Carter said. 
Earlier this week, advocates expressed similar concerns in Montpelier, and pushed lawmakers to pass a bill that would change the state’s approach to licensing individual child care workers.
Carter’s younger child, 2, still commutes to Chittenden County for care. In his community, Carter said, “everyone’s got a story” about child care.

‘Very slim to none’
Providers in Franklin County are feeling the strain — long waitlists weigh against a dearth of qualified employees.
Paulette Fedorishen, longtime director of Little Shepherd Child Care in St. Albans, said she has a waitlist of about 30 families looking for infant care alone. Parents commonly call before the child is born, she said, because otherwise, “the odds of you getting a spot are very slim to none.”
Several care providers told VTDigger about a bottleneck around care of very young children stemming from particular restrictions on in-home providers, as well as tighter rules in general surrounding staff-to-child ratios and group size.
Preschool slots, Fedorishen said, are much more widely available due to opportunities created by the state’s universal pre-K program. Her enrollments in that age group are “stagnant” by comparison, she added.
Fedorishen operates her center with 38 full-time slots, well under its licensed capacity, but said she has to turn parents away “all the time.” She needs to hedge her bets, she said, due to “never knowing if (we’re) going to have enough staff.”
Population density is also an important factor in determining pressure on or opportunity for particular businesses, some providers said. Franklin County’s relative concentration of child care facilities near St. Albans, its largest city, is a pattern that has appeared elsewhere in the state, with some educators moving away from rural areas to improve enrollment and make ends meet.
Suzy’s Little Peanuts, a small chain of child care centers, recently closed locations in Brookline and Bellows Falls due to rising costs and lower demand.
“Brookline was kind of in the middle of nowhere, so we didn’t have as high of enrollment that we wanted,” said Kayla Gralia, the Springfield location director.
The business’ new location in Brattleboro opened on Monday, and though enrollments are starting slowly, Gralia said she expects the center to be at capacity soon.
“Brattleboro will probably be one of our most successful sites,” she said.
While Windham County appears better placed in Roche’s study than Franklin and other counties further north, demand for care slots still exceeds supply by over 100%.
Roche said child care in Vermont may be entering a new phase in which advocates and grant administrators should look to solve particular deficits in particular communities.
“We’re not quite there,” she said of developing such a county or town-specific strategy, but “I think that’s where we’re going.”
It might not just be about investment, Roche said — some communities use alternatives to full-time child care more often based on their particular demands. Essex County in particular has an unusually large proportion of part-time care providers.
“Every family is different, and every child has different needs,” she said.

The vote, which was held after 30% of union members brought a petition, was 73-38 to maintain the union, a slightly wider margin of support than the initial vote to form the union in 2024.

This story by Aaron Calvin was first published in News & Citizen on Jan. 22, 2026.
Just over a year after they first voted to form a labor union, Copley Hospital workers voted to continue the union in a rare decertification vote, which, if successful, would have led to its dissolution.
The Copley support staff voted last Wednesday 73-38 to maintain the union, in a secret ballot election supervised by the National Labor Review Board. The vote showed a slightly wider margin of support than the initial vote to form a union in November 2024, where support for organizing was 68-44.

The vote was held after 30% of union members brought a petition to force another vote on the matter. This came following a year of slow-moving contract negotiations and a pay increase offer from hospital administration for non-union employees.
“Our coworkers spoke clearly today. We voted to stay organized, to fight for a livable wage and fight for a fair contract so we can provide the best care to our patients and the community,” Sarah Bray, a member of the support staff at Mansfield Orthopedics in Waterbury, said in a statement after the vote results were announced last Thursday, Jan. 15.
“We respect the democratic process that played out and the decision employees made against decertification of their union,” Wayne Stockbridge, chief of administration and human resources at Copley, said in a statement following the vote. “While we had hoped to return to a direct working relationship, we accept the outcome of the vote. Our priority now is to move forward constructively and collaboratively.”
Though Copley officials have emphasized in public statements that this push for a new referendum was enacted on unionized employees’ “own accord” and that a year of contract negotiations with the support staff union was done “in good faith,” internal and public communications leading up to the vote indicated hospital administration would strongly prefer the employees not be unionized.
Following the successful union drive at the end of 2024 — the vote was held after a year of organizing by staff and the Northeast Nurses Union to address issues around growing disparity and benefits, and seeing the protections enjoyed by their nursing colleagues, who have been unionized since 1997 — support staff entered into contract negotiations with hospital administration.
For eight months, these negotiations proceeded slowly, with much time spent constructing a fair wage scale, something Bray said the hospital did not have in place for support staff.
Then, in an Aug. 11 internal memo, Copley CEO Joe Woodin put additional pressure on contract negotiations by announcing a 5% raise for hospital staff, but not for union employees, as “union members follow the guidelines outlined in the contract or are subject to union agreements with current negotiations.”
Woodin did not comment for this story.
Bray said she believed frustration around the length of the contract negotiations and the timing of the announcement that support staff were not receiving a 5% raise led to the decertification petition.
“The staff, I think in general, are frustrated with the fact that it’s hard enough to survive on what we make already, given the rising cost of living,” Bray said. “That 5% makes a big difference for people over the years, and we want to make sure that that’s something we get every year, at least.”
While nearly a third of Copley support staff were required to hold a decertification vote, hospital administration did not shy away from voicing their support for their staff hoping to return to business as usual.
After the initial unionization effort, the Northeast Nurses Association submitted multiple complaints to the National Labor Review Board, alleging that Copley administration had violated the National Labor Relations Act and unlawfully fired two employees for engaging in unionization activities.
Woodin said at the time that he had resolved these complaints with the NLRB. A request for comment from the board was directed to the Office of Congressional and Public Affairs, which did not return a request for comment.
On Dec. 30, Stockbridge sent out a memo emphasizing that not including union staff in the 5% raise was “not a punishment but a legal requirement.”
He added that first contract negotiations often take well over a year and would likely continue to drag on if the union was not decertified.
He also emphasized the cost of union dues to employees as the downsides of a seniority-based promotion system favored by unions, as opposed to Copley’s focus on “individual performance and the ability to work flexibly with our team.”
“We believe the relationship Copley has with our employees is stronger, more productive, and more responsive without a union,” Stockbridge wrote in the Dec. 30 memo, noting benefits employees were previously offered, like gift cards for local businesses during the holiday.
“We strive to treat our employees fairly without the need for a third party,” he wrote.
On the eve of the decertification vote, the hospital published a public letter from interim Chief Operating Officer Carol Ferrante that encouraged support staff to “make your decision based on what is best for your own personal interest and your family,” claiming again that unions privilege seniority, not merit, when it comes to promotions.
“I feel very strongly that promotions and opportunities should be based on merit. If we are bound by rigid union rules regarding seniority, we lose the flexibility to reward the individuals who are working the hardest to make Copley great,” she wrote.
Most of the hospital’s support staff were apparently not convinced.
“The outcome reinforces what support staff have said consistently since organizing: They are seeking a contract that delivers fair wages, transparency, and the resources necessary to provide quality patient care,” Katie Doodie, a regional organizer for the Northeast Nurses Association, wrote in a statement following the vote. “Workers say today’s election result is a clear signal to management to come to the table promptly and negotiate in good faith to reach agreement.”

Smile
Jordan Kramer, 15, Hinesburg
The last thing that brought a smile to my lips was a school hallway interaction. A girl I’d never seen before passed by me, and gave me the biggest smile. It quite literally felt like sunlight seeping into my core. Even after she had passed me, there was still a trace of a smile on my face. And that reminded me of something.
When I was little, I used to play a game with my sister where we would take our bicycles around
Burlington. The game went like this: Each person who smiled back at us on the bike path was worth one point, and we would compete to get the most points. We would smile hugely until our face muscles felt tight.
I remember how much my own smile and my sister’s would tint my day with joy. What a beautiful time.

Josh Shapiro addressed mounting fear about immigration enforcement tactics Saturday hours after federal agents shot and killed another person in Minneapolis amid escalating confrontations with the city’s residents, government and public safety officials. 
“What we are seeing in Minnesota is absolutely unacceptable,” Shapiro said. “It is so dangerous, not just for Minnesota, but for the entire country. … What’s happening in Minneapolis could happen here in Philadelphia, or in Pittsburgh, or in Lancaster, or in other communities across our commonwealth. And I will just tell you this: We are prepared for that.”
Shapiro spoke in response to a submitted question about what he’s doing to keep Pennsylvanians safe from Immigration and Customs Enforcement during a book signing at Parkway Central Library in Philadelphia.  Just outside, on a historically cold afternoon, hundreds of people rallied in protest of ICE’s surge in several states in recent months – and what they’ve said has been silence and inaction from the governor as he launches a re-election campaign.  Shapiro is also mentioned as a potential Democratic candidate for president.

Andrew Lefkowitz, of Montgomery County, came into the city for the event organized by advocacy groups including the Pennsylvania Immigration Coalition and Council on Islamic Relations.
Lefkowitz, 32, said he wanted to protest test the governor “not really doing much about ICE in Pennsylvania.” Although, the inaction isn’t limited to Shapiro, he added. 
“Democratic leadership … they’re throwing up their hands and saying, ‘Oh, well, you know, not much we can do. We’re doing our best,’” said Lefkowitz, an activist who’s been helping people and their families find legal assistance and other support when they’re arrested by ICE. “They’re trying to play by the rules. And Trump is throwing the rules out the window.”
Lefkowitz said he felt a particular sense of urgency Saturday after learning a U.S. Border Patrol officer had shot and killed 37-year-old intensive care unit nurse Alex Pretti in Minneapolis. It was the second fatal shooting since the Department of Homeland Security started deploying thousands of immigration officers last month to the Twin Cities region and beyond. 
Last week, the death of 37-year-old Renee Good was ruled a homicide. And details emerged about the DHS memo laying out a legal argument to justify warrantless forced entry to people’s homes.  
Shapiro said Saturday his administration is doing “tabletop exercises” and planning.

“We are working with our partners at the local level and where we can at the federal level to ensure their safety, and to ensure that we can continue to keep and build bonds and trust that exist, … and not have it eroded by the federal government sending in ICE against the wishes of the mayor or against the wishes of the governor,” he said.
Shapiro also said “we do not do ICE’s work for them here in Pennsylvania.”
“Our state police [don’t] ask for people’s status and we do not share any of that information with the federal government,” he said. 
Advocates, however, have flagged a couple loopholes in the Pennsylvania State Police’s civil immigration law enforcement policy that they say need to be closed, which would all but sever communication with ICE. It’s one in a list of executive actions they say the governor should take to protect immigrants and the general public amid the Trump administration’s enforcement surge. 
Meanwhile, dozens of the commonwealth’s other law enforcement agencies – local police, constables and county jails and sheriffs departments – have contracts formalizing ICE cooperation. 
Known as 287(g) agreements, they delegate to local law enforcement ICE tasks and responsibilities that differ depending on the type of agreement in place. The most common one among Pennsylvania law enforcement agencies, by far, is a task force model. It affords the most authority of three 287(g) types, empowering trained officers to carry out enforcement actions such as making civil immigration arrests, collecting evidence for deportation cases and issuing requests to other agencies to detain people for suspected immigration violations. 
Those agreements would be banned or restricted by proposals being developed in the state legislature modeled after laws already in place in some other states.

(Photo by Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)Lawmakers lodging complaints to Arkansas’ colleges and universities isn’t necessarily anything new. Legislators have no qualms telling school leaders when they or their constituents are displeased.
In recent years, it’s likely had more to do with football coaches than law school deans.
But the swiftness by which the University of Arkansas withdrew its offer to incoming Law School Dean Emily Suski is a sign of the new reality for higher education in the state. And it signals to lawmakers how quickly schools could bow to pressure.
The UA’s about-face has become the latest flashpoint over academic freedom as schools around the country face increased Republican scrutiny, from President Donald Trump down to state officials. 
The backlash over the school’s decision to withdraw Suski’s offer has created unwanted headlines nationally for the UA. Closer to home, the decision prompted a walkout by students and sparked fears from professors about their own freedom of speech.
An Arkansas Supreme Court decision last year that could open the door to the Legislature taking further control over higher education and direct say over hiring and firing officials.
The court unanimously ruled last year that the Legislature has the authority to scale back constitutional amendments that were proposed and approved by the people. 
Most of the attention following that decision was on progressive measures the state had approved because of citizen initiatives, including the 2016 amendment that legalized medical marijuana. The ruling raised concern among groups that have been trying to put proposals on the ballot dealing with redistricting and reproductive rights. 
But it might also mean the Legislature can revisit the constitutional amendment that was aimed at giving higher education the kind of independence that Suski’s defenders say is now at risk.
That amendment, also known as Amendment 33, was ratified in 1942 in response to a different kind of political meddling. The University of Arkansas back then faced the ire of Democratic Gov. Homer Adkins and his efforts to fire then-president and eventual U.S. senator J. William Fulbright.
In a bit of irony, it was another law school dean who took center stage in that fight over higher education’s independence. Then, it was Robert Leflar.
Even before the court’s ruling on constitutional amendments last year, the Legislature had a political advantage that was clear. 
Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders has made targeting “indoctrination” at all levels of education a clear priority. That line of attack has found favor with legislators, especially those facing primary fights in March. 
The UA’s flagship school had already taken steps that appeared to be in response to higher ed’s role as a culture war battleground. That includes the school’s decision to close its diversity, equity and inclusion office in 2023. Late last year, the school removed the head of its Middle East Studies office over comments made about Israel.
The school’s posting of Ten Commandments displays on the Fayetteville campus — in compliance with a 2025 state law — led an alumnus to pull two scholarships he had funded.
Republicans hold an overwhelming majority that could turn the normal holds on budgets that are a headache for schools and other state agencies into an outright nightmare when the fiscal session begins in April.
The challenge facing UA leaders is how they can reassure nervous faculty and students that they’re not effectively handing over every administrative decision to lawmakers. Or that faculty’s curriculum vitae won’t be scoured for any material politically unpopular in a deeply Republican state.
At the same time, they’ll have to provide that reassurance in a way that doesn’t threaten opening up a deeper fight with the Legislature over who controls the higher education system.

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/25/susan-keane-ct-retires/,"Keane, the recently retired senior administrator of the Appropriations Committee, leaves a legacy as a fierce advocate for public access.","For the past four decades, Susan Keane has helped to shape Connecticut’s schools and communities, health care and social programs, transportation systems and environment.
Few people noticed.
In many ways the behind-the-scenes chief architect of the state’s budget adoption process, Keane has piloted dozens of legislatures through the labyrinthine task of crafting the multibillion plans that guide so much of life here.
Whether shepherding hundreds of bills, overseeing months of public hearings, arranging research or preserving records, Keane has been the one constant in a process in perpetual flux.
But when the General Assembly convenes its next regular session on Feb. 4, Keane — for the first time in 43 years — won’t be there.
The recently retired senior administrator of the Appropriations Committee leaves an overarching legacy as the model of nonpartisan support that drives democracy, as a fierce advocate for public access and as a trainer to countless staff, legislators and lobbyists.
I feel I have an obligation to make that process as open to the general public as the joint rules will allow.Susan Keane
Keane, 69, who stepped down in late November due to health issues, will be missed for her sharp Irish wit and fiery red hair — not to mention a deep appreciation for music and dance.
“The genuine calmness under pressure, being precise without being rigid, and being deeply respectful to people at every level,” Taylor Aitken of Lebanon, who succeeds Keane, said of her mentor. “She made people feel, whatever question you came to her with, that you mattered. You don’t replace someone like Susan. You carry forward what she’s built.”
“She will be missed by people who never even experienced her,” said Sen. Gary Winfield, a New Haven Democrat and veteran member of the Appropriations Committee. “Her role wasn’t just the committee administrator. Her role was the thread who ties through everything.”
Open, accessible government comes first
The “everything” that Keane tried to preserve was nothing less than Connecticut’s legislative process, from the smallest proposal to the $27.2 billion spending plan lawmakers approved last June for the current fiscal year.
“My philosophy was always to be the ultimate facilitator of moving bills properly,” Keane said. “That’s the bottom line. That’s my north star, the process of good government.”
By far the most grueling of legislative committees, Appropriations has 12 subcommittees and, at any given time, several other affiliated working groups or task forces.
In the final weeks of the legislative session, leaders negotiate a budget with the governor’s staff, a process that can take weeks or months, marked by days that start mid-morning and end well after midnight.
Sue Keane [was] the person who operated the nuclear power plant and never allowed it to melt down.Spencer Cain, state fiscal analyst
Proposals offered in the middle of the night often must be ready for a vote within a day.
“Many people likened Sue Keane to the person who kept the trains running on time,” said Spencer Cain, a state fiscal analyst for three decades prior to his retirement in 2009. “But I likened Sue Keane to the person who operated the nuclear power plant and never allowed it to melt down.”
For Keane, “good government” goes way beyond keeping good records and facilitating legislators’ research. It involves linking residents with their government.
That means given people access to public records — even if state officials prefer otherwise, said Betty Gallo, a lobbyist for more than 40 years who retired in 2018.
“If she could possibly give [a budget document] to me, she gave it to me,” Gallo said. “She never said ‘I don’t have time,’ or ‘I’m not going to get that, it’s too much trouble.’”
But Keane was better known for making face-to-face connections happen.
That means everyone gets a chance to testify before legislators. If special technology, unconventional hours or other adjustments must be made, so be it.
People with mental illness might not be able to stay long in a crowded hearing room. And if so, others — including state officials — might have to wait for their chance to speak with the committee.
“I feel I have an obligation to make that process as open to the general public as the joint rules will allow,” Keane said. “And that’s one of the things that I’m most proud of.”
Regardless of the logistics, “she always made it work,” said Rep. Toni E. Walker, a New Haven Democrat and current House chair of the Appropriations Committee who said Keane clearly loved the challenge. “And you could see her wheels turning. Her right hand would start going like she was pounding out a beat in her mind.”
Never one to shrink from a challenge
Not shrinking from a challenge was a virtue instilled in Keane by some of her earliest mentors.
Born Susan Ann Keane in June 1959 on Capitol Avenue in Hartford, just a few minutes from gold-domed building that would dominate her career, she would learn from her father, John, that a polite joke and a smile can turn back many aggressive people.
“I can dish as well as I can be served,” she said.
She spent most of her childhood just east of the Connecticut River, graduating from Manchester High School before attending the University of Hartford, where she learned about a Capitol internship.
Not intending to work in government but thinking it could be interesting, she decided to try.
Her compassion and empathy transcended the legislative process.Vincent J. Candelora, House Minority Leader
After two years of assisting Rep. Thom Serrani of Stamford, then co-chair of the Transportation Committee, he asked her to remain on as clerk. Keane accepted but had no interest in “the money committees” because they “used to kill all of the transportation bills.”
That changed in 1983 term when “my legislative godmother,” Secretary of the State Julia Tashjian, insisted Keane drop her grudge and interview to clerk the Appropriations Committee.
After five minutes with that group’s House chair, Waterford Democrat Janet Polinsky, Keane was hooked for life.
“Janet and I clicked immediately, like a bolt of lightning struck, and I don’t say that lightly,” she said.
Keane loved Polinsky’s insistence on inclusiveness, respect for the governor down to the most obscure staffer, and zero tolerance for those disrespectful to rank-and-file workers.
If lobbyists or politicians sought a meeting with Polinsky, Keane said, “She would look at me and say: ‘Do we like them?’ And that was Janet’s code for, ‘Are they good to you?’”
Though also protective of staff, Keane shies away from confrontations.
Though she likes being called “Susan” and “cherishes” being named after her grandmother, Keane says nothing when many at the Capitol call her “Sue” because “I’m uncomfortable correcting people.”
Her desk is the building’s unofficial “therapy room,” Aitken said. Gallo occasionally found excuses to visit the Appropriations Committee office, just to run into Keane. “She was one of those people, when you have a bad day, you would just drop by,” Gallo said. “You’d feel better when you left. And that’s not a small skill.”
‘Lucy and Ethel’ of the General Assembly
Still, there was one type of friction Keane always relished: between Appropriations and its opposite number, the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee. One group figures out how government spends money, the other how it raises it.
House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, who spent most of his career on Finance said Appropriations — which hears countless impassioned pleas from program advocates seeking funding — is often called the “feeling committee.” Those on Finance, though, are members of the “thinking committee.”
But Candelora says no one is held in higher respect than Keane. 
“Her compassion and empathy transcended the legislative process,” he added.
Keane appreciated Candelora’s praise but said he’s wrong about the two committees.
“Despite what Finance thinks, Appropriations is the most unique committee in the legislature,” she said. “That’s gospel, my friend.”
Ironically, Keane’s closest friend during her legislative career was Mary Finnegan of South Windsor, senior administrator of the Finance Committee for most of her 37-year career until her retirement in 2014.
“For a good year, I felt like I was missing a piece of me” after Finnegan left, Keane said.
She made sure that [the governor’s staff] and the committee were able to work through all our differences and learn to respect one another.Ben Barnes, budget director for former Gov. Dannel P. Malloy
Both hold the legislative process and public access in the highest regard. Neither suffer fools gladly.
For decades, legislative leaders called upon both senior administrators to train new staff, new legislators and lobbyists, a job for which Keane was perfect.
“She was definitely a feeler,” Finnegan said. “She was very supportive of people. She formed relationships.”
In the 1980s and ’90s, when the legislature hosted huge parties in the Capitol shortly after the session’s midnight adjournment, Keane and Finnegan were the chief organizers.
“We were like the hostess with the most-est,” Finnegan said, adding that Keane, an accomplished Irish step dancer, “could cut a rug.”
But none, Finnegan added, could match Keane’s encyclopedic knowledge of music, whether classical, big band, jazz, pop, rock or hip-hop.
The duo, because of their camaraderie and similar passions, became known as “Lucy and Ethel,” though it never was entirely clear who was who.
Keane shared Lucille Ball’s red hair, but modestly insists Finnegan, like Lucy, “was the alpha.”
It mattered little. Both women insist the other was the consummate friend and public servant. And no challenge was so great it could withstand their combined efforts.
“Do you have time to meet me at the railing?” was code, Keane said, for meeting on an upper floor of the Legislative Office Building, “consoling one another, solving the world’s problems.”
Avoiding partisanship – but not laughter
But despite her passion for work, Keane found time to enjoy the Capitol’s lighter moments.
Former House Minority Leader Lawrence Cafero, a Norwalk Republican who retired in 2016, recalled at least one time Keane allowed a huge break in her focused demeanor during a committee meeting. But it took a highly atypical topic: whether to fund a new state ranger to monitor flocks of free-range chickens.
“I think I blurted out, ‘There’s a post you don’t see at the job fair in high school,’” Cafero told the Connecticut Mirror. “She just lost it. She had to literally excuse herself from the room. When she came back, she sat down — and lost it again.”
Superior Court Judge Robert Genuario, a Norwalk Republican who spent a more than a decade in the Senate and on Appropriations in the 1990s and 2000s, credits Keane’s sense of humor with averting a budget crisis in 1995.
With Republicans holding the Senate for the first time in a decade and Democrats the House, both entered the final days of the session agreeing on spending for health care, education and other core programs while lowering taxes one year down the road.
But they couldn’t decide which chamber and party would get to adopt the new budget first.
It’s critical that we maintain that sense of objectivity, which sometimes flies in the face of being human.Susan Keane
Keane, whose committee staffed those negotiations, “just started laughing like it was nobody’s business,” Genuario said. “All of these weighty issues that impact people in their daily lives, and we got stuck on … inside baseball.”
But it was her laughter that showed legislators their stubbornness, Genuario said, adding the House got the first vote and Connecticut got its tax break.
 “It strikes me as indicative of her ability to respect all people … not to take sides, but pave the way for a good working environment,” he said.
Keane also refused to be adversarial with the Executive Branch, said Ben Barnes, who was Gov. Dannel P. Malloy’s budget director from 2011 through 2018.
“As much as anyone, she made sure that [the governor’s staff] and the committee were able to work through all our differences and learn to respect one another,” he said.
Keane could work with anyone who respected her allegiance to an open and fair legislative process, said New Haven Democrat Bill Dyson, who served 32 years in the legislature through 2008 and co-chaired the Appropriations Committee for much of that time.
She was the glue that sort of held everything together.Former Sen. Toni Harp, D-New Haven
“She had a certain aura about her work that was beneficial,” he said. “Once you knew she was serious, she was easy to get along with. You do what you’re supposed to do.”
But there was one time Keane found it hard to remain silent as others debated issues.
Her son, Daniel, is on the autism spectrum, and Keane recalled a debate in the early 2010s over whether to increase funding for mental health supports.
At the urging of Sen. Toni Harp, a New Haven Democrat and co-chairwoman of Appropriations at the time, Keane agreed to share with legislators the challenges, “the journey” her son and family faced. But that was it.
“That was the hardest thing for me,” she said, but as a nonpartisan staffer, “it’s critical that we maintain that sense of objectivity, which sometimes flies in the face of being human.”
Harp said Keane’s dedication to her role was unmatched. “She just knew all the rules,” Harp said. “She was the glue that sort of held everything together.”
COVID presented the ultimate test
Keane faced one of her greatest challenges in March 2020 when the General Assembly closed its regular session two months early with the coronavirus’ arrival. Although leaders planned to reconvene the 2021 session on time the following January, it soon became clear that most residents wouldn’t be vaccinated by then.
Legislators needed safe access to their constituents and to each other, but the heart of committee work — public hearings, orderly debate and voting — had to be preserved.
Keane, who says she was cursed with “lousy gene pools” and has battled Bell’s palsy, heart disease, and sleep apnea, feared for herself, other legislative staffers and for their family members who might be infected through second-hand exposure.
But when legislative leaders tasked her with developing new procedures for all committees, she also saw an opportunity to deliver a more open government long after the COVID outbreak slowed.
“This idea of expanding access to people has been percolating in my head for decades,” she added.
Remote online hearings, once considered unwieldy at best and unworkable at worst, became possible.
The legislature increased its reliance on The Connecticut Network, its 24-hour cable television and internet news service that records countless events at the Capitol and Legislative Office Building. Meanwhile, Keane created numerous YouTube channels to serve the committees.
Procedures were created to allow remote constituent testimony. And the voting process was deliberately slowed to allow each legislator in remote attendance to first show their face on camera, state their name, and then cast their vote.
Her legacy is woven into the building.Taylor Aitken, incoming senior administrator of appropriations committee
Lawmakers often forgot one step or another at first in a voting process that already could get complicated quickly by amendments and other special rules.
Keane steered them back gently but relentlessly, part operatic conductor, part Simon Says leader.
“Are you on [camera] yet?” was a common response to lawmakers who tried to vote remotely with sound on but camera off. “I know you’re trying.”
When Rep. Tammy Nuccio, R-Tolland, once got confused and addressed Keane as the “chairwoman” of the committee, the senior administrator smiled and said, “Why thank you, madame” for the promotion.
But those changes took hold, and now most committees operate in hybrid fashion, allowing remote or in-person attendance, something Walker said has greatly improved attendance and facilitated scheduling.
Finnegan said only Keane could have developed that new system — and kept legislators from rejecting it. “She is incredibly creative,” Finnegan said. “I kept watching it on TV saying, ‘I would kill myself.’ That was a tremendous load of work. … She was the go-to person.”
Finding time for family, leaving a legacy
Finnegan also marveled that Keane, despite carrying a weekly workload that often exceeded 70 or 80 hours, found time for family.
Keane met her husband, Vincent Mazzotta, when he represented Portland and Cromwell in the House of Representatives in the late 1980s. They married in 1993, years after he had left General Assembly. Besides their son, they also have a daughter.
And though Keane lives in nearby East Hartford, she said her family sometimes sacrificed because she couldn’t get home soon enough.
“There were concerts and plays that were missed,” she said. “They went to bed without being tucked in by their mom, having a story read or getting a good night kiss. And that took a toll.”
But when the legislative session was over, Keane said, everything took a back seat to family.
There were frequent vacations to Cape Cod, “which is our favorite place on earth,” and lots of “unstructured time” that was just about being together.  “There were days we didn’t get out of our pajamas,” she said. “There were times we had what we called a ‘totally chocolate dinner.'”
“You can never recapture what was lost, but you can find a way to make memories, and I worked very hard to do that for my children.”
Legislators knew how many priorities Keane juggled for years, Candelora said, adding they couldn’t resent their workloads when they saw how she handled hers, day after day.
“She always set the tone with a smile,” he said.
Keane’s example and dedication, Aitken added, is as much her legacy as the knowledge she shared with so many, or the budgets and countless other bills she helped legislators produce.
“Her legacy is woven into the building,” she added. “If you worked in the legislature or adjacent, there’s a very good chance you learned something from Susan.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026_0109_SR_SusanKeane_085-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-25 05:57:50.481675

As costs rise, residents need flexible, affordable options that support their daily lives.","For most of us, the phone in our pocket has quietly become the center of daily life. It’s how we manage work schedules, school updates, medical appointments, transportation, and the constant stream of communication that keeps a household running. In Connecticut, where communities range from dense suburban neighborhoods to more rural stretches, staying reliably connected isn’t just convenient, it’s essential.
Yet the cost of that connection has steadily climbed. Families are stretching budgets to cover multiple lines. Young adults entering the workforce are navigating rising living expenses with little room for unexpected bills. Seniors, many of whom now rely on mobile devices for telehealth and staying in touch with loved ones, are finding that dependable service can feel like a luxury rather than a given. And in areas where coverage is inconsistent, even the most basic tasks (confirming an appointment, checking a bus schedule, receiving a school alert) can become unexpectedly difficult.
These challenges don’t always make headlines, but they shape the rhythm of everyday life. More households are relying on mobile service as their primary connection to work, school, and healthcare, even as costs continue to rise. When mobile service becomes too expensive or unreliable, the effects ripple outward, a missed job opportunity, a delayed message from a child’s teacher, a dropped telehealth call. The small disruptions add up.

That’s why the conversation around mobile affordability matters so much right now. Residents need options that reflect the realities of modern life: plans that don’t force them into paying for more than they use, coverage that supports them whether they’re at home or on the go, and service that adapts to the needs of families, singles, seniors, and everyone in between.
Cox Mobile is one of the providers working to meet those needs by rethinking how mobile service can fit into people’s lives. Instead of one‑size‑fits‑all plans, Cox Mobile offers flexible options that allow residents to choose what works for them, whether that’s a predictable monthly rate for a busy household or a lower‑usage plan for someone who simply needs reliable connectivity without the financial strain. For many, it’s the ability to stay connected without paying for data they don’t use. For others, it’s the reassurance that their mobile service will support virtual appointments, job applications, or school communication without interruption.

These kinds of choices matter. They give residents more control over their budgets and their connectivity, and they help ensure that staying connected doesn’t become another source of stress. As Connecticut continues to evolve and the demand for connectivity increases, the importance of accessible, dependable mobile service will only grow. It supports workforce participation, strengthens family communication, and helps residents navigate the demands of a fast‑moving world.

When people can stay connected without financial strain, the benefits extend far beyond the device itself. It’s about stability, opportunity, and the ability to participate fully in daily life, no matter where you live or what stage of life you’re in.

And of time, memory, and knowing when to let go.
On the last long trip in our old Jeep I topped a hill west of Meade in southwest Kansas one evening and was buffeted by the wake of a double tractor-trailer going the opposite direction. Trucks on that stretch of U.S. 54 Highway don’t dawdle, and the turbulence rattled my hood so hard that the exterior latch on the passenger’s side came loose. I cursed and pulled the Jeep over at a wide spot on the shoulder, put the gearshift in neutral, and set the parking brake. Then I got out to inspect the damage.
Owners of older Jeeps might know the weird hood flutter endemic to the vehicle. There’s a center latch underneath that keeps the hood from flying up and smacking the windshield, but there are two outside latches that keep the corners of the hood more or less secure.
On this particular model of Jeep, a 2010 Wrangler JK, the straps of the stock hood latches are made of rubber, which stretch as they age and make the hood flutter more severe. After a few years, the rubber breaks, which makes for an unpleasant highway experience, and you also lose some hardware. During the life of the Jeep, I had replaced the latch-strap combination at least three times.
I finally tried an aftermarket all-aluminum latch, which took an hour in the driveway and resulted in skinned knuckles from jamming wrenches inside the fender to reach some of the nuts, but I hadn’t gotten the tension right, which put me on the side of the road dealing with the problem. I didn’t have the right hex wrenches, or enough daylight left, for a permanent fix. So I resorted to a temporary repair.

In past years, I’d used an assortment of bits and bobs to secure broken hood latches while on the road, including once using an old fishing stringer. I had since learned to keep a small roll of baling wire in the back. As I finished up the temporary repair and snipped off the excess wire with the cutter on a pair of needle nose pliers, I looked back down the highway toward Meade and saw the all-but-full moon just above the lonely horizon.
In the other direction, the setting sun was a blazing beacon.
It was Tuesday, Nov. 4, 2025.
The juxtaposition of sun and moon seemed significant.
I was on my way to the Oklahoma panhandle to research a forthcoming book, and even before I left home, I was having jitters about the fitness of the 15-year-old Jeep to make the journey.
The engine was still good, but the clutch was beginning to slip after nearly 180,000 miles. The passenger side headlight sometimes winked out, but thumping it usually brought it back. There was a Christmas tree of warning lights on the dash from an ABS module that had failed, and I had spent much of the last month haunting dealerships in various towns across eastern Kansas in a vain attempt to find one in stock. The part appeared to be on permanent backorder. The brakes still worked, but I didn’t have any of the fancy stuff like traction control. The factory CD player in the dash had stopped working about a decade ago, the passenger’s side heater didn’t work, and a rear main engine seal was leaking, requiring me to add a quart of 5W-20 every couple of thousand miles.
Perhaps worst of all, a driver in a Dodge truck had failed to yield at an intersection during a September trip to Texas and struck us a glancing blow, creasing the driver’s side rear quarter panel and shattering the plastic fender flare. I had gotten a replacement fender from eBay and attached it with fasteners from Harbor Freight, but there was still the smear of green paint from the Durango on the Jeep’s silver panel.
It was the only mishap in the Jeep, and it scared me and Kim badly. The Dodge had come from behind a semi into our lane, and although I steered far enough over to prevent tragedy, there was still contact, accompanied by a loud bang and flying debris. Nobody was hurt in the collision, but it was a lesson in mortality. If my reaction had been a split-second later, if the point of contact with the Durango had only been a few inches ahead, it would have been grim.
For years we’d had a sense of safety in the Wrangler, but the cold equations of physics had allowed us a glimpse of the catastrophe possible in meeting a bad driver at the wrong time. I developed a fear of passing semis because you never can tell what’s lurking on the other side, but that feeling eventually passed. The Wrangler was old and battered, but it had kept us safe in the only accident we’d had in 14 years of marriage.
But as I stood at the side of the road, at the crest of the hill outside Meade, I finally admitted to myself that the silver Jeep had likely reached the end of its useful life as a highway vehicle. It was a realization I had been resisting because the Jeep wasn’t just a vehicle. It had become a four-wheel-drive icon of freedom to roam. I’ve driven Jeeps daily since 1999. If you’d like to know the story of the first military Jeep sold to civilians after World War II, you can find it here. Jeeps are noisy, finicky, and sometimes just plain trouble, but there’s no substitute for authenticity or trail-worthiness. I’d had the silver Jeep, the 2010, the longest of any, and it took us from Sacramento to upstate New York and just about everywhere in between.
There’s not a corner of Kansas we didn’t visit in the silver Jeep from home base in east central Kansas, and the towns we explored were a lesson in state history: Arkansas City, Atchison, Cherryvale, Colby, Coffeyville, Cottonwood Falls, Council Grove, Dodge City, Elkhart, Fort Scott, Garden City, Greensburg, Hays, Iola, Lawrence, Leavenworth, Lecompton, Liberal, Lucas, Lyons, Manhattan, Marion, Newton, Peabody, Kansas City, Osawatomie, Shawnee Mission, Topeka, Wamego, Wichita and many others.

I know the Jeep was not a living thing, but an object. Yet those two round headlights reminded me so much of a horse it was easy to forget. I sometimes found myself patting a fender of the Wrangler in the way you would an animal. Kim tells me that I tend to get along better with machines than people — automobiles, guitars and amplifiers, ham radios, old stereos — and that is true enough. It isn’t the machines themselves I am fascinated with, but in the way these machines are connected with the world we know. Whenever we fall in love with a family car, it’s not the car we cherish, but the memories of our lives in that car. Take Kim out of the equation and the silver Jeep becomes just another vehicle.
It wasn’t a particularly valuable car otherwise.
It was a bog standard Wrangler Sport S with a black hard top and alloy wheels. They were produced in the tens of thousands. It was already a year old when I bought it, with a loan from the credit union, and the price seemed high at the time — around $16,000. Looking back, I realize it was among the last of a breed, with no touch screen in the middle of the dash and a mostly analog driving experience, including manual transmission.
Even when it was 15 years old, I still thought of it as the “new” Jeep. It always seemed that way, even when it was beginning to fail. Cars changed dramatically during the time I owned the Jeep, something I was confronted with every time I had to rent a car for business. Everything seemed to be controlled by a menu instead of a switch or a button. Are cars better now? Absolutely. They are safer, faster, more sure-footed. But I think I’ll always miss the silver Jeep.
Among the memories I’ll hold tight to is loading the back of the Jeep with personal things from my office in Plumb Hall after I was among more than 30 faculty members fired at Emporia State University. You can read about the purge in this column from 2022, but what you need to know is that our termination wasn’t our fault. I filled the Jeep with crates of my books, boxes of research, mementos from students. When I swung the tailgate shut, it marked the end of 17 years of teaching journalism, including the anxiety and chaos of the pandemic. The future was uncertain, but damned if I didn’t feel I was ready for anything with that gearshift under my right hand and Kim waiting at home on Constitution Street.
The next couple of years were tougher than we could have imagined.
The one thing that didn’t let us down was the Jeep.
It got us to the other side of a bad stretch. Yeah, it had a few problems, but it never left us stranded. It took us anywhere we asked of it. We did have a bad few minutes in Yellowstone National Park when a snowstorm was blowing in and the electrical system went dead, but a quick brushing of a corroded battery post got us rolling again.
We said farewell to the silver Jeep on Dec. 13, 2025, when we traded it in at a dealership. It had taken a day to clean out all the stuff that had accumulated over more than a decade. The glovebox was a time capsule of registrations, insurance cards, oil change receipts, assorted pens and business cards from people I didn’t remember. Beneath the passenger seat, I found a favorite pocketknife I’d lost three years before. From a plastic bag beneath the hood, zip-tied to the fender, was a spare car and house key to be used in case we locked ourselves out.
We had taken the back seat out so there would be more space for gear. There was camping equipment to get us through a night or two if needed, including sleeping bags and butane cook stoves; there was fishing equipment consisting of fishing rods in cases, a soft-sided tackle box, and a net and a stringer; a tackle box turned into a first aid kit with bandages and pain relievers and anti-itch ointments and other things that might be needed in a pinch; tools, including a tow strap, fuses, jumper cables, a flashlight and a full set of socket and open-end wrenches; a pair of my old boots stuck in a corner of the hard top, along with a clean pair of wool socks; a grey plastic bus bin used as a catch-all for maps, brochures, bandanas, Nalgene bottles, cups, trash bags, paper towels, snacks, a camera tripod and two pairs of flip-flops; and a badly scuffed orange utility box, with assorted outdoor gear, that had been in the back of every Jeep I’d owned over the past quarter century. All three had been daily drivers.
At the dealership, Kim made a final search of the Jeep, just to be sure.
From deep beneath the driver’s seat she pulled, fittingly enough, a reporter’s notebook. It was the last thing the old friend gave up.
I had been reluctant to trade in the Jeep. Even at the dealership, I tried to talk myself into keeping it, lied to myself there wasn’t all that much wrong with it, and thought wouldn’t it be nice to keep just to drive around town? But Kim said it was time, and I knew she was right. Still, we nearly left the dealership — in a different and newer Wrangler — with the keys to the old Jeep in my pocket.
I went back inside and tossed the keys to the service manager, who made a fine catch. And in that moment it was done.
Cheers to open roads and new chapters.

But if you must...,"I hate winter.  And winter hates transportation.
Growing up in The Great White North (Canada, eh?), winter seemed to last about six months.  This winter in Connecticut seems even longer.  But feet of snow and sub-freezing temperatures don’t have to stop you if you follow some tried and true travel hacks.



Traveling by car:
If a storm is coming, get your car off the street and into a garage.  That way the trucks can plow and you don’t have to dig out your ride.  
If you do have to clean off your car after a storm, include the roof in your efforts. Otherwise your car may start launching “ice missiles” at unsuspecting targets as you’re driving down I-84.  That can mean a fine and possible injury to others.
Keep your gas tank full.  Your windshield washer tank, too… with ice-melting fluids, not water.  Replace worn wipers before winter storms.  Frozen, shredded rubber on dirty glass turns night driving into roulette.


When you start your engine, let it idle for at least 20 to 30 seconds before driving to ensure adequate oil distribution.  Don’t race the engine.  This isn’t Daytona, and cold oil doesn’t respond well to your enthusiasm.
Drive with your traction control turned on and proceed with caution.  Just because you’re in a SUV, don’t assume that because your car is bigger it’s safer.
Check your tires.  For every 10 degree drop in temperature you lose one PSI in tire pressure.  Under-inflated tires mean longer stopping distances (before factoring in the ice), lower fuel economy and higher risk of blowouts.
If you’re in an EV anticipate that your car won’t charge as well in the cold.  And expect to lose 20-40% of your normal driving range.  Pre-conditioning the battery while plugged in can claw back some of that mileage.
Without sounding like a scolding parent, just assume the worst because winter always does. Keeping an emergency kit handy: a blanket, flashlight, phone charger, and gloves in the car isn’t paranoia, it’s planning.
Traveling by train:
While train travel is much safer in bad weather, it’s not immune to physics.  Sub-zero temperatures are the enemy of all things mechanical.
To their credit, Connecticut’s railroads have a much better record of performance in winter than in years past when service was pre-emptively cancelled to avoid stranding passengers.  But remember… parts of this railroad are 100+ years old and centenarians don’t like playing in the snow.
While apps like TrainTime have vastly improved communications, they’re not perfect.  Trust your eyes and crowd-source any mistake you see to the Twitter account @CTRailCommuters to advise your fellow riders.
If your station’s waiting room is locked or the platform is not shoveled / sanded, document it and call your town hall.  Commuters deserve heat and a safe path to their train.
Grabbing the first train in the morning darkness turns you into a guinea pig as it encounters frozen switches and doors so later trains don’t have to.  Overhead power lines can snap and strand you without heat, so opt for diesel powered trains if they’re an option.
And don’t forget to download and activate your ticket before boarding; this in case cell service is lost and you’re hit with an $8 fine under Metro-North’s new rules.
Keep your cell phone (and its winter-hating battery) fully charged and close to your body heat to preserve its power.  Stashing your phone in a bag or outside pocket will drain your power quickly.
Finally, ask yourself “Is this trip really necessary?”  Sometimes the smartest winter travel decision is deciding not to travel at all.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/plowing-1.jpg,,,2026-01-25 04:56:12.636841

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Over a thousand people gathered for a vigil and rally Saturday night at Whittier Park in Minneapolis to mourn Alex Pretti, the man who was shot and killed by a Border Patrol agent. After the vigil, demonstrators marched in subzero temperatures to the site where Pretti was killed on Nicollet Avenue, south of 26th Street.
The site of the shooting has been turned into a makeshift memorial of candles and flowers, less than 2 miles away from the memorial in the Powderhorn neighborhood made for Renee Good on January 7, the day she was shot and killed by ICE agent Jonathan Ross.
Since Pretti’s killing, which drew hundreds of protestors in the immediate aftermath, people have built barricades out of dumpsters, trash cans and picnic tables to block off traffic from the surrounding streets. Before a swell of demonstrators arrived from the Whittier Park vigil, the area was mostly quiet, with hundreds huddled around his memorial.
Isabelle Atem, a nurse who drove in from Woodbury, cried as she said: “I thought it was just a dream, but… I’m here now. It feels real. It really happened. You know, in a movie, when you shoot people, I know it’s fake. I never knew it (could be) real.”
Atem said she felt bad when she found out Pretti was also a nurse. In a statement to multiple news outlets, Pretti’s parents said he was an ICU nurse at the Minneapolis VA hospital.
“Nurses are out there to help people. Why are they killing? Why are they shooting?” Atem said.
Atem, an immigrant from Cameroon, said that despite being a U.S. citizen, she has been afraid to go outside amid the surge of over 3,000 federal immigration agents to Minnesota, who have detained residents regardless of their citizenship status.

People were handing out warm drinks and food — fried rice, hummus — from local restaurants at tables at Pretti’s memorial. Glam Doll Donuts, across the street from where the Border Patrol agent shot Pretti, was open after hours and filled with people looking to stay warm.
As demonstrators from the nearby vigil filtered onto Nicollet, chanting, Jake Anderson handed out the last of the three gallons of chicken wild rice soup he had made that day.
Anderson, who lives in the Whittier neighborhood where Pretti was killed, said that he came to support everyone marching “a brutal takeover of our city by totalitarian ICE members and people who don’t actually care about safety in our community.”
“I think there’s a lot of outrage and rage clearly, but there’s also just a sense of community,” he said, as a man complimented his soup.
Some demonstrators banged on dumpsters with hammers and their hands as people chanted: “No Justice, No Peace” and “F*ck ICE.”
The parents of Alex Pretti, Michael and Susan Pretti, released a statement Saturday, castigating the Trump administration for slandering their son with “sickening lies” that they called “reprehensible and disgusting.”
They defended their son’s conduct, saying he was protecting a woman who had been pushed down by federal agents. “Please get the truth out about our son. He was a good man. Thank you.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NN260124_0729-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-24 22:56:50.623254

Family members identified the man who was killed as Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care unit nurse who had protested President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown in his city. After the shooting, an angry crowd gathered and protesters clashed with federal immigration officers, who wielded batons and deployed flash bangs.
The Minnesota National Guard was assisting local police at the direction of Gov. Tim Walz, officials said. Guard troops were sent to both the shooting site and to a federal building where officials have squared off with protesters daily.
Information about what led up to the shooting was limited, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said.
But Connecticut officials, including Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy, quickly denounced the federal agents’ actions.
“It’s just f***ing awful, the inhumanity of this,” Murphy said in a video posted to social medial. “We cannot fund ICE as it is constituted today.”

Pam Bondi just sent a letter to Minnesota officials saying ICE will leave if the state turns over its voter database to Trump. Guess what? This has never been about safety or immigration. It’s a pretext for Trump to take over elections in swing states. pic.twitter.com/BHrQJUECJY— Chris Murphy  (@ChrisMurphyCT) January 25, 2026

Sen. Richard Blumenthal criticized the Department of Homeland Security’s plan to investigate the shooting itself and called for an independent investigation.

Coverup in real time—if DHS investigates its own potential illegality. Congress must demand an independent investigation—immediately. A bipartisan call for justice—now. https://t.co/vgCHB6TJnR— Richard Blumenthal (@SenBlumenthal) January 24, 2026

U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, joined the call for an independent investigation.
“The second fatal shooting by DHS agents in Minneapolis this month demands a thorough, professional homicide investigation by local and state authorities who are actually qualified to carry out that task,” Courtney said in a statement. “DHS leaders and agents have shown they are more interested in politically spinning the facts to escape accountability, which is one of many reasons why tensions in Minnesota and across the country are dangerously on edge. The DHS spending bill, which I opposed along with the entire Connecticut House Delegation this past week, will simply perpetuate the status quo rather than rein in DHS rogue behavior. The Senate still has a chance to vote to restore civilized norms in law enforcement, and for the sake of the country, they should act accordingly.”
U.S. Rep. Jahana Hayes, D-5th District, called the shooting “sickening.”

The images coming from MN are absolutely horrifying. ICE agents have killed someone else.This must be investigated and ICE must leave MN.Residents should not have to fear the federal government. This is sickening.— Jahana Hayes (@RepJahanaHayes) January 24, 2026

Democratic state Rep. Farley Santos represents Danbury, where a number of ICE arrests took place last year.
“What we are witnessing should stop this country in its tracks,” Santos said in a press release. “We have seen children used as leverage, toddlers detained, kindergartners turned into bait, and now another human being killed. … What we are seeing is the result of unchecked power and reckless tactics … This is violence carried out under the color of authority. If we remain silent, it will only spread. What is happening is un-American, and it cannot continue.”
And a coalition of Connecticut immigration organizations released a statement to the media calling for the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency to be abolished.
“We are heartbroken,” reads the statement, signed by CT Students for a Dream, Danbury Unites for Immigrants, Colectivo de Defensa/Hartford Deportation Defense, Make the Road CT, New Haven Immigrants Coalition, Stamford Norwalk United For Immigrants and Unidad Latina en Acción.
“We stand with Minnesotans as they continue to face the terror of state violence and illegal actions by federal agents,” it continues. “We have seen first-hand ICE’s increasingly more violent tactics and the escalating number of detentions in CT and across the Northeast. … Our CT elected officials must ensure that Connecticut is not complicit in the federal government’s abusive immigration enforcement tactics or its creeping authoritarianism. We call on our state legislators to protect our privacy by regulating private companies’ ability to capture our personal information and ensure the national guard is not used for immigration enforcement.”
Trump lashes out
Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that federal officers were conducting an operation and fired “defensive shots” after a man with a handgun approached them and “violently resisted” when officers tried to disarm him.
In bystander videos of the shooting that emerged soon after, Pretti is seen with a phone in his hand but none appears to show him with a visible weapon.
O’Hara said police believe the man was a “lawful gun owner with a permit to carry.”
DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said during a news conference that Pretti had shown up to “impede a law enforcement operation.” She questioned why he was armed but did not offer detail about whether Pretti drew the weapon or brandished it at officers.
The officer who shot the man is an eight-year Border Patrol veteran, federal officials said.
Trump weighed in on social media by lashing out at Walz and the Minneapolis mayor.
Trump shared images of the gun that immigration officials said was recovered and said: “What is that all about? Where are the local Police? Why weren’t they allowed to protect ICE Officers?”
Trump, a Republican, said the Democratic governor and mayor are “are inciting Insurrection, with their pompous, dangerous, and arrogant rhetoric.”
Pretti was shot just over a mile from where an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Good on Jan. 7, sparking widespread protests.
Pretti’s family released a statement Saturday evening saying they are “heartbroken but also very angry,” and calling him a kindhearted soul who wanted to make a difference in the world through his work as a nurse.
“The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting. Alex is clearly not holding a gun when attacked by Trump’s murdering and cowardly ICE thugs. He has his phone in his right hand and his empty left hand is raised above his head while trying to protect the woman ICE just pushed down all while being pepper sprayed,” the family statement said. “Please get the truth out about our son. He was a good man.”
Video shows officers, man who was shot
In a bystander video of Saturday’s shooting obtained by The Associated Press, protesters can be heard blowing whistles and shouting profanities at federal officers on Nicollet Avenue.
The video shows an officer shoving a person who is wearing a brown jacket, skirt and black tights and carrying a water bottle. That person reaches out for a man and the two link up, embracing. The man, wearing a brown jacket and black hat, seems to be holding his phone up toward the officer.
The same officer shoves the man in his chest and the two, still embracing, fall back.
The video then shifts to a different part of the street and then comes back to the two individuals unlinking from each other. The video shifts focus again and then shows three officers surrounding the man.
Soon at least seven officers surround the man. One is on the man’s back and another who appears to have a canister in his hand strikes a blow to the man’s chest. Several officers try to bring the man’s arms behind his back as he appears to resist. As they pull his arms, his face is briefly visible on camera. The officer with the canister strikes the man near his head several times.
A shot rings out, but with officers surrounding the man, it’s not clear from where the shot came. Multiple officers back off the man after the shot. More shots are heard. Officers back away and the man lies motionless on the street.
The police chief appealed for calm, both from the public and from federal law enforcement.
“Our demand today is for those federal agencies that are operating in our city to do so with the same discipline, humanity and integrity that effective law enforcement in this country demands,” the chief said. “We urge everyone to remain peaceful.”
Gregory Bovino of U.S. Border Patrol, who has commanded the Trump administration’s big-city immigration campaign, said the officer who shot the man had extensive training as a range safety officer and in using less-lethal force.
“This is only the latest attack on law enforcement. Across the country, the men and women of DHS have been attacked, shot at,” he said.
Walz said he had no confidence in federal officials and that the state would lead the investigation into the latest fatal shooting.
But Drew Evans, superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, said during a news conference that federal officers blocked his agency from the shooting scene even after it obtained a signed judicial warrant.
Amid the unrest, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats will not vote for a spending package that includes money for DHS. Schumer’s statement increases the possibility that the government could partially shut down on Jan. 30 when funding runs out.
Protests continue in Minneapolis
Protesters converged at the scene of the shooting despite dangerously cold weather.
At midday Saturday, the worst of an extreme cold wave was over, but the temperature was still -6 degrees (-21 Celsius).
After the shooting, an angry crowd gathered and screamed profanities at federal officers, calling them “cowards” and telling them to go home. One officer responded mockingly as he walked away, telling them: “Boo hoo.” Agents elsewhere shoved a yelling protester into a car. Protesters dragged garbage dumpsters from alleyways to block the streets, and people who gathered chanted, “ICE out now” and “Observing ICE is not a crime.”
As dark fell, hundreds of people gathered quietly by a growing memorial at the site of the shooting. Some carried signs saying “Justice for Alex Pretti.” Others chanted Pretti’s and Good’s names. A doughnut shop and a clothing store nearby stayed open, offering protesters a warm place as well as water, coffee and snacks.
Caleb Spike said he came from a nearby suburb to show his support and his frustration. “It feels like every day something crazier happens,” he said. “What’s happening in our community is wrong, it’s sickening, it’s disgusting.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26025029988353-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-24 21:56:35.553078

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin says she will vote against funding the Department of Homeland Security after federal immigration officers fatally shot a second American citizen in Minneapolis Saturday.
Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said federal agents killed a 37-year-old man who was an American citizen and a lawful gun owner. The Associated Press identified the man as Alex Pretti.
Graphic video filmed by bystanders and posted to social media shows federal agents wrestling Pretti to the ground and hitting him with a firearm before multiple shots can be heard.
It is the second time this month U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have killed an American citizen in Minnesota. Federal agents previously shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Good on Jan. 7.
Slotkin, a Democrat from Holly, said the killings are “part of a continued, coordinated assault on our Constitutional rights — with specific focus on individuals and groups who disagree with this President.”
“As all Americans can see with their own eyes, ICE and those under their command are not acting as responsible law enforcement agencies,” Slotkin said. “They are recklessly inciting violence at the whims of the president. And they must be reined in before there is more killing.”

The appropriations package that Slotkin plans to vote against includes $64.4 billion in DHS funding for fiscal year 2026. It would reduce funding for Customs and Border Patrol by $1.3 billion but would continue funding ICE at current levels.
The package includes $20 million for officer-worn body cameras for ICE agents but stops short of additional guardrails that Democrats, including Slotkin, have demanded.
Republican leaders in the Senate plan to bring the DHS funding up as a single vote with funding for other government programs that have more support among Democrats.
The funding package would need to earn 60 votes in the Senate by Friday to avoid a government shutdown.
Even if DHS funding lapses, federal agencies could tap into $170 billion of one-time funding for immigration enforcement that was included in President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
All but seven Democrats in the U.S. House voted against the DHS funding. Michigan’s congressional delegation voted along party lines, with every Republican voting to pass it and every Democrat voting against it.
Retiring U.S. Sen. Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield Twp.) has not indicated how he plans to vote on the funding package.
Federal agent shoots and kills man in Minneapolis, rousing more demonstrations

But he has called for a “full and impartial investigation by local police” into the fatal shootings of Pretti and Good.
In both cases, federal officials stonewalled state and local police from investigating and quickly began spreading a narrative that is not supported by videos shared by witnesses and reviewed by experts.
An F.B.I. agent investigating the shooting of Good resigned after the Trump administration pressured her to drop the civil rights inquiry, The New York Times reported.
While Michigan’s congressional Republicans have been largely silent on the killing, Democrats have been outspoken.
U.S. Rep. Hillary Scholten (D-Grand Rapids) echoed the calls for a “thorough, independent investigation.”
“Our communities deserve public safety and accountability — not a militarized presence that escalates fear, trauma, and loss of life,” Scholten said. “What we’re seeing isn’t how a world leader runs its immigration system. It’s evidence of chaos, cruelty, and dysfunction.”
Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said the actions of ICE agents are “not reflective of the high standards residents should expect of law enforcement officials.”
“This failure, in turn, compromises the ability of local and state law enforcement to do their jobs and jeopardizing the safety of police and civilians alike,” Nessel said.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
U.S. Rep. Kristen McDonald Rivet (D-Bay City) said Congress “must not send them one more taxpayer dollar without reforms that bring the agency back to its mission and in line with basic law enforcement best practices.”
“I’ve worked with brave, patriotic law enforcement officers for decades. They take their duties seriously to uphold our laws, de-escalate situations, and keep us safe,” McDonald Rivet said. “Lawless ICE operations are doing the opposite, and now we have chaos and dead Americans.”
U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit) said that “anything less than abolishing ICE is a cowardly capitulation to fascism.”
“I am so sick of fake ass people who say they uphold our Constitution,” Tlaib said. “No you don’t if you fund this madness.”
U.S. Rep. Shri Thanedar (D-Detroit), who is facing a primary challenge, repeated his call to abolish ICE, adding that the Senate “must stop all funding to ICE, even if that means shutting down this oppressive government.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/83A0225-1536x1024-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-24 21:56:35.553078

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Hundreds in force, Mainers rallied this weekend against the Trump administration’s immigration operation in the state, decrying the arrests of their neighbors and recognizing those afraid to leave their homes who couldn’t join in protest. 
Since U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement heightened its presence in Maine on Tuesday, the agency said it has arrested at least 100 people but provided few specifics, as public officials have called for transparency, to no avail. Community organizers, faith leaders, business owners, political officials and candidates at protests in Portland and Lewiston demanded accountability, pointing to the known detentions of at least several people with permission to work in the U.S. and no criminal records. 
Others shared personal stories and the anguish of loved ones who are afraid to leave their homes. 
Usually filled with children doing their homework and laughing, the office of Generational Noor, a youth education nonprofit in Lewiston, is now empty, said executive director Amran Osman. 
“They’re scared to show up because they think that showing up to somewhere means that they might not make it home,” Osman said. “No child should have to feel this way.”
Safiya Khalid, executive director of the Community Organizing Alliance, a Lewiston-based group boosting civic engagement among Black and immigrant communities, said her phone is filled with requests for help. A friend afraid to drive into work. Another in need of food, fearful they’ll be picked up outside the store. Detentions in both scenarios have already been documented in Maine.  
“But at the same time,” human rights activist Faisal Khan told Maine Morning Star, “more and more people are waking up; more and more people are speaking out, not only in protest but really showing support to the marginalized communities that are being targeted right now.”
While many comments at rallies were targeted calls to get ICE out of Maine, speeches were also filled with gratitude for how community members have stepped up. 
“There is an effort in this country to define who belongs and who does not… to convince people that if it is not happening to them, it is not their problem,” Khalid said. “But here is what they miscalculated: they underestimated community. They underestimated neighbors who will drive each other to work. They underestimated networks that would deliver groceries. They underestimated people who refused to look away.”
In Portland Friday night, passing cars honked incessantly amid the chants of the roughly 1,000 people gathered in Monument Square, where speakers demanded justice for Minneapolis resident Renee Good and others killed by federal agents, before marching down Congress Street, stopping traffic.
The next morning in Minneapolis, federal immigration officers shot another U.S citizen.
On Saturday afternoon, about 500 people gathered inside the Agora Event Center in Lewiston, many taking to the podium to condemn that latest killing, while equally as many people marched outside in solidarity in single digit temperatures. Other actions were held across the state, including about 60 people who lined the streets of Saco, and dozens more who protested South Portland.

Pointed critiques and calls to action
In a statement condemning the recent killing, Gov. Janet Mills said she requested a meeting with President Donald Trump to demand in-person that his administration “withdraw these untrained and reckless ICE agents in Maine and across the country who are stoking fear in communities, arresting legally present people, including law enforcement officials, and who pose a grave threat to public safety.” 
Mills also called on Congress to immediately bring Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem before them for a public hearing and to cut off further funding for ICE “until their lawless tactics and dangerous behavior cease.”
Some who rallied in Lewiston and Portland criticized Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Golden for voting for a spending package Thursday after many other Democrats rejected it, objecting to funding the Department of Homeland Security amid aggressive immigration enforcement. 
Others directed their anger toward Republican U.S. Sen Susan Collins.
Democrat Troy Jackson, gubernatorial candidate and former president of the Maine Senate, said, “I hear all the time about the supposed power and influence of U.S. Senator Susan Collins. Well, Senator Collins, this would be a great time to use it.”
Graham Platner, the oysterman trying to unseat Collins, called on current Maine leaders to do more. 
Platner criticized Mills for delaying her decision on a forthcoming law that will restrict local police from cooperating with ICE. State and local police already couldn’t enforce immigration laws, which are a federal matter, however local authorities have contributed to immigration arrests in Maine, including through traffic stops and 911 calls.
While the Maine Legislature passed it last year, Mills let it become law without signature earlier this month, making it so it can’t take effect until the summer. Maine State Police, however, is already following the law. Maine Department of Public Safety Commissioner Mike Sauschuck issued a directive last month that essentially implemented its underlying policies.
Democratic State Rep. Ambureen Rana of Bangor also called out Mills during the rally in Portland, arguing that fear of government retaliation for the law was regarded above “the terror that immigrants in our community face day-to-day.” 
Immigration authorities and state Republicans have pointed to that law when defending the surge of immigration enforcement in Maine. 
“Every elected official is complicit,” Rana said, “and they must be held accountable. They must be pushed. They must be swayed and brought along in this movement.” 
Other calls for action came from Jackson, who said the state needs to create more accessible systems of accountability, such as a civil rights and legal action team. Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, a Democrat who is also running for governor, said the state ought to use the documented evidence of ICE’s actions so far to hold the agency accountable. And another Democratic gubernatorial candidate, Hannah Pingree, called on governors and attorneys general across the country to file suit every single time the Constitution is violated by ICE.

Here’s what would.,Mike Goldstein,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/opinion/what-were-doing-to-treat-adhd-isnt-working-heres-a-plan-to-change-that/,"There needs to be a wholesale rethinking of our approach to ADHD, one that is guided by evidence and a better understanding of the dynamic nature of attention problems.","AFTER DINNER, some 200,000 Massachusetts teenagers retreat to their bedrooms. Nominally, they’re doing homework. In practice, many are waging—and losing—a private war of attention. Even when they turn their phones off or leave them in the kitchen, the homework itself often lives on a laptop, where a single click offers instant distraction and relief. 
We recently launched a consulting business to coach high schoolers struggling with getting homework done. The fancy, sometimes broader name for the skill we try to help them develop is executive function.  
We’ve worked with dozens of teens over the past six months. Many try in good faith.  They trudge upstairs after dinner.  They stare at Google Classroom, click into math or history, maybe start a problem or two. Then they promise themselves they’ll start “for real” in 10 minutes, and click elsewhere. The evening dissolves into self-reproach.  Now it’s 9 pm.  Oops, now it’s 11.   
What we’ve learned in helping kids with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, is that they need more than “strategies.”  Teachers and counselors have already explained these – here is how to get organized, how to prioritize, here are some tricks to help you focus. It is not leading to behavior change.   
There is no one-size-fits-all plan that will work with all students.  Most of our students arrive having already tried these things.   
What’s needed is a wholesale rethinking of our approach to ADHD, one that is guided by evidence and a better understanding of the dynamic nature of attention problems. Getting the diagnosis right will allow us to stop spinning our wheels and develop the best plan for each student dealing with these challenges.  
ADHD is a complex, multi-dimensional problem.  You need a spirited trial-and-error, equally multifaceted plan to address it.  It’s a chronic condition that is always changing, often in reaction to changed circumstances: fall to wintertime blahs, loss or gain of friends, a particularly inspiring or boring teacher, sports participation.   
The chronic nature means it’s unlikely that an ADHD teen will ever transform into someone like his or her super-organized friend or sibling.  What’s more plausible is that an hour a week of well-considered, evidence-based, trial-and-error coaching can help unlock perhaps 10 additional individual hours of effort – which could mean the world to the mental health and school trajectory of a struggling 15-year-old.    
When it comes to how adults respond to a teen with ADHD, parent reaction varies.  Some feel sympathy, others fury.  Some parents (moms more than dads) blame themselves.   
At high schools, many veteran teachers shrug.  It’s always been like this – some teens just can’t or won’t get their work done – but it’s way worse now in the smartphone era. Solving the 8 am to 3 pm smartphone issues with school cellphone bans, however, doesn’t do anything for the 3 pm to 3 am problem.   
What precisely is behind all this? As journalist Paul Tough  wrote last year in The New York Times Magazine, experts argue vigorously about ADHD. What is it? Are we over- or underdiagnosing it? How should we treat it?
In 2024, Tough wrote, 11.4 percent of all US children had been diagnosed with ADHD, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Among adolescents, the figure was even higher — 15.5 percent — while a stunning 23 percent of all 17-year-old boys had an ADHD diagnosis.  
Our take: It’s over-diagnosed in affluent communities, where some families simply see a path to advantaging their teen over their friends, with extra time on SAT and so forth. Meanwhile, it’s under-appreciated in high-poverty schools, where there’s less belief that many teens are trying in good faith to get their work done, but stuck.   
Families desperate for answers often marshal everything they can to address the problem. The cavalry sometimes succeeds: medication, therapy, IEPs and 504 plans, executive-function coaching. Often it doesn’t. 
Take Alan, a 16-year-old with two D’s and an F. His mom had already tried the obvious fixes. She sat him at the kitchen table to do homework—he’d start, then toggle to Discord within five minutes. She hired therapists—he felt better after sessions, but turned in zero additional assignments (and sometimes used therapeutic language to deflect Mom). The school offered daily check-ins. Alan BS’d his way through them. 
We tried all sorts of strategies with him. Clear task list with time estimates? First night: 8 out of 10 level of impact. Two weeks later: it had slipped to 4 out of 10. Pomodoro technique – the celebrated 25 minutes on, 5-minute break tactic?  Failed for him.  App blockers? Alan circumvented them in minutes. Hard start time? Somehow 4:30 pm became 5:15 pm became “after this YouTube video.” 
What worked? A coach adopting a Sherlock Holmes mentality when navigating the school’s online platform (it might take 22 clicks to find what was actually due tomorrow); detailed nightly plans his mom enforced; body-doubling for math, where Alan dictated answers, first to the coach and eventually to the computer; chunking big research paper assignments into smaller pieces with micro-deadlines; live editing sessions, where a coach would hover over Alan a little bit, kind of like a personal trainer at the gym (“OK, now hold this plank for 60 seconds”).  
What were Alan’s final semester grades? In chemistry, he went from an F to a B. In pre-calculus, from a D+ to an A, and in history, from a D to a B. When all was said and done, four strategies failed, five worked – for Alan. The next kid will need different ones. 
And that’s the problem. Schools, parents, and even some clinicians use the strep throat framework. Positive strep test? Amoxicillin.  Or, to borrow another medical analogy: broken ankle?  A cast, followed by eight weeks of PT. These solutions work reliably. 
ADHD doesn’t operate that way. That’s why everyone gets frustrated. We should treat it more like diabetes: a complicated, chronic condition that requires constant monitoring and adjusting of treatment, as warranted.     
Even when you think you’ve cracked the code, conditions change, and the treatment needs to also. The sport season that was a motivating force ends. The friend group shifts. The science teacher who motivated kids goes on leave, and the sub is a dud. 
What are the policy implications of all this? 
1. ADHD exposes the failure of one-shot systems. 
The problem with our approach to ADHD is the same as the problem with how we deal with many learning disabilities that call for an individualized education program.  IEPs aren’t built for trial and error. Moreover, they often have a legal compliance vibe. Many veteran teachers are forced to sit through meetings where, in their heart of hearts, they don’t think the plan has any chance to succeed – it’s full of jargon and nominal accommodations like “preferential seating.”    
We could learn from how we handle other chronic conditions like diabetes, where success means continuous monitoring and adaptation. What if IEP teams reconvened quarterly, not annually, explicitly to test and adjust interventions?  This won’t make a difference if the special ed services amount to no more than bureaucratic compliance. In that scenario, it’s just more worthless meetings, annoying for all involved.  But this is an essential idea if the services are delivered in good faith, because only trial and error is likely to stumble on the set of things that work for that particular teen at that moment in their lives.   
2. ADHD has an evidence vacuum. 
When it comes to treating ADHD, we have passionate practitioners—therapists, coaches, teachers, pediatricians—but little shared measurement of whether interventions actually improve a student’s ability to plan, start, and finish tasks.   
Massachusetts is home to many world-class social scientists.  MIT’s Blueprint Labs  uses data to better understand policies in education and other areas.  There are many other similar research centers. The state could fund randomized controlled trials with real outcome metrics: tasks started on time, assignments submitted, credits earned. Publish all results, good or bad. The goal isn’t crowning one method—it’s building a testing infrastructure and evidence base that separates what works from what merely sounds helpful.   
3. ADHD magnifies a brutal equity gap. 
Trial and error costs money. What works is relentless tinkering—come up with a strategy the teen is willing to try, do it, measure it, adjust—until some combo clicks. Our small firm mostly serves wealthy families who can afford multiple attempts until something clicks. Families relying on services in public schools often get one shot, maybe two, before the system gives up on their teen. 
Massachusetts already knows how to democratize boutique interventions.  For example, the 2006 Rosie D. settlement—a class-action lawsuit over inadequate mental health services—transformed home-based therapy for Medicaid-eligible children from a luxury into a statewide benefit.  We should do the same for executive function support—making the trial-and-error coaching process accessible to every family, not just those who can pay.

The Mississippi Department of Transportation said ice had been reported on roads and bridges in at least 26 counties, primarily in northern Mississippi. In a social media post, the agency urged residents in heavily impacted areas to use roadways only for emergencies as crews monitored conditions and treated major routes.
People hunkered down in their homes after stocking up on groceries, and officials warned that electricity outages are likely in some places if ice coats power lines or knocks trees onto the lines.

Local officials echoed warnings about avoiding travel as temperatures dipped below freezing. Oxford Mayor Robyn Tannehill and the city’s police department reported that several major roadways were icy on Saturday afternoon, with conditions expected to worsen overnight and into the weekend.
“Please stay off the roads if at all possible,” Tannehill said. 
Severe winter weather is a rare occurrence in the Deep South, so it can have outsized impacts because Mississippi has limited winter weather infrastructure. Ice accumulation, even in small amounts, can quickly make roadways impassable and increase the risk of crashes.

The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency has warned that the storm could cause major power outages that could last several days across much of the state. MEMA had also urged residents days in advance to prepare by having enough water and non-perishable food on hand.
Gov. Tate Reeves has declared a state of emergency and said at a Friday news conference he had been in contact with federal authorities to prepare for the storm.

The Associated Press reported that almost 12,000 weekend flights in the U.S. were canceled as the massive storm started to wreak havoc.
Roughly 140 million people, or more than 40% of the U.S. population, were under a winter storm warning from New Mexico to New England. The National Weather Service forecast warned of widespread heavy snow and a band of catastrophic ice stretching from east Texas to North Carolina. By midday Saturday, a quarter of an inch of ice was reported in parts of southeastern Oklahoma, eastern Texas and portions of Louisiana.
“What really makes this storm unique is, just following this storm, it’s just going to get so cold,” said Allison Santorelli, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. “The snow and the ice will be very, very slow to melt and won’t be going away anytime soon, and that’s going to hinder any recovery efforts.”

Jackson’s homeless shelters opened additional beds ahead of a potentially devastating ice storm to protect vulnerable residents from the freeze.
But advocates say it would not be enough to serve the city’s entire unhoused population – some of whom will weather the storm outside in tents, tarps and sleeping bags. 
“I’m ready for this cold. I got on plenty layers and lots of blankets. I’m good,” said Michael Veal regarding the impending winter blast forecast for this weekend.

It’s not just homeless people in open-air encampments who will be left in the cold: Jacksonians with poorly insulated homes — as is common across the Southeast — may also need to seek refuge, further straining shelter capacity across the city. In other parts of Mississippi, churches and social services groups started opening shelters Friday as a winter storm with snow, freezing rain and sleet started moving across parts of the state Saturday.
Jackson’s roughly 250 shelter beds, operated by Stewpot Community Services, Shower Power, Gateway Rescue Mission and the Salvation Army, will accommodate the homeless or unstably housed during the coming week’s freezing temperatures, according to Melvin Stamps, the planning director for the Central Mississippi Continuum of Care.

But the number of available beds is in flux, with advocates reporting that two of the year-round centers, the men’s shelter at Gateway Rescue Mission and the adult shelter at Salvation Army, are full or near capacity. The Salvation Army typically charges a boarding fee, but it waives that cost during inclement weather.
During past weather events, the city of Jackson has opened a temporary shelter at the Johnnie Champion Community Center, often called Champion’s Gym, near Jackson State University. With more than 100 beds, the building offers the largest capacity of any shelter in the city.

It will not be open during this storm because the heaters need to be replaced, according to city officials. An additional city facility that has been used as a temporary shelter, the Jackson Police Training Academy on Charles Street, is also not in sufficient condition to open. 
Nic Lott, the city’s spokesperson, said the building and maintenance department is working to secure new heaters. “We would love to use the facility, but the heaters need to be replaced and there’s a process we’re going through to get that done,” he said. 
Shower Power, which has operated at Champion’s in the past, opened 75 beds on Saturday at its building on South Commerce Street. 
Stewpot offers beds at two shelters, a men’s facility and a facility for women and children, all year round. On Friday, it opened an additional 30 beds at its downtown Opportunity Center – usually a day center – in anticipation of the falling temperatures. 
The city announced in a press release that the American Red Cross would be offering shelter, but as of noon on Saturday, the nonprofit was not affiliated with any shelters in Jackson or in the state of Mississippi, according to its online map.

“We probably won’t have enough inventory to be able to support the number of beds that may need that warming space,” said Stamps from Continuum of Care, which is composed of several organizations working to reduce homelessness. “Now, I think it would have been OK if Champion’s Gym was open.” 
While some homeless people in the Jackson area will attempt to weather the ice storm, Stamps said he anticipates the vast majority will attempt to seek shelter. Earlier this week, his organization conducted a survey of the number of homeless people in Jackson and found 123 people living at roughly 50 encampments throughout the city. 
“It’s all about establishing a positive rapport with them so that when a situation like this occurs, it’s not like we’re trying to poke and prod,” Stamps said. “We already have relationships.”

Even so, the number of people outside who will attempt to seek shelter is likely higher, as point-in-time counts often fail to accurately capture how many homeless people live in a community. 
For the people who don’t seek shelter, advocates and outreach coordinators like Dee Dee Barlow Moore say the coming days will be life-threatening. Last month, a homeless man died of hypothermia after opting to sleep outside a building in downtown Jackson — mere blocks away from a shelter. 
“So many of them, in their minds, equate shelter to confinement and to so many horrible, traumatic things in their past,” she said. 
Another reason people avoid the shelter: Their dogs can’t come with them. 
Teresa Renkenberger, the founder of Shower Power, said she wishes it were possible to accommodate pets, but it is too disruptive.
“They would fight and bark, and trust me, I want to take them,” she said. 
To help the folks outside, she said they will be making repeated visits with sleeping bags and even pet food. And if people do choose to go to Shower Power, Renkenberger promises warmth: She said they recently finished installing blown-in insulation to complement two 5-ton heaters inside the large sleeping area.

Moore has also been visiting encampments throughout the city – collections of tents on streets in a mostly deserted industrial area close to downtown Jackson or groups who congregate behind chain retailers in the city’s northern limits – to pass out camping gear and other supplies. 
“But the ones that are the diehards, that truly believe that they can make it through anything, I ordered some of these camping mats that are insulated,” she said. 
That’s in addition to doling out what Moore estimates is three cars-worth of thermal blankets, tarps, hats and gloves, and sleeping bags. She is also planning to pass out propane camping heaters.

Chemical hand warmers in particular can save lives, she said. 
“I’ve had one guy that literally didn’t die from hypothermia because his entire encampment pooled all of those together,” she said. “He had fallen in the mud and all they saw was his shoes sticking up. They got 20 to 30 HotHands and covered him in it until AMR got there.” 
Belonging to a group can help in other ways, too, Moore said. Some people who don’t want to go to shelters will pool funds they have made from panhandling to buy motel rooms. But for that to work, at least one person in the group must have identification — leading to the sometimes fatal resort of staying outside. 
“The wet and the cold is what will kill them,” she said. 
It’s not just the ice that can lead to death. The winter months in Jackson are known as “fire season,” due to the number of homes — abandoned or otherwise – that ignite, said Jeremiah Howard, the Hinds County coroner who also works as a volunteer firefighter in the tiny town of Pocahontas. 
The city of Jackson will sometimes see multiple fires in one night, Howard said. One cause of the repeated blazes: Homeless people seeking shelter inside abandoned houses and lighting fires to stay warm. 
Moore said she’s recently started passing out hand sanitizer to people living in encampments so they can safely start fires, as she’s seen too many people try to light tires to stay warm, then breathe in toxic smoke. 
“They come out looking like they’ve been rolling in soot,” she said. “But they’re trying to survive.”

Another reason for the fire season: Drafty windows and poor insulation that force residents to heat their homes through unsafe methods, such as multiple space heaters or the oven. 
Jill Buckley, Stewpot’s executive director, said the extended freezing temperatures mean a higher likelihood that people will face financial hardship from trying to stay warm.  
“It’s a cascade of events that starts here and now and will take months to recover from,” she said. 
In one scenario, Buckley described a resident’s gas usage going up because they’re relying on the oven to stay warm, leading to a higher bill the next month. 
“Then you have to figure out how to pay your regular bills,” she said. “Or something happens with your plumbing, you can’t afford to get the plumber out, and JXN Water charges you thousands of dollars.” 
Buckely said her coordinators will keep going out to make sure people know they have a place to get warm. 
“They’re making that decision when it’s 54 degrees outside,” she said. “It might be a different decision when it’s 32 degrees outside.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/23191155/Opportunity-House-1.jpg,,,2026-01-24 14:57:03.381904

As Stateline recently reported, DHS recently revised its account of a December shooting in Glen Burnie, Maryland, after local police contradicted its initial version. DHS first claimed both men injured in the incident were inside a van that ICE officers fired at in self-defense, but later said that one of the injured men had already been arrested and was in custody inside an ICE vehicle when he was hurt. The other man was shot twice and is facing two federal criminal charges.
In August, federal immigration agents fired at a family’s vehicle three times in San Bernardino, California. DHS maintained the shooting was justified after at least two agents were struck by the vehicle, but available footage shows an agent breaking the driver-side window moments before gunfire erupted. Surveillance footage from the street does not show agents being struck by the vehicle.
The Saturday shooting comes one day after tens of thousands of people protested ICE in downtown Minneapolis in subzero temperatures.

“If you tamper with my players, I’m going to turn you in. It’s just that simple,” Swinney said during a news conference. “I’m not out to get anybody fired, but there has to be accountability and consequences for this type of behavior and total disregard for the rules.
“If this happened in the NFL, which is an actual league with rules, they would be fined, they would take draft picks, they hit the cap, whatever,” Swinney continued. “This is such a terrible example for young coaches in this profession. … To me, this situation is like having an affair on your honeymoon.”
Ferrelli, a former linebacker at California, entered the transfer portal on Jan. 2 and committed to Clemson four days later. Ferrelli subsequently enrolled, began classes, and began attending meetings and workouts, Swinney said.
Ferrelli reentered the portal on Jan. 22 and committed to Ole Miss.
“You can’t sign with the Browns and practice a week, and then the Dolphins call you and say we’re going to give you a little more money and you say, ‘See ya, boys,’ and go play for the Dolphins. That’s not the real world,” Swinney said.
Ole Miss athletic officials did not respond to Swinney’s allegations when contacted on Friday by The Associated Press.

NCAA vice president of enforcement Jon Duncan said in a statement that the association “will investigate any credible allegations of tampering and expect full cooperation from all involved as required by NCAA rules.”
Swinney alleged that Golding maintained contact with Ferrelli after the linebacker had enrolled at Clemson, even texting, “I know you’re signed, but what is your buyout?”
When Swinney found out about it, he said he initially told Clemson general manager Jordan Sorrells that he wanted to give Golding “some grace” because the Rebels’ coach was newly promoted after Lane Kiffin left for LSU over Thanksgiving weekend.
Swinney asked Sorrells to tell Ole Miss officials “that we know what’s going on, and if he doesn’t cease communication, I’m going to turn him in. I really thought that would be the end of it, but it wasn’t.”
Swinney said Ferrelli’s agent confirmed that Golding had continued reaching out to the player, so Clemson officials asked for copies of the text messages.
“The agent communicated that if we were to add a second year at $1 million to the already agreed-upon deal with Luke, then they would gladly give us whatever we need to turn Ole Miss in,” Swinney said. “Jordan, appropriately, said, ‘No, we’re not doing that.’”
Clemson athletic director Graham Neff said the university’s main reason for making the allegations public was to spur changes to the college football calendar and related rules — or lack thereof — that have contributed to upheaval across the sport.
“The NCAA was surprised a school was willing to come forward as directly and transparently as we were,” Neff said. “We need to look real hard at how we got here, but (also) how to get out of it.”
Neff added that Clemson was exploring its legal options.
“This is not about a linebacker at Clemson,” Swinney added. “I don’t want anyone on our team that doesn’t want to be here.
“It’s about the next kid and about the message being sent if this blatant tampering is allowed to happen without any consequences.”
Swinney also called the January transfer portal window “stupid,” saying it causes “flat-out extortion in some cases” because players and schools are making major decisions during “such a short period of time, right in the middle of when people are trying to play bowl games, playoff games, et cetera.”
If the system is not reformed, Swinney warned, there will be unintended consequences for players who transfer among multiple schools while chasing short-term financial payouts — particularly if they don’t make it to the NFL.
“We’re going to have some screwed-up 30-year-olds … that have no degrees, that have spent their money, that can’t play football anymore and aren’t connected to anything,” Swinney said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/24111155/AP25361755369011.jpg,,,2026-01-24 12:57:15.130108

(Photo by Meghan O'Brien/South Dakota Searchlight)Judges in South Dakota routinely order people charged with alcohol or drug offenses to get chemical dependency evaluations or sign up for drug treatment programs as a condition of pretrial release from custody.
In practice, those orders have long functioned more like suggestions in most counties.
“Nobody follows up on that,” South Dakota Supreme Court Chief Justice Steven Jensen told the Legislature’s Joint Appropriations Committee on Friday at the Capitol in Pierre. “We don’t have anybody doing that, because we’re not doing pretrial probation.”
That’s about to change in South Dakota’s second most populous county, Jensen told lawmakers earlier this year.
The chief justice told the committee that the pretrial supervision pilot program in Pennington County will use a $385,000 grant from the MacArthur Foundation to build a base-level of supervision for people who’ve yet to be tried in court. Probation officers will follow up with people released on bond to notify them of upcoming court dates. 
Chief justice outlines roadmap to more services for drug offenders, young people and probationers

One piece of the Pennington County program is already in place in Minnehaha County, and has been since 2018.
In all counties outside of Minnehaha, Jensen said, judges set bond conditions without seeing a criminal or drug abuse history for the person asking for pretrial release. 
Under the pilot program, Pennington County court staff will gather that information and share it with judges upfront, as staffers in Minnehaha County already do.
The Unified Judicial System isn’t asking for any extra money from lawmakers this year for the pilot program, as Jensen said existing employees should be able to shoulder the workload. He also said, however, that the pilot program could point the way to a future expansion of pretrial services.
Jensen is asking lawmakers to take an action without a price tag, however. House Bill 1015 would authorize the state court system to offer probation-like services to people who’ve yet to be convicted. The House Judiciary Committee voted 10-3 on Wednesday to send that bill to the full House of Representatives.
Committee members commended court system officials for exploring ways to refine bond condition decisions and reduce problems with missed court appearances. Some members expressed concerns about ongoing funding when the grant money runs out. 
One opponent, St. Onge Republican Rep. Mary Fitzgerald, said she couldn’t support a bill that put more responsibilities on overworked court service officers.
“How in the world do you expect them to do this in Pennington County without hiring?” she said Wednesday.
Rep. John Hughes, R-Sioux Falls, said he understands concerns about ongoing funding, but that he supports the program. The issues created by a lack of pretrial services for people at risk of missing court or misbehaving are too serious to ignore, he argued.
“I’m of the mindset that doing something is mandatory, and doing something like this is way better than doing nothing,” Hughes said.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden has been getting some flak recently from his Republican primary election opponents for using his office to bolster his reelection campaign. It will be interesting to see, should any of them displace Rhoden, if they use the office any differently. 
At the top of the opponent complaint list is the governor’s penchant for roaming the state, handing out checks from the Future Fund. So far he has hit Aberdeen, Watertown and Brookings, offering payments to bolster economic development.
One of Rhoden’s opponents, Aberdeen businessman Toby Doeden, questioned the timing of the $1 million grant to Aberdeen’s two new business parks. In a South Dakota Searchlight story, Doeden said Rhoden “uses taxpayer money the same way career politicians have been using taxpayer dollars for decades — largely for his own benefit.”
It’s easy to see Rhoden’s largesse in Aberdeen as a political jab at the wealthy Doeden, as though the governor is saying “you’re not the only one in this race with some money to throw around.” 
Governor hits the road to award more state grants; opponents call it campaigning

In the same story, Rhoden’s other opponents also offered criticism of the timing of the Future Fund grants. U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson said it was concerning when award announcements turned into campaign rallies and state House Speaker Jon Hansen said that the Future Fund was funding Rhoden’s political future. Rhoden countered by saying he was just doing his job. 
Created in 1987 at the request of Gov. George Mickelson, the Future Fund was designed to allow a governor to respond with funding quickly for an economic development opportunity. Gov. Kristi Noem’s use of the fund raised some eyebrows. She used it to pay for a series of commercials starring herself, a shooting range lawmakers had refused to pay for, a fireworks show and a rodeo. Basically, she used the Future Fund to pay for items that were too expensive for her to put on her state credit card. 
Part of the Noem legacy that Rhoden is left to deal with is Senate Bill 1, a measure that would take some control of the Future Fund away from the governor and give it to the Board of Economic Development. As much as his opponents don’t like the timing of Rhoden’s Future Fund awards, they may be secretly rooting for SB 1 to fail, ensuring their own ability to make grants and influence people. A vote on the bill ended in a tie in the Senate State Affairs Committee. It’s likely to be resurrected in some form this session. 
A case can be made for saying Rhoden began using the office to bolster his political career as soon as Noem left for a life of leading the masked marauders in the Department of Homeland Security. It’s likely the scent of her perfume still lingered in the governor’s office when Rhoden hit on the idea to embark on an Open for Opportunity tour of the state. The taxpayer-funded series of events was designed to introduce the state to its new governor and the new governor to business leaders and potential donors. 
Well-timed economic development grants and taxpayer-funded travel aren’t the only benefits of incumbency. Rhoden also inherited a well-tuned communications machine that cranks out news releases aplenty. These releases rarely, if ever, include bad news. It’s usually a glowing report on state finances, grant announcements, task force recommendations, board appointments — with the appointee expressing what a pleasure it will be to work with the governor, pleas for Congress to do better and announcements about Rhoden’s Open for Opportunity itinerary.


Let us know what you think...


 

In among those news releases is a weekly column from Rhoden. Anyone with experience in public relations knows that it’s unlikely the governor actually writes the columns. Still, they serve as inexpensive political advertising when picked up by the state’s newspapers. His pre-session column assured voters that he would be working hard for them with the Legislature. 
It would be easy for Rhoden to quell this particular line of attack from his opponents. He could stay in the Capitol, emerging only for actual campaign events. He could put away the Future Fund checkbook, or if there’s a community in need, send an economic development minion to hand over the grant. That would keep the presentations from having the same air as a campaign event. He could cut back on the news releases and, out of fairness to his opponents, suspend his weekly column until he’s no longer a candidate for office. 
It’s unlikely he’ll do any of those things. Using the perks of the office for his benefit is what happens when a politician runs for a job he already has. 
As for the other Republicans running for governor, they may want to choose something else to complain about. By harping on the notion that Rhoden is using his office for political gain, they run the risk of reminding voters that he’s the governor and they’re not.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_7788-scaled-e1769266672955-1024x727.jpg,,,2026-01-24 10:57:39.379165

Ibarra,,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/2026/01/childrens-hospital-transgender-patients-california/,Families sued to block the Justice Department's subpoena for records of young transgender patients. The agency agreed to drop its request through 2029.,"In summary
Families sued to block the Justice Department’s subpoena for records of young transgender patients. The agency agreed to drop its request through 2029.


Transgender patients of Children’s Hospital Los Angeles secured a win this week after the U.S. Department of Justice agreed to end its efforts to obtain personal and medical information of more than 3,000 young patients. 
Last summer, the federal Justice Department announced that it sent subpoenas to more than 20 medical providers that offered gender-affirming care for minors. At the time, the department said it was doing so to investigate “healthcare fraud” and “false statements.”
Seven families whose children have received gender-affirming services at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles sued in November to quash the subpoena to protect their information. 
The department never provided evidence of fraud, said Khadijah Silver, director of Gender Justice & Health Equity at Lawyers for Good Government, one of the firms representing families in the class action lawsuit. The hospital did not not turn over the requested documents. 
“It was basically a fishing expedition,” Silver said. “Without any probable cause, they did not have the authority to be seeking medical information.” 
The DOJ and Children’s Hospital Los Angeles did not immediately return requests for comment.
The department subpoena demanded the hospital provide a large range of documents, including patient intake forms, insurance claims and “documents sufficient to identify each patient (by name, date of birth, social security number, address, and parent/guardian information) who was prescribed puberty blockers or hormone therapy,” court documents show.
Under the agreement, filed in federal court Thursday, the Justice Department will withdraw requests for documents that identified patients or their families through 2029. 
Attorneys representing patients and their families have moved to dismiss the case.
“This is one piece of a large, very important puzzle, but it does allow our clients to hold on to their basic legal right to medical privacy,” Silver said. 
The settlement unfolded the same week that a judge in Baltimore rejected the Trump administration’s request to subpoena the same information from Children’s National Hospital in Washington D.C.  
The subpoena is not the only federal action that has targeted transgender patients and their providers.
Last year, the Trump administration issued an executive order that threatened to pull federal funding from medical institutions that provide gender-affirming care. Attorney General Rob Bonta filed a lawsuit over the summer seeking to block the order. 
The federal government has also issued orders that recognize only two biological sexes and prevent transgender girls and women from participating in women’s sports. A third order threatens federal funds for schools that support transgender youth.
After federal actions escalated, Children’s Hospital Los Angeles closed the doors to its Center for Transyouth Health and Development last July, leaving about 3,000 young patients in limbo. Other providers in the state have also scaled back gender-affirming services. 
“The shutdown came despite efforts my office took over recent months to assure (Children’s Hospital Los Angeles) that they were protected and required to provide gender-affirming care,” Bonta said at the time. 
Bonta’s office has filed amicus briefs opposing the Trump administration’s attempts to subpoena medical records of gender-affirming care at other hospitals including University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and Children’s Hospital Colorado. Bonta did not intervene in the case settled this week.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/021325_CHLA-Gender-Affirming-Care-Demo_JWH_CM_06.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-24 08:56:29.334769

It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
The 1967 bombing of the Beth Israel Congregation was far from a solitary act. The attack on Mississippi’s oldest synagogue came as part of a reign of terror by the nation’s most notorious Ku Klux Klan.
The newest attack on the house of worship, which happened this month, shows that “history repeats itself,” said Lindsay Baach Friedmann, South Central regional director for the Anti-Defamation League. “The question is not whether we are teaching the next generation, but what are we teaching them?”
The FBI has charged Stephen Spencer Pittman, 19, of Madison, with burning the synagogue in the predawn hours of Jan. 10. According to federal court documents, Pittman referred to it as “the synagogue of Satan” — a term used by followers of Christian Identity, a white supremacist religion that teaches that Adam and Eve were white, that non-whites are “mud people” and that Jews are the offspring of Satan.


What makes the latest attack scary is “there are a lot more of him out there,” said Rabbi Valerie Cohen, who served Beth Israel from 2003 to 2014.
During the Civil Rights era, the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan became the most violent white supremacist organization in the U.S., responsible for at least 10 killings in Mississippi. They were also responsible for dozens of church bombings as well as the bombings of the homes of civil rights and Jewish leaders.

The White Knights rose to the fore after the University of Mississippi enrolled its first Black student in 1962. By 1964, the Klan group boasted more than 90,000 members.
When news came in early 1964 that civil rights workers planned to “invade” Mississippi that summer, Imperial Wizard Sam Bowers told his Klansmen, “The events which will occur in Mississippi this summer may well determine the fate of Christianity for centuries to come.”
He urged them to get their guns ready.
“When the black waves hit our communities, we must remain calm and think in terms of our individual enemies rather than our mass enemy,” he told them. “We must roll with the mass punch which they will deliver in the streets during the day, and we must counterattack the individual leaders at night.”
Then he advised them, “Any personal attacks on the enemy should be carefully planned to include only the leaders and prime white collaborators of the enemy forces.”
On the first day of summer 1964, Klansmen killed three young civil rights workers, who were investigating the Klan’s burning of a Black church in Neshoba County. A deputy jailed Michael Schwerner, James Chaney and Andrew Goodman and released them into the hands of waiting Klansmen, who shot them to death and hid their bodies in an earthen dam.
Forty-four days later, FBI agents discovered the buried bodies. By killing the trio, the White Knights meant to send a message not just to those in the movement, but across the nation, about who held power in Mississippi, who could do as they pleased and who needed to live in fear.

Between June and October 1964, Mississippi saw the bombings of at least 48 Black churches, homes and “freedom houses,” according to records kept by the Council of Federated Organizations, an umbrella group for civil rights organizations.
That same year, the White Knights began to regard Jews as their major enemies, just as the Klan had done in the 1920s. Klansmen embraced the views of Christian Identity, which teaches that white people are the true Israelites and that Jews are imposters.
On Sept. 18, 1967, the White Knights bombed the Beth Israel synagogue, the opening salvo of the White Knights’ campaign against the Jews.
A month later, the White Knights suffered their biggest setback when a U.S. District Court jury convicted seven, including Bowers, on federal conspiracy charges for the 1964 killings of the three civil rights workers. They received prison time up to 10 years, but they initially remained free on appeal bonds.
The violence continued.
On Nov. 15, 1967, the White Knights bombed the home of the Rev. Allen Johnson, a Black Methodist member and NAACP leader in Laurel, where Bowers lived. Four nights later, a bomb ripped through the home of civil rights activist Bob Kochtitzky in Jackson.
Two days before Thanksgiving, the White Knights bombed the home of Rabbi Perry Nussbaum, leader of the Beth Israel congregation in Jackson.

More attacks followed in 1968, including the bombings of Black churches and a synagogue in Meridian.
After Meridian police determined that Klan bomber Thomas Tarrants was behind the synagogue bombing and others, a shootout took place between him and officers. He somehow survived, but his companion, Kathy Ainsworth, was killed.
After the death, Bowers wrote to an officer involved in the shootout and questioned why he would protect the Jews, calling them “the synagogue of Satan.”
Tarrants went to prison for the bombing. While there, he underwent a religious conversion that he later wrote about in his book, “Consumed by Hate, Redeemed by Love.”
Tarrants, now president emeritus of the C.S. Lewis Institute, became friends with the Rev. John Perkins of Jackson, who was beaten in jail by law enforcement for his involvement in the civil rights movement.

The latest burning of Beth Israel “is not just an attack on a building — it is an assault on human dignity, on faith and on the sacred truth that every person is made in the image of God,” said Elizabeth Perkins, co-president of The John & Vera Mae Perkins Foundation.
“My father has always said that reconciliation is born where truth and love meet,” she said. “That belief still stands. We grieve with Beth Israel. We stand with Beth Israel. And we commit ourselves again to the long, holy work of justice, reconciliation, and peace. Hate will not have the last word. Love will.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/12154649/DSC01168.jpg,,,2026-01-24 07:56:30.711528

All four said they regretted ending their pregnancies.
The state rested its case Friday after bringing to the stand a panel of witnesses who argued abortion is harmful to women and should be governed by strict regulations. It’s the same argument Missouri’s anti-abortion movement continues to make the focus of its campaign to ban the procedure.
With the trial scheduled to end Monday, the state capitalized on emotional testimony in an attempt to prove its case that these regulations, which have crippled Planned Parenthood’s ability to perform abortions, are necessary safeguards. 
Planned Parenthood and the ACLU of Missouri, which sued to strike down the laws under the state’s new voter-approved reproductive rights amendment, have argued the laws are discriminatory and unconstitutional because they have prevented tens of thousands of Missouri women over the past several years from accessing abortion without crossing state lines.
State attorneys leaned on the stories of women who sought abortions decades earlier at Missouri Planned Parenthood clinics, before the procedure, its providers and its clinics were more heavily regulated. The four described impersonal visits and overcrowded dark rooms with heavy, sad atmospheres where women were often crying.
“The abortionist came in from a side door,” testified Stephanie Jacobson, using an anti-abortion pejorative for the doctor, about the first abortion she had when she was 16 in 1978. “It was very excruciating. I must have been squirming, because they kept saying, ‘Lay still.’”
After her second abortion in 1982, this time at a local hospital, Jacobson said she miscarried another pregnancy and attributed it to her abortions. She went on to give birth to five children.
But until about nine years ago, when Jacobson said she completed an abortion recovery counseling program, she said she was depressed, angry and had thoughts of harming herself because of the choice she’d made.
The requirement that Missouri’s 26-page informed consent booklet be given to every woman seeking an abortion is one of the challenged laws in the case. While it does mention that a provider must inform the patient of “possible adverse psychological effects associated with the abortion,” it does not go into any further detail about those effects or provide any basis for the statement.
Missouri regulator says abortion clinics faced heightened scrutiny unrelated to safety

Marilyn Cox, of Hillsboro, said she was going through a divorce in 1980 when she was seeing another man and got pregnant. For financial reasons and because she “didn’t want to face” her dad, she had an abortion. 
Cox said the Planned Parenthood she went to did not properly inform her of the development of the fetus in the womb at eight weeks. She testified that she would not have gone through with the abortion if she knew that, or if she had seen it on an ultrasound.
After that, she described two near-suicide attempts, one that occurred about a year after the abortion.
“I hated my guts,” she testified.
Linda Raymond took the stand on Tuesday and spoke about the effects of her abortion in 1976, saying she had depression, anxiety, nightmares and flashbacks, and is still on an anti-depressant today. Like Jacobson, she said she found a “post-abortive” counselor to help her through it.
And Crystal Lane had an abortion in 2009, during a divorce when she was dating someone else. Lane said she didn’t want to bring more children into a volatile family situation, as she already had two at home.
“No one at the (Planned Parenthood) clinic coerced me, but I wasn’t told how it would affect me,” Lane said.
Lane said she’d had some substance abuse issues before the abortion, and later became addicted to methamphetamine. She said it wasn’t until she went through a program focused on healing from abortion that she could process the trauma. The program encouraged her to name the fetus she aborted, and she now has the name “Starling” tattooed above her right eyebrow.
During cross-examination of the witnesses, attorneys for Planned Parenthood pointed out that three of the four women testified they had been abused by someone close to them. Raymond said her mother physically abused her, Lane said her ex-husband and father were abusive and Cox said her previous marriage was abusive.
Many studies show women who experience intimate partner violence are at increased risk for developing mental health problems, including post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and substance abuse disorders.
Attorneys for Planned Parenthood affiliates and the ACLU of Missouri repeatedly challenged the relevance and expertise of the state’s witnesses on scientific and relevancy grounds, leading to drawn-out exchanges that eventually drove Deputy Solicitor General Peter Donohue to accuse the other side of purposely doing it to “run out the clock.”
But the witnesses still provided plenty of testimony, despite the objections.
An Ohio nurse practitioner named Maureen Curley testified that although she hadn’t referred anyone for an abortion in 20 years, her counseling of patients who had abortions led her to believe that motherhood is protective, and giving birth is “psychologically safer” than abortion. 
She said even in a case like the 10-year-old girl in Ohio who was pregnant as a result of incest and had to travel to Indiana for an abortion, giving birth would be more protective from a mental health standpoint.
Abortion safety takes center stage as Missouri trial enters second week

St. Louis Dr. Andrew Steele, an OB-GYN who largely performs pelvic-related surgeries, said he’s seen four cases of abortion complications between 2009 and 2023. And one California doctor who had performed a different type of abortions than today’s practice between 1987 and 1994 was largely excluded from testifying after the plaintiffs objected.
Plaintiffs unsuccessfully sought to exclude the testimony of Priscilla Coleman, a retired professor of human development and family studies who frequently writes and testifies against abortion. Coleman’s papers, some of which have linked abortion to increased risks of mental health problems, have faced criticism and even retraction.
On cross examination, attorneys for Planned Parenthood tried to accuse Coleman of cherry picking data points and studies that supported her anti-abortion views. Coleman provided an expert report in the case and told the court she had read each of the 280 papers she cited in that document. But she acknowledged she removed one of her citations of a study published only in Turkish, which she does not speak, after it was pointed out by plaintiffs. 
Coleman testified she believed abortion should be illegal in almost all cases, including rape.
She acknowledged that the American Psychological Association, the National Academy of Sciences and the United Kingdom’s Royal College of Psychiatrists have all concluded that scientific literature shows no association between abortion and adverse mental health, but said scientists were breaching ethics to advance abortion rights.
“I believe there’s an effort to distort the literature,” she said. 
A temporary injunction blocked most of Missori’s abortion regulations pending trial.  Until a ruling is made, the Planned Parenthood clinics in Kansas City, Columbia and St. Louis continue offering appointments for procedural abortions. Medication abortion remains unavailable.

[…]","The Missouri Capitol Building in Jefferson City (Getty Images).January is National Mentoring Month, a time often marked by good intentions and well-meaning reminders to “give back.” But mentoring is not a box to check or a seasonal act of generosity.
In Missouri—at a time when leadership pipelines are strained, women continue to exit the workforce, and civic trust feels fragile—mentoring is essential infrastructure.
I have spent much of my career mentoring women leaders across Missouri: women balancing careers and caregiving, women stepping into leadership for the first time, women returning after a setback, and women wondering whether the table they worked so hard to reach truly has a seat for them. Through my work with the Greater Missouri Leadership Foundation (Greater MO), I have seen again and again that mentoring is not about advice alone. It is about belief, access, accountability—and support that helps women soar.
That support matters more than ever. According to the Women in the Workplace study from McKinsey & Co. and LeanIn.Org, one of the biggest drivers of women’s ability to advance in their careers is the level of career support they receive. But women still receive less of that support, particularly early and later in their careers, which can limit their professional growth. It also robs our economy of the benefits of their full potential.
At Greater MO, our mission is to strengthen Missouri by preparing women for civic, community, and organizational leadership. That work is grounded in a simple but powerful truth: leadership does not develop in isolation. It develops in relationship, and all of us have a role to play.
When women are supported and mentored well, they stay engaged, pursue promotions, run for boards, step into public service, and remain connected to their communities. When they are not, we see the opposite: talent loss, disengagement, and leadership gaps that ripple across sectors. Mentoring is how we build a sustainable pipeline of leaders who are prepared not only to lead organizations, but to steward communities.
But despite the overwhelming evidence of the importance of mentorship to our workplaces and our economy, mentorship remains too scarce. Research shows that women are 24% less likely than men to get advice from senior leaders, and 62% of women of color say the lack of an influential mentor holds them back. And while the vast majority of Fortune 500 companies offer mentorship programs, uptake is a challenge—with less than a quarter of employees taking advantage of the programs available to them.
We can do better.
National Mentoring Month is an invitation—to individuals, organizations, and communities—to take mentoring seriously. Not as a program, but as practice. Not as charity, but as strategy.
If you are further along in your career, consider who is watching your path and wondering if theirs is possible. If you are earlier in your journey, seek out those who ask thoughtful questions and honor your full life, not just your résumé. And if you lead an organization, ask whether mentoring and structured support systems are embedded into your culture—or left to chance.
Mentoring does not require perfection or decades of experience—only presence, curiosity, and a willingness to share both lessons learned and lessons still unfolding. In fact, research shows peer mentorship leads to longer-lasting relationships and is just as effective as traditional mentorship.
One of the most meaningful mentoring relationships in my own life came at a moment when I did not yet have the language for what I needed. My mentor did not hand me a blueprint. Instead, she asked better questions: What do you want your life to look like? What are you optimizing for right now? What does “enough” look like in this season?
Those questions stayed with me. They shaped how I lead, how I mentor, and how I encourage others to define success on their own terms—not as perfection, but as progress with intention.
The future of leadership in Missouri will not be built by accident. It will be built through relationships, intention, unwavering support, and the quiet, powerful work of mentoring—one conversation, one goal, one rising leader at a time.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-512285042-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-24 06:57:33.680245

You know the ones—ominous music, grainy photos, and a narrator who sounds like they gargle gravel for a living. We’ve all seen them. We’ve all heard them. And at this point, we’re anesthetized. Political Novocaine.
Enough.
Montana deserves better than campaigns that treat voters like raccoons rummaging through ideological trash cans. We deserve ideas, not insults. Debates, not drive-by smear jobs. Sunlight, not sludge.
And that brings us—unavoidably—to incumbent Sen. Steve Daines.
Rather than showing up in Montana for public town halls, rather than standing in front of voters and answering unscripted questions, Daines has perfected a different approach – absence. He won’t hold a public town hall. He won’t face constituents. Instead, Montanans get something else entirely—well-financed, vicious attack ads, launched long before an election and even before a candidate has formally declared.
That’s offensive.
If you won’t show up, don’t send a hit piece in your place. Montana is not a focus group. Democracy is not a mailer campaign. And an attack ad is not a substitute for showing your face and answering hard questions.
Daines should show up. Sending a slick, cynical attack ad instead doesn’t cut it.
Now let’s be honest about what just happened—because it tells us everything we need to know.
University of Montana President Seth Bodnar resigns his position, and before he even announces a campaign, before he files for office, before he says a word about running, Republicans launch a vicious attack ad.
Day. One.
That’s not confidence. That’s fear.
You don’t unload the attack ads that early unless you’re scared stiff.
No welcome. No thanks for service. No “let’s debate the issues.” Just straight into the gutter, guns blazing, facts optional. Misleading claims. Flat-out untruths. The political equivalent of throwing a punch before the bell rings.
Shame on them.
This is exactly why Bodnar is such a compelling candidate. The very speed and savagery of the attacks are the tell. When the ideas are weak, the attacks get loud. When the record can’t compete, the mud comes out early.
Here’s a radical thought: What if candidates held 56 debates across Montana? Fifty-six. One for every county. Let voters ask questions. Let candidates explain who they are, what they’ve done, and what they actually plan to do—rather than explaining why their opponent is apparently the third cousin of Satan.
Crazy, right?
Attack ads don’t persuade; they poison. No one watches one and says, “Wow, that really enriched my understanding of public policy.” They say, “I hate all of you now.” These ads ruin television, make public service unattractive, and convince good people that running for office isn’t worth the personal abuse.
Attack ads are why decent people stay home and cable news stays rich.
This isn’t the Montana way. Or at least, it didn’t used to be.
Which brings me back to Bodnar.
Under his leadership, UM stretched to new heights: roughly $300 million in infrastructure improvements—much donor-funded; R-1 research status (a very big deal); rising enrollment; better retention. He took on a tough job and exceeded expectations.
Now, according to reports, Bodnar may run for the U.S. Senate—as an independent. And suddenly the political establishment loses its mind.
Let’s pause on something important: Bodnar is a real public servant. Full stop.
First in his class at West Point. Rhodes Scholar. Truman Scholar. Green Beret. Multiple combat deployments. Lieutenant Colonel in the Montana National Guard—still serving. Leadership under fire isn’t theoretical for him; it’s lived.
This guy didn’t read about leadership—he graded it.
He taught economics at West Point. He served as a senior executive at General Electric. He knows how large, complicated systems work—and how to fix them.
So what do the attack ads do? They lie.
They claim Bodnar raised tuition by 30%. False. Tuition is set by the Board of Regents, appointed by Gov. Gianforte. If you’re angry, aim accordingly.
What Bodnar actually did was create the Grizzly Promise: Students from families earning $50,000 or less attend UM tuition-free—about a quarter of undergraduates. The average Montana student paid around $3,000 a year in tuition. That’s not an increase. That’s a lifeline.
They claim he’s anti-woman. Also false. His record includes hiring and promoting accomplished women across campus leadership—law, business, conservation and beyond.
Montana deserves truth—not attack-ad garbage. Not politics as a blood sport. Not tribal stupidity served with gusto. 
Public service should not require body armor.
This is a call for higher integrity and higher discourse—from every party and every candidate. Tell us your vision. Tell us your ideas. Tell us how you’ll make Montana stronger.
And if you’re already in office, show up. Face the people you represent.
Just spare us the lies, the fear-mongering, and the political junk food.
Montana deserves better. And we should demand it—loudly.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/bodnar-1024x885.jpg,,,2026-01-24 06:57:33.680245

Megan Degenfelder, Wyoming's top education official, proclaimed a desire to someday be president back in high school. Today, she’s running to become the state’s second female governor, the first in a century.
The post Degenfelder sets sights on long-held ambition to lead Wyoming appeared first on WyoFile .","CASPER—Liz Masterson has been a high school journalism teacher long enough that some of her current students have parents who also took her classes. 
A lot of things have changed in the course of the almost two decades since Masterson began her career. But she still remembers Megan Degenfelder’s drive, especially compared to other students.  
“She said she wanted to be the first woman to be president of the United States,” Masterson recalled. 
Upon graduation, Degenfelder forged a path she now says sets her apart from other Republicans in the race to be Wyoming’s next governor — and potentially the first woman to hold the office since Nellie Tayloe Ross a century ago.
Degenfelder’s resume looks like one drawn up to check every box for an ideal Wyoming politician. She attended the University of Wyoming and then studied economics in Beijing, where she wrote a master’s thesis on coal and natural gas. She then spent about a decade in the energy industry. She also worked for U.S. Sen. Cynthia Lummis in D.C. and served under former Superintendent Jillian Balow in Cheyenne. In 2022, when voters elected Degenfelder as superintendent of public instruction, she became one of the youngest statewide officials in Wyoming history. 
“Now here we are,” Masterson told WyoFile at a Tuesday night campaign event in Degenfelder’s hometown. 
In a capacious, modern outbuilding dubbed “The Barn” by its affluent owners, Tiffany and Blake Gamble, on the Oil City’s eastern outskirts, dozens of Degenfelder’s family members, friends and supporters gathered. 
Wearing a red jacket and skirt with a turquoise squash blossom necklace, Degenfelder moved easily from one conversation to another, shaking hands, laughing and smiling. Her long blonde waves curled away from her face.

The crowd leaned younger, closer to Degenfelder’s age of 37, and was a contrast to the typical older turnout at GOP events in Wyoming. A gaggle of children ran around in red campaign T-shirts while parents and other attendees munched on Domino’s pizza. For many of those in the room, Degenfelder’s bid for governor felt both inevitable and thrilling. 
“I’m fired up,” Tiffany Gamble told WyoFile before her opening remarks. 
Standing in the truck bed of a blue, cherry-condition, vintage Ford, Gamble spoke into a microphone about her time with Degenfelder at Natrona County High School. Together they served as student body president and vice president. 
“Of course, Megan, she was president,” Gamble said. But the evening was not strictly about friendship, she added.
“We have a clear choice to make,” she said. “Do we drift toward middle-of-the-road politics, trying to please everyone, borrowing liberal ideas that don’t fit who we are? Or, do we stand firm in our conservative values?”
“I can tell you, my family is choosing the latter,” Gamble said. 
As superintendent, Degenfelder has not shied away from aligning with the right flank of the party. She backed legislation to authorize charter schools and a voucher program to make public funds available for private tuition. (The latter remains in limbo after it was challenged in court as unconstitutional.) She also supported legislation limiting transgender students’ participation in school sports and bathroom accessibility, and cheered the Trump administration’s dismantling of the U.S. Department of Education. 
Still, the Wyoming Republican Party has not always backed Degenfelder. 
In 2022, when Balow resigned from her superintendent post to take a job in Virginia, the party voted to nominate three other finalists over Degenfelder, even though she had served in a key leadership position at the state’s education department. More recently, the Wyoming Freedom Caucus, a group of Republican lawmakers that’s gained a significant foothold in the party, has been mum about her gubernatorial bid while weighing in on other statewide races, and taking aim at Degenfelder’s most evenly matched opponent, Sen. Eric Barlow of Gillette. 
But Degenfelder has something now she didn’t have in years past. This time, the most powerful person in the country is backing her campaign. Four days before she announced her plans, President Donald Trump gave his endorsement. 
“Should she decide to enter this Race, ‘MAGA’ Megan Degenfelder has my Complete and Total Endorsement,” Trump posted online. “RUN, MEGAN, RUN!”
Although Degenfelder defeated Trump-endorsed incumbent candidate Brian Schroeder in 2022, Trump’s endorsement counts for a lot in Wyoming, where 75% of voters supported him in 2024. Her campaign Facebook page includes a photo of him next to an image of her. 
Bryan Dugas, Degenfelder’s husband of about a decade, introduced her Tuesday night. 
“I’m a better Christian, a better husband, better physician, a better man because of Megan,” Dugas said. “And we have the opportunity to support her and her aspiration to better this entire state, its people and its future.”

After Degenfelder stepped into the truck bed, she began by thanking her hometown supporters and her mom, Cheryl, who died in 2024. 
“She hated politics, but she’s with us, and I’m very grateful for that,” Degenfelder said. 
From there, Degenfelder asked the crowd to go back in time with her to the mid-1800s, “when a group of people on the East Coast of the United States of America heard about the promise of a better life out west.”
She described their journey as the greatest risk of their lives. And she spoke about her own family, who ultimately wound up west of Casper and would come to grow a life from half a section of land to over 8,000 acres. 
“They arrived at this place after this journey — if they survived — and they look around and nothing’s here,” Degenfelder said. 
There were, of course, people here. She did not mention the Indigenous people who inhabited the land going back at least 12,000 years, or the Plains Indians, whose pragmatic routes over mountain passes, along river corridors and across sagebrush basins were followed by early Euro-American immigrants and explorers. 
When her ancestors and other settlers arrived, Degenfelder said, “they started building something bigger than themselves. That’s who we are as Wyomingites.” 
Today people expect elected leaders to “get out of the way,” she said, “but to fight hard as hell for Wyoming when it matters most.”
The fight at Wyoming’s doorstep, as described by Degenfelder, includes: coastal elites and celebrities “trying to push a climate agenda” that hurts the state’s jobs and revenue, transgender athletes and “radical activists that are literally trying to redefine genders of children,” a lack of respect for the rule of law and for citizenship, assaults on ICE agents and law enforcement officers, child care fraud in Minnesota, and New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani “who literally hates everything that we stand for in America.” 
Degenfelder made a vow if elected governor.
“I will protect our conservative values and way of life because our rights, our freedoms, they come from God, not from the government, and they cannot be taken away,” she said.

Many of those supporting Degenfelder’s gubernatorial campaign were by her side in 2022 when she ran for superintendent, including Kayleigh Clark. 
At the event, Clark told WyoFile she recalls working with “a bunch of other moms” to put together Degenfelder’s Casper Parade day float, and sharing an excitement with them about “where we live.”
Clark doesn’t think of herself as a political person, she said, but learned from seeing her parents review the Casper Star-Tribune’s voter guides over the years to be informed about her choices. Clark now has two children and said she wants to be a part of setting up the state for success. 
“Now feels like a different energy,” she said. Tiffany Gamble echoed that, telling WyoFile it feels like a “whole new generation” becoming more interested in politics. 
Gamble recently founded Powder River Prep, a private school in Casper, due to growing concern with “politics brought into the classroom,” she said.
The school is “rooted in conservative values and faith-based principles,” according to its website. Families need more choices, Gamble said, lamenting that her school cannot receive state funding and voicing her appreciation for Degenfelder’s support of school choice. 
As a member of the State Board of Land Commissioners, Degenfelder has opposed Prism Logistics’ development of a gravel mine at the base of Casper Mountain. Even so, Prism’s owner, Kyle True, was there Tuesday to support her campaign.   
“There are bigger issues than my little business,” True said, adding that he’s been impressed with her time in statewide office. 
In an interview with WyoFile at the event, Degenfelder answered questions about recent budget cuts supported by the Legislature’s Joint Appropriations Committee. The panel sent shockwaves around Wyoming when it recommended major cuts to the University of Wyoming, the defunding of Wyoming Public Media and the elimination of the Wyoming Business Council.
“I support that the Joint Appropriations Committee is trying to get people’s attention. They are trying to make sure that people know what government is funding, and really to have that conversation about it,” Degenfelder said when asked about the committee’s proposal to cut roughly 11% of UW’s block grant. 
“Now, do I think that the $40 million cut to the University of Wyoming is the right move right now? No,” she said. “I think we can find where that sweet spot is.”
As a UW graduate, Degenfelder said she wants “the best” for the school, but that “doesn’t mean we just allow runaway spending.” 
Asked about her stance on the committee’s proposal to dismantle the Wyoming Business Council, Degenfelder said the state’s tax structure is at odds with the agency. 
“It’s very difficult for them to be successful,” she said, adding that economic development has a place in Wyoming. 
“But when we talk about economic diversification, it’s incredibly difficult to do,” Degenfelder said.

Lastly, Degenfelder told WyoFile she wants “people to get excited about politics again” and “this new wave of Republican politics in the state of Wyoming and the next generation of leaders and the opportunity that we have.”
Before any of Tuesday night’s speeches, the lights and country music came down. People quieted their conversations and turned their attention to a large projector screen. A glossy campaign video played, casting a red glow over the darkened room.
There was Degenfelder. Coaching the UW women’s rugby team. A rifle slung over her shoulder in a sagebrush sea. Walking her rescue dogs across Laramie’s campus. Atop a horse. At War Memorial Stadium. In a classroom. On Fox News.

In his budget proposal released Jan. 15, Gov. Jim Pillen proposed to transfer $40 million, over two years, out of the Nebraska Environmental Trust to finance a new boat marina along with bank stabilization work at Lewis & Clark Lake, and to pay for water conservation projects – two things previously funded using state taxpayer funds.
The $40 million take, which must be approved by the Legislature, would nearly exhaust about $20 million-a-year in state lottery proceeds given to the Trust to dole out annually via competitive grants to enhance and conserve the state’s environment.


Amendment proposed
A proposed constitutional amendment introduced in the Nebraska Legislature would “cut out all of this nonsense, and preserve the (Environmental) Trust,” according to former State Sen. Sandy Scofield, the head of the watchdog group, Friends of the Environmental Trust.
Legislative Resolution 298CA, by State Sen. Tom Brandt of Plymouth, would let voters decide whether Trust funds only can be used for “the conservation, enhancement, or restoration of the natural physical and biological environment in Nebraska.”
It also would require state agencies to come up with a 50% match for any funds granted to them by the Trust.


The $32.7 million earmarked for the Lewis & Clark Lake marina and bank improvements would nearly replace the $37.5 million in state tax funds that Pillen set aside for the project last year. The $8 million in Trust funds proposed for the Water Resources Cash Fund mirrors a request made recently by the Nebraska Department of Water, Energy and Environment, which administers the fund.
Neil Sullivan, the governor’s budget director, told the Examiner in an email that using $40 million in Trust funds, rather than state taxpayer funds, “contributes toward delivering both a balanced budget and additional property tax relief.”
But Jon Oberg, a former director of the Nebraska Department of Administrative Services who has sued previously to prevent a transfer of Trust funds, characterized the use of Trust money to replace general taxpayer funds as “classic money laundering” to solve a state budget problem.
Oberg, in an email, said he hopes the Legislature’s Appropriations Committee rejects the Pillen administration’s attempt to “circumvent the Constitution” and “uphold(s) budget integrity.”
He said rejection of the transfer by state lawmakers is preferable to requiring “citizen lawsuits” like the one he and W. Don Nelson, a chief of staff under then Gov. Bob Kerrey, filed in 2020 to block a swap of Trust grants to benefit an ethanol blender pump project.
In May, Oberg threatened – but didn’t file – a lawsuit against the Pillen administration’s proposal to transfer $15 million in Trust funds to sustain a state water conservation fund.

The proposed Trust fund transfer comes as Pillen looks to close a $471 million budget gap by tapping excess state funds (see infobox) and cutting government spending.
The Legislature has, in past years, approved transfers of funds from the Trust into the Water Resources Cash Fund. Local natural resources districts use that fund to finance projects that conserve water and soil. Backers say it fits with the Trust’s stated purpose “to conserve, enhance and restore the natural environments of Nebraska.”
The Environmental Trust currently shows a surplus fund balance of about $20.6 million, but that does not include a recent $6.5 million transfer from the state lottery at the end of December.
The governor’s fund transfer proposals in Legislative Bill 1072 call for $32.7 million for the Lewis & Clark Lake work to be transferred by June 30, which raises the question of whether the Trust will have enough money by then.
Questions also have been raised about whether Trust funds can be used for “recreation” projects, such as a marina for boats at Lewis & Clark Lake.
Sullivan, the state budget official, said recent Trust grants have included a discovery center at Pecan Creek in Lincoln and renovation of Memphis Lake. He said the Lewis & Clark project would improve public access to the lake and include shoreline restoration and enhancement of fish habitat.

“Using these funds to protect the vital groundwater and surface water resources and for lake improvements, access enhancements and shoreline restoration is a clear constitutional and commonsense use of the funds allocated to the Environmental Trust,” he said.
But former State Sen. Sandy Scofield, who heads a watchdog group called Friends of the Environmental Trust, said financing a marina for 350 motorboats and sailboats at Lewis & Clark Lake doesn’t fit with the Trust’s purpose.
“The only habitat it creates is for predatory humans,” Scofield said. “I love the [marina] idea, and I’d certainly support the project, but it’s not even remotely appropriate for the Nebraska Environmental Trust.”
Last year, the governor had a bill introduced to expand the use of Trust funds to include “recreation” and the construction of new cabins at state parks, but the bill didn’t advance.
Scofield added that transferring almost all of the Trust’s funds to one project — at Lewis & Clark Lake — runs contrary to the Trust’s goal of spreading the lottery money to all counties and cities across Nebraska.
“It’s just unfair to everyone in the rest of the state to play games like this,” she said.

Other proposed fund transfers
Besides the $40 million transfer from the Nebraska Environmental Trust, Gov. Jim Pillen’s budget proposes several other fund transfers to the general fund, including:
* $50.7 million from the Water Recreation Enhancement Fund. (It was created by the so-called STARWARS committee, created in 2021 to improve recreational opportunities in the state. The original proposals included new marinas at Lewis & Clark Lake and Lake McConaughy, a new lodge at Niobrara State Park and a huge sandpit lake between Omaha and Lincoln.)
* $18 million from the Economic Recovery Contingency Fund.
* $13.8 million from the Nebraska Capital Construction Fund.
* $7.8 million from the Health and Human Services Cash Fund.
* $6.5 million from the Homeless Shelter Assistance Trust Fund.
* $5.7 million from the Perkins County Canal Project Fund.
* $4.9 million from the Trail Development and Maintenance Fund.
* $2.4 million from the Nebraska Rural Projects Fund.
* $5 million from the Records Management Cash Fund.
* $2.5 million from the Secretary of State Cash Fund.

In an effort to help Idahoans follow major bills, resolutions and memorials through the legislative process, the Idaho Capital Sun will produce a “legislative notebook” at the end of each week to gather information in one place that concerns major happenings in the Legislature and other news relating to state government. To receive the full extent of our reporting in your inbox each day, sign up for our free email newsletter, The Sunrise, on our website at idahocapitalsun.com/subscribe/.
Here is our quick rundown of the major happenings during the second week of the Idaho Legislature’s 2026 session.



 First bill to conform Idaho’s tax code with ‘Big, Beautiful’ bill emerges

One of the biggest puzzles Idaho legislators must solve in the 2026 legislative session – and every session – is the state budget. And one of the biggest pieces to that puzzle this year is how the state will choose to conform with the “One Big Beautiful Bill” Act championed by President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress.
In most legislative sessions, a tax conformity bill is usually one of the first pieces of legislation to be introduced, often with little fan fare or debate. But 2026 is different due to those massive changes to the federal tax code.
On Friday, Rep. Jeff Ehlers, R-Meridian, unveiled a proposal that would adopt nearly all the tax deductions that were included in Trump’s megabill, which Ehlers estimates could cost the state about $155 million in lost tax revenue each year that the deductions are in effect.
Idaho Legislature’s budget committee adopts more optimistic revenue forecast

“This is a much bigger bill this year,” he said before the House Revenue and Taxation Committee.
There are about 39 tax code changes from the massive federal tax and spending bill — such as no taxes on a worker’s tips, no taxes on some workers’ overtime, and various business deductions — most of which have financial implications for the state.
The timing of these tax changes matter, and there are different ideas from elected officials on when Idaho should conform with the federal law.
Ehlers estimated the changes will cost $155 million annually, which is the same as what the governor projected in his budget proposal. However, Gov. Brad Little’s proposed budget assumed the tax changes would take place starting in the next fiscal year. Ehlers’ proposal would have the budget reductions hit in the current fiscal year.
If the state adopts the changes for the current 2026 fiscal year, that could put additional strain on the Idaho State Tax Commission as it rolls into the busiest part of tax season. It may also lead to more Idahoans having to file amended tax returns.

The issue becomes even more complicated because some of the definitions states must use to apply to their own taxes from the “Big, Beautiful” bill have not yet been released by the federal government. That means Idaho lawmakers don’t have a clear estimate on how much conforming to the GOP megabill will actually cost as they set the state budgets for all agencies and departments.
Idaho officials have cited estimates on the cost of adopting all the tax changes that ranged from $115 million to around $400 million, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported.
Asked why he chose to use the retroactive date, Ehlers noted that some of the changes expire in 2028, such as the no taxes on tips or overtime. 
“If we don’t allow them to take it in 2025, then they’re missing one of the four years,” Ehlers said in an interview. “So that’s like 25% of the benefit; they’re only going to take it for the three years. So, we wanted to make sure that they got the full four years of the One Big Beautiful Bill.”
 House committee narrowly rejects introducing bill that would have eliminated Idaho’s Hispanic commission

After a tie vote in the House State Affairs Committee on Thursday, a draft bill that would have eliminated the Idaho Commission on Hispanic Affairs was not introduced for further consideration. 
House committee rejects bill to eliminate Idaho Commission on Hispanic Affairs

Rep. Heather Scott, R-Blanchard, presented a draft bill that would have repealed any mention of the commission from state code, eliminating it completely by July 1. Scott served on the Legislature’s interim DOGE committee, named after the federal (and now defunct) Department of Government Efficiency, which was tasked with finding bloat in state government programs and budgets to cut.
Some members of the state DOGE committee said the commission represents “DEI,” which stands for diversity, equity and inclusion, and voted to recommend its elimination last year.
The governor’s proposed budget for the commission is $288,500 in state general funds, according to the state legislative budget book.
 Legislation of interest during the first week of the 2025 session

House Resolution 20: Sponsored by Rep. Monica Church, D-Boise, the resolution condemns political violence, honors the lives of those killed or injured, and calls on all Idahoans to reject all forms of such violence. It is on the House’s third reading calendar and may be taken up in the coming days of the session.
House Bill 489: Sponsored by Rep. Bruce Skaug, R-Nampa, the bill adds to existing law to prohibit the use of a mask or disguise during a criminal offense. It is on the House’s third reading calendar and may be taken up in the coming days of the session.
House Bill  491: Sponsored by Rep. Marco Erickson, the bill amends Idaho’s existing Good Samaritan law to protect people who give aid to an individual that is experiencing a mental health or suicidal crisis. The bill prevents a civil lawsuit from being filed against someone who stops at the scene of an emergency and, “in good faith,” tries to provide assistance, unless they are found to be “grossly negligent.” It is on the House’s third reading calendar and may be taken up in the coming days of the session.
House Bill 493: Sponsored by Rep. Britt Raybould, R-Rexburg, the bill would make it a felony on a first offense for anyone 21 years or older to solicit commercial sexual activity. Idaho’s current law provides for charging a misdemeanor for the first offense, followed by a felony for the second offense. It is on the House’s third reading calendar and may be taken up in the coming days of the session.
 What to expect next week at the Idaho Legislature

Quick note: Many committees, especially at the beginning of the session, have agenda items known as an RS (which stands for routing slip). That’s legislative talk for “draft legislation.” An RS is not a public record until a committee votes to introduce the bill. Many of those agenda items are only listed by subject matter, so it’s impossible to ascertain what the RS is specifically about, other than the few words used to describe the RS until the introductory hearing takes place.
IDAHO SENATE
Senate Resources and Environment Committee
1:30 p.m. Monday: The committee is scheduled to hold introductory hearings on an RS relating to “Consolidation of the Soil and Water Conservation Commission,” and it will consider the gubernatorial appointments of Kenneth Long of Horseshoe Bend and Carl Rey of Boise to the Outfitters and Guides Licensing Board.
Senate Education Committee
3 p.m. Monday: The committee is scheduled to hold a public hearing on Senate Bill 1225, which would change Idaho law to reduce the public disclosure requirements of finalists for the state’s open public university presidency positions from five finalists down to one sole finalist. The committee is also scheduled to hold an introductory hearing on an RS that would change “Lewis-Clark State College’s name to Lewis-Clark State University throughout Idaho Code.”
IDAHO HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
House Education Committee
9 a.m. Monday: The committee is scheduled to hold an introductory hearing on an RS relating to “Education funding, disabilities.
House Health and Welfare Committee
9 a.m. Monday: The committee is scheduled to hold seven introductory hearings on RSs relating to “cottage food operations,” “yellow dot program,” “directed blood product transfusions,” “health care cash payments,” “health benefit plans – cancer medications,” “midwifery,” and “epinephrine delivery systems.”
House State Affairs Committee
9 a.m. Monday: The committee is scheduled to hold an introductory hearing on an RS relating to  “flags, gov entities, penalties.”
Idaho constitutional amendment proposed by state senator to protect public lands

House Local Government Committee
1:30 p.m. Monday:  The committee is scheduled to hold an introductory hearing on an RS relating to “agricultural pests” and “open meetings, public comment.”
House Transportation and Defense Committee
1:30 p.m. Monday: The committee is scheduled to hold four introductory hearings on RSs relating to “vehicle registration stickers,” “parent-student driver’s training,” “transportation, identity,” and “transportation, funding, fuels.”
 Quote of the week

“I wanted feedback. I wanted a lot of feedback, because it deals with a very personal matter for every Idahoan, and that is our public land here in Idaho.” – Sen. Ben Adams, R-Nampa, who introduced a proposal on Wednesday to amend the state constitution to protect public lands acquired by the state from the federal government

Idaho Supreme Court Chief Justice G. Richard Bevan gave the annual “State of the Judiciary” speech to the Idaho House and Idaho Senate on Wednesday, asking legislators to thoughtfully consider how best to protect public officials and members of the public who use the court system as threats made against judges in the state continue to rise.
“Threats directed at Idaho judges and courts have increased significantly in recent years, and while most never materialize, those that do require precautions that can disrupt court operations and delay the delivery of justice,” Bevan told legislators.

It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
Secretary of State Michael Watson says that strengthening Mississippi’s notoriously lax campaign-finance laws will be his top legislative priority this year. 
Attempts to tighten Mississippi’s campaign spending laws have sputtered in recent legislative sessions. Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have been reluctant to consider any reform. But Watson, a Republican who helps administer the state’s elections, said recent criminal corruption allegations against local officials have renewed his push. 
“This is not just a political issue,” Watson said. “This is a crime-fighting issue.” 
A federal grand jury last year indicted two county sheriffs in the Mississippi Delta on charges of corruption linked to an alleged drug-trafficking scheme. The two have pleaded not guilty, though court documents allege that undercover law enforcement agents bribed the officials through campaign donations.

Hinds County District Attorney Jody Owens and former Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba are also fighting federal bribery charges, where law enforcement agents accuse them of accepting bribes in the form of campaign donations. They have pleaded not guilty. 
Watson’s proposal would require local and state candidates to file reports online, cap cash donations to political candidates at $1,000 and transfer enforcement authority from the Mississippi Ethics Commission to both the Secretary of State’s office and the Attorney General’s office.
If a candidate does not have reliable access to the internet or is unable to operate a computer, they can send a facsimile copy or a letter of their report to the Secretary of State’s office, who will then upload the report online.

The secretary of state said he has worked with Sen. Jeremy England, a Republican from Vancleave, and Attorney General Lynn Fitch in crafting a bill. 
MaryAsa Lee, a spokesperson for Fitch, told Mississippi Today in a statement that the Attorney General’s Office was proud to work with Watson and legislative leaders on the bill, and Mississippians deserve to control their own elections.

“Together, we have created a package of reforms that will close the loopholes that allow outside, special-interest dark money to flow into Mississippi elections,” Lee said. “We are hopeful that this year the Legislature will make these reforms.”
Mississippi’s current law has a confusing, conflicting enforcement system that gives some responsibilities to the secretary of state’s office, the attorney general’s office and the Ethics Commission. 
The new proposal would task Watson’s office with investigating violations and Fitch’s office with prosecuting them if a crime has occurred. The only time the Ethics Commission would step in is if the secretary of state’s office was involved in alleged violations. 
England is the author of the legislation, and the lieutenant governor’s office has referred the measure to the Senate Elections Committee, which England leads. 
The Jackson County lawmaker said he’s hopeful the Legislature will pass the measure because it’s important for the state’s elections to be as “transparent as possible.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/21165710/MG_9221.jpg,,,2026-01-24 06:57:33.680245

Wes Wolfe/Georgia Recorder March 10 is shaping up to be a busy day 
There are now four special elections set for March 10 in Georgia.
The most closely watched will be the race to fill former Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene’s seat in northwest Georgia. Nearly two dozen candidates signed up to run in what is known as a jungle primary, which is when all the candidates appear on the same ballot at once, and if no candidate gets more than half the vote, the top two compete in a runoff.
With so many names on the ballot, the race for the 14th Congressional District will surely go to an April 7 runoff. 
But there are also now three state legislative races set for that day. 
One election is to replace ex-state Sen. Colton Moore, a Trenton Republican who is running for Greene’s seat. Senate District 53 includes Walker, Dade, Chattooga, Catoosa and part of Floyd counties. 
Candidates can start qualifying for the special election Thursday. 
There are also two House seats on the ballot after a pair of lawmakers resigned shortly before the start of the 2026 session. 
Former state Rep. Karen Bennett, a Stone Mountain Democrat, resigned before being charged with unemployment fraud. She pleaded guilty Wednesday to making false statements to obtain the aid, according to a press release from the U.S. Attorney’s office for the Northern District of Georgia. 
House District 94 includes portions of DeKalb and Gwinnett counties. Qualifying for the seat starts Monday. 
Ex-state Rep. Lynn Heffner, an Augusta Democrat, said she was stepping down because damage to her home from Hurricane Helene left her unable to satisfy a state law requiring lawmakers to live in the district they represent. House District 130 includes part of Richmond County. Candidates can start qualifying Monday. 
Winter storm Fern will freeze the state legislative session, at least for a day.  
House leaders announced they would delay the start of Monday’s session until 1 p.m. and that no legislative business would be conducted that day. The Senate is still set to gavel in Monday morning but the chamber is expected to be quiet. The Senate committee meetings that were scheduled for Monday have been canceled. 
Gov. Brian Kemp declared a statewide state of emergency Thursday ahead of the weekend storm that is expected to bring a wintry mix and wind gusts that could take down trees and power lines and cause other damage. 
“If you can just stay off the roads, that would be a big favor to us and help keep everybody safe,” Kemp told reporters during a virtual media briefing Thursday. Kemp was in Belgium Thursday on an economic development trip. 
Monday will be the sixth official day of the 2026 session, which is set to end April 2. Lawmakers are scheduled to be in session through Thursday next week. 
Announcements:
Denise Pierce Burns, who is the former GOP congressional district chair, announced Friday that she will run to replace former state Sen. Colton Moore. In a press release, the homeschool mom describes herself as a homesteader who has also advocated for “food freedom, medical freedom and small farms.” 
Ross Sheppard, a Milledgeville Democrat, has launched his House campaign for District 149. Sheppard is a Milledgeville native who says he served as a legislative aide while in college for former longtime Rep. Rusty Kidd, who died in 2020, before working as a lobbyist. He’s challenging Democratic incumbent, Rep. Floyd Griffin, who won the seat in 2024. 
Endorsements: 
Sen. Nabilah Parkes, a Duluth Democrat, has picked up several endorsements from her colleagues in the Senate in her quest to become Georgia’s next insurance commissioner. Parkes announced Thursday that she has the backing of Senate Minority Leader Harold Jones of Augusta and more than a dozen other Democratic Senate leaders and senators. She’s the only announced candidate on the Democratic side in that race so far, and she is challenging GOP incumbent commissioner John King.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)A bill introduced in the Kansas House this week, one that its Republican sponsor hopes will embolden free speech in honor of Charlie Kirk, might indeed prevent censorship and nudge student voices, as he intends.
However, it might also frustrate many Kansans (including fellow Republicans) who won’t enjoy the unfettered expression — from students and faculty, on campus and online — that this bill protects. We can nitpick other likely consequences of the bill after we cover the basics.
Rep. Brett Fairchild, R-St. John, introduced a bill Tuesday that would, generally speaking, enlarge the free speech rights of people on Kansas university and postsecondary education campuses. The bill’s acronym? The FORUM Act, for “forming open and robust university minds.”
In the other chamber, Kansas Senate President Ty Masterson, R-Andover, announced this week that additional legislation “is being drafted to safeguard free speech for students across Kansas education, from K-12 to public colleges.”
Fairchild and Masterson paid homage to Kirk, a slain conservative activist and free speech advocate who was shot and killed in September while speaking at a Utah college campus.
“Charlie Kirk was martyred for bringing truth and wisdom to college campuses, where the free exchange of ideas must remain central to their mission. He built a legacy of respectful yet passionate discourse and warned of the dangers when we stop talking to one another,” a statement from Masterson said, calling the bill a “top priority.”
Fairchild called Kirk “a great champion of free speech on college campuses.”
While Kirk’s views on many issues struck me as wrongheaded and offensive, his advocacy for free speech was different. The open debates he created, particularly for college students, pivoted campus norms about free speech.
I worry that this bill — or ones like it — won’t do nearly as much.
As we wait for the Senate bill, let’s review the House bill from Fairchild. Or, to be more accurate, the piece of legislation that Fairchild said came from someone connected to the libertarian group Young Americans For Liberty. Fairchild credited the words in the bill to a person who “knocked on doors when it was 100 degrees outside” and “helped me get elected a few years ago.”
“I’m a big fan of free speech and the First Amendment and I didn’t have any reason to say no,” Fairchild said during my interview with him this week.
He also expressed a loose commitment to the current language of the bill, House Bill 2472.
“I’m not necessarily 100% locked in to keep the bill exactly how it is,” Fairchild said. “As it is currently written, I’m open to amendments if universities come and testify.”
My former University of Kansas colleague Harrison Rosenthal helped me rake through the bill’s legalese. Rosenthal now works as a managing associate at the Dentons law firm and focuses on media and constitutional litigation.
Many of the bill’s provisions would duplicate protections provided by the First Amendment, and in that way the bill seems to me like political stagecraft — feting Kirk without making meaningful changes on college campuses.
However, Rosenthal said, “the bill’s novel moves are significant.” For example, the bill instructs universities to make all outdoor areas on campus into “public forums.” Another provision bars institutions from providing preference to groups or speakers affiliated with the university over unaffiliated groups or speakers.
The bill also protects off-campus and online expression by students. This is where I believe the bill proposes more than many Kansans actually want.
Section 9 of the bill says, “No postsecondary educational institution shall discipline, penalize or otherwise retaliate against a student, student organization, faculty member or staff for expressive activity conducted online, whether on social media, in email, on websites or other digital platforms, if such activity is protected under the first amendment to the constitution of the United States and section 11 of the bill of rights of the constitution of the state of Kansas and conducted in person.”
No discipline, penalty or retaliation at all? For students, organizations, faculty and staff? Would that be a popular outcome?
While I personally believe that universities should not be in the business of regulating a freshman’s Instagram post, is that what Fairchild believes?
In our interview, he said that he doesn’t want “speech constrained unless the speech is basically violent or racist speech.” It’s unclear, in my reading of the bill, what would trigger constraints on racist speech — and those guardrails have existed in the past.
Apart from racist speech, many fellow Republicans, including national political figures, have worked to punish students and faculty for speech recently. In fact, some of that speech was in response to Kirk’s shooting. 
Last year, a KU staff member posted that Kirk was “better in the ground as worm food than up here preaching that murdered children are a necessary sacrifice for 2A rights,” referencing the second amendment.
The backlash was understandably fierce from conservatives, including Masterson, who called for the university to fire the staff member. (KU did not.)
If Fairchild’s bill — or one similar in the Senate — passes, employees and students would be emboldened to speak in that same way.
Similarly, the New York Times published previously sealed court documents this week that showed the only evidence used by the Trump administration to seek deportation of university students was constitutionally protected speech. The judge in the case unsealed the documents to showcase how free expression about Israel and Palestine was being weaponized.
The judge in that case chided two Trump cabinet members for their role in an “unconstitutional conspiracy.” The administration’s actions were, in the judge’s view,  “violating” expressive rights of students studying in the United States.
“These cabinet secretaries have failed in their sworn duty to uphold the Constitution,” Judge William G. Young said last week in an emotional denunciation of the government from the bench.
The bill also requires that each institution “submit a report to the legislature and the governor” detailing the restrictions it enforced, speech disruptions or censorship and more. Asking for more annual reports is a curious pose from a political party that seeks to make our state government leaner and reduce funding for state universities. (It also smacks of a fishing expedition to provide fodder for screaming headlines in partisan media outlets.)
My biggest concern with this bill and others like it: Conservatives envision such laws as potentially liberating conservative speech on campus while somehow constraining contrary messages.
What will conservatives think if the law allows unfettered speech for their political foes?
For his part, Fairchild said he wants all speech protected.
“I don’t think it’s promoting a certain political view over any other type of political view,” Fairchild said. “I think it would protect speech from students who are on the left side of the political spectrum just as much as it would those on the right.”
As a free speech advocate, I support most of the bill’s language. Campuses could improve by fostering more open and risky debate among everyone on campus.
However, I worry that Kansas state law has little to do with the reticence that most students have. I have never heard a student bemoan the lack of statutory protection for what they want to say in class or on social media.
Rather than being a legal problem, student hesitation about being honest and open is a problem of social psychology.
Undergraduate students between 18 and 22 have grown up with the specter of digital retribution for their expression: Is someone going to post a recording of what I say in class to Instagram? Will I be canceled by friends if I post this video on TikTok? Will I be tossed out of contention for a dream job because of something I wrote on Twitter in high school?
These are the worries that they reported to me in class this week as we started a new semester. We reviewed recent research showing how college students see First Amendment protections as being damaged — more and more each year.
At the end of the presentation, I stood at the front of the auditorium and said, “So, this is the time to let me know what you think — how you feel.”
More than 150 undergraduate students looked back at me silently, some doodling nervously in their notebooks. Only the hum of computer projectors filled the classroom. Someone coughed.
“I’m really good at these awkward silences that encourage students to speak up,” I said.
I paused again.
Veteran teachers know that if you make eye contact and provide a kind smile, students will often take that as a cue.
“Still nothing?” I said.
Their nervous stares answered: nothing.
While I don’t see much objectionable in the House bill introduced this week, I don’t think it will break that silence in my classroom or at the state’s other university campuses.

The expiration of popular federal tax credits last year led to higher health care costs across the board, and some Marylanders just couldn’t afford their previous plans, opting for cheaper, less-comprehensive health care coverage for the 2026 plan year.
It was one of the many caveats that came with the newest enrollment data, which actually showed an overall increase in enrollments — despite expectations that rising costs would push more people away from coverage.
Michele Eberle, executive director of the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange, urged lawmakers to “dig deeper” into the data, because 5,743 people moved from a higher coverage policy called a “gold plan” to the bottom rung 0f coverage, a “bronze plan,” taking on significantly higher deductibles to maintain less-comprehensive health coverage.
Higher costs are only part of the changes coming to health insurance

“Most of our bronze plans carry $10,000 deductibles, so now that financial burden for medical has gone up tenfold for that family,” Eberle told senators during a Thursday briefing for the Finance Committee.
Gold plans tend to have a deductible of around $1,000, meaning plan holders only have to cover $1,000 of a significant medical cost before their insurance steps in to cover the rest.
“That’s really, really unfortunate that that’s happening,” said Vincent DeMarco, president of the Maryland Health Care for All coalition. “That means that people are not going to be able to get the health care that they need and are going to go to the hospital and create uncompensated care … we’ll have to pay for that hidden health care tax.”
A major factor to health care costs rising is the expiration of Enhanced Premium Tax Credits, a popular COVID-era federal benefit that helped keep monthly costs down for 190,000 Marylanders who purchased individual plans on the state’s Affordable Care Act marketplace.
“The federal government’s inaction to extend the tax credits means those who can afford coverage will be forced to pay more while getting less,” Health Secretary Meena Seshamani said in a written statement. “The ripple effect of this will lessen access to needed health care, result in job losses for health care workers, and be a blow to our state’s economy in a time when Marylanders are already experiencing rising costs in so many areas of their lives.”
New data from the exchange supports Seshamani, as data reports that thousands of Marylanders found their previous plans were no longer affordable and dropped to lower-quality plans.
The end of the federal tax credit in December had ripple effects on the whole health care economy. Last year, state insurance officials approved an average 13.4% premium rate increase for 2026 health care plans, to compensate for the expected drop in enrollment.
Despite those rising costs, Marylanders proved they wanted health care, officials said.
State subsidy softens blow to enrollment
According to early data, about 255,600 people purchased individual health care plans from the Maryland Health Connection, with 207,797 people renewing coverage this year and 47,815 newly enrolling in the exchange.That’s about 3.4% more than in last year’s open enrollment period.
The early data eases fears of what many anticipated to be a major drop in coverage due to the expiration of the federal tax credits. But officials from the marketplace note that the 2026 data is not finalized, and there may be a drop in enrollment numbers in coming weeks.
“Individuals must pay the first month’s premium to their insurance company by the end of January to start coverage,” according to a press release from the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange. “There will be some who will get the first month’s bill and not be able to pay.”
A new state-level subsidy may help some people keep their health care plans.
Maryland lawmakers last year approved funding, called the Maryland Premium Assistance, to help replace some of the lost benefit for 2026 plans.
Senate Finance Committee Chair Pamela Beidle (D-Anne Arundel) believes the new state-level subsidies likely helped stave off a massive drop in enrollment.
“I thought more people would leave their plans,” Beidle said. “I’m sure the state subsidy is helping people to stay.”
The Maryland Premium Assistance subsidy replaces the extended tax credit for those earning up to twice the federal poverty level. For those earning two to four times the federal poverty level, the state subsidy can replace 50% of the value of the federal tax credits.




Federal poverty level
The Maryland Premium Assistance subsidy replaces the lost federal Enhanced Premium Tax Credit for individuals making up to 200% of the federal poverty level.
In 2026, individuals making up to $31,300 a year are earning about 200% of the federal poverty level, state officials say. For a family of four, an income of $64,300 would be twice the federal poverty level.
Someone making up to $62,600 a year would be earning four times the federal poverty level and could qualify for a state subsidy worth about 50% of what the federal credit would have paid. The same level of support would apply to a household of four earning around $128,600 annually, which is 400% of the federal level.
Those making above 400% of the federal poverty level do not qualify for the state’s new premium assistance.




Without the state-level premium assistance program, the exchange anticipated that 90,000 people would have dropped their coverage when the federal tax credits expired. Even with the state subsidy in place, the marketplace estimated that some 30,000 people dropped their coverage because they can no longer afford it.
The new state subsidy is likely a temporary solution to what could be a long-term problem if Congress does not renew the lapsed federal tax credit, which is currently under debate in Washington.
The state may not be in  position financially to continue funding the program down the line.
The state’s premium subsidy is currently funded by Maryland’s reinsurance program — a special fund through which insurers are reimbursed for a portion of the costs of patients requiring the most expensive care.
The reinsurance program is funded through a 1% assessment on health insurance policies and is currently set to end in 2028 unless the federal government approves an extension on the state’s waiver for the program.
Beidle said that continuing to fund the premium subsidy past 2026 would likely require increasing the assessment or pulling from general funds. But lawmakers this year face a $1.5 billion budget shortfall in the fiscal 2027 budget.
“Our overall budget is so tight,” Beidle said. “There’s only so much you can do with a limited amount of money.”
She noted that the open enrollment data will finalize around March and the legislature would likely have some time to respond if legislative action is needed.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/healthcare-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-24 07:56:30.711528
