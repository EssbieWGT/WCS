(Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)LAWRENCE — Katie Batza’s first memory of HIV and AIDS was as a pre-teen church volunteer helping her mother deliver Meals on Wheels to a man facing death.
She was 11 years old and her politically conservative Catholic mother was dedicated to making certain those struck by the pandemic were treated with kindness, empathy and love.
HIV and AIDS, first recognized in the early 1980s, emerged as a lethal disease most commonly contracted by men having sex or addicts sharing needles to do drugs. The disease’s learning curve meant it was common for people to mistakenly believe the virus could be contracted by touch. Doctors and nurses were scared to treat the sick. The general public was profoundly alarmed. In partisan circles, AIDS was a vehicle of political attack.



“We were in charge of visiting this young man with HIV, who was in hospice,” Batza said on the Kansas Reflector podcast. “My mom really wanted to make sure … that the person felt like we weren’t afraid of him, that we could be friends with him. To try and be gentle to him in the final, you know, weeks and months of his life.”
She put aside medical trappings of a life ebbing away, and would sit with him, play Legos and chat.
“I learned that his family wasn’t speaking to him and he was relying on people like my mom to kind of help him in the final weeks,” Batza said. “It was a formative memory for sure.”
Afterward, she found reason to explore shelves of the library to learn about LGBTQ+ history. She was deeply disappointed by the lean offerings.
“In that moment, I thought, ‘This isn’t right. This isn’t good. I need to figure out how to fill this bookshelf,'” Batza said.
 
Heartland answers
Decades later, Batza has become a researcher, writer and teacher on the history of this breathtaking disease estimated to have taken more than 40 million lives worldwide so far.
Batza, associate professor of women, gender and sexuality studies at University of Kansas, recently published “AIDS in the Heartland: How Unlikely Coalitions Created a Blueprint for LGBTQ Politics.” It explores the pandemic from perspectives of family, friends and others who grappled with AIDS far from population epicenters for the disease in San Francisco or New York City.
Library shelves aren’t as bare as they once were, but Batza said there was a need to help fill gaps in medical, religious, social, economic and political history of AIDS in the heartland.
“Even historians who study HIV and AIDS, they kind of gloss over the middle part of the country as a place that was really not impacted,” Batza said. “That does a huge disservice for the history that is here, as well as the people that are here fighting to make sure that the AIDS epidemic doesn’t kind of rear its ugly head again.”
For the book, she was able to draw upon oral histories, interviews and archived material at KU.
She discovered religious organizations were key in regions of the country that didn’t have a large social safety net to serve the mostly gay men struck down by HIV and AIDS. Grassroots systems did emerge in Kansas and elsewhere, she said.
“There were several of the people that I interviewed for this book who said without religious organizations there would not have been a response to HIV in this region,” she said. “Churches, synagogues, convents, these are all places that kind of had resources, whether it’s church vans or extra rooms in the convent.”
In Topeka, Westboro Baptist Church led by the late Rev. Fred Phelps offered Kansas a unique and tragic response. Phelps’ followers picketed funerals of people suspected of dying of AIDS. They sang abusive songs, hoisted disrespectful signs and stomped on the U.S. flag. Their funeral picketing was challenged in court and declared constitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court.
“Some of Fred Phelps’ people still kind of haunt the hills of Kansas,” Batza said.
She said Wesboro’s confrontational style fostered the formation of unlikely coalitions in the Midwest.
“You saw drag queens and motorcyclists kind of use their motorcycle engines to rev out the noise and drag queens would make these elaborate costumes with big wings to visually block off the protesters,” Batza said.
 
Hearts and minds
She said in less densely populated areas of the country there was cross-pollination of activists. In some instances, the same people in a community were involved with a series of health care, housing, transportation or religious organizations. It was amazing to seek how personal connections created a holistic approach to the HIV and AIDS crisis that wasn’t matched in bigger cities, she said.
In terms of heartland medical care for people with HIV or AIDS, there was no mirroring New York City or San Francisco where wings of hospitals were devoted to this pandemic.
Kansas did have Donna Sweet, a renowned Wichita physician who in the early 1980s was one of the first doctors in Kansas to treat patients with HIV and AIDS.
She cared for patients all over the state and led initiatives to educate others about a disease that has been transformed over the decades from an almost certain death to a preventable disease that also can be treated as a chronic health condition.
“She would literally work with farmers to find crop dusters who could pick her up and take her to farms and fields so that neighbors didn’t necessarily have to know what was happening,” Batza said. “She really did the work of changing the hearts and minds of people, you know, one person at a time. I think that kind of really grassroots effort of educating can’t be overstated.”
 
Politicized immediately
Batza, who is in her 12th year at KU, said this generation of college students know what a pandemic looks like after experiencing COVID-19. But many students have shared their dismay at hostility directed at people suffering HIV or AIDS, she said.
It can be difficult to contemplate that men and women with such a debilitating disease were abandoned by their families and friends or that hospital personnel were afraid to touch them or deliver food to them.
“It’s really a big ask for them to grasp the full scope of the early HIV-AIDS crisis,” she said. “They did not comprehend the extent of the stigma and the fact that people could get kicked out of their jobs and houses.”
In hindsight, it was inevitable HIV and AIDS would be political dynamite.
“An epidemic of any kind becomes politicized almost immediately,” she said. “Deploying shame as a political tactic … was pretty helpful for some people who were in politics at the time. But as a public health strategy, obviously, it’s proven to have failed several times over, because in ostracizing people, you’re not willing to talk about how transmission happens, how to prevent it from spreading to more people.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Katie-Batza-4-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-20 10:16:55.344214

(Steph Quinn | Missouri Independent)Missouri has lost nearly 1.6 million pounds of food aid since May due to sudden cuts to a federal program that buys food from U.S. farmers and sends it to food banks across the country.
That’s 146,400 pounds of cheese, 433,070 pounds of canned and frozen chicken, 1.2 million eggs, 38,250 gallons of milk, 120,000 pounds of pulled pork, 115,200 pounds of sliced turkey breast, 180,000 pounds of dried plums and 114,000 pounds of frozen pork chops.
The Trump administration in late March slashed $500 million that had already been allocated to food aid nationwide through The Emergency Food Assistance Program, or TEFAP. That canceled 124 scheduled deliveries to Missouri food banks, according to data obtained from the U.S. Department of Agriculture by ProPublica and shared with The Independent.
Food banks across the state said they have largely made up shortfalls from the March cuts by increasing their food purchases. But some food bank leaders worry that hunger in Missouri will increase with the implementation of changes signed into law this summer to federal assistance programs, like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.
“Food banks are the safety net to the safety net,” said Leigh Anne Haun, executive director of Feeding Missouri, a coalition of the state’s six regional food banks. “When you talk about programs like SNAP…any time those start to get strained, or there’s holes in those nets, the food banks are the safety net underneath.”
They are also bracing for increased demand as the federal government shutdown wears on. U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins warned Thursday that SNAP will run out of funds in two weeks if the shutdown continues, and USDA has directed regional SNAP directors to stop working on benefits for November, according to an Oct. 10 letter obtained by Politico.
Meredith Knopp, president and CEO of the St. Louis Area Foodbank, said any disruption the food bank experienced due to canceled deliveries was “minimal,” and that the tornado that hit St. Louis in May and the ongoing shutdown have affected the food bank more.
“Right now it’s just about educating and informing people where they can go for help, how they can get assistance temporarily until the government reopens,” Knopp said of the shutdown.
Knopp said purchases made by the USDA later in the year made up for canceled TEFAP deliveries. On Aug. 1, the USDA announced the purchase of $230 million in fish, dried cranberries, beans and apples for food banks nationwide.

The canceled shipments make up a relatively small portion of what Missouri food banks distribute each year. Missouri’s food banks dispensed 132.2 million pounds of food in 2023, according to the Missouri Hunger Atlas, which is published by the Interdisciplinary Center for Food Security at the University of Missouri.
But Jordan Browning, director of communications for Ozarks Food Harvest in Springfield, said food banks still have to fill in gaps.
The first canceled shipments – over 100 orders of 2% milk headed for 30 states – were scheduled to arrive on May 14, records show. That day, Ozarks Food Harvest and the St. Louis Area Food Bank in Bridgeton were each slated to receive orders of more than 2,000 gallons of milk, according to the records.
At first, Browning said, he thought the deliveries might just be delayed, which had happened in the past.
The next missed delivery date in Missouri was May 31, when all six of the state’s regional food banks were scheduled to receive shipments, according to the records. 
“They kept getting delayed further and further,” Browning said. “Pretty much until it finally came to an actual cancellation notice, we weren’t aware that we would have to make up a shortfall.”
Much of the food was high quality protein, the items that are priciest and hardest for food banks to source, food bank administrators said.
The Southeast Missouri Food Bank received all the orders staff were told to expect, according to Heather Collier, donor relations and communications manager at the Sikeston-based food bank, though some were delayed.
But Collier said shipments can be canceled before the state notifies regional food banks that they should expect a delivery. 
“Canceled loads, if they’re fully canceled, they’re usually happening before we’re even notified,” Collier said.
Collier said that although the food bank weathered the March cuts relatively easily, she expects coming changes to SNAP to increase the number of Missourians who don’t qualify for federal assistance but struggle to reliably access nutritious food.
The budget reconciliation bill passed by Congress in July cuts SNAP by $187 billion through 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The bill also expands SNAP work requirements to include adults ages 55-64 and parents of children over 14. 
In the Southeast Missouri Food Bank’s service area, according to Collier, 46.5% of people who are food insecure already do not qualify for SNAP.
“You’re meeting the definition of food insecurity, but not meeting the qualifications to receive assistance,” Collier said. “Food banks are going to have to make that up.”
Haun said community support will enable food banks to continue helping Missourians in need.
“It’s so important for people to connect with their local food bank now,” Haun said. “They need not just funds to allow them to address these gaps, but other types of donations and volunteering.”
Through the shutdown and any future challenges, Knopp was confident the food bank would continue to help.
“It might not always be smooth sailing,” Knopp said. “It might be clunky. But we’re here, and we will be here to support anyone who needs us.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_3142-1024x614.jpeg,,,2025-10-20 10:16:55.344214

In March, $500 million was cut in funding for the Commodity Credit Corporation, a program that provides food to food banks and other emergency food providers through The Emergency Food Assistance Program, another Department of Agriculture program. According to U.S. Department of Agriculture data obtained by ProPublica, this meant that around 94 million pounds of food never reached those food banks. 
For some Michigan groups, especially those that faced greater losses, these cuts have made it more difficult to continue to serve their communities.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Annmarie Zaremba, the Director of Food Sourcing at Forgotten Harvest in Oak Park, said that her organization had lost about $750,000 worth of food in these cancelled deliveries. Much of that was protein like chicken and pork — food items that other donations tend not to include, but that are important for recipients to have in their diets. 
“Our goal is always to give a variety of foods to try to create as much balance distribution as we can,” she said. “For the protein that we do have in inventory, we are being very methodical about it. We have a shipping plan for our protein so that people do get something, it might not be a frozen protein every time, it might be a bean item, and then the next distribution will switch to maybe a frozen chicken item or something like that.”
Not all of the federal support for Forgotten Harvest comes from the Commodity Credit Corporation, and other programs are still providing assistance. 
“We are able to make up some of it,” Zaremba said. “It is getting harder and harder, though, without getting really creative.”
Gleaners Community Food Bank in Detroit noted that, across all USDA programs, they received 5.1 million pounds less in USDA-donated food in fiscal year 2025 than the year before. 
“Additionally, with 75% of our food going out through our partner network, Gleaners invested our own reserves to purchase over 700,000 pounds of food to help our partner network access food that was not donated,” Kristin Sokul, Senior Director of Advancement at Gleaners, wrote in an email. “While we have been able to meet requests for support as they have been presented to us from partners and community, and we’re still finalizing our fiscal year 2025 numbers, we expect that we will deliver fewer total pounds this fiscal year than we originally projected in our fiscal year 2025 budget.”

Notification of these changes also caught some organizations by surprise. 
“It happened pretty quickly,” Zaremba said. “We had probably a month or so where there was some uncertainty for a while, and then we did get final notification that all of these loads had been canceled and they wouldn’t be replaced.”
Going forward, organizations like Gleaners are having to develop new strategies for allocating food for distribution. 
“To safeguard continued access to nutritious food for our guests for years to come, we have created a Sustainability Plan to invest reserves into innovation and sustainability, increase fundraising efforts, and regularly evaluate expenses for efficiency,” Sokul wrote. “Gleaners remains focused on achieving a hunger-free community in Southeast Michigan with collaborative solutions that empower people and enable them to thrive.”
Michigan Democrats in both houses of Congress sent letters to Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins in the spring, expressing concerns about these funding cuts and how they would impact emergency food assistance programs. 
U.S. Reps Rashida Tlaib, Haley Stevens, Shri Thanedar, Debbie Dingell and Kristen McDonald Rivet all signed the letter from members of the House of Representatives, while Sen. Elissa Slotkin signed the version coming from the Senate.
But for other groups, the cuts were less pronounced — some fluctuations in deliveries are normal, according to Ed Scott, Director of Macomb Community Action, and occasional cancellations or substitutions are normal. Macomb Community Action had over 4,700 deliveries cancelled, according to the Department of Agriculture data.
“TEFAP (The Emergency Food Assistance Program) is a federally managed program that relies on a variety of factors, including supply chain logistics, product availability, vendor capacity, and federal contracting procedures,” Scott added. “As such, it is not uncommon for certain food items to be delayed, substituted, or canceled altogether. These changes are often beyond the control of local agencies and are part of the broader effort to ensure food safety, quality, and responsible stewardship of federal resources.”
A spokesperson for the Mid-Michigan Community Action Agency wrote, “at this time, our food programs are operating normally,” while spokespeople for Samaritas and Kent County Community Action noted that they had not experienced any cuts or cancellations.
The Department of Agriculture declined to comment, citing ongoing litigation. Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania filed a lawsuit in federal court against the agency in June over funding cuts to food aid programs.

The council’s leaders agree Mississippi would benefit from a statewide, uniform building code – a policy experts widely believe improves an area’s chances of surviving destructive weather. By lowering risk, strengthening buildings also helps against rising insurance rates. 
“It’s kind of like the three little pigs: You want the straw, the sticks or the brick?” said Jennifer Hall, vice president of the council. “I want the brick.” 
But the Legislature, the council also agreed, has no interest in expanding regulations. If anything, lawmakers are more interested in weakening what rules are in place. 
“There is a movement at the Capitol right now to do away with regulations,” Hall said at the meeting. 
After seeing the impact Katrina had on weaker homes and businesses in 2005, lawmakers in 2014 passed a statewide building code, requiring construction to meet modern standards. But the 2014 law included a key caveat: Within four months of the new regulation going into effect, any city or county could vote to opt out. As it turned out, most did just that. 
Resilience experts, public officials and coastal residents who talked to Mississippi Today pointed to crucial policies to enhance local fortitude against future disasters: funding for mitigation and strong building codes. Yet while research suggests Mississippi is as vulnerable to climate change as anywhere in the country, state leadership has failed to embrace either strategy over the last two decades. 
“Mississippi has had the opportunity to do this for years,” said Julie Shiyou-Woodard, president of Smart Home America and a Pass Christian native. “Sadly, it’s going to show. The choices we made in Mississippi after Katrina, you will see that when we get hit with a direct category 3 (hurricane) again. It will be clear.”

‘A silly question, Senator’
Mike Chaney, a Republican who has been the state’s insurance commissioner since early 2008, estimated that two-thirds of Mississippi’s counties opted out of the 2014 building code standards. Now, just about half of the state has “fairly decent” codes, Chaney said. The lower six counties– including three that touch the Coast – adopted codes shortly after Katrina, although most are now outdated, a federal database shows. The many places in the state without codes altogether are going to “hurt in the long run,” Chaney said.
Hall, who is also executive director of the Mississippi Manufactured Housing Association, said “the only way” lawmakers could have passed the 2014 bill was to allow cities and counties to opt out.
Mississippi Today reached out to several government agencies and organizations, and no one in the state, it appeared, tracked which areas have what building codes. The 2014 law gave no one the authority to actually enforce the codes it put into place, Hall said. In other words, there’s no accountability at the state level, even for the cities and counties that didn’t opt out in 2014.
Last year, the Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety ranked Mississippi’s codes near the bottom among coastal states. The impact a lack of codes has on life-safety and property damage “has unfortunately been exposed in recent tornado outbreaks” in the state and “would be exploited in a hurricane impact,” the report said. 
Over the last decade, tornadoes, strong winds and thunderstorms have directly killed 67 people in Mississippi, national storm data show. Also, including hurricanes, those storms have caused over $740 million in property damage in that time.

Disaster and insurance experts also point to mitigation grants as a necessary step toward local resilience. Alabama, Louisiana and other states have launched grant programs to help homeowners in high-risk areas pay for improvements that are often cost-prohibitive otherwise. 
The Mississippi Insurance Department first established its home mitigation program in 2007, but it didn’t receive funding from the state until 2024 when lawmakers set aside $5 million for the department to do a test run. 
With grants up to $10,000, the program paid to upgrade and strap roofs onto homes – protecting against high winds and water leaks – as well as for shutters to guard windows. After slowly rolling out the program, which Chaney said was done to avoid mishaps, the state funded improvements to 28 homes. 
In a dispute that played out in news stories and on social media over the summer, legislators were critical of the department’s ability to run the program. Particularly, Sen. Scott DeLano, a Biloxi Republican, said he disagreed with Chaney’s approach. 
DeLano and other lawmakers slammed the Insurance Department for only doing 28 homes, said Chaney provided scant details about how the program would run, and argued the program should go through an independent contractor. 
As a result, the Legislature omitted funding for the program this past session, and killed a bill that would have paid for the grants through fees from insurance companies. Republican Sen. Walter Michel of Ridgeland presented the bill on Chaney’s behalf.

Some of the criticisms about the pilot fell flat, Mississippi Today found. For instance, DeLano and others pointed to the success story in Alabama – which leads the nation with over 51,000 “FORTIFIED” homes – and said Mississippi should mimic its neighbor to the east. But the Alabama Department of Insurance told Mississippi Today that its program is run almost entirely in-house. 
Chaney’s office pushed back on criticism over the results of its pilot program, arguing it executed more grants than other states in its first year. 
At a Senate committee meeting in January, DeLano criticized Chaney, who was sitting a few feet away, for not also requiring counties to have up-to-date building codes before residents could receive a grant. Doing so would attract more insurance companies into the state, the senator said. 
 After Chaney said he would only support the idea in a separate bill, DeLano fired back: 
“Are you really for mitigation then?” 
“That’s a silly question, Senator,” Chaney responded. 
Responding to Mississippi Today about the exchange, Chaney’s office said requiring a county to have certain building codes would only hold up mitigation progress. 
The two elected officials agreed about the importance of a mitigation program, but each side accused the other of not playing ball. DeLano said Chaney hasn’t provided details of his proposal, and Chaney said DeLano wouldn’t meet with him to discuss the proposal. 
Multiple people told Mississippi Today the distrust between the two sides traces back to 2016, when the state nearly lost $30 million in Federal Emergency Management Agency funds meant for retrofitting 2,000 homes on the Coast. An Office of Inspector General report recommended FEMA suspend the program after finding the state had spent over $30 million and did work on only 945 homes.

The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency fired the employees it claimed were responsible for the blunder. The agency eventually resumed the program and ended up with $19 million in federal funds, it told Mississippi Today. 
But Rep. Kevin Ford, a Republican from Vicksburg, said lawmakers still have a “bad taste in their mouth.” When asked if the earlier scandal is why the Legislature hasn’t funded the program for roughly a decade, Ford said, “Yes, 100%. There’s no doubt.”
“What it sounds like to me is there is a trust issue,” said Chris Monforton, CEO of Habitat for Humanity of the Mississippi Gulf Coast, referencing the OIG report. Monforton, who worked with the insurance department to start its pilot program, said the pilot was “very similar” to how Alabama established its mitigation grants. 
When asked about the issues from 2016, DeLano didn’t go so far as to tie it to his disagreement with Chaney, but said “we know the history of mitigation programs in our state.” 
Ford, who wrote a competing mitigation bill in the House this past session, argued that Chaney as an elected official shouldn’t have control over the millions of dollars that would fund the program, suggesting the money could be tilted towards potential voters. 
Chaney strongly disagreed with using an outside company to run the program, arguing a contractor would be more expensive and not subject to the same oversight as the insurance department. Both Ford and Michel said they would reintroduce their bills in the 2026 legislative session, and it’s unclear if either side is willing to compromise.
Rep. Jerry Turner, a Republican from Baldwyn, is the House Insurance Committee chairman and has served at the Capitol since 2004. When asked why it took 17 years for the state to fund a mitigation program, Turner said, “I’m not trying to dodge a bullet or pass a buck, but I think you’d be better served if you talked to the people on the Coast and the insurance (department).”
“I’m not siding either way,” he added. “ I’ll do anything I can to get this thing started off because I think it’s something that the citizens of the state of Mississippi deserve.”
‘The market will collapse’
The parallel rise of disaster risks and insurance costs in the nation’s poorest state begs the question: What will happen if neither trend slows down?
Chip Merlin, an attorney who specializes in insurance claims for homeowners and who worked with Mississippians after Katrina, said eventually communities will have to migrate.
“I think we’re starting to see it already,” Merlin said, pointing to parts of California and Florida that have seen residents leave because of climate risk. “There’s an emotional aspect of once your home gets damaged by flood, wind, wildfire, that I don’t want to be in harm’s way anymore. And people look for a place where it’s less emotionally taxing to live.”

David Baria, a Democratic former state lawmaker from the Coast, said he ran for office in 2007 largely because of the local issues with insurance he witnessed after Katrina. 
Baria called it “a slog” to get any kind of insurance reform passed. He introduced bills in 2017, 2018 and 2019 to fund a mitigation grant program. None made it out of committee. 
“ There were many bills that I attempted to pass to rein in insurance company practices to improve the lot of homeowners, to strengthen structures, and they were routinely opposed by the insurance industry and the leadership of both the Senate and the House,” said Baria, who served in both chambers. 
Both Merlin and Baria criticized Mississippi leadership for not better protecting policyholders, especially around delaying or denying claims after a disaster. 
In 2024, a New York Times analysis of an insurance study looked at which parts of the country pay the most in home policy premiums relative to their house’s value. The analysis found that, throughout Mississippi, that ratio was “much higher” than the national average.  
Smart Home America, a nonprofit based in Mobile, Alabama, has helped strengthen homes and design policy in over 20 states. Shiyou-Woodard, its president and CEO, said she “worked closely” with Chaney’s office to kickstart Mississippi’s mitigation program, and it was on the right track until the Legislature cut its funding.

While policy around mitigation can face obstacles, such as building contractors not wanting to deal with the extra cost of complying with new codes, Mississippi’s lack of local resilience comes down to those in the Capitol, she said. 
“Mississippi is a black hole,” Shiyou-Woodard said, explaining that its neighboring states are ahead of the game. “Why is it not catching up? There should be no reason. It has the same risk as Louisiana, the same risk as Alabama, what’s the problem? The problem in Mississippi has been political will.”
When asked what would happen if the state doesn’t act to lower the risk for homeowners, she pointed to Louisiana, which has only recently seen insurance improvements after a slew of companies pulled out due to frequent disasters. 
“When Mississippi gets hit with a significant wind event, the market will most likely collapse,” she said. “And that’s not fortune telling.

Campbell settled nearly all the evictions filed between 2010 and 2018 outside of court, or judges had them dismissed. Yet, they still appear when searching her name in the Richland County court system.

“Here I am after years and years and years, and you’re still holding this on me,” Campbell told the SC Daily Gazette.
A bipartisan bill proposed in the House would require the state to remove from public access after 30 days any eviction filings that do not result in an actual court order telling the tenant to get out. Any cases that did result in an eviction order from a judge or were settled in court would be removed from public view after six years under the proposal.
That would wipe Campbell’s record clean.
The 41-year-old mother of four received two court-ordered evictions, also called writs of ejectment, within three months of each other in 2016, according to court records. Another seven are listed as settled, dismissed or disposed.
None of the filings, including the two court orders, resulted in Campbell actually getting kicked out of her home, she said.
Still, the long list of cases that pops up anytime someone searches Campbell’s name in the Richland County court filing system “looks so very ugly,” she said.
South Carolina appeared to have among the highest rates of eviction filings in the country in 2018, with about 23 of every 100 renters having an eviction filed against them, according to the most recent available data from the Eviction Lab at Princeton University.
Comparisons are hard to draw because different states, and even different counties within states, handle eviction cases in different ways, Stateline has reported.
South Carolina’s data, released after the state NAACP settled a lawsuit over the use of automated technology to collect eviction data, doesn’t include outcomes for those cases.
In 2024, more than 126,000 South Carolina renters had some sort of eviction filed against them in court, meaning they might face difficulty in renting in the future, according to the Legal Services Corporation’s Civil Court Data Initiative.
Lack of eviction data obscures extent of the affordable housing crisis

As costs continue to rise, paying rent each month is becoming increasingly difficult for many people, said Rev. Carey A. Grady, pastor of Reid Chapel AME Church in Columbia and an advocate for affordable housing.
Landlords may use a filing to put pressure on tenants to pay their rent, even if they have no intention of actually kicking them out of the property, Grady said.
“One filing can haunt you and your family for the rest of your life,” Grady said.
An eviction can be devastating, whether or not the landlord follows through on it, said Mary Ann Fey, pastor at St. John Neumann Catholic Church and a board member for advocacy group MORE Justice, which is short for Midlands Organized Response for Equity and Justice.
A blighted record can mean people have no place to go, continuing a cycle of hardship, she said.
Access to housing has remained a top concern of Richland County residents since the group formed a decade ago and began holding annual community meetings, Fey said.
“Housing is foundational,” Fey said. “When families can not access it, everything else — employment, education, health — becomes harder, and especially harder on children.”
People who have managed to turn their lives around shouldn’t stay beholden to the struggles they faced previously, Fey said.
“This bill does not erase accountability,” Fey said. “Instead, it ensures that the records relied on in making housing decisions are accurate, timely and truly reflective of a person’s current situation.”
Many filings don’t result in actual evictions, and even if they do, they may not reflect a person’s current economic status, said Rep. Carla Schuessler, the bill’s primary sponsor.
Unlike certain criminal charges and bankruptcies, which can be expunged, eviction filings stay with a person forever, often preventing them from finding stable housing in the future, even if they can pay rent, the Myrtle Beach Republican said.

As a former executive director of Horry County’s Habitat for Humanity, Schuessler worked with people who struggled to find housing they could afford because of bad credit histories or eviction records, she said. Removing some of those records could help get more people into homes, she said.
“There’s so much conversation with the housing market and affordable housing and workforce housing and inflation,” Schuessler said. “This is something we can do to help South Carolinians to better their lives.”
Nonpayment isn’t the only reason landlords might file an eviction, which costs $40 and requires little effort on their part, said Sue Berkowitz, director of Appleseed Legal Justice Center, which helped craft the bill.
People who live paycheck to paycheck may consistently pay late because their income doesn’t come in by the first of the month, or a landlord may file an eviction for a different lease violation, such as an extra person staying in the property, Berkowitz said.
She thinks the legislation should be altered to erase eviction records from public scrutiny sooner: three years, instead of six.
A person’s life can drastically change over six years, she said.
“Look back at how your life was six years ago, and it might be very different now,” Berkowitz said.
After several years of financial and personal hardship that led to the eviction filings against her, Campbell is back in stable housing, she said.

She works as a court mediator, helping other people settle disputes, including about evictions, and advocates with MORE Justice. She wants to raise awareness of the eviction process, making sure people know how to look up their own legal histories and what to do if their landlord files an eviction notice.
Arguing against eviction proceedings can be a stressful and time-consuming process that often involves missing work, and judges make default rulings in favor of landlords if tenants don’t show up, Campbell said.
On top of the difficulty in finding housing, an eviction record can take an emotional toll, Campbell said.
She often feels like a failure for the times in her life when she struggled to support her four children, two of whom are in college and two of whom are in elementary school.
She shares a Columbia apartment with her mother, and though the two remain mostly independent, Campbell wishes she could find her own place, she said.
Removing her eviction records could help with that, she said.
“I think just having this bill is a start,” Campbell said. “It’s a start at some change.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4658-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-20 10:01:11.172569

As we brace with hope, relief and caution for the ceasefire to hold and the Israeli assault on Palestinian people to scale back, there is still a long road to Palestinian rights and wellbeing. The board and management at the Wedge — a 50-year-old food cooperative known for its commitment to food justice, equity, community, and democratic member-ownership — needs to realign with its values, its staff, and hundreds of its members and revoke the policy change they made to censor workers who wore pins in solidarity with Palestinians.  
In March, Wedge management issued a revised dress code prohibiting staff from wearing messages referencing values or causes not explicitly supported by the co-op. This occurred after a small group of Wedge member-owners attended the February board meeting to express disapproval of workers wearing pins that said “Labor for Palestine.”  
As Wedge member-owners and as Jews who oppose the occupation, we believe it is our moral and religious obligation to stand up for human and civil rights and support the workers, at both Lyndale and Linden Hills Wedge locations, who continue to risk their livelihoods by persistently and boldly advocating for their right to free expression and protest the ongoing suffering in Gaza.
Gazans have been starved. According to the UN, just 1.5% of arable land remains accessible or undamaged; the workers’ pins are clearly in alignment with Wedge values, which include food justice. Moreover, we find it unacceptable for any so-called progressive institution — particularly in this moment of extreme national repression — to censure objections to what numerous international and even Israeli organizations have deemed a genocide.  
So, in April, in response to this policy change, over 100 member-owners, many of us Jewish, attended a board meeting to challenge the dress code change and support workers who continued to wear pins in defiance of the dress code. We presented an open letter signed by over 600 people condemning the change. And in May, many of us attended a rally outside the Lyndale location calling on management to adhere to the co-op’s values. 
Instead of publicly answering to co-op owners, CEO Nick Seeberger claimed ongoing contract negotiations with workers was the necessary route to address the issue — despite rejecting proposals and diverting the conversation to a management-worker committee. 
In that context, Seeberger invited workers to draft their own version of a dress code, which staff undertook with tremendous thought and effort. But according to workers, the only concession their effort achieved was the allowance to wear a single pin representing a country’s flag, suggesting that this concession was a stall — not an accommodation made in good faith. 
Meanwhile, in Gaza, 92% of all residences have been destroyed, as well as mosques, hospitals, and schools, from kindergarten to university. The Committee to Protect Journalists reports that roughly 240 journalists have been killed. Humanitarian aid was withheld. According to The Guardian, Gaza now leads the world in child amputees. And NPR reports that over 65,000 Gazans have been killed. 
Given this context, the Wedge’s restriction of workers’ speech repudiates our values of justice, equity and commitment to community — precisely the reasons many of us shop there. And, given the number of members who have protested the change, the continued censoring of workers contradicts our value of democratic ownership. 
While the Wedge board of directors may believe it needs to accommodate both sides, the truth is, only one side is morally just. Many Western nations and numerous international, academic, and Jewish organizations have condemned Israel’s actions. To accommodate those who support Israel’s slaughter of Palestinians is to endorse this slaughter. And despite the blessing of this week’s ceasefire agreement, we must be vigilant in truth-telling not only about the past two years of genocide, but about the state of apartheid to which Palestinians have been subjected for decades, and which is likely to persist for the foreseeable future. 
Judaism teaches that no one’s life — not even that of another Jew — is more important than any other life. In light of the atrocities committed against our Palestinian brothers and sisters, it is the duty of all democratic institutions to support those willing to speak out. 
The election for four new Wedge board of trustees runs until October 21st; this would be the time to contact candidates and see where they stand on our stated co-op goal to “meet the goals and aspirations of our community” — specifically as they relate to food justice, free speech. and member-owner participation.  
It is our fervent hope that the Wedge reinstates its former dress code and allows workers their right to free speech in support of those whose world has been destroyed. 
Editor’s note: Wedge Community Co-op responded with a statement: “We are heartbroken over the war in Gaza and have compassion for the Palestinian people. We are hopeful for lasting peace and the end to war and violence. Our mission is building community by developing a strong local food system and are grateful for the role we play in our community. Everyone is always welcome at the Wedge, every day. Our staff are an important part of realizing our mission, and we are working through structures we have in place through our collective bargaining agreement. We will continue through these processes to a resolution. Voting in the Board election is a key part of being a co-op owner!

Huntington Beach and its all-Republican city council have proudly led California’s conservative resistance. Now, if California voters approve Gov. Gavin Newsom’s plan to temporarily redraw the state’s congressional maps, the city would be represented by Rep. Robert Garcia, a gay progressive who leads Democrats on the House Oversight Committee.


California may have a reputation as a bastion of blue, but there are only so many Democratic voters to go around.
Under Proposition 50, Gov. Gavin Newsom’s plan to gerrymander California’s congressional maps to favor Democrats, no incumbent Democrat would take on more Republican voters than Rep. Robert Garcia of Long Beach. 
Garcia’s new district, rather than stretching north from his home town into liberal Los Angeles County, would instead shift southward to encompass a coastal slice of conservative Orange County — notably, the conservative-leaning cities of Huntington Beach and Newport Beach. 
Absorbing those GOP voters into the 42nd congressional district is a point of pride for the 47-year-old Peruvian immigrant, a gay progressive whose sharp-tongued condemnations of President Donald Trump and Elon Musk catapulted him into party leadership as the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, the chamber’s main investigative arm. 
He also serves on the committee’s viral “DOGE” subgroup, where he and a group of fellow young progressives use their speaking time to lob sardonic rhetorical questions that cast the proceedings and the chairwoman, Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, as absurd and even laughable.
“Are Bert and Ernie part of an extreme homosexual agenda?” Garcia asked Paula Kerger, president and CEO of the Public Broadcasting Service, during a hearing in March as his staffer held up a life-sized image of the beloved muppet duo.
If his party retakes control of the House next year, Garcia would almost certainly ascend to chair the committee, which has vast subpoena powers, and would become the face of congressional Democrats’ resistance to Trump.
But don’t expect Garcia, a former Long Beach mayor and city councilor, to back down from his anti-MAGA bully pulpit just because he would then represent a town whose city council has embraced the moniker “the MAGA-nificent seven.” 
“Folks have asked, ‘Hey, you know, you’re pretty progressive. Is this gonna impact the way you take on Trump or the oversight committee?’” Garcia told political commentator Katie Phang during a virtual fundraiser for Prop. 50 last month.
“Absolutely not,” he said.
Garcia’s certainty that he’ll win re-election next year, regardless of which maps are used, is precisely the problem with creating noncompetitive districts as Prop. 50 proposes to do, said state Sen. Tony Strickland, a Republican former mayor of Huntington Beach. 
The city is currently represented by a Democratic congressmember, Rep. Dave Min of Irvine, who succeeded Democrat Katie Porter when she unsuccessfully ran for U.S. Senate last year. But since the district is currently drawn as a competitive seat, Strickland said, Min must win favor from at least some conservative voters if he wants to stay in office. That wouldn’t be the case for Garcia, should Prop. 50 pass. 
Strickland and other local officials in coastal Orange County are skeptical that Garcia — a former Long Beach mayor who said he’s thrilled that his new district would include the entire city — will prioritize their cities’ needs, especially if he doesn’t need their votes to win. 
“The problem with Prop. 50 is you have predetermined elections. You already know who your congressman is before election day,” Strickland said. “As a pretty conservative city, both Newport and Huntington will have one of the most liberal members of Congress. And I just don’t think that’s healthy.”
“We want to govern ourselves”
While Huntington Beach has long asserted its conservative tilt by resisting compliance with state laws they view as too liberal (such as housing construction requirements), the city in recent years has embraced the national culture wars and grabbed headlines for leading a conservative backlash to the state’s ruling Democrats in Sacramento. 
Residents last March approved a ban on flying the rainbow LGBTQ Pride flag on city property. They greenlit a controversial ordinance requiring voters to bring ID to vote, which Attorney General Rob Bonta and Secretary of State Shirley Weber argue violates state election laws. (Oral arguments before an appeals court are scheduled for Oct. 22).
And a simmering battle over sexual content in children’s books and Huntington Beach’s public library came to a head in June. 
The city council had previously approved a controversial ordinance establishing a community review board for library books — what critics dubbed a book ban — and also briefly explored privatizing the library, policies they saw as a counterbalance to the state Legislature’s ultraliberal, “woke” laws. But this summer, via special election, voters overwhelmingly supported repealing the review board and limited the city’s ability to outsource library services.
“We really just want home control. We want to govern ourselves,” said Huntington Beach Mayor Pat Burns. He doesn’t know Garcia personally, but as a former police officer in Long Beach he’s familiar with the former councilmember’s left-leaning politics. 
“Hopefully he’s open to helping us, but if he comes in and tries to break us, you know, break our community and try to crush our council in some way,” Burns said, speaking of Garcia, “well, we’re going to resist. We’re not going to get along.”
Garcia argues that the successful repudiation of the library crackdown is evidence that the city council’s right-wing approach doesn’t fully represent residents’ values. 
“The vast majority of Huntington Beach are good, hard-working, middle-class folks that want a just future for themselves,” Garcia told CalMatters in an interview. “That’s who I’m gonna represent.”
Garcia reiterated that he’s unafraid to speak out, even when he disagrees with decisions made in cities that he represents. Even so, he said he would be proud to represent everyone in his proposed new district and would fight hard to bring federal dollars home to support local projects. He said he would prioritize issues that “everyone cares about,” such as increased affordability, combating climate change and curbing corruption. 
Still, Garcia also repeatedly noted that the proposed district would still be solidly Democratic. He effused confidence that he would handily win re-election next year and, he hopes, help Democrats retake control of the House. 
Democrats have come under fire for drawing the new maps behind closed doors without input from the public or the independent citizens redistricting commission. But Paul Mitchell, the election data guru and redistricting expert who penned the proposed maps, said that in redrawing Garcia’s district to include coastal Orange County, he and his team hewed closely to proposals that advocacy groups previously presented to the independent commission.
Moving Garcia’s district to Orange County was crucial to shore up support for three vulnerable Democrats — Min along with Representatives Derek Tran and Mike Levin — and creating two newly redrawn districts, currently held by Republican representatives Ken Calvert and Darrell Issa, that Democrats believe they can flip.
“That was a critical piece of the puzzle,” Mitchell said in an interview. “It facilitates everything in Southern California.”
Fellow California Democrats have sung Garcia’s praises for graciously allowing his district to go from one that Vice President Kamala Harris won by more than 32% last November to one in which Democrats only have a 10 percentage point registration advantage.
“Robert Garcia is an incredible team player,” said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, chair of California’s Democratic congressional delegation, in a written statement. “He’s taking in some historically Republican neighborhoods, but it’s still going to be a Democratic district.”
During the same virtual fundraiser in September, Garcia told viewers that taking on more Republican voters was “the right thing to do” because “our democracy’s at stake.” 
“This is not a moment for us to worry about not having competitive seats or about being in Congress for a lifetime,” Garcia said. “This is about winning the majority to protect people and to save our country.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/041025-US-Rep-Robert-Garcia-GETTY-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-20 10:01:11.172569
,California,2025-10-20 13:03:23+00:00,CalMatters,Expect more phonics lessons in California schools under law Newsom signed,Carolyn Jones,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/k-12-education/2025/10/phonics-california/,"The law comes on the heels of a host of other literacy initiatives, including mandatory dyslexia screening and universal transitional kindergarten.","In summary
The law comes on the heels of a host of other literacy initiatives, including mandatory dyslexia screening and universal transitional kindergarten.


California took a big step toward overhauling its reading curriculum last week when Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill pushing for phonics-based instruction in elementary and middle school classrooms.
The new law provides training for school principals and reading specialists in the “science of reading,” a method of literacy instruction focused on vocabulary, comprehension and sounding words out rather than learning words by sight. The approach has led to improved reading scores in Mississippi, Louisiana and districts like Los Angeles Unified, which adopted it several years ago.
The law also updates the state’s list of textbooks, flash cards and other classroom reading materials to align with a phonics-based approach.
The law comes on the heels of a host of other literacy initiatives, including mandatory dyslexia screening and universal transitional kindergarten. Combined, the efforts will dramatically reshape the way children in California learn to read and hopefully lead to higher test scores, experts said.
“California has one of the best literacy policy frameworks in the country right now,” said Marshall Tuck, chief executive of the advocacy group EdVoice and a former candidate for state superintendent of public instruction. “We worked very hard on this and we’re thrilled to get to this point. Now we just have to see it through.”
After years of controversy, little opposition
The new law passed the Legislature unanimously and had little opposition. That’s in stark contrast to previous efforts to bring phonics to classrooms, which met steep resistance from English learner advocates and the state’s largest teachers union. English learner groups said that a phonics-based approach only works for children who are fluent in English; the California Teachers Association said teachers need flexibility to pick a reading program that works for their students.
But those groups threw their support behind the current bill after a few changes: Reading materials will be available in languages other than English, and using phonics-based instruction will be optional, not mandatory. Although the state is pushing all schools to adopt the new approach, some may choose to stay with their existing curriculum, which is permissible under the state’s school governance system that leaves most decisions up to local school boards.
“What does this all mean? It means we’ll see,” said Todd Collins, an organizer of the California Reading Coalition and former Palo Alto Unified school board member. “But I’m hopeful. I think most school districts will get the message that they need to improve early literacy.”
Scores inching up
Collins’ group surveyed 300 California school districts in 2022 and found that 80% were not using a phonics-based approach to reading instruction. That’s changing, with some of the state’s largest districts adopting science-of-reading strategies and seeing good results. Los Angeles Unified, for example, saw its English language arts test scores jump 5.5 percentage points since it adopted a phonics-based curriculum in 2022. San Francisco Unified, Fresno Unified and Long Beach Unified have also seen improvements.
California’s reading scores are about the same as the national average, according to the latest Nation’s Report Card scores, and have been inching up since the pandemic. Last year, 49% of students met or exceeded the state’s English language arts standards — still below pre-pandemic levels but a big increase from the previous year.
Helping teachers
Among those who’ve pushed for the switch to phonics is Assemblywoman Blanca Rubio, a Democrat from West Covina who co-authored the bill. A former elementary teacher, Rubio hopes the new law will help classroom teachers as much as students and their families.
“It’s hard for teachers to see their kids feel defeated and frustrated,” Rubio said. “Now they’ll be equipped to really help their students succeed.”
She was inspired to author the bill, she said, in part because of her younger brother’s experience in school. He was wrongly placed in special education and never properly learned to read, she said, leading him to disengage from school and drop out in ninth grade. Countless other students have had the same experience, she said.
“I know how much it means to learn to read. It can shape someone’s whole life,” Rubio said. “That’s why we stuck with this.”
Another boost to reading instruction came in June, when Newsom included $200 million in the state budget to train teachers in the science of reading. The money should be enough to train every K-3 teacher in the state, Collins said. Credential programs are already training future teachers in the approach.
Tuck, of EdVoice, said the next step is ensuring the policy rolls out smoothly in schools. The new curriculum is a major shift for most schools, and teachers will need plenty of support.
“We can celebrate today, but tomorrow it’s back to work,” he said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/111722-Whittier-LJ-CM-17.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-20 10:01:11.172569

(Photo by Christian Nunes inaturalist.org CC-by-NC 4.0)The Iowa skipper butterfly, once prevalent in prairies across the middle of the U.S., is now at risk of extinction — according to the Center for Food Safety, which has petitioned federal agencies to list the butterfly as an endangered species. 
The Center originally filed a petition on the butterfly in March of 2023, but after several extensions and missed deadlines from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to make a decision, the Center has filed a notice of intent to sue over the delayed action. 
Center for Food Safety holds that the Iowa skipper, a small bright yellow and orange butterfly, has lost most of its habitat due to agriculture and is further at risk by commercial pesticide spraying, climate change and invasive species. 
Suzannah Smith, legal counsel with the Center for Food Safety, said the Iowa skipper, if listed as endangered, will get designated critical habitat, which she said will be good for a slew of at-risk pollinators. 
“Because they’re an indicator of good prairie habitat, a lot of other pollinators that are just barely hanging on the Great Plains are also really dependent on the habitat that they’re in, and so by designating the habitat for the Iowa skipper, we can also help protect a lot of other pollinators,” Smith said. 
Endangered species designation would also protect the butterfly from actions intended to harm, trap, kill, wound or capture.
Iowa skipper no longer in Iowa
The Center for Food Safety, a nonprofit aimed at fighting the industrial food model, called the Iowa skipper a “canary in the coal mine” for high-quality prairie habitat. According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, North America has lost more than 60% of its grassland biome, and 99% of tallgrass prairie in the continent has been lost because of agriculture, development and invasive species. While the grassland biome used to stretch as far east as Iowa, most of the remaining biome, according to the service, is further west and south. 
The subspecies of skipper butterfly, despite its name, has not been present in Iowa since 2009, according to the center’s petition from March 2023 to list the butterfly as an endangered species. 
In addition to Iowa, the butterfly was commonly found in 14 states through the central portion of the country. Now, according to the center’s petition, Atrytone arogos iowa, the Latin name for the butterfly, is typically found only in protected prairie areas in states like Nebraska, Colorado and Oklahoma. 
The center calls the butterfly a “prairie specialist” and holds that the conversion of prairie to cropland, combined with regular application of pesticides on commercial agriculture operations, has contributed to the species’ decline. Smith said even in protected prairie areas, the butterfly is at risk of pesticide drift as the small protected regions are typically surrounded by cropland.
According to the petition, the Iowa skipper faces similar threats to the already endangered Dakota skipper, Poweshiek skipperling and rusty patched bumblebee. 
Legal action 
The Center for Food Safety’s notice of intent to sue alleges USFWS violated the Endangered Species Act by failing to issue a finding on the butterfly within its designated time frame. 
This is the second time the center has issued a notice of intent to sue over the matter. It filed in April 2024 after the initial one year and 90-day deadlines were missed. According to the center, the federal department responded in June 2024 that it would make a 90-day finding, so the center held off on the suit. In October 2024 the USFWS said a listing “may be warranted” for the butterfly, and according to the center, did not issue its 12-month finding on the matter after a full year. The center filed the latest notice of intent to sue on Oct. 8, 2025. 
Smith said it “seemed like” the service was working on reaching a decision in 2024, which is why the center gave it a “bit of a grace period.” But, she said the service then “blew past the deadline,” even before the current government shutdown. 
Staff at USFWS could not be reached for comment on the notice of intent to sue because of the federal shutdown which furloughed hundreds of thousands of federal employees. 
The Center for Food Safety said it intends to sue under the Endangered Species Act if USFWS does not issue its 12-month finding, or “develop a timeline” for the Iowa skipper in the next 60 days. 
Butterfly protections 
The Endangered Species Act, which passed in 1973, is considered one of the strongest laws in the U.S. and has become fairly controversial in the past 50 years. Some believe the law is used by environmental advocates to block various development projects. 
The first notable time the law was used, it protected a small darter fish in a Tennessee river and in the process, stalled a massive dam project. 
Smith said the endangered species designation for the Iowa skipper would protect the butterfly from any “taking” by a private or government actor. Taking, under the act includes things like harming, killing, trapping or wounding. 
Smith said spraying pesticides in an area where the butterflies are known to live would be a form of taking. Controlled burns, which are often used to manage protected areas, can also harm the butterflies, so Smith said endangered species designation for the butterfly could also alter some land management practices in areas the butterfly resides. 
The Center for Food Safety has an extinction crisis campaign as well as campaigns against pesticides, which includes herbicides, insecticides and neonicotinoids. It also fights against things like forever chemicals, genetically engineered foods and confined animal feeding operations. 
“Our belief is that our food system should be nourishing both humans and the planet, and we shouldn’t have a food system that’s destroying our planet,” Smith said. “So we’re trying to make sure that industrial agriculture, including monoculture and pesticides, aren’t pushing pollinators towards extinction.”

The Trump resistance ignited again in the U.S. and California Saturday, underscoring a country that’s on multiple tracks to push back against the president as state lawyers prepare for two marquee court hearings against his administration this week and next.
Nationwide, some protesters held colorful signs, chanted in unison and wore inflatable costumes. It was the second No Kings protest following the first one in June, and it was much bigger this time around, according to organizers: More than 7 million people showed up across 2,700 planned events, compared to June’s rally, which included 5 million people and 2,100 events.
Demonstrators slammed the administration’s crackdown on immigration, deployment of the National Guard to Democratic-leaning states, firing of federal workers and other policies. President Donald Trump’s net approval rating is now -15 percentage points, according to The Economist. Some Californians also showed their support for the state’s redistricting measure, Proposition 50.
Protesters in Los Angeles were nonviolent, reports CalMatters’ Mikhail Zinshteyn, who was on the ground in downtown Saturday. But police officers on horseback moved on demonstrators after issuing a number of dispersal orders in the evening to clear the area. Some officers also fired less-lethal munitions. Several people were detained and there was at least one reported arrest, according to ABC 7.
Tens of thousands of protestors rallied together elsewhere in California, including the northern region of the state, San Francisco and the Bay Area, Central Valley and the Inland Empire.
In response to the nationwide protests, Trump posted an AI-generated video of himself wearing a crown, flying a jet labeled “King Trump” and targeting demonstrators with a brown substance.
California’s Attorney General has sued the Trump administration 44 times and two of those lawsuits will see consequential court hearings this week and next. In both cases, California lawyers will seek to persuade judges to undo Trump’s control of the California National Guard. Whether Trump can federalize California troops has been an ongoing legal tussle since June and the issue has expanded to other states.
Meanwhile, Gov. Gavin Newsom on Sunday condemned the Trump administration after a military shell detonated over Interstate 5. The shell went off during a live-fire demonstration at Camp Pendleton in San Diego County in celebration of the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Marine Corps. 
Newsom had previously opposed the demonstration, arguing that it was “reckless” and closed off a section of the major freeway. No injuries were reported, though shrapnel dropped onto vehicles, reports The New York Times.

Recently minted CA laws

Let’s dive into some measures Newsom recently signed into law:

Reading lessons: California will take a major step to overhaul its reading curriculum after Newsom signed a bill last week providing training for school principals and reading specialists in the “science of reading.” Also known as phonics-based instruction, this approach to reading focuses on vocabulary and sounding out words rather than learning words by sight. Read more from CalMatters’ Carolyn Jones.


Birthing centers: After CalMatters published a series of reports detailing the state’s dire lack of birthing centers — particularly in rural areas — the governor approved a bill that would streamline licensure requirements for birthing centers, making it easier for them to receive state approval. Read more from CalMatters’ Kristen Hwang.


Food stamp data: Newsom signed a bill by Assemblymember Buffy Wicks that bans state and local departments from sharing sensitive personal data to increase CalFresh enrollment. The Oakland Democrat’s measure is a rescission of a law Wicks successfully pushed last year. That law allowed state and local public entities — including ones related to education, crime and employment — to override all state privacy laws in order to share data about people who could potentially get food stamps. Wicks said she was reversing course in response to the Trump administration’s attempt to “weaponize state data.” Read more from Phoebe Huss of CalMatters’ College Journalism Network.




Mixed success on reparations bills

Proponents of reparations are regrouping after state lawmakers had mixed success with winning Newsom’s signature for a slate of bills intended to right the lasting damages of slavery and centuries of discrimination against Black Californians, write CalMatters’ Cayla Mihalovich and Wendy Fry. 
Of the 16 “Road to Repair” bills the California Legislative Black Caucus prioritized earlier this year, Newsom signed five into law and vetoed five others. One bill Newsom spiked would have allowed colleges to prioritize descendants of enslaved people for admissions. In his veto message, the governor said colleges “already have the authority to determine whether to provide admission preferences like this.”
State Sen. Akilah Weber Pierson, a San Diego Democrat and chairperson of the caucus, said the caucus plans to regroup in a couple of weeks to plan its direction for next year. Two of her reparations bills were signed, including one requiring California State University to research methodologies to determine whether someone is a descendant of an enslaved person.

Weber Pierson, in an interview: “A veto is never, in my opinion, a ‘no.’ It may be a ‘no, for now.’ It may be just a ‘no’ this year. And it may be a ‘no’ but let’s try something different.”

But Chris Lodgson, a spokesperson for the advocacy group Coalition for a Just and Equitable California, argues the state isn’t moving fast enough, and that passing legislation focused on more reparations research rather than directly repairing harm “is delay by design.”

The Minneapolis school board has formally asked Superintendent Dr. Lisa Sayles-Adams for information that could lead to school closures. They passed a resolution to the effect at a recent meeting. 
The board first drafted the directive —which asks for an initial report to the board by April 2026 — at two day-long meetings in June and August. The planning follows years of discussion about closing schools in a district with 29,000 students but the capacity for 42,000 and thus a bevy of half-empty schools. 
Even as enrollment declines at a school building, the fixed expenses for building staff — like principals, secretaries, nurses, librarians, culinary workers, custodians and social workers — stay the same or go up. With so many buildings below capacity, a big portion of each Minneapolis student’s funding has to go toward covering these fixed building-level costs, draining money away from instruction and extracurricular activities. 
The board resolution comprises topics for district administrators to investigate, including efficient use of current buildings, potential changes to magnet programs, and ways to increase enrollment in the district.
Years-long discussion about the financial burden of operating small enrollment schools 
The process for downsizing the district’s footprint has been long and circuitous. 
In October 2022, the district prepared a comprehensive financial assessment forecasting that without significant cost cutting, the district would end up draining its reserves, while expenses would exceed revenues by the end of fiscal year 2026. The district has avoided that fate by cutting services and raising class sizes, but it is still unable to balance its budget without relying on reserves and other one-time funds.
The 2022 memo did not prescribe closing schools, but it did present an analysis showing enrollment growth alone could not overcome the district’s structural inefficiencies resulting from operating many schools with small enrollments. At the time of the analysis, Anoka-Hennepin was operating 37 school buildings while enrolling about 37,000 students. Minneapolis was operating 61 buildings while enrolling about 29,000 students. Minneapolis had about half as many students per building as Anoka-Hennepin.
The board first publicly discussed reducing the number of schools in March 2023, when then-board Chair Sharon El-Amin asked Rochelle Cox, the then-interim superintendent, to develop a draft plan for “school transformation.” Neither Cox nor the board took action.
Two months before current Superintendent Dr. Lisa Sayles-Adams started at the district in early 2024, the School Board passed a “transformation resolution” that directed the district to do an accounting of physical space but stopped short of calling for a timeline on school closures. 
Sayle-Adams promised to tackle “right-sizing” the district after passing a budget in June 2024, because, she said, the community asked her to address the issue. 
Low enrollment schools require more funding per student for building-level staff
The district is contending with rising costs and operating a significant number of small buildings, as well as buildings operating below capacity. Given the rising fixed costs of operating these buildings, that leaves less money for everything else, from class size reduction to teacher pay and programs commonly found in most school districts like world languages, art, music and athletics.
Across the district, as building-level enrollment has declined, students have lost access to services like academic support if they’re struggling; staff to address student behavior; and community liaisons to help parents connect with schools. Small elementary schools have difficulty funding full-time positions for electives like art, music and gym, while hiring part-time staff for these positions is challenging. Some elementary students have gone without these electives, or only have music or art for part of the school year.
Enrollment declines at middle and high schools have meant fewer elective options, like world languages, dance, theater and orchestra, as well as extracurriculars. Students also lose access to advanced coursework — like AP or IB classes — when there are too few students in the school who want to enroll. Many of the district’s high schools are now sharing athletic teams because individual schools lack enough students and funding to support a robust athletics program.
The decline in services drives some families to schools outside the district that have the services and programs they desire, compounding the enrollment declines.
Declines in enrollment mitigated by new-to-country students
Minneapolis Public Schools lost about 15% of its enrollment in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, due to a combination of factors including implementing a controversial plan redrawing school boundaries, and keeping its schools closed longer during the pandemic than any other Minnesota district, which was followed in March 2022 by a three week educator strike. 
The district has enjoyed a small enrollment increase both last year and this year. Although the district does not track the immigration status of students, the increase has been attributed almost entirely to students newly arrived to the United States from Central America. Since the 2021-22 school year, English learner students have increased from 17% of the district’s students to 23% in the 2024-25 school year, according to Minnesota Department of Education data. 
This year, the district expects to spend at least $17 million more on English learner services than it receives in funding from state and federal sources. Although the Legislature increased state aid for English learners during the 2023 legislative session, the district’s funding is insufficient to cover the cost of providing the intensive services needed by students with the lowest levels of English proficiency. 
Many of the newcomer students are also unhoused, which has led to growing costs for the district to transport students from shelters outside district boundaries, as required under the federal McKinney-Vento law. The state has started to pay the cost of this transportation under a law passed in 2023.
It is not clear whether changes to federal immigration policy will impact the district’s ability to continue to rely on newcomers to stabilize or grow enrollment in the future.
Future enrollment expected to decline, limiting district’s funding
Hazel Reinhardt, a demographer hired by the district, says enrollment is likely to continue to decline in the coming years because of lower birth rates, fewer families choosing to raise children in the city, and the state’s favorable laws around charter schools and open enrollment, allowing parents to send their children to St. Paul or suburban schools. 
Reinhardt told the board in June that once parents leave for charter and private schools or open enrollment options, “precious few” districts are able to bring them back. 
Most of the district’s funding is based on enrollment, so declining enrollment has created a ballooning fiscal crisis. Growing costs for both labor and services have outpaced increases in state and local funding. 
The district continues to cut services, increase class sizes and pull from its dwindling reserve funds to balance its annual budget. The district is expected to use $25 million from its reserves this school year after using $85 million from reserves last school year.
The district’s enrollment woes and related financial distress are not unique to Minneapolis, with similar challenges facing large urban districts like Oakland, San Francisco, Denver, Seattle and Portland. Denver and Oakland have closed a small number of schools in recent years, but not enough to stabilize district finances. And school boards in Seattle and San Francisco have walked away from closure plans after significant public pressure, leaving both districts with growing budget deficits.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MinneapolisSchool_1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-20 09:01:55.297692
,California,2025-10-20 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,Stockton is redefining its identity through the evolution of its hip-hop scene,Tama Brisbane,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/10/stockton-identity-evolution-hip-hop-scene/,"Stockton struggles with an identity crisis, born out of geography and a distance that impedes everything: access to industry, audiences and opportunities.","Guest Commentary written by

Tama Brisbane
Tama L. Brisbane is Stockton’s Poet Laureate Emerita and a literary and performing arts consultant.


I watched a new era in Stockton’s hip-hop scene come of age.
Moving to the Central Valley city in the early 2000s, I found a hip-hop community that was its own form of resistance. Smoldering frustration with poverty, racial tension and a reputation for violence that it couldn’t seem to shake. Stockton’s sound was silenced more often than it was supported.
My adopted home carries a peculiar duality: burdened by perception and powered by persistence. Hip-hop here didn’t arrive gently. Hell, it wasn’t even invited — it bum-rushed its way in. 
One of the longest odds Stockton hip-hop struggles with is an identity crisis, born out of geography and a distance that impedes everything: access to industry, audiences and opportunities. We’re 45 minutes from Sacramento and nearly two hours from the Bay, in the middle of a region nobody knows how to define. The Bay has hyphy and an iconic ambassador in E-40. 
But Stockton? This in-between place never had a defining sound all its own. 
But distant didn’t mean dismissed. Even as far back as the 1980s, Stockton was in the building. Thanks to legendary and local promoters like Hardin Fulcher, Brian Sampson, Thaddeus Smith and others, acts like Too Short, The Fat Boys, even N.W.A pulled up. And the Civic Auditorium was the stage of the people, home to hip-hop before the city ever thought to make it actually welcome.
Contrast that with the venerable Bob Hope Theatre, the city’s downtown showpiece before the construction of Stockton Arena. In an earlier era, Black residents were relegated to sitting in the balcony, demonstrating how cultural exclusion was built into the city’s entertainment DNA. 
Then in 2006, Stockton opened a $68 million arena, its official entry into the lucrative concert industry. The city had a chance to debut the venue with Carlos Santana — globally famous, riding the wave of mega-hit “Smooth,” and culturally resonant with Stockton’s large Hispanic community. Instead, white, aging, tepidly popular Neil Diamond was chosen, and paid $1 million— up front. The city trumpeted a sellout show, but behind the scenes they gave away huge blocks of tickets to fill embarrassingly empty seats. 
The final tally: $400,000 in losses and a public outcry that cost the city manager his job. 
At the same time, the city’s code enforcement campaign was targeting local promoters, nickel and diming them with excessive event permit, security and insurance fees — $100 if there was dancing, more for amplified sound, and a requirement to hire off-duty police officers as security. 
How you gon’ hip-hop in stillness and silence? The fees weren’t just applied unevenly — they were weaponized, wielded against a genre and a culture. 
In 2005, when I was appointed to Stockton’s Civil Grand Jury, one of our investigations spotlighted the city’s discriminatory entertainment policies and burdensome fees. When our report was published in 2006, the city was put on notice — and on the clock — to make changes. The official door for hip-hop in Stockton was opening.
Enter Common: rapper, poet, activist. Thanks to the University of the Pacific’s Music Management Program, in 2007 he became the first hip-hop act to perform at the Hope. The sold-out show represented a seismic shift in the city’s entertainment landscape. And for weeks, one question echoed throughout the local hip-hop scene: Who’s opening for Common?
I pitched a local, collaborative showcase to the university. A Stockton-centric opening set, that reflected the range, artistry and elevation possible — and profitable — for the hip-hop scene.
Hip-hop in Stockton didn’t just survive — it’s evolved. Local artists who once struggled to book a venue now shape the entire city’s entertainment vision. In the person of Adonis Spiller, aka MadSpill, hip-hop now sits on the Stockton Arts Commission, influencing both artistic funding and policy. 
And the arena that once hosted Neil Diamond’s costly debut/debacle? It’s since welcomed E-40, Lil Wayne and a parade of revenue-generating hip-hop acts. Stockton hasn’t produced a breakout star — yet — but the infrastructure, energy and community remain undeniable.
In the end, Stockton hip-hop isn’t just about music, or even money. It’s about creating and showcasing 209 stories. Stockton’s hip-hop scene was built, not in spite of this city’s notorious violence, but oftentimes in direct response to it. 209 contends with crime, systemic disinvestment, apathy and oppression towards its youth and communities of color — conditions that color the lyrics and experiences of its artists.
Artists like Daddex, MBNel, EBK Jaaybo, Mundo, Jelani, Deozene, Surf Baby, Braxy, Zeps, BLoveJones, Haiti Babii, Steve Spiffler and Mikeila Janae are making waves regionally and beyond. It’s Jazmarie LaTour, Stockton Poet Laureate, host of the city’s longest-running open mic, and Hatch Workshops, where hip-hop happens. It’s The Lyte, or word-of-mouth but now standing room only event where performance artists come to shine. 
And one day, it’s gonna be about that time when it was, finally, Stockton hip-hop’s time.

An audit last week said the now-defunct Maryland Racetrack Operating Authority Board failed to document agreements for a $10 million loan for the track as well as millions in consulting contracts. (File photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)A now-extinct state board charged with overseeing the redevelopment of Pimlico Race Course and overseeing thoroughbred racing in the state failed to formalize an agreement for $10 million in working capital and ensure that millions in consulting contracts were in the state’s best interest and competitively bid.
The findings are part of a report on the Maryland Thoroughbred Racetrack Operating Authority released Thursday by the Office of Legislative Audits.
The report found “significant deficiencies” in the operation of the board that auditors said could “adversely affect MTROA’s ability to maintain reliable financial records, operate effectively, and/or comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations.”
Auditors said they also found “significant instances of noncompliance” with state laws and regulations.
The authority was created in 2023 as part of what is seen by many as a last-ditch effort to preserve the state’s horse racing and related industries, revitalize Pimlico and prevent the Preakness Stakes, the second leg of the Triple Crown, from leaving Baltimore and perhaps Maryland.
The 13-member authority was tasked then with creating a “best in class” racing venue. The authority was to take over the track and consolidate thoroughbred racing in the state. The authority created the nonprofit Maryland Jockey Club last year to manage day-to-day racing operations as the state took over the track as well as the licensing of the Preakness and related races and memorabilia.
Audit finds lax credit card oversight at Department of Assessments and Taxation

Earlier this year, lawmakers in Annapolis hinted at trouble with the arrangement. Hearings early in the session yielded little additional information.
But in March, as the session was winding down, a budget conference committee added surprise language dissolving the authority and bifurcating racing and redevelopment efforts.
The Maryland Stadium Authority was tasked with overseeing the demolition and construction of a new Pimlico track as well as a modern training facility. The Maryland Economic Development Corp. assumed responsibility for racing operations and community redevelopment.
The redevelopment of Pimlico is now underway under the changes made earlier this year.
The legislative audit sheds light on concerns about the authority handing millions in state money to the jockey club and used to hire consultants.
In one instance, auditors found the authority failed to secure a written agreement with The Maryland Jockey Club governing what auditors described as a $10 million “working capital advance” or loan. A typical agreement should have detailed the roles and responsibilities of the authority and jockey club in managing and operating Pimlico and the training facilities.
“Such agreements are critical for establishing oversight over the $527 million that the General Assembly has committed to the redevelopment of Pimlico and training facilities,” auditors wrote.
The governor’s office, responding for the now-defunct thoroughbred racetrack authority, agreed with many of the findings. But it challenged the idea of $10 million in working capital as “a loan.”
Deputy Chief of Staff Manny Welsh, in a written response, said the 2023 law “does not specify that the working capital authorized in the law be treated” as a loan.
He added that the authority board “did not conduct a vote on any agreements to clarify that the working capital was to be treated as a loan advance or finalize any terms for repayment.”
Auditors, in a note at the end of the report, said they stood by their description.
In the report, auditors wrote that a draft agreement written in February 2025 “referred to the $10 million as an operating loan and as such, this description was included in our analysis. The terminology is also consistent with the description … provided to us by MTROA management during our audit.”
A second finding — which the governor’s office agreed with and deemed accurate — involved five consulting contracts totaling $1.9 million.
Auditors reported that the authority “did not ensure the contracts included clearly defined deliverables and deadlines and that the related invoices were detailed. Therefore, there was a lack of assurance that invoices were appropriate to pay and that the services were provided timely.”

The Crew monitors 12 species spanning over 140 plots each year. (Courtesy Institute of Applied Ecology)Last month, the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) announced it had partnered with the Department of the Interior to cut $14 million worth of environmental grants, including $2.5 million for New Mexico.
The Institute of Applied Ecology, based in both Oregon and here in New Mexico, is one of the organizations that had a large swath of its funding cut.
“We work with native plant materials development,” said Katy Silbert, the assistant branch director of the institute’s southwestern branch. “Which means that we are collecting seeds from the wild to then grow those plants and put them back on the landscape.”
In addition to replanting, the institute does experimental research and monitoring of rare plants in partnership with private landowners, and a slew of federal, state, and local agencies across seven states.
Silbert said that the funding cuts seemingly came out of nowhere, with some of their staff learning about them while out in the field.
“One of our ecologists was doing a planting with our Bureau of Land Management partners and were finding out [about the cuts] at the same time that we were,” Silbert told KUNM.
The cuts were spearheaded by DOGE, and the Trump administration claimed on the social media site X (formerly known as Twitter) that these grants, which make up over half of Silbert’s budget, were “wasteful” because their DEI-esque hiring initiatives weren’t aligned with agency “priorities.”
The now-cancelled awards came from a slew of agencies under the Department of the Interior – from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National Park Service, to the U.S. Geological Survey and the Bureau of Land Management for initiatives for delivering on the ground conservation or building conservation capacity.
“Real action = real savings,” Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum wrote on social media. DOI is also currently preparing to implement another round of agency-wide layoffs.
Overall, the Institute for Applied Ecology received 30 federal award cancellation notices on Sept. 23 from Department of the Interior agencies totaling somewhere around $3.5 million. Silber said $2.5 million of that was specifically for conservation in New Mexico.

Other organizations that lost funding include the Bird Conservancy of the Rockies and the Lomakatsi Restoration Project. It’s common for these types of awards and grants to be reimbursed after organizations have spent their own personal funds for a project, which is then paid back by the federal government after a review process. These agreements can span several years.
This means that Silber’s team has already spent money that they might not get back.
“It can be a challenge to balance that when we have some of these larger expenditures – because conservation, while very important, isn’t always cheap, but it’s always worth it,” Silber said.
Silber pointed out that their habitat restoration efforts are broadly beneficial for many New Mexico species – including the lesser prairie-chicken, chestnut-collared and thick-billed longspurs, and the monarch butterfly.
“There are these massive ripple effects of having fewer resources on the landscape,” she added.
While some of these projects will still go forward and others reevaluated, the slashes are having an immediate effect, forcing the institute to lay off two seasonal youth field crews and four other regular positions.
These cuts come in the midst of a systemic push to overhaul agencies under the executive branch, where President Donald Trump is broadly attacking popular conservation policies and public lands in the name of energy exploration and economic development.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/appliedecology-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-10-20 09:01:55.297692

“We have a lot of geothermal resources, and they’re not being developed as much as they should or could be,” Senate Majority Assistant Whip Mike McKell, R-Spanish Fork, told the Natural Resources, Agriculture, and Environment Interim Committee on Wednesday. “And the question was, who owns the geothermal resource in the state of Utah? Is it a water right? Is it a surface right, or is it a mineral right?” 
Currently, the Utah Division of Water Rights reviews permits for geothermal developments, a process that can be done in about 30 days, Senate Majority Assistant Whip Mike McKell, R-Spanish Fork, told the Natural Resources, Agriculture, and Environment Interim Committee on Wednesday.
While industry players are happy with the fast permitting timelines, there’s still uncertainty about who holds what right, McKell said.

The process, under a new bill from McKell, will be a little bit of a hybrid. Land owners will be able to own the energy-producing heat below their land, regardless of whether someone else owns rights to minerals like oil or gas in the space.
However, energy producers must also have a water right for the geothermal fluids they have to use since traditionally, the technology uses water or working fluids to carry heat to turn turbines.
The Division of Water Rights would still approve applications to operate wells for geothermal production under McKell’s bill.
The bill would also affect the water rights division’s public record practices. If approved, it would delete part of the code that says that geothermal filings to the division are public records “unless the owner or operator requests, in writing, that the records be held confidential” for a maximum of five years.
“Previously, the state engineer would hold the proprietary data for five years. It’s reducing that to one year, which we think is a good thing to encourage geothermal development,” state engineer Teresa Wilhelmsen told the legislative panel.
The proposal passed as a committee bill, but still faced skepticism from some members. The bill will go through a full legislative approval process with considerations in Senate and House committees, a path that McKell specifically requested.
“This is a big enough issue, and I think it’s actually helpful for us to signal this to industry that we’re working on it and we’re providing this clarity,” McKell said.
Other Western states are mixed on geothermal rights, McKell said. Wyoming, for example, includes geothermal fluid in its definition of underground water, so energy producers need to apply for a water permit to access the geothermal heat. Others, like Nevada, Oregon and Washington tie geothermal rights to the owners of the land on the surface. 
Unique, waterless geothermal system moving forward in Utah

Utah has essentially been operating under the model laid out in the bill, but it’s now being codified, McKell said.
Jim Goddard, geothermal program manager at the Utah Division of Water Rights, said in a presentation that this bill would tackle one application of geothermal generation — electricity, which is accomplished at high temperatures.
Other geothermal uses, like direct heating and cooling done at lower temperatures, will be regulated differently. 
The Point development, located at the site of the former Utah State Prison, for example, has the potential to develop an existing geothermal well to provide community heating and energy, greenhouse support and recreation. Because the system used at The Point isn’t hot enough to produce electricity, it wouldn’t fit in this specific legislation.
One of McKell’s goals with the bill is to make the regulatory burden as low and economical as possible, he said. Another is to encourage private geothermal development in the state.
During the meeting Rep. Carl Albrecht, R-Richfield, expressed concern about whether the geothermal operation would affect local water rights used for irrigation and other purposes.
“That is exactly why we have to keep a water right attached, so that we can go through that process and identify if existing rights will be impaired or affected by that, and then we can take appropriate action,” Wilhelmsen said.

(Eric Schultz for Alabama Reflector)Republican voters in eastern Alabama go to the polls Tuesday to elect a GOP nominee for the House District 38 special election.
Voters will choose between Garrett Dixon, Micah Messer and Kristin Nelson. All are first-time candidates, except for Messer who ran in the 2022 GOP primary against former Rep. Debbie Wood, R-Valley.
The district covers parts of Chambers and Lee counties.

When do polls open?

Polls will be open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Tuesday. 

Where do I find my polling place

The Alabama Secretary of State’s website allows you to check voter registration and the location of your polling place. You can find it here.

What do I need to vote?

Voters must present a valid photo ID before voting. Valid forms of ID include: 

Alabama driver’s license (not expired or expired less than 60 days)
Alabama Law Enforcement Agency digital driver’s license
Alabama Non-Driver ID (not expired or expired less than 60 days)
Alabama Photo Voter ID card
State-issued ID (Alabama or any other state)
Federal-issued ID
U.S. Passport
Employee ID from the federal government; state of Alabama; county; municipality, board or other entity of Alabama

Where is the district located?

The district covers parts of Chambers and Lee counties, including Valley, Lanett and Smiths Station.

How did the seat become vacant?

The seat became vacant after Wood resigned this summer to move near the Florida panhandle, where her husband works. 

Does the seat have a partisan lean?

District 38 is solidly Republican. Wood won in 2022 with almost 90% of votes against Libertarian Charles Temm Jr. She won with about 70% of votes in 2018 against Democrat Brian McGee.

What issues dominate the race?

Messer and Nelson have both said they want income tax reform, but the current rates are locked via a 1933 constitutional amendment. Any changes would have to be done through a different constitutional amendment. 
Messer also wants an election audit law, which Wood tried to do while she was in the Legislature. Nelson wants every school, public and private, to have a school resource officer.
Multiple attempts to reach Dixon have been unsuccessful. 

Campaign fundraising

According to campaign finance records, Dixon has raised more than $55,000 and spent almost $41,000. About one-third of Dixon’s donations came from Political Action Committees (PACs). He had almost $7,000 on-hand before the special election cycle began.
Messer has raised about $16,000 and spent almost $22,000. He had almost $9,000 on-hand before the special election cycle began. According to campaign finance records, the EAGL PAC donated $1,000, the sole PAC donation to Messer’s campaign.
Nelson has raised over $22,000 and spent almost $21,000 since the beginning of the special election in August. She had about $11,000 on-hand before the special election cycle began. All of her cash donations came from individuals and businesses.

What happens after Tuesday?

The Republican with the most votes will face Democratic candidate Hazel Floyd, 21, on Feb. 3, 2026. If a candidate does not receive 50% of the vote, a runoff primary election will be held on Nov. 18.

Will the results alter control of the Legislature?

No. Republicans currently hold 72 of the 105 seats in the Alabama House, after three resignations after the end of the 2025 session in May, including Wood. Rep. Cynthia Almond, R-Tuscaloosa, was appointed president of the Public Service Commission in June. Rep. Matt Woods, R-Jasper, was elected to the State Senate on June 24.

They’re also holding on to their properties longer before putting them up for sale, in keeping with a nationwide trend.
Las Vegas home sellers saw a median profit of 53% in the third quarter of this year, down from 59.6% a year ago. The typical Las Vegas home sold in the third quarter had been owned for about eight and a half years, according to a new report from ATTOM, a real estate data analyst. 
Seller gains in Southern Nevada topped out in the second quarter of 2022 at 81.8%, based on transactions going back to 2008.  Profit margins are based on the difference between the purchase and resale price.  
The median sale price of a home sold in Reno in the third quarter was $548,000, down from $555,000 in the second quarter, and down from $577,570 a year ago. 
Profit margins in Reno peaked in the second quarter of 2022 at 88.5%. 
Reno homeowners who sold in the third quarter earned a median profit of 54.8%, down from 68.1% a year ago. The typical homeowner in Reno owned their property for approximately nine and half years. 
Homeowners in the U.S. made a median profit of 49.9% on homes and condos sold during the third quarter. That’s down from 55.4% a year ago, according to the report. 
The median sale price of a home in the U.S. in the third quarter was $370,000, up 1.2% from the second quarter and up 3.4% from last year. 
The median sale price in Las Vegas, according to ATTOM, was $445,000, down from $449,000 last quarter, but up from $440,000 a year ago. 
U.S. homeowners are keeping their properties longer before putting them up for sale. 
“Owners had held homes sold in the third quarter of 2025 for an average of 8.39 years before selling them, the longest average homeownership tenure in at least 25 years and up from 8.13 years for homes sold in the previous quarter,” the report says. 
Among metropolitan areas with populations above 1 million, the largest average profit margins last quarter were in San Jose, CA (94.3%); Seattle, WA (80.2%); Buffalo, NY (80%); Rochester, NY (77.3%); and Hartford, CT (75%).
The lowest average profit margins among the biggest metro areas were New Orleans, LA (19.6%); San Antonio, TX (22.8%); Houston, TX (30%); Austin, TX (31.8%); and Dallas, TX (33.5%).
 Profit margins are still above pre-pandemic levels, according to ATTOM’s data.  
“Prior to 2020, home sellers saw profit margins of around 30 percent. As the Covid-19 pandemic induced people in search of more space to leave cities and buy homes, profits doubled to more than 60 percent in mid-2022,” the report says. “The average seller’s return has been dropping steadily since that peak, but over the last three quarters it’s held just below 50 percent.”
Big cities. Bigger prize. 
In terms of cash, the typical home sale generated a profit of $123,100, the report says, but notes “large disparities, with sales in the top major urban areas generating 18 times more in profit than those at the other end of the spectrum.”
The west coast swept the category of top large metropolitan areas with the largest raw dollar profits, with San Jose, CA leading the way with $740,500, followed by San Francisco, CA ($450,000); San Diego, CA ($350,000); Los Angeles, CA ($349,500); and Seattle, WA ($325,000).
According to a 2024 Consumer Affairs report, some 158,000 Californians have moved to Nevada since 2020, making up 43% of new residents within the past four years.
Major metros with the smallest raw profits were New Orleans, LA at $41,000, followed by San Antonio, TX ($55,895); Oklahoma City, OK ($63,000); Birmingham, AL ($68,500); and Louisville, KY ($71,000).
While real estate gains “remain below the peak levels reached during the pandemic, recent quarters suggest a more stable, sustainable market environment,” the report said of the national outlook. “Continued buyer demand, bolstered by moderating mortgage rates, may be helping to maintain solid returns for sellers across much of the country.”
Institutional investors not going away  
Purchases by institutional investors such as hedge funds made up 6.4% of sales nationwide in the third quarter, down from 7% in the second quarter, but up from 6.1% a year ago. Homes sold to institutional investors accounted for 6.4 percent of all sales nationwide, down from 7 percent in the previous quarter but a slight increase over 6.1 percent in the third quarter of last year.
Texas had the highest proportion of sales to institutional investors at 8.8%, followed by Missouri (8.8 %); Tennessee (8.7%); Indiana (8.4%); and Mississippi (8.4%).
Additionally, Las Vegas was among the five metro areas with the lowest percentage of lender sales. Seattle, WA had the lowest share (0.5% of all sales), followed by Los Angeles, CA (0.6%); Charlotte, NC (0.6%t); Las Vegas (0.6%); and Phoenix, AZ (0.6%).",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-468653152-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-20 08:01:47.879333

A Homewood charter school that was founded to serve LGBTQ+ students got renewed last week, but school officials said they had taken out language about their mission. (Alander Rocha/Alabama Reflector)I’m not a fan of charter schools. Broadly speaking, they do little to improve learning outcomes and siphon resources from traditional public schools.
We don’t need that in a state that underfunds education, particularly where Black Alabamians are concerned.
But I hate bullies. And I hate what the bullies running our state have done to Magic City Acceptance Academy.
The charter school opened in Homewood in 2021, focusing on LGBTQ+ students. It was the first of its kind in Alabama, but not the first in the nation. New York’s Harvey Milk High School dates back to 1985. Pride School operated from 2016 to 2018 in Atlanta.
Whatever you think of charter schools, LGBTQ+ students are often the targets of cruel people. Three-fourths of LGBTQ+ students responding to a 2022 survey said they had experienced harassment; a third of them said it had been physical. Other surveys have found that physical bullying of LGBTQ+ students is even worse in the South. Which can lead to horrible outcomes, including increased risk of suicide.
Needless to say, all public schools should enforce anti-bullying policies and make students feel safe and welcome. But there is a clear logic to opening a school where students don’t have to worry that their sexual identity will put them in danger.
Magic City did not limit its enrollment to gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender students. But it aimed to make LGBTQ+ students feel welcome. Students in the school told al.com in 2022 that they could thrive at Magic City. They could even attend the prom, something they didn’t feel safe doing before.
Unfortunately, Magic City couldn’t stop the ambitious bullies in our political class.
In 2022, Republican Tim James tried to boost his floundering gubernatorial campaign by attacking a drag performance presented by the school’s teachers. Even by the gutter standards of Alabama politics, it was despicable. It led to harassment of school students and officials and forced the charter to invest in security.
Two years later, Gov. Kay Ivey signed SB 129, a law banning publicly-funded DEI programs and “divisive concepts,” which can be roughly defined as anything suggesting a world beyond the views of wealthy white heterosexuals.
That’s about as clear as I can get. The law is vague in its definitions. Which is convenient for those who get into politics to hurt people.
And in Magic City’s case, it seems to have worked.
The school did get its charter renewed last week. In some ways, that was a victory over Alabama’s far-right media, which treats vulnerable people as things to be threatened.
But a lot seems to have been lost. Magic City Acceptance Academy is no longer a school that aims to help LGBTQ+ students. That language is gone, according to the testimony of Patton Furman, the principal and superintendent of the school.
“We have taken that out,” he told the Alabama Public Charter School Commission. “We are affirming to all people.”
That’s fine, but the point of the academy was giving LGBTQ+ students a place to live as themselves. If a school is simply “affirming” everyone’s existence, what makes it so different from a public school?
There are smaller losses, too. The school altered its logo. It had to recontextualize the rainbow motifs in its building.
They’re even teaching kids at the school to call the Gulf of Mexico the “Gulf of America,” President Donald Trump’s preferred name for the Gulf of Mexico. That’s sad. I’m sure that petty burst of insecurity has already been replaced two or three times over in Trump’s head with something else from his bottomless persecution complex.
I sympathize with Furman, who is playing a bad hand as best as he can. A school that welcomes everyone is nothing to criticize.
But it’s a terrible marker of the nation’s degeneracy. Ten years ago, bigotry around sexual identity seemed to be dying. We could see a future where gender and orientation mattered as much as eye and hair color. We could imagine a nation free of the poison of closeted behavior and the trauma of forcing people to deny who they are.
Today, Alabama makes it a crime to provide health care to transgender people. Lawmakers work every year to force LGBTQ+ communities out of public life.
This is the environment the school faces. We live in a time where a small band of zealots want to beat Alabama into an either/or way of life, where conformity is all and individuality is a threat.
So there are two ways to view the changes they’ve made.
One is that Magic City has abandoned their outreach to LGBTQ+ youth.
The other is that they’re concealing that mission, hoping to survive until the storm ends.
In the latter case, it may be the only way for the school to keep going.
But it’s a baleful moment. A place meant to allow LGBTQ+ youth to be their best selves now models ways to hide what it is.
That’s an outrage. Places like Magic City should be lifting us to a better future. Instead, they’re knuckling under, showing what governance by bigotry and grievance has cost us.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/PXL_20230516_163756103-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-10-20 09:01:55.297692

The cyber attack ended up crippling several critical services like the Department of Motor Vehicles for over a week, and the full extent of the data that was compromised is still unknown as state officials, the Cyber Security Infrastructure Administration, and the FBI continue their investigation. 
However, one critical state service – the Secretary of State’s voter registration information – remained untouched. This was due in large part to a 2021 law that mandated centralizing voter data into a top-down voter registration system, consolidating all counties’ voter information. 
The old system, which had required each county to individually track and record voter data, was a bottom-up system where counties had to manage their own lists and cybersecurity before the information was transmitted to the SOS system. In contrast, the Voter Registration and Election Management System (VREMS) requires that all counties report voter registration and election data into a single system, which allows for more uniform list maintenance and provides a more secure cybersecurity infrastructure, as seen with the cyber attack earlier this year. The change, although expensive, has resulted in a safer and more transparent system for election officials and voters alike. 
The implementation of VREMS removed siloes between the Secretary of State and county clerks, allowing not just for easier list maintenance, but also strengthening the state’s ability to safeguard the information in one system rather than the patchwork the state had previously. 
All in all, the adoption of the new VREMS systems has demonstrated its value in more ways than one, and Nevada voters can rest assured knowing that their voter registration data was not compromised in the latest cyber attack. However, the attack is also a signal of what’s to come and a reminder that we cannot let our guard down. 
Specific voter data – such as addresses, partial security numbers, and driver’s license numbers – is sensitive and should remain guarded from malicious or third-party actors. Yet, budget cuts at the federal level to organizations like CISA, combined with a rise in cyber attacks like the one we experienced earlier in the year, add layers of complexity to that mandate for state officials. 
While we wait to learn more about the full extent of Nevada’s cyber attack, we’re taking this time to learn what went right in Nevada’s switch to the VREMS system and protect against future attacks by continuing to learn and adapt to emerging cybersecurity threats. For so many Nevadans, participating in elections is a dearly held right. We must do everything we can to make sure that this right, and the information we give to exercise it, remains safe.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/election-day-10-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-20 08:01:47.879333

Here's what to know.","Next month, Connecticut voters will head to the polls to elect candidates for local positions in their city or town.
No statewide or national elections — like those for United States Senate and House of Representatives seats or for governor of Connecticut — are held in odd-numbered years. But on Nov. 4, many communities throughout the state will still elect officeholders to positions like mayor, city councilor, alder or board of education member.
Here’s what to know about the upcoming elections.
How do I know who’s running in my city or town?
The Secretary of the State’s office publishes sample ballots online for each city and town, which show the candidates running. You can find yours here.
Many Connecticut municipalities publish the sample ballots on their websites as well. 
Where and when can I vote?
Polls will be open from Oct. 20 through Nov. 2 for early in-person voting. Early voting is a relatively new option for Connecticut voters — the state implemented it for the first time last year after the legislature approved it in 2023.
Early voting will be open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. each day, including weekends. On Oct. 28 and 30, the polls will have extended hours from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.
Each municipality is required to have at least one polling location — typically at a town or city hall — and those with populations of 20,000 or more have the option to open multiple locations. 
Your early voting polling location may be different from your Election Day polling place. Find your early voting location on the Secretary of the State’s website here.
On Election Day, polls will be open from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. You can find your polling place here.
Can I vote absentee?
Possibly, if you meet certain requirements.
In Connecticut, you are only allowed to vote by mail for one of the following reasons: you’re an active member of the U.S. military; you will be out of town on Election Day; you will be serving as an election official at a different polling location; you can’t vote for religious reasons that day; or sickness or a physical disability will prevent you from making it to the polls on Election Day.
Absentee ballots for the Nov. 4 election became available on Oct. 3. To get one, you must first apply for it by sending a completed absentee ballot application to your town clerk’s office. You can download the application here or pick one up at your town clerk’s office.
A ballot will then be mailed to you, and after filling it out, you or a “designee” can return it by mail, drop it in a ballot drop box or return it in person to the town clerk. Full absentee ballot guidelines, including who qualifies as a designee, can be found here.
Last fall, Connecticut voters approved a constitutional amendment that allowed for universal (also known as “no-excuse”) absentee voting, paving the way for the legislature to pass a law allowing every voter to cast an absentee ballot. However, the legislature has not passed such a law, so absentee ballots are still only available to voters who meet the qualifying circumstances.
What if I’m not registered to vote?
Connecticut offers same-day voter registration during the early voting period and on Election Day. 
During early voting, you can register at your polling place. On Election Day, you can register at your town’s Election Day registration site, which can likely be found on your municipality’s website.
What are some of the biggest races?
The two largest cities with mayoral elections in November are New Haven and Stamford. In both cities, incumbent Democratic mayors are running for reelection against Republican challengers.
New Haven Mayor Justin Elicker is running for a fourth two-year term. His Republican opponent is Steve Orosco, a former MMA fighter and the founder of SMASH MMA, a mixed-martial arts events organization.
Stamford Mayor Caroline Simmons is running for a second four-year term. Her Republican opponent is Nicola Tarzia, founder of a plumbing, heating and construction services company and former Stamford Board of Education member.
Norwalk and Hamden also have mayoral elections, but in those municipalities, candidates are running for open seats. 
In Norwalk, the Democratic nominee is Common Council President Barbara Smyth, a retired teacher who defeated fellow council member Darlene Young in the primary. She’ll face off against Republican nominee Vinny Scicchitano, an auto repair shop owner and member of the Saint Ann’s Club of Norwalk.
Hamden’s Democratic nominee is former school board chair and longtime town official Adam Sendroff, who won a five-way primary race. His Republican opponent is Jonathan Katz, a paralegal who holds degrees in economics and international political economy from Fordham University.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024_1105_SR_Polling_027-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-20 07:37:22.964745

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Richard Faesy: ‘Affordable’ housing and Vermont energy codes.","This commentary is by Richard Faesy, of Starksboro. He is a principal and co-founder of the Energy Futures Group. 


Building more affordable houses for Vermonters is in everyone’s interest. However, making sure that homes are energy efficient, healthy, durable and resilient so that they remain affordable over their lifetime is equally as important. Instead of only looking at the first cost, considering the year-over-year energy operating costs would also provide the best indication of true home ownership costs. Financing a little more upfront for an energy efficient home can pay for itself with energy savings that more than offset any increase in monthly mortgage payments. 
Vermont energy codes are developed with just this approach in mind; only those measures that more than pay for themselves in energy cost savings are included. Reverting back to the 2020 Residential Building Energy Standards (RBES) energy code actually makes housing less affordable than building to the more cost-effective 2024 RBES. This energy code rollback, ordered by Gov. Phil Scott on Sept. 17, not only makes housing less affordable but also means that the state will need to find other potentially more costly ways to meet our climate goals.
However, while Scott’s executive order is a setback, it could also provide an opportunity to level an uneven playing field for all builders and new construction. 
If Vermont is serious about providing affordable housing, we need to ensure that all homes are at least built to the 2020 RBES energy code. Past market assessment surveys conducted by the Vermont Department of Public Service have shown declining RBES compliance rates over the time; the most recent study, looking at homes built between 2017 and 2021, shows that only about half of new homes were built to the 2015 RBES, two code cycles behind today’s standards. This is a disservice to homeowners who are paying too much in energy costs and is unfair to those law-abiding builders who choose to build to the current energy codes.
Vermont’s lack of an “authority having jurisdiction” over all energy codes means there is no state agency enforcing the energy codes, resulting in our abysmal energy code compliance rates. Besides home buyers paying higher energy bills, builders can compete on home prices by building sub-standard homes and undercutting their legally compliant competition.
Naming a state agency such as the Division of Fire Safety to oversee both energy and building codes for all buildings in Vermont — and not just “public buildings” as is currently the case — while establishing a code enforcement system would provide consumer protection. It would also make sure all builders are playing by the same rules, make gains towards our climate goals and ensure that all of the homes our state needs to build are truly “affordable.”

(Getty Images)Frustration over utility rates and concerns about the impact of new businesses locating in Indiana have driven discussions about Indiana’s energy policy to an unprecedented but justified level of intensity in recent months. 
It is not hard to understand why. Access to reliable and affordable energy is essential to our daily lives. It is also critical to the state’s manufacturing and industrial sectors, which currently account for 26% of the state GDP, a larger share than any other state.  
Though it is easy to understand why energy anxiety has hit new levels, it is a little harder to pinpoint, exactly why. It is a long and complex story. Suffice to say that economic incentives to support utility investment, the necessary process of retiring aging power plants and building replacement generation, inflationary pressures, changing customer demand, and a litany of other factors have all played a role in bringing us to this point. The interplay of these factors help explain why the process of creating balance between customers and utilities — which is the ultimate goal of the regulatory process — is difficult.  
Unfortunately, while Indiana and some very dedicated policymakers and stakeholders have tried very hard to find the right balance between those pressures and their impact on customers, we haven’t gotten the mix quite right. 
Braun names next top utility customer advocate, tees up regulator overhaul

At this historic juncture, with a need to expand electric capacity on a scale the likes of which this country has not seen since the 1940s and 50s, we now have two broad paths open to us. One is to keep doing what we have been doing. The other is to try new approaches to adjust the balance. Understanding the story of how we got here is important, not to lay blame, but to focus on the essential question: “Which path do choose?” If we want reliable and affordable power as well as economic prosperity and development, we cannot continue along our current trajectory.  
But if we choose a different path, what does that look like?
One step is to establish better support for customer investment in the energy resources which serve them. Indiana already has customer generation and, in fact, industrial customers in Indiana generate hundreds of megawatts of their own power to support their operations. But more could be done to balance the rights of customers and the interests of utilities. Expanded options for ownership and operational models for customer generation, actively supporting voluntary partnerships between utilities and customers to develop generation, and removing geographic and economic constraints on generation are all positive steps that could expand private investment in energy resources and reduce the need for costly new utility construction at public expense.
We also need to re-evaluate the incentives currently provided to utilities. In the past, Indiana has encouraged infrastructure investment by providing financial incentives for cost recovery. But a sustained cycle of incentivized capital investment by utilities will continue to drive utility rates higher. In that regard, Gov. Mike Braun has suggested we need to be more “attentive” to the investments utilities make.  
One approach would be to revisit prior legislation to add stronger ratepayer protections. Utilities should be required to provide better justification for investments which receive automatic rate recovery; to demonstrate more than ordinary business risk before recovering cost overruns from customers; and adjust their profit margins to reflect the reduced risk arising from pre-approved investments. These are common sense steps to balance the existing investment incentives with the corresponding rate burden on customers.
Indiana has many advantages as we head into the future. Our location at the Crossroads of America means we have the highways, the pipelines, the transmission facilities and other resources to propel ourselves forward. As we consider that future, no single answer is the “right” one. It is clear that if we want different outcomes, we need to implement different approaches.  Hopefully, we choose that path.

There will soon be fewer steelhead released into Washington’s waters due to the impending closure of Skamania Hatchery. 
Located in Washougal, the hatchery produces summer and winter steelhead that are released into southwest Washington rivers for recreational fishing. 
The hatchery produces 331,000 steelhead per year, according to the state Department of Fish and Wildlife. 
Operations at Skamania Hatchery will begin to slow in in the 2026 fiscal year, which starts in July, as the state Department of Fish and Wildlife begins the three-year process of closing the facility. 
The Washougal and Beaver Creek hatcheries will take over some steelhead production. 
The Department of Fish and Wildlife estimates that closure of the Skamania Hatchery will reduce the total production of steelhead in Washington by 161,000 per year after factoring in the increased fish from the other facilities.
The hatchery’s closure will most strongly affect southwest Washington recreational steelhead anglers, according to the Department of Fish and Wildlife. 
The Department of Fish and Wildlife announced its decision to close Skamania Hatchery in June after not receiving its full two-year budget request from the state Legislature. 
The agency had asked the Legislature for $1.9 million to maintain operations at the North Toutle and Skamania hatcheries, but only received $750,000 as lawmakers worked earlier this year to resolve a budget deficit in the $12 billion to $16 billion range. 
“This funding is far short of the amount needed to sustain current hatchery operations at both facilities,” the Department of Fish and Wildlife said in its budget request for next year. 
The North Toutle Hatchery produces Tule Fall Chinook and coho salmon. 
With only enough funding to support continued operations at one of the two hatcheries, the Department of Fish and Wildlife determined that the benefits of keeping the North Toutle Hatchery open outweighed the benefits of the Skamania Hatchery. 
Rather than asking the Legislature to backfill its initial request amid declining revenue forecasts, the Department of Fish and Wildlife is asking for $432,000 in the 2026 supplemental budget to start closing Skamania Hatchery. 
“The Department recognizes the necessity of exercising fiscal restraint this year
considering falling revenue forecasts, rising caseload costs, shifting federal impacts, and
increasing tort liabilities,” Department of Fish and Wildlife Director Kelly Susewind said in a letter to Office of Financial Management Director K.D. Chapman-See. 
Two Skamania Hatchery staff will be reassigned to the Washougal Hatchery but stay onsite at the Skamania Hatchery to oversee the three-year closure process. 
Those staff members will continue trapping and fish ladder operations for returning adult fish that were released from the hatchery as juveniles. 
Staff will finish closing the hatchery and begin decommissioning it once there are no more adult fish returning. 
Decommissioning the hatchery will involve removing any intake or other in­water structures, demolishing infrastructure and restoring habitat in the area. 
That process may take an additional six years after the hatchery closes and cost roughly $8 million, which the Department of Fish and Wildlife said will need to come from a future capital budget.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/485006935_1056478596514356_3017860874306171660_n-1-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-20 07:37:22.964745

(AP Photo/Rick Bowmer, Pool)After three executions in less than a year — ending a nearly 15-year pause in Indiana’s use of capital punishment — it’s not clear when the state will carry out another.
Five men remain on Indiana’s death row, but only four are currently considered competent for execution. 
No new inmates have been added since 2013, and capital prosecutions remain rare and costly.
While prosecutors say there are still appropriate cases for capital punishment, local jurisdictions are increasingly weighing when those charges are best pursued compared to life-without-parole sentences, especially given the legal costs and the length of appeals.
“Prosecutors are using this only when absolutely necessary,” said Clark County Prosecutor Jeremy Mull. “Justice sometimes demands it — but it must also be reliable, fair and certain.”
There’s no timeline for the next execution — it’s up to the Indiana Attorney General’s Office to request execution dates from the state supreme court.
The future of execution methods is also unclear, given mounting scrutiny over how much Indiana taxpayers have paid for the lethal injection drug pentobarbital used in the state’s three most recent executions.
 Who remains on Indiana’s death row
Indiana’s remaining condemned inmates are housed at the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City.
Eric D. Holmes was sentenced in 1993 for a double murder during a 1989 robbery at a Marion County Shoney’s restaurant. Holmes and an accomplice ambushed three former coworkers, killing two with knives. His federal habeas appeal was denied, and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review his case.
Kevin Isom was sentenced in 2013 for killing his wife, Cassandra, and her two teenage children in Gary in 2007. He fired at responding officers before a SWAT team took him into custody. His case remains under federal habeas corpus review.
Jeffrey Weisheit was sentenced in 2013 for the deaths of two children in Vanderburgh County. Prosecutors said he bound and gagged 5-year-old Caleb and 8-year-old Alyssa Lynch before setting his home on fire. His most recent federal appeal was denied in 2023.
William Clyde Gibson III, sentenced in separate cases in 2013 and 2014 for killing three women — Karen Hodella, Stephanie Kirk and Christine Whitis — in Floyd County. Each was strangled to death in 2012. His appeals are ongoing in federal court.
Michael Dean Overstreet was sentenced in 2000 for the 1997 kidnapping, rape and murder of 18-year-old Kelly Eckart in Johnson County. He was declared mentally incompetent for execution in 2014, effectively suspending his death sentence unless a future court finds him competent.
Three others who were long listed on Indiana’s death row — Joseph Corcoran, Benjamin Ritchie and Roy Ward — have since been executed. 
Corcoran was executed in December 2024 for the 1997 killings of four men in Fort Wayne — one brother and three friends — marking Indiana’s first execution since 2009.
Ritchie was executed in May for the 2000 shooting death of Beech Grove Police Officer William Toney.
And Ward was put to death earlier this month for the 2001 rape and murder of 15-year-old Stacy Payne in Spencer County, marking the state’s third execution in twelve months.
Pending capital cases
No new inmates have been added to Indiana’s death row since 2013. But several defendants across the state currently face capital murder charges.
According to data from the Indiana Supreme Court and county filings, four defendants have pending death penalty cases: John Adams in Marion County; Carl Boards II in Madison County; Orlando Mitchell in Marion County; and Dalonny Rodgers in Hendricks County.
County prosecutors have not filed any new death penalty cases in 2025, as of mid-October. 
Over the past five years, filings have been limited to between one and three capital cases per year — a decline from the 1990s and early 2000s, when multiple capital prosecutions often ran simultaneously, according to state data. 
Three new death penalty cases were filed in 2021, two in 2022, two in 2023 and one in 2024, Supreme Court data shows.
Prosecutors weigh costs, time and other factors
Mull chairs the Indiana Prosecuting Attorney Council’s Complex Litigation Committee that advises Hoosier prosecutors on capital cases, law enforcement shootings and other highly complicated cases. He told the Indiana Capital Chronicle that prosecutors reserve death penalty filings for “the worst of the worst offenders.”
“These cases are filed where we have very strong and incontrovertible proof of guilt,” Mull said. “We do not want to be a state where we have someone who is wrongfully put on death row.”

He noted that while justice sometimes requires pursuing the death penalty, prosecutors also weigh a defendant’s mental condition and the toll that lengthy appeals take on victims’ families.
“Many families simply don’t want to go through decades of appeals and hearings,” Mull said. “They want closure. Life without parole often accomplishes that.”
Costs of capital litigation are another consideration.
“These cases can run into the millions of dollars over time,” he said. “Counties generally get reimbursed for a percentage of that by the state, but it can still leave taxpayers locally on the hook for a huge amount of money.”
Death penalty prosecutions can cost counties millions to litigate, depending on how long the case remains active.
Multiple state studies — including a 2010 review by the nonpartisan Legislative Services Agency — have found that a death penalty case in Indiana costs about five times more than a comparable case seeking life without parole, largely because of the extra trials, legal motions, expert witnesses and appeals required.
The Indiana Abolition Coalition further points to counties that have been forced to raise taxes or divert road funds to cover the costs of single capital prosecutions that later resulted in life sentences instead.
Under Indiana law, counties can seek 50% reimbursement for defense costs in death penalty cases through the Indiana Commission on Court Appointed Attorneys.
Marion, Madison and Wayne counties collectively received more than $230,000 capital reimbursements during the 2024–25 fiscal year for ongoing cases, according to the CCAA’s latest annual report.
Statewide, capital reimbursements totaled about $197,000 in fiscal year 2022–23 and $312,000 in 2023–24, according to CCAA data.
Mull emphasized that the state’s appellate process can take decades, contributing to delays that frustrate families and communities. He suggested lawmakers consider legislation to shorten appellate timelines, arguing that “citizens and victims have a right to speedy justice,” just as defendants do.
“There’s no reason it should take 10 or 20 years to determine whether it was a fair trial,” he said.
Questions over Indiana’s execution drugs
The state resumed executions last year using pentobarbital, a single drug protocol also used by the federal government.
Gov. Mike Braun’s office has refused to disclose how much the state paid for the latest three sets of lethal injection drugs purchased by the Department of Correction in recent months.
At least one of those sets of pentobarbital was expected to be used for Ward’s execution. The remaining sets will expire at the end of the month, according to court documents.

The governor previously disclosed that state officials spent $1.175 million on lethal injection doses over the past year — $600,000 of which was spent by former Gov. Eric Holcomb’s administration on drugs that expired before use. The cost has been between $275,000 and $300,000 per dose.
Over the past year, Braun and several Republican lawmakers have discussed potential alternatives to lethal injection amid ongoing shortages and legal challenges.
Some have floated legislation to authorize nitrogen hypoxia, mirroring Alabama’s new method, while others have proposed a review of whether the state should keep the death penalty at all.
Bills to abolish capital punishment have been filed in recent sessions but have not received hearings.
Federal death row in Terre Haute
Indiana is also home to the nation’s only federal execution chamber, located in the U.S. Penitentiary in Terre Haute. The facility gained national attention during the final months of the first Trump administration, when officials carried out 13 executions there between 2020 and 2021.
Today, only three men remain on federal death row — two of them housed in Terre Haute. The third, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, convicted for his role in the Boston Marathon bombing, is being held in Colorado because of what Bureau of Prisons officials have described as “unique security management requirements.”
Federal executions have been paused since 2021, though, when former President Joe Biden ordered a moratorium to review the government’s use of pentobarbital. In December 2024, Biden commuted the death sentences of 37 of the 40 men who were then on federal death row, converting their punishments to life without parole.
He did not commute the sentences of Tsarnaev; Dylann Roof, who killed nine people in a Charleston church; and Robert Bowers, convicted in the 2018 Pittsburgh synagogue massacre.
Since returning to office, President Donald Trump has pledged to restart executions in Terre Haute and directed Justice Department officials to assist state prosecutors interested in re-trying Biden clemency recipients in states that retain the death penalty.

March 12, 2025. Submitted photo.While Michigan lawmakers had been in what felt like a never-ending stalemate on their budget negotiations for a large part of this year, the recent passage of the 2026 state budget agreement demonstrates that bipartisanship is still possible in today’s polarizing political climate. With that being said, we wish the agreement had been reached back in June and that it was a budget that truly put the people of Michigan first. 
The budget, as a whole, takes some significant positive steps toward meeting the needs of Michigan children, families and seniors. However, we recognize more work needs to get done. And Michiganders will still feel undue harm caused by federal cuts to essential programs like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. 
Reacting to the harmful federal megabill, the budget included the important step of updating state laws to protect Michigan’s ability to fund its share of Medicaid by keeping the state’s provider tax structure in place. Without this, Michigan would have had to either dig into state coffers at the expense of other priorities to maintain existing services, or it would have lost billions of dollars in Medicaid funding, restricting Michiganders’ access to health care, eliminating coverage for important services like doulas or community health workers, and disrupting our state health care system for everyone. This was necessary and we are thrilled the Michigan Legislature and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer took steps to protect it.
Michigan Democrats blunted the effects of Trump’s tax reforms. Now businesses are bristling.

Stronger and more equitable school funding, including an increase in per-pupil spending and increased funding focused on the students who need it most, additional funding for student mental health services, and the continuation of universal free school meals are all vital to ensuring kids have what they need to learn. We were pleased to see these things make it into the final budget agreement. An investment in technology to protect Bridge card users from benefit theft was also included as well as a significant down payment in the expansion of the successful and evidence-based Rx Kids program, which will help more Michigan babies and parents get a stronger start toward health and economic security.

While it’s positive that the Legislature looked at state revenue streams and recognized that the status quo just wasn’t good enough, we are concerned that roads were prioritized at the expense of more meaningful investments in the people of Michigan at a time when they need it most. 
Despite the budget agreement including some things that center Michiganders’ needs, more must be done to truly shield them from the harm caused by the federal megabill. The most vulnerable of Michiganders will be hit the hardest by the megabill at a time when they are already struggling to make ends meet. We know from our latest Kids Count in Michigan data released a couple of weeks ago that more than 17% of our state’s children are living in poverty, and over 40% of Michigan households are either in poverty or can’t afford the basic cost of living. 
And while early childhood is the age group that has the biggest return on investment, Michigan lawmakers largely left them out this year. We were deeply concerned that, overall, the budget lacked a holistic approach to funding the early childhood service sector and a comprehensive strategy to address the early childhood workforce shortage. 
Additionally, funding for other services, such as Early On and early literacy programs, was at best held flat or decreased at a time of growing need. What’s worse is that funding for our Great Start Collaboratives, which serve as an important resource to families through connections to services, home visiting programs and parent education, was completely eliminated, breaking a nearly two-decade-long commitment to these support systems that serve thousands of kids each year. As child care and early education programs remain out of reach for many Michigan families due to both the high cost and lack of availability, we need further investment, not stagnating funding.

Budgets are not just spreadsheets, they are moral documents, and the people of Michigan — kids, families and workers — should always be central to them. 
The agreement that was finally reached doesn’t completely miss the mark in that regard, but we had hoped to see more people-centered investments to mitigate more of the harm caused by federal funding cuts to programs Michigan families and our local communities rely upon to stay healthy and thriving. In the face of increases in child care costs, rising housing costs and unknown future health care costs, our state lawmakers need to continue to champion policies that will protect Michiganders from what we know are going to be some extremely challenging times ahead.

This story was originally published by ProPublica. Sign up to receive their biggest stories. 
When Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers stormed through Santa Ana, California, in June, panicked calls flooded into the city’s emergency response system.
Recordings of those calls, obtained by ProPublica, captured some of the terror residents felt as they watched masked men ambush people and force them into unmarked cars. In some cases, the men wore plain clothes and refused to identify themselves. There was no way to confirm whether they were immigration agents or imposters. In six of the calls to Santa Ana police, residents described what they were seeing as kidnappings.
“He’s bleeding,” one caller said about a person he saw yanked from a car wash lot and beaten. “They dumped him into a white van. It doesn’t say ICE.”
One woman’s voice shook as she asked, “What kind of police go around without license plates?”
And then this from another: “Should we just run from them?”
During a tense public meeting days later, Mayor Valerie Amezcua and the City Council asked their police chief whether there was anything they could do to rein in the federal agents — even if only to ban the use of masks. The answer was a resounding no. Plus, filing complaints with the Department of Homeland Security was likely to go nowhere because the office that once handled them had been dismantled. There was little chance of holding individual agents accountable for alleged abuses because, among other hurdles, there was no way to reliably learn their identities.
Since then, Amezcua, 58, said she has reluctantly accepted the reality: There are virtually no limits on what federal agents can do to achieve President Donald Trump’s goal of mass deportations. Santa Ana has proven to be a template for much larger raids and even more violent arrests in Chicago and elsewhere. “It’s almost like he tries it out in this county and says, ‘It worked there, so now let me send them there,’” Amezcua said.
Current and former national security officials share the mayor’s concerns. They describe the legions of masked immigration officers operating in near-total anonymity on the orders of the president as the crossing of a line that had long set the United States apart from the world’s most repressive regimes. ICE, in their view, has become an unfettered and unaccountable national police force. The transformation, the officials say, unfolded rapidly and in plain sight. Trump’s DHS appointees swiftly dismantled civil rights guardrails, encouraged agents to wear masks, threatened groups and state governments that stood in their way, and then made so many arrests that the influx overwhelmed lawyers trying to defend immigrants taken out of state or out of the country.
And although they are reluctant to predict the future, the current and former officials worry that this force assembled from federal agents across the country could eventually be turned against any groups the administration labels a threat.
One former senior DHS official who was involved in oversight said that what is happening on American streets today “gives me goosebumps.”
Speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, the official rattled off scenes that once would’ve triggered investigations: “Accosting people outside of their immigration court hearings where they’re showing up and trying to do the right thing and then hauling them off to an immigration jail in the middle of the country where they can’t access loved ones or speak to counsel. Bands of masked men apprehending people in broad daylight in the streets and hauling them off. Disappearing people to a third country, to a prison where there’s a documented record of serious torture and human rights abuse.”
The former official paused. “We’re at an inflection point in history right now and it’s frightening.”

Although ICE is conducting itself out in the open, even inviting conservative social media influencers to accompany its agents on high-profile raids, the agency operates in darkness. The identities of DHS officers, their salaries and their operations have long been withheld for security reasons and generally exempted from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. However, there were offices within DHS created to hold agents and their supervisors accountable for their actions on the job. The Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, created by Congress and led largely by lawyers, investigated allegations of rape and unlawful searches from both the public and within DHS ranks, for instance. Egregious conduct was referred to the Justice Department.
The CRCL office had limited powers; former staffers say their job was to protect DHS by ensuring personnel followed the law and addressed civil rights concerns. Still, it was effective in stalling rushed deportations or ensuring detainees had access to phones and lawyers. And even when its investigations didn’t fix problems, CRCL provided an accounting of allegations and a measure of transparency for Congress and the public.
The office processed thousands of complaints — 3,000 in fiscal year 2023 alone — ranging from allegations of lack of access to medical treatment to reports of sexual assault at detention centers. Former staffers said around 600 complaints were open when work was suspended.
The administration has gutted most of the office. What’s left of it was led, at least for a while, by a 29-year-old White House appointee who helped craft Project 2025, the right-wing blueprint that broadly calls for the curtailment of civil rights enforcement.
Meanwhile, ICE is enjoying a windfall in resources. On top of its annual operating budget of $10 billion a year, the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill included an added $7.5 billion a year for the next four years for recruiting and retention alone. As part of its hiring blitz, the agency has dropped age, training and education standards and has offered recruits signing bonuses as high as $50,000.
“Supercharging this law enforcement agency and at the same time you have oversight being eliminated?” said the former DHS official. “This is very scary.”
Michelle Brané, a longtime human rights attorney who directed DHS’ ombudsman office during the Biden administration, said Trump’s adherence to “the authoritarian playbook is not even subtle.”
“ICE, their secret police, is their tool,” Brané said. “Once they have that power, which they have now, there’s nothing stopping them from using it against citizens.”
Tricia McLaughlin, the DHS assistant secretary for public affairs, refuted descriptions of ICE as a secret police force. She called such comparisons the kind of “smears and demonization” that led to the recent attack on an ICE facility in Texas, in which a gunman targeted an ICE transport van and shot three detained migrants, two of them fatally, before killing himself.
In a written response to ProPublica, McLaughlin dismissed the current and former national security officials and scholars interviewed by ProPublica as “far-left champagne socialists” who haven’t seen ICE enforcement up close.
“If they had,” she wrote, “they would know when our heroic law enforcement officers conduct operations, they clearly identify themselves as law enforcement while wearing masks to protect themselves from being targeted by highly sophisticated gangs” and other criminals.
McLaughlin said the recruiting blitz is not compromising standards. She wrote that the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center is ready for 11,000 new hires by the beginning of next year and that training has been streamlined and boosted by technology. “Our workforce never stops learning,” McLaughlin wrote.
White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson also praised ICE conduct and accused Democrats of making “dangerous, untrue smears.”
“ICE officers act heroically to enforce the law, arrest criminal illegal aliens and protect American communities with the utmost professionalism,” Jackson said. “Anyone pointing the finger at law enforcement officers instead of the criminals are simply doing the bidding of criminal illegal aliens and fueling false narratives that lead to violence.”
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, the Trump pick who fired nearly the entire civil rights oversight staff, said the move was in response to CRCL functioning “as internal adversaries that slow down operations,” according to a DHS spokesperson.
Trump also eliminated the department’s Office of the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman, which was charged with flagging inhumane conditions at ICE detention facilities where many of the apprehended immigrants are held. The office was resurrected after a lawsuit and court order, though it’s sparsely staffed.
The hobbling of the office comes as the White House embarks on an aggressive expansion of detention sites with an eye toward repurposing old jails or building new ones with names that telegraph harsh conditions: “Alligator Alcatraz” in the Florida Everglades, built by the state and operated in partnership with DHS, or the “Cornhusker Clink” in Nebraska.
“It is a shocking situation to be in that I don’t think anybody anticipated a year ago,” said Erica Frantz, a political scientist at Michigan State University who studies authoritarianism. “We might’ve thought that we were going to see a slide, but I don’t think anybody anticipated how quickly it would transpire, and now people at all levels are scrambling to figure out how to push back.”
‘Authoritarian playbook’
Frantz and other scholars who study anti-democratic political systems in other countries said there are numerous examples in which ICE’s activities appear cut from an authoritarian playbook. Among them was the detention of Tufts University doctoral student Rümeysa Öztürk, who was apprehended after co-writing an op-ed for the campus paper that criticized the school’s response to the war in Gaza. ICE held her incommunicado for 24 hours and then shuffled her through three states before jailing her in Louisiana.
“The thing that got me into the topic of ‘maybe ICE is a secret police force’?” said Lee Morgenbesser, an Australian political science professor who studies authoritarianism. “It was that daylight snatching of the Tufts student.”
Morgenbesser was also struck by the high-profile instances of ICE detaining elected officials who attempted to stand in their way. Among them, New York City Comptroller Brad Lander was detained for demanding a judicial warrant from ICE, and U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla was forcibly removed from a DHS press conference.
And David Sklansky, a Stanford Law School professor who researches policing and democracy, said it appears that ICE’s agents are allowed to operate with complete anonymity. “It’s not just that people can’t see faces of the officers,” Sklansky said. “The officers aren’t wearing shoulder insignia or name tags.”
U.S. District Judge William G. Young, a Ronald Reagan appointee, recently pointed out that use of masked law enforcement officers had long been considered anathema to American ideals. In a blistering ruling against the administration’s arrests of pro-Palestinian protesters, he wrote, “To us, masks are associated with cowardly desperados and the despised Ku Klux Klan. In all our history we have never tolerated an armed masked secret police.” The Trump administration has said it will appeal that ruling.
Where the fallout is felt
The fallout is being felt in places like Hays County, Texas, not far from Austin, where ICE apprehended 47 people, including nine children, during a birthday celebration in the early morning of April 1.
The agency’s only disclosure about the raid in Dripping Springs describes the operation as part of a yearlong investigation targeting “members and associates believed to be part of the Venezuelan transnational gang, Tren de Aragua.”
Six months later, the county’s top elected official told ProPublica the federal government has ignored his attempts to get answers.
“We’re not told why they took them, and we’re not told where they took them,” said County Judge Ruben Becerra, a Democrat. “By definition, that’s a kidnapping.”
In the raid, a Texas trooper secured a search warrant that allowed law enforcement officers to breach the home, an Airbnb rental on a vast stretch of land in the Hill Country. Becerra told ProPublica he believes the suspicion of drugs at the party was a pretense to pull people out of the house so ICE officers who lacked a warrant could take them into custody. The Texas Department of Public Safety did not respond to a request for comment.
The Trump administration has yet to produce evidence supporting claims of gang involvement, said Karen Muñoz, a civil rights attorney helping families track down their relatives who were jailed or deported. While some court documents are sealed, nothing in the public record verifies the gang affiliation DHS cited as the cause for the birthday party raid.
“There’s no evidence released at all that any person kidnapped at that party was a member of any organized criminal group,” Muñoz said.
McLaughlin, the DHS spokesperson, did not respond to questions about Hays County and other raids where families and attorneys allege a lack of transparency and due process.
In plain sight
Months after ICE’s widely publicized raids, fear continues to envelop Santa Ana, a majority-Hispanic city with a large immigrant population. Amezcua, the mayor, said the raids have complicated local policing and rendered parents afraid to pick up their children from school. The city manager, a California-born citizen and Latino, carries with him three government IDs, including a passport.
Raids of car washes and apartment buildings continue, but the community has started to “push back,” Amezcua said. “Like many other communities, the neighbors come out. People stop in the middle of traffic.”
With so few institutional checks on ICE’s powers, citizens are increasingly relying on themselves. On at least one occasion in nearby Downey, a citizen’s intervention had some effect.
On June 12, Melyssa Rivas had just started her workday when a colleague burst into her office with urgent news: “ICE is here.”
The commotion was around the corner in Rivas’ hometown, a Los Angeles suburb locals call “Mexican Beverly Hills” for its stately houses and affluent Hispanic families. Rivas, 31, the daughter of Mexican immigrants, belongs to Facebook groups where residents share updates about cultural festivals, church programs and, these days, the presence of Trump’s deportation foot soldiers.
Rivas had seen posts about ICE officers sweeping through LA and figured Downey’s turn had come. She and her co-worker rushed toward the sound of screaming at a nearby intersection. Rivas hit “record” on her phone as a semicircle of trucks and vans came into view. She filmed at least half a dozen masked men in camouflage vests encircling a Hispanic man on his knees.
Her unease deepened as she registered details that “didn’t seem right,” Rivas recalled in an interview. She said the parked vans had out-of-state plates or no tags. The armed men wore only generic “police” patches, and most were in street clothes. No visible insignia identified them as state or federal — or even legal authorities at all.
“When is it that we just decided to do things a different way? There’s due process, there’s a legal way, and it just doesn’t seem to matter anymore,” Rivas said. “Where are human rights?”
Video footage shows Rivas and others berating the officers for complicity in what they called a “kidnapping.” Local news channels later reported that the vehicles had chased the man after a raid at a nearby car wash.
“I know half of you guys know this is fucked up,” Rivas was recorded telling the officers.
Moments later, the scene took a turn. As suddenly as they’d arrived, the officers returned to their vehicles and left, with no apology and no explanation to the distraught man they left on the sidewalk.
Through a mask, one of them said, “Have a good day.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gettyimages-2224603707-1024x692.jpg,,,2025-10-20 07:37:22.964745

Mikie Sherrill has enlisted prominent national Democratic lawmakers to boost her bid for governor, a strategy her GOP rival has not adopted.","Rep. Mikie Sherrill, Democratic nominee for governor, right, appears with Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer at the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers union hall in Paramus on Oct. 18, 2025. (Photo by Amanda Brown for New Jersey Monitor)Prominent Democratic lawmakers are hitting the campaign trail to stump for Rep. Mikie Sherrill in her bid to become New Jersey’s next governor, a strategy election observers say is intended to secure the support of voters who loathe President Donald Trump.
Former President Barack Obama cut an ad for Sherrill that debuted last week. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and former Rep. Gabby Giffords of Arizona have campaigned in New Jersey for Sherrill. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore went door-knocking with her on Sunday in Newark. And Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer championed Sherrill for union members in Paramus Saturday.
“I may not be from here, but let me tell you, New Jerseyans are a lot like Michiganders. We work hard, we’re tough, we want the best for each other. You’re loud, you’re proud, and you don’t eff around,” Whitmer said. “This is a clear choice: We got a guy who’s going to get bossed around by D.C, versus a woman who can get sh*t done. We got a bad actor who’s willing to sell you out, or a badass Navy pilot who will take on any woman who messes with New Jersey.”
Thousands protest Donald Trump at New Jersey No Kings rallies

Dan Cassino, a professor of government and politics at Fairleigh Dickinson University and executive director of the FDU Poll, said enlisting Democrats’ most notable national names earns Sherrill media coverage while also helping her overcome lackluster support among some Democratic factions and reinforce her message that she will fight the Trump administration.
“She understands that perhaps people aren’t excited to vote for her, but they will crawl over broken glass to vote against Donald Trump. And so she’s doing everything she can to try and make it seem like voting for Mikie Sherrill is voting against Donald Trump,” Cassino said. “If you’re trying to nationalize the race, bringing in national figures helps to do that and helps to build her narrative of saying, ‘This is a national race, not a local race.’”
It’s a strategy other Democratic candidates have embraced too, with Jersey City mayoral hopeful Mussab Ali this season touting endorsements from Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) and Ilhan Omar (D-MN).
Jack Ciattarelli, Sherrill’s Republican rival, has brought in several GOP VIPs, including MAGA influencers like Scott Pressler and Jack Posobiec, who appeared at a Ciattarelli rally earlier this month in Wildwood, and Vivek Ramaswamy, who appeared with Ciattarelli at the Saddle Brook Diner last Wednesday. Posobiec again joined Ciattarelli in Dumont on Sunday.
But Ciattarelli, a former state assemblyman, has not had lawmakers with higher name ID at his side the way Sherrill has. Observers say that’s probably deliberate.

Bringing in national politicians to campaign with him doesn’t quite square with Ciattarelli’s favorite line that he’s a lifelong Jersey guy focused solely on the Garden State while Sherrill is an out-of-stater who may have higher aspirations, said Ashley Koning, a political science professor at Rutgers University and director of its Eagleton Center for Public Interest Polling.
Many GOP politicians nationally have become so polarizing that inviting them to campaign here becomes a “difficult dance” for Ciattarelli, Koning added.
With a moderate Republican at his side, he could irritate the White House, an unwise move considering Trump endorsed him, she said. Yet a more conservative Republican campaigning for him risks alienating undecided voters in a state where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by more than 800,000 and unaffiliated voters comprise over a third of all registered voters, she said.
“It is so hard to pinpoint what kind of national Republican would play well with voters in New Jersey right now, because at least historically, we’ve had a very different brand of Republicanism than is being executed on the national stage right now,” Koning said.
She added: “Even if they have their party base on their side and with increases in Republican registration, he still likely needs independents to cross the finish line.”
The Sherrill campaign’s choice of backers — moderate Democrats instead of more polarizing politicians like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-New York) — is also likely intentional, Cassino and Koning agreed.
“These are obviously kind of popular, or not really controversial, political figures, at least among Democrats and independents,” Koning said.
While persuading popular lawmakers to stand beside her bolsters Sherrill’s cachet as a four-term congresswoman, it also underscores an unsavory reality about politics — money motivates, Cassino said.
Donors might be more generous seeing big-name politicians support her, while those politicians might hope Sherrill returns the favor someday, he said. Gateway to Leadership, a Sherrill-affiliated leadership PAC, raised nearly $400,000 in the 2023-24 election cycle and donated tens of thousands of dollars to Democratic candidates and groups, according to OpenSecrets, a nonprofit that tracks campaign finance.
“Mikie Sherrill is a very prolific fundraiser, and so other politicians want to be on her good side because she might be giving them money at some point. It’s not a quid pro quo, but it is definitely something that makes her more popular and makes people want to come out in support of her,” he said.
If nothing else, luring big-name politicians to New Jersey can make the race more interesting, said Micah Rasmussen, director of the Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics at Rider University. Voters from both major parties are used to hearing from state party leaders but don’t often get to see or interact with national leaders, he added.
“This is a fun chance to meet national figures who they read about, see on TV, and follow on social media,” Rasmussen said. “I don’t think there’s a serious risk for the campaigns — there’s always the possibility of backlash for a controversial position or a misspeak, but these are experienced, polished leaders who aren’t looking to jam up themselves or anyone else.”
Whoever the candidates line up to stump for them, though, doesn’t signify anything about how the race is going, observers said.
“I know we’re all trying to read the tea leaves,” Cassino said. “But the candidates are just as much in the dark as the rest of us are.”
Ciattarelli campaign spokesman Eric Arpert said Sherrill’s reliance on out-of-state Democratic lawmakers is an attempt to “save her failing final efforts.”
“She’ll never understand the problems we face, and can’t be trusted to fix them. Jack’s campaign continues to be about delivering the positive change New Jersey so desperately needs, and it’s why our momentum and energy continue to grow,” he said.
Asked in Paramus whether enlisting Democratic lawmakers from other states illustrates Ciattarelli’s frequent attack line that he is from New Jersey and she is not, Sherrill said she thinks people “know what I’m focused on.”
“I have been directly focused on driving down costs for families and running on my record of effectiveness and ruthless confidence, if you will, and of course my opponent continues to run away from his record, while at the same time supporting Trump, who is driving up costs for everyone. That seems to be resonating with people,” she said.

And what about the Royals, the other team state lawmakers were hoping to convince to stay in Missouri when they created the subsidy program?  Crickets. 
A ballot summary prepared by Hoskins’ office for a pair of proposed initiative petitions seeking to repeal the stadium funding law declares that voter approval could “likely cause the Kansas City Chiefs to move their stadium from Missouri to Kansas.”
There is no mention of the Royals, an omission that sparked a flurry of questions — and criticism. 
Does Hoskins have some reason to believe the Royals have already decided to leave the state or have no intention of using the stadium tax incentives? 
Or, as critics allege, is Hoskins hoping to sink the measure by making predictions about the future plans of the Chiefs, who — unlike the Royals — have a statewide fanbase, three recent championships, and a star player in Patrick Mahomes who is the face of the sport?
The Secretary of State’s Office insists it has neither inside knowledge of the Royals’ intentions nor a desire to bias voters against the proposed repeal. In a statement, the office said it “does not have access to or knowledge of the private business decisions of any professional sports franchise,” and that the ballot summary must reflect the “clearest, most immediate potential consequence” of the law.
Besides, Hoskins’ office said, the current version of the summary is just the “first bite at the apple.” A recently approved state law gives the secretary of state up to three times to get the ballot language right — if proponents are upset enough about the first version to take the issue to court. 
Brad Ketcher, a lawyer working with the group behind the ballot measure to repeal the subsidy, believes that’s the point. Writing an unfair ballot summary forces backers of initiative petitions to invest the time and money into legal challenges that could otherwise be dedicated to gathering signatures or engaging with voters. 
“Hoskins is all but admitting,” Ketcher said, “that he drafted flawed language with an eye toward slowing the measure.”
Lawsuit, threat of criminal charges part of GOP effort to block vote on Missouri map

Over the last month, Hoskins has found himself at the center of the political storm, facing criticism — and lawsuits — over his office’s role in the initiative petition and referendum process. 
Hoskins has used his authority to pre-emptively reject 100,000 signatures for a proposed referendum on Missouri’s new congressional map. He’s also come under fire for crafting what critics call “deceptive and prejudicial” summary statements for two public‐education related constitutional amendments. 
He was tasked with rewriting the ballot language for a proposal to reinstate Missouri’s abortion ban after a Cole County judge determined the initial wording by lawmakers failed to alert voters that the amendment would ban most abortions. 
But his initial draft was rejected when the judge determined it was “insufficient and unfair.” Hoskins got the judge’s sign off on the summary on his next attempt. 
Sean Nicholson, a longtime progressive activist in Missouri, filed a lawsuit earlier this year asking a judge to strike down a new law that says any ballot language deemed insufficient or unfair by a court must be sent back to the secretary of state up to three times for revision. If, after three attempts, the courts still find the language unacceptable, a judge is then allowed to rewrite it themselves.
Nicholson said Hoskins’ behavior is exactly why the law is so dangerous and should be overturned.
“Denny Hoskins is required to write fair and impartial language,” Nicholson said. “But instead, he is reinforcing all the concerns people had when the legislature passed the law, that a bad-faith politician could use it to waste the people’s time and resources.” 
As for the Chiefs and Royals, their future — in Missouri or Kansas — remains unresolved. 
“We have heard nothing to indicate that the Royals have decided to leave the State of Missouri,” said Gabby Picard, a spokeswoman for Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe, whose office plays no role in the intuitive petition process, when asked about the team’s omission from the ballot summary.
“In fact,” Picard said, “Gov. Kehoe and his team remain in frequent communication with the Royals and the Chiefs to ensure that both teams stay in Missouri — where they belong.”
The teams have expressed interest in leaving Missouri when the lease on their current stadiums in Jackson County expire in 2030. Kansas lawmakers put a deal on the table that would use state incentives to pay for up to 70% of the costs of new stadiums.
The Missouri plan would allocate state taxes collected from economic activity at Arrowhead and Kauffman stadiums to bond payments for renovations at Arrowhead and a new stadium for the Royals in Jackson or Clay counties. The cost is estimated at close to $1.5 billion over 30 years.
Missouri AG, General Assembly seek to dismiss lawsuit against stadium funding bill

A pair of Republican lawmakers filed a lawsuit hoping to get the entire package thrown out, arguing it violates the constitution by including multiple provisions and aid to private interests. 
The initiative petitions aiming to repeal the stadium subsidy seek to direct any money saved toward preventing cuts to Medicaid that could result from legislation passed this summer by Congress. 
Hoskins, Ketcher alleges, “has chosen to protect billions for billionaire sports team owners at the expense of everyday Missourians and their health care.” 
For his part, Hoskins defended his work — and his team loyalties. 
“Secretary Hoskins applauds the Royals on a hard-fought season and, like many Missourians, is cheering on the Chiefs this football season,” his office said in a statement. “Regardless of team colors, the goal remains the same: ensuring Missouri voters have the facts they need to make an informed decision at the ballot box.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/032625_RighttoLifeHoskins-1024x615.jpg,,,2025-10-20 07:37:22.964745

They need to make it the highest priority.","Classroom coaching is a proven strategy that improves reading scores with relatively little investment, by hiring coaches to work one-on-one with teachers on how they can improve their students' reading, writes Kalman Hettleman. (Photo courtesy U.S. Department of Education)Most teachers aren’t taught to teach reading. They should be and they’re supposed to be. And you would think they are.
There are many programs to teach them, spanning roughly pre-service college undergraduate and graduate degrees, certification/licensure, in-service guidance manuals, classroom coaching and “professional learning” sessions (which are short and scattershot).
Yet, the evidence is incontrovertible that the great majority of teachers haven’t been brought up to speed to teach reading, which is a lot more demanding than you think.
Still, no surprise, there’s no ready fix. Improvements in each of the training modes are necessary.
But there is one reform that can be a gamechanger: It’s classroom coaching that allows well-trained coaches to work one-on-one with classroom teachers.
In fact, classroom coaches are key drivers in state Superintendent Carey Wright’s flagship early literacy initiative. Wright, who came to nationwide fame for the remarkable increase in literacy that occurred when she was state superintendent in Mississippi, cites classroom coaches as a vital, if not indispensable, feature of the “Mississippi miracle.”

The job description for coaches encompasses in class-support, modeling instructional strategies, and helping teachers analyze data on student performance. At the same time, the coaching must be custom-tailored to each teacher’s strengths and weaknesses. All of which require that the ratio of coaches to classroom teachers be realistic.  Beware the educational curse of programs that are a mile wide and an inch deep.
In Mississippi, Wright took the bold, and probably unprecedented, step of scouring local districts for good coach candidates, then hired them as state employees under her direct supervision. She intends to pull off the same feat in Maryland — if funds are available.
She and the state board of education are making an all-out effort to corral funding. At the last session of the General Assembly, the Maryland State Department of Education’s priority request included kindergarten to third grade literacy coaches, but it was not funded. MSDE intends to resubmit the request at the coming session.
For now, Wright is making a start with the Comprehensive State Literacy Development Grants Project. The $40 million federal grant over five years is being channeled to local school districts for literacy initiatives, with coaching a leading priority.
In addition, she is pitching coaching to foundations. So far, funding has been obtained for pilot coaching in one local district.
Unfortunately, the prospects for more funding from Annapolis, especially for coaches to work with a reasonable number of classroom teachers, are not bright. Requests for more money are a political no-no these days because of the state’s fiscal problems.
Nonetheless, funding for coaches would require only a relatively small amount of funding. By rough calculation, $30 million would be a significant down payment on the number of classroom literacy coaches needed statewide.
At the same time, it is essential that the funding be additional state aid, not funding diverted from other Blueprint initiatives. Bear in mind that classroom instruction is almost in a class by itself in current underfunding under the Blueprint. The Kirwan Commission and the Blueprint missed the boat in failing to provide funding earmarked for them — a fatal flaw, unless corrected.
As things now stand, classroom coaching poses a litmus test of whether Annapolis means what it says when it proclaims support for early literacy — the gateway to fulfillment of the Blueprint and student success.
So, Gov. Wes Moore and the General Assembly: Invest in early literacy, with classroom coaches the highest priority, and our schoolchildren (and taxpayers) will get the greatest dividends.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/US-Dept-Education-photo-tutoring-1.jpg,,,2025-10-20 07:37:22.964745

What is the endgame? What are the real goals behind the suppression and gutting of the processes that have been the bedrock of the democratic process in America?
Endgame is not just a short or long-term effect or result. It means the final, decisive stage of any strategic activity.
What do you think the final result will be of some of the disturbing and questionably illegal actions occurring in the halls of government in our state and nation?
In Missouri, what is the endgame of a governor who follows the dictates of a national Republican agenda when it comes to denying abortion care, signing a redistricting map whose origin is in question and making direct participation in the democratic process more difficult, if not impossible — all of which are contrary and diametrically opposed to the will of the majority of Missourians?
What is the endgame?
When all is said and done, what life might be like for Missourians cannot be minimized.
Typically, we see damaging legislation, policies and budget cuts as cyclical, and find some measure of comfort. We believe and hope that changes will occur in the next election cycle and things could get better with a new incoming administration.
Given the political climate we are in, with the rapid and extreme changes taking place at the state and national level, there is a greater chance that recovery might be extremely difficult, or worse, might never occur.
Our state and Congressional representatives willingly give tacit and overt approval of what appears to be arbitrary policy changes, budget cuts, new tariffs and other measures that hurt many Missourians. Will the effects be short-term or lasting?
That’s especially true when it comes to the cuts in Medicaid, which will deny many Missourians needed health care and other services, as well as result in the closure of rural hospitals and community health centers, eliminating access to critically-needed medical treatment.
Or when it comes to farmers not having access to markets to sell their produce, running the risk of losing farms that have been in families for generations.
Or when it comes to being able to deal with the rising costs of groceries and other consumer goods.
Are these current conditions temporary or do they represent the quality of life to come?
On the national level, what is the endgame when our branches of government — executive, legislative and judicial — repeatedly disregard their role and responsibilities, then abuse, capitulate or totally forfeit their constitutional powers when it comes to executing and protecting the integrity of our democracy?
Will the disregard for the rule of law be a short-term occurrence with this administration or will it become the norm of future administrations?
Paying close attention to what is occurring in the legislative halls and the streets in cities and states across America should compel us all to ask: what is the endgame?
When we are constantly bombarded with lies, distortions, divisive name-calling, hate speech, coming from the very political leaders who should be promoting collaboration and finding solutions — Is this just temporary?
Or will it result in a total collapse of our political values, traditions, civic culture and civility itself.
Just as important: what is our game plan to make sure all the disregard for the democratic principles and laws that define America is short-term and short-lived?
Teams that survive and ultimately win do not leave their game plan up to chance. They do not just sit idlily by, watch and hope that the opposing team gives up their fight and loses the game.
They become intimately familiar with the tactics and plays of the opposing team.
Teams that win also have an offensive and defensive game plan and strategies to counter the opposing team that they commit to and consistently employ.
For those of us who do not like the game we are in, and the possible long-term results, we need to determine our own desired endgame.
What will it be?
What team will you be on?

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)When patients struggling with opioid addiction walk into the newly opened Community Medical Services (CMS) clinic on Milwaukee’s South Side, “we want them to feel that this is a space for healing and growth,” said Amanda Maria De Leon, regional community impact manager for CMS. The clinic provides therapy and medication-assisted treatment for people working to stabilize their lives after addiction.
Medication-assisted treatment involves medications like Methadone to control opioid cravings and withdrawal symptoms. Together with therapy, medication-assisted treatment allows patients to begin to stabilize and repair their lives. Although studies have associated medication-assisted treatment with reductions in overdoses and other improved recovery outcomes, its use also carries stigma. Confronting that social disapproval, while also providing a comfortable environment for patients, is part of the mission of CMS.

Walking into the clinic, patients are met with an open waiting room and ample seating. There is a small area with toys for young children in one corner, and across the room nurses sit at a desk waiting to check in patients. Hanging over the small play area is a plaque dedicated to a young girl who spoke at one of the city zoning hearings in favor of the clinic opening. De Leon explained that the girl, who was 8 years old at the time, had befriended a local unhoused man to whom she’d given food. “She knew he needed treatment,” De Leon told the Wisconsin Examiner, saying the girl told the zoning board, “I want them to open this clinic for my friend.” 
Around a corner from the lobby, behind a set of protective glass windows, nurses dispense liquid methadone into small cups for patients on a daily basis. Walls and therapy rooms throughout the facility are painted calming  blues and  greens, and feature art or motivational messages. Small, decorative coffee tables sit between two small couches large enough for one or two people to sit facing each other. 
“We create a space like this intentionally, because we don’t want a patient to feel like it’s a transaction,” De Leon told the Examiner. She said that the facility is designed to be therapeutic both to the patients and the staff, to mitigate burnout.

Dr. Dan Lemieux, one of the medical doctors at CMS, said that he’s “used to the hustle and bustle” of a clinic. His background began in family medicine, where Lemieux was used to seeing 20-25 patients each day. Over time he also began working in Suboxone treatment programs. “I think about eight years ago I kind of pulled back on family medicine a little bit and did a little more time in addiction,” Lemieux told the Wisconsin Examiner. “I found it more gratifying, enjoyed helping people a little bit more.” Lemieux began working at methadone clinics after the COVID-19 pandemic and found his way to CMS, where he has worked for about two years. 
Lemieux has worked as the medical director of CMS clinics in West Allis, Madison, Fond du Lac, and now the Southside Milwaukee Clinic. Recalling the workload at West Allis, Lemieux told the the Examiner, “I think the counselors are really good at just keeping the flow going, and the front desk staff. So it never seemed overwhelming or busy, and the clients are always very appreciative.” Lemieux said he likes the highly focused sessions in recovery work, because “you can really spend your time kind of helping the client with those particular issues.” 
Overdose deaths driven by the synthetic opioid fentanyl began skyrocketing in Milwaukee County around 2016, claiming hundreds of lives annually. New records for overdose deaths were set and broken every year from 2018 to 2022, when the death toll peaked at 674 lives lost. Nearly 5,800 non-fatal overdoses occurred that same year, according to the county’s overdose dashboard.

Recently, as new programs and services were established to stem the tide, overdoses began to decline. Last year there were 450 overdose deaths in Milwaukee, so far there have been fewer than half that number this year. CMS is  one of the many organizations on the frontlines of the crisis, both as a treatment clinic and as a harm-reduction advocacy organization. 
De Leon showcased a storage room full of boxes of hygiene kits, testing strips for both fentanyl and the tranquilizer xylazine (a more recent trend in the drug market), and Narcan (used to reverse an overdose), all of which are either used or distributed by the CMS outreach team. Sometimes staff visit homeless encampments and food pantries, other times they hold pop-up events in areas with high overdose rates. The team even organized a sober tailgate at American Family Field at a Milwaukee Brewers game and distributed over 1,200 tickets. 
“We just deliver a little hope,” said De Leon. “Hopefully when you’re feeling a little better you’ll walk into a door of a treatment center. We don’t care where you walk into.” CMS also works with numerous partner organizations including the Milwaukee Overdose Response Initiative (MORI), various fire departments, the West Allis overdose response team and other nodes along an evolving network. 
De Leon said the network has become bigger and more collaborative. At an open house CMS held at  the new clinic, dozens of people showed up, she said, including community members, firefighters and police officers from multiple departments, probation and parole representatives and treatment providers. “I was speechless,” said De Leon. “We had over 70 people show up to our open house…That would have never happened in a methadone treatment world 20 years ago.”

“We’re breaking down silos, we’re educating people,” she added. Today, people have easier access to methadone treatment programs. In Milwaukee County, both the jail and the Community Reintegration Center (formerly known as the House of Corrections) have medication-assisted treatment programs. De Leon stressed that when people are taken to correctional facilities they should tell staff whether they need medication-assisted treatment in order to access those programs. 
The West Allis Fire Department became the first to carry Buprenorphine, which is given to people after reviving them from an overdose to stop sudden withdrawal symptoms. Bipartisan legislation at the state level legalized both fentanyl and xylazine testing strips.
Nevertheless, stigma associated with both addiction and medication-assisted treatment creates barriers to progress. Although CMS has clinics in the cities of West Allis and South Milwaukee, its new clinic is the first it has been able to open in the city of Milwaukee itself. The opening marked an end to years of contentious meetings with the city’s zoning board and local residents. Now, patients living near the South Side won’t need to travel far, and the new clinic could also lighten patient loads at other clinics.

Ald. Marina Dimitrijevic, who represents the district where the new CMS clinic is located, said she supports the treatment center opening. “I strongly supported this facility opening in our community,” Dimitrijevic told the  Examiner. “Providing residents with nearby access to needed health care and harm reduction tools makes us all safer and healthier. I am proud to have led by example on this issue by welcoming CMS to our community and am grateful for their work serving our residents.” 
Another clinic is expected to open up on Milwaukee’s North Side in early 2026. But many people are not sold on medication-assisted treatment, fentanyl testing strips and overdose-reversing medications. In 2023, when the city of Milwaukee’s zoning board approved the North Side clinic, reactions from the community were split. Leadership from the fire departments of Milwaukee and West Allis spoke in favor of CMS opening a clinic, stressing the dire need for relief and treatment access across Milwaukee County. 
Others called treatment centers “predatory” and expressed concerns about the clinic’s   for-profit business model. 
At least one 2014 study, which analyzed self-reported services from disease testing to psychiatric care, found that for-profit providers “were significantly less likely than nonprofit and public programs to offer comprehensive services”. The study said that “interventions to increase the offering of comprehensive services are needed, particularly among for-profit programs.”

Other objections to the new clinic came from neighbors who  argued that opening the clinic would hurt their property values and quality of life. A corporate representative and a real estate attorney from the Vin Baker Treatment Center, a facility named for a Milwaukee Bucks player that is located on N. 76th Street in Milwaukee, said that CMS would disrupt its business, jeopardizing a $3 million investment into the Vin Baker center. Ald. Lamont Westmoreland, who represents a North Side district, also opposed CMS,  referring to city planning documents which recommended against opening social service businesses in the area. “I support treatment facilities, just not at this particular location,” Westmoreland said before the center opened. 
John Koch, national director of community and public relations at CMS, explained that CMS is a for-profit entity with private equity backing. Koch said that the private equity investment, coupled with grants, has allowed the clinic to scale up to address the overdose crisis. opening new treatment centers, providing grants to extend clinic hours and embedding staff with local fire departments and homeless outreach programs for harm reduction. CMS bills Medicaid and other patient insurance to cover  patient care, “and 90% of our people are on Medicaid”, Koch told the Examiner. “We work very heavily with Medicaid. And then outside of that we receive grants to open new projects.” 
The private equity backing allows for “continuous investment back into the company to address the opioid epidemic as it’s needed,” said Koch. “If we were Ma and Popping it and just growing non-profit style, it’s so much slower and we would never be able to match the need.” CMS has opened seven clinics across Wisconsin, with over 70 clinics operating nationwide. “What we’ve been able to do is be innovative with our money, and meet people where they’re at,” said Koch. “So that’s our secret sauce, is using funds to just continue to provide more access to treatment. If we did not have private equity backing, we would never have been able to be this big, or be treating 30,000 people…That’s what’s allowed us to beat the opioid epidemic.”

Koch knows firsthand how treatment access can be the feather on the scale deciding life or death. In 2013, he was living on the streets of Chicago struggling with a heroin addiction. One night, not long after completing his second adult prison sentence, Koch encountered a police officer who saw that he needed help and gave him the number to a treatment center. Koch went the next day to begin recovery, which also included medication-assisted treatment. Today Koch is raising a family  and works to give people the second chance he got years ago. 
Despite such success stories, there is still public skepticism about medication-assisted treatment. De Leon recalled a conversation she had after making a presentation on harm reduction at a national conference. “This guy came up to me and said, ‘You know, you really changed my thinking,’” she said. He mentioned that in some cases people on probation or parole are expected to get off methadone in order to be fully released from supervision, despite the fact that he’s seen it significantly improve people’s lives.

De Leon asked why people were being forced to get off methadone and the man replied, “Well, nobody should be on these medications for the rest of their life.” She countered that if someone is finally stable after decades of addiction then, “Why not?…Would you tell me to get off of my insulin?” The man said no. “Then why would you tell somebody to get off of lifesaving medication that has him the most stable he’s ever been?” People are free to work on tapering off if they choose, but the priority should be stabilizing and saving a life, she argued. 
Dr. Lemieux said that he’s also seen medication-assisted treatment make a difference. “It’s always a tough conversation to try and change minds,” Lemieux told the Examiner. “Just the data that comes out shows that people in recovery are getting jobs, they’re reuniting with family, they’re working more, crime goes down, and it’s just a win. They’re getting their lives back, and just being a part of that is very rewarding and amazing. I just hope that more people see this, realize this, and reducing deaths is just another huge point, too.”

The department accounts for a larger piece of the pie than any other state agency. But it’s unclear where budgeters may want to cut. 
The post Wyoming lawmakers scrutinize Health Department ahead of budget session appeared first on WyoFile .","The Wyoming Legislature’s 2026 budget session is still four months away, but lawmakers are already scrutinizing the Wyoming Department of Health’s budget. 
At $2.2 billion in the current budget, the department accounts for a larger piece of the pie than any other state agency. And some lawmakers are concerned about what may lie in Wyoming’s financial future. 
“Wyoming is headed toward an impending fiscal cliff that is caused by what I believe is unsustainable spending,” Sheridan Republican Rep. Ken Pendergraft said last month at the first meeting of the newly formed Subcommittee on the Wyoming Department of Health Budget. 
In August, Pendergraft made a motion at a Joint Appropriations Committee meeting to form the subcommittee, which he now chairs. He sought five meetings. Two of those have already taken place — one in Casper, another online. 
“This has been a fact-finding thing,” Pendergraft told WyoFile. “This isn’t a grudge match. This isn’t going out and trying to hack with a meat cleaver or anything. But the necessity may well be there — that we’re going to be forced to do some cutting. And if that is the case, we want to do so as judiciously as possible.”
At the end of this month, state financial forecasters will release revenue projections to coincide with the governor’s budget preparations. Those estimates will then be revised in January to provide the latest data to lawmakers, who hold the state’s purse strings. Both reports will give a clearer picture of the state’s financial footing. 
Forecasters have long cautioned lawmakers in their CREG reports of the shakiness of the state’s economic picture. Wyoming’s revenue streams are slowly diversifying, but in the process, the state has grown more reliant on its investment portfolio as well as oil and gas production — all of which come with higher volatility than coal. 
While lawmakers wait for the latest forecast, Pendergraft said it’s important to be prepared to make tough choices. 
“We don’t want this to catch us kind of by surprise, like it did in 2017, like it did in 2021,” Pendergraft said. 
In 2017, a fossil-fuel bust resulted in an 8% across-the-board cut to the state budget. And on the heels of the COVID pandemic, Gov. Mark Gordon signed a budget in 2021 that included over $430 million in cuts and the elimination of more than 300 state positions. 
“We wanted to learn from those experiences and not repeat bad mistakes if possible,” Pendergraft said. 
The formation of the subcommittee also reflects changing political winds at the statehouse. 
In even-numbered years, lawmakers create a two-year budget, and 2026 will mark the first budget session since the Wyoming Freedom Caucus won control of the lower chamber in the 2024 election. With that victory, caucus members and allies, including Pendergraft, comprise all but one member of the House Appropriations Committee. The panel has considerable power since it gets the first crack at the budget alongside its Senate counterparts. 
In April, the caucus announced it aimed to take inspiration from the Trump administration’s efforts to cut federal jobs and spending by “DOGE-ing Wyoming’s budget by identifying unconstitutional and wasteful spending.” 
Altogether, another budget showdown could be in the works — with the Department of Health’s comparatively large budget at the center of it. 
In 2024, the Senate passed the budget by just two votes after most Freedom Caucus members and allies voted against it in the House. In a surprise and unprecedented move earlier this year, the Senate refused to pass a supplemental budget after the two chambers split on several spending policies. 
The subcommittee’s meetings have so far contrasted with the caustic budget fights of the last few years. The tone has been cordial and data has driven much of the conversation as Department of Health Director Stefan Johansson has walked the committee through the ins and outs of the agency’s mission and budget at the last two meetings.

In September, Johansson guided the subcommittee — which, alongside Pendergraft, includes Powell Republican Sen. Dan Laursen and Laramie Democrat Rep. Trey Sherwood — through each of the department’s four divisions. 
Approximately 95% of the department’s budget covers medical services, including via facilities like the Wyoming State Hospital in Evanston, the Life Resource Center in Lander and the Veterans Home in Buffalo. The other 5% accounts for administrative costs, such as claims processing and state employee salaries. 
Wyoming has not expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, so the federal-state health insurance program is reserved for certain low-income and medically needy individuals and families. As of August, 66,225 Wyoming residents are enrolled in Medicaid — 61% are children. 
Like other state-federal programs, for every dollar Wyoming spends on Medicaid, the federal government contributes a matching amount. Those kinds of matching funds can restrict lawmakers — if the state doesn’t spend, the federal government doesn’t match. 
“There are some constraints within that budget … that are important to consider when looking at the budget overall,” Elizabeth Martineau, senior fiscal analyst with the Legislative Service Office, told the subcommittee in September. 
Martineau pointed to, for example, the preschool services unit of the state’s budget. 
“If you don’t meet that maintenance of effort, you could lose those funds,” she said. 
Likewise, investing in community mental health services can save the state money in other areas, Andy Summerville of the Wyoming Association of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Centers, told the committee. 
Community mental health centers are a large item in the department’s budget, Summerville said, but their budget has remained mostly flat since 2002, mostly between $50 and $55 million per year. 
“One of the unique characteristics of the community mental health centers is that part of the behavioral health redesign mission is diversion away from state institutions,” Summerville said. “It’s diversion away from the state hospital, life resource center, keeping people in their communities, working with the criminal justice population much more strongly now, trying to keep them out of jail or reduce recidivism.” 
Separately, health officials and many county sheriffs are pushing lawmakers to support legislation to boost treatment for mentally ill people detained in county jails while they wait for a bed at the state hospital. 
Pat Sweeney, a former Republican lawmaker from Casper, also testified to the committee. He was a member of the House in both 2017 and 2021. 
“During the pandemic, Department of Health did an unbelievable job trying to manage that,” Sweeney said. “But did our citizens suffer because of it? Yes.”
Pendergraft asked Sweeney if he had “any large regrets” from the times the Legislature had to cut. 
“I think we could have been maybe a little more strategic than across the board,” Sweeney said.
The subcommittee’s next meeting is Nov. 7 in Casper.

Parks Elementary in Oklahoma City on the first day of school on Aug. 13, 2025. (Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)Rather than continuing the chaotic annual strategy of throwing everything  but the kitchen sink at Oklahoma’s failing public school system, it’s clear that we need leaders with the vision to develop a 10-year roadmap.
Because I don’t know about you, but over the past decade, it’s felt like we’ve careened from one crisis to another. And somehow we’ve ended up with lawmakers who haven’t been particularly visionary on the public school front, and who have preferred a scattershot approach to tackling whatever happens to be the latest predicament. 
Take the 2025 legislative session, for instance. They weighed or passed laws dealing with cellphone bans, overhauling federally protected individualized education plans, ending virtual school days, mandating recess, free college tuition for the children of long-time teachers, overhauling how school boards operate, tutoring incentives, teacher pipeline grants, extending the educator salary schedule and expanding educator testing requirements. And late in session, lawmakers decided to add an extra day of school to the year in exchange for a seemingly random $25 million in new funding. (Yes, we were confused, too.)
And that’s all completely separate from the havoc now ex-state Superintendent Ryan Walters added to the mix. After the session ended, he randomly demanded the end of standardized testing and that schools begin providing free lunches to students – without additional funding to buy that food.
I cannot imagine how destabilizing all this chaos must be to school administrators, staff, teachers and our children, who are always having to pivot because our lawmakers cannot plan effectively and because our leaders give the sense that they’re in constant panic mode.
As the oft-repeated phrase goes: “The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over expecting different results.”
We clearly are there because our results are not moving the needle in a substantive way.
Just take a look at the abysmally low proficiency test scores for  Oklahoma students in reading and math. Just 27% of third graders are classified as proficient or advanced in reading based on national standards. Only 33% hit those grade-level targets in math.
That’s troubling, given the fact that the building blocks for future student success are largely developed in kindergarten through third grade.
Since our leaders can’t seem to come up with a blueprint to set the foundation for legislative policy and funding priorities, I’ll help them.
That plan would ideally include:

A long-term recurring compensation plan for teachers and staff to ensure we’re attracting the most talented educators into our classrooms. Walters showed us with his recruitment signing bonus programs that people will come here if they’re paid well. And, I suspect good teachers will remain if they’re paid competitively. Right now, we rank toward the bottom in the region in terms of pay. And with over $20 an hour average wages offered by private businesses, a starting teacher or staff member can probably make as much or more working full-time at a place like Amazon, which doesn’t have as many politicians meddling in their workday.
Guaranteed money for new textbooks — or electronic learning tools — so schools can plan. 
A huge, recurring investment in tutoring and strategic educational enrichment programs given our children’s lagging learning outcomes.
Planned annual increases in funding to address teachers’ health care benefit costs and to help school districts combat inflation and insurance, all of which are soaring for them just like they are for the rest of us. 
Regular investments in school security. 
An examination of the worthiness of the plethora of school credits lawmakers have haphazardly pushed through over the years. We’re now paying people to send their children to private schools. We offer a tax credit to school donors, and we have a fund aimed at helping property-tax poor districts afford buildings. That last fund is probably a good thing as long as there is a stable, reliable funding source.
And most importantly, it should focus on funding safety net programs, including those operated by other agencies, that help tackle the underlying root issues that may be causing students to struggle: poverty, hunger, homelessness, lack of health care access and mental illness.

It’s been heartbreaking to hear about children who don’t have enough to eat or those that are struggling with unmet emotional needs. Intruder drills have become a reality in our classrooms, but routine investments in security could help harden schools from violence.
Children deal with broken playground equipment or aging technology. And it’s hard to explain to a child that lawmakers are not making proper investments in staff pay so now there’s a shortage of bus drivers, delaying the time it takes them to get home from school.
Enough is enough. 
We’ve managed to develop and implement a visionary plan for our foster care system. We’ve developed a long-term plan for our roadways. 
So why can’t we do the same for our schools? 
In fact, it seems pretty common sense to spend the next 15 or so months bringing together stakeholders from all spectrums of life — parents, educators, lawmakers, nonpartisan education experts, business leaders — and even children.
The roadmap would need to have some flexibility to address policy needs as they develop in our ever-changing world.
Maybe such a plan could be a legacy of Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt and his newly appointed state Superintendent Lindel Fields when they both leave office in January 2027.
Because Oklahomans deserve nothing less than a stable path forward for our schools. They deserve to know that our tax dollars are being used efficiently and in the most effective way possible. And they need the assurance that our leaders did what we expect to put a solid plan in place to get our schools moving in the right direction.

Pantries and emergency food providers across the state are bracing for additional stress and demand as changes to the SNAP public food assistance set in and nudge some recipients out. (Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — He said he worked 20 years for U.S. troops in his homeland of Afghanistan, in roles ranging from soldier to cook and interpreter, before his at-risk family was flown out of the country in 2021 as it fell again to the Taliban.
Now age 46 with 10 children, the Afghan refugee works full-time in a Nebraska production job and says $2,100 in monthly public grocery assistance has helped his family make ends meet. He and his wife expected to gain financial independence as their kids got educated and into careers.
Mohsen asked that his full identity not be revealed, because he fears retaliation against  family members still in Afghanistan. In the U.S. since 2021, he said he now worries about how the loss of public SNAP grocery aid will hurt his family. He and his wife have 10 kids ranging from a toddler to college-aged. (Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)
But any sense of stability has crumbled, the man said, as his family faces the impact of President Donald Trump’s tax and spending law that Trump calls “big” and “beautiful” — and Nebraska’s implementation this week of related changes in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. 
Mohsen, who asked that his full name not be used for fear of retaliation against family in the U.S. and abroad, is among an estimated 7,000 refugees, asylees and other Nebraska newcomers without permanent residency status who are poised to lose their SNAP benefits, according to Nebraska Appleseed, a statewide organization that advocates for low-income people and immigrants. The Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services put that number closer to 6,300.
 Vets, homeless, foster care impact

Under the megabill approved July 4, the grocery benefits now will be limited to citizens and green card-carrying lawful permanent residents who also meet income guidelines. Also eligible are Cuban and Haitian newcomers and those in the U.S. as part of a compact of free association with Palau, Micronesia and the Marshall Islands. 
Currently about 150,000 Nebraskans, nearly 8% of the state’s population, participate in SNAP, formerly known as food stamps. People without a documented immigration status have never been eligible for SNAP.

According to Appleseed, another 10,000 or so SNAP recipients in Nebraska — including veterans, homeless and people recently aged out of foster care — are at risk of reduced SNAP benefits under changes and stricter work requirements in the new law. Appleseed estimates are based on 2023 data from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
Supporters of more stringent restrictions have argued that they will increase accountability, self-sufficiency and help cut government spending. 
While the changes were expected to squeeze out some participants — accommodating a reported $186 billion cut in SNAP spending over the next decade — Nebraska’s release last week of details on how the bill impacts local populations has advocacy agencies scrambling to try and ensure no one goes hungry. 
Based on guidance received recently from the feds, DHHS issued a statement Friday on the changes to be enforced starting Oct. 20, 10 days before the federal deadline for full implementation. 
State officials said they’ve started contacting recipients to alert them, and also have assembled a list of frequently asked questions. Eligibility for each person or family is to be reevaluated when they recertify for the program, which happens every six months, or when household characteristics are updated. So cutoffs won’t all happen at once. Mohsen, for example, recently recertified and faces SNAP loss in April.











There is immense concern about how this will exacerbate the already really high food insecurity problem across the heartland.

DHHS spokesman Jeff Powell noted that Nebraska is mandated to enforce the changes. Due to the federal shutdown, the state is waiting for additional guidance and said it will provide updates as more information is received. Under the new law — backed by all five members of Nebraska’s congressional delegation — states will be subject to financial penalties based on error rates. 
In addition, Nebraska will have to provide an estimated $17 million more in the coming fiscal year to administer the program, said Eric Savaiano, Nebraska Appleseed’s economic justice program manager.
“Monumental” changes, as he called them, have spurred formation of a Nebraska coalition of emergency food providers and refugee advocacy agencies to discuss ways to respond and fill gaps.
 Hit from different directions

Some advocates say it is particularly jarring to know the loss for newcomers, such as Afghans and Ukrainians, who fled war. Refugees and people granted asylum typically left their homelands seeking safety from persecution and violence and have been vetted by the U.S. government to be granted that relief.

In the case of Mohsen, he said he was lawfully admitted to the U.S. in 2021, moved to Nebraska in 2022, and has applied for asylum. He said he previously had applied for a Special Immigrant Visa, based on service work with the U.S. government in Afghanistan, and was rejected. While the government has authorized him to work while his asylum application is pending, he does not have permanent residency or citizenship status, which is now grounds for losing SNAP benefits.
“Twenty years I worked with the U.S. Army in Afghanistan. They promised they will help me,” Mohsen said. “We already had the hard life in Afghanistan — why make our life so hard here?”
He said hits are coming from other directions, too. Family members have been denied Medicaid benefits, he said. Bills from a few emergency room visits have piled up and haunt him as he has ignored them to pay others.
His three oldest children were denied federal financial aid to attend Nebraska’s public university system, and the reason given, the dad said, was “illegal” immigration status. 
“We did not come here illegally,” he said. The three ended up enrolling at Metropolitan Community College.
Mohsen, interviewed this week after he finished parent-teacher conferences for his elementary-age kids, said his wife stays at home to care for their children. The youngest, 3 years old and a U.S. citizen, likely still could qualify for SNAP.
The Nebraska Examiner sought comments about the megabill’s impact on SNAP from all five members of the Nebraska delegation. U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Nebraska, responded. He said he negotiated to reduce Nebraska’s cost of implementing SNAP by half. 
“I tried to get the best bill possible, while also increasing funding for our military by $150 billion, modernizing our air traffic control and preventing a 20% tax increase on all families,” he said.
 Pantries scramble

Hannah Vlach of Omaha-based Restoring Dignity says advocates have been trying to prepare for the changes but still hold out hope the state will create a program to help cover lost food benefits.

DHHS’ Powell said all options would be considered.
But the shifts come as Nebraska lawmakers struggle already with a state government budget shortfall. 
Vlach said it feels particularly “immoral” to pull assistance from a refugee who fought alongside the U.S. She said it hints at something darker.
“When we look back at history, every time a targeted group had food taken away, it marked the beginning of something horrific,” she said.
Toby Rees of Kountze Commons in downtown Omaha said her food pantry already is short of proteins supplied by the Food Bank for the Heartland and has tried to compensate by, for example, using donor funds and grants to buy groceries at a discount from cooperating stores. 
“The need is going to increase,” she said, noting the new faces among about 400 people that visited the pantry Monday. Kountze does not ask for income or other verification, nor does it limit  visits, she said. More immigrant and refugee families are seeking a new and “safe” place to get food, she said. 
“It’s really scaring them,” she added.

Vlach said the coalition is preparing documents in 13 languages that provide information and pictures on available Omaha area pantries and places where people can seek food. 
“Everybody’s resources are limited,” said Rees. “But we are banding together.”
Tim Williams of the Food Bank for the Heartland says his organization provides food to about 500 pantries and other partners in 93 counties across Nebraska and Iowa. About 20% of commodities comes from the USDA emergency food assistance program and the rest largely from donors and companies. 
He called SNAP one of the most useful tools for families to access nutritious food. The food bank is worried about the added burden on pantries at a time of less federal emergency food assistance and greater demand.
“There is immense concern about how this will exacerbate the already really high food insecurity problem across the heartland,” said Williams. 
 Work requirements 

Appleseed’s Savaiano fears that expanded work requirements under the new law will create more administrative paperwork that will “gum up” the process and lead to reduced SNAP benefits for populations beyond refugees and immigrants.
Currently, able-bodied adults are limited to three months of SNAP benefits every three years unless they work 20 hours a week or qualify for an exemption. The new law expands work requirements through age 64 (it was age 54 before), and excludes parents with children younger than 14 (it used to be 18). 
DHHS said three groups no longer are exempted from work requirements: veterans, homeless individuals and those aging out of foster care. The state said those exemptions were temporary due to the Fiscal Responsibility Act and now are being removed. A new exception was added for Indians, Urban Indians, and others eligible for Indian Health Services.

Advocates are urging Nebraskans to lean on federal lawmakers to repeal SNAP changes or support alternative programs.
Confounding Mohsen, he said, is why his case seeking a more permanent status has moved so slowly through the immigration court system.
“I worked honestly for those 20 years,” he said of service to the U.S. military. “Sometimes it makes me crazy, it’s upsetting.”
Mohsen hopes to find other avenues to put healthy food on his family’s table, but he is bracing for the last resort. That would be for his older children to quit or delay schooling and help the family financially. He said education and hope for meaningful careers was always the lure of the U.S. 
“Our big hope is education,” Mohsen said. “If they don’t get education, it’s not meaningful for us.”

In multiple instances, the state GOP’s platform contradicts itself and the stated beliefs of traditional Republicans, writes guest columnist Jim Malcom.
The post The Wyoming Republican Party is a big RINO appeared first on WyoFile .","The Wyoming Republican Party platform contradicts what traditional Republicans stand for. I say this as a registered Wyoming Republican voter. 

Opinion

The platform has 23 “timeless truths that will always inform and direct our party and our country…” Meanwhile, unlimited guns threaten life, its anti-abortion fixation drives the government to enforce specific religious interpretations and many of these “timeless” principles emerged in the last century.
The first and highest principle listed, Life (No. 1 in the platform), declares the government’s “only purpose” is protecting individual rights. But then the platform immediately begins a series of demands for government control and violations of those same rights.
Real Republicans believe in limited government, defend individual liberty and respect religious freedom. Yet Wyoming’s GOP thinks it knows better than everyone and forces one narrow interpretation of Christianity. They want you and your doctor to follow their interpretation of their religion.
Many Christians, Jews and others differ on when a fetus becomes its own life. (See Genesis 2:7, Job 33:4, etc.). Ancient religious law treated miscarriage as property damage, not murder (Exodus 21:22). But Wyoming’s GOP encodes a specific Christian view. Their theology “trumps” everyone’s law. Consider: Even 60% of Catholics believe abortion should be legal in most cases.
Real Republicans defend property rights. The government can’t touch your land, business or money without due process. But according to the Wyoming GOP, you don’t own your own body. That’s government property now. A rancher’s cattle have more bodily autonomy than Wyoming women under this “Republican” platform.
Here’s the kicker: After claiming their highest value is life, they abandon every policy that helps children survive and thrive — health care, education, childcare, nutrition programs. They chain women to pregnancy and then abandon the children. The contradictions multiply from there.
The second platform principle, Equality, is then violated through many of the rest of the principles. The largest political party in the Equality State, right after declaring equality for all under the law as a principle, goes about carving out special treatment for gun owners, Christians and businesses.
Consider principle No. 3: Second Amendment. First, the GOP platform omits the first half of the actual amendment’s wording, “a well regulated militia,” and then declares there will be no restrictions on arms or ammunition. This undermines their first principle, Life, by exposing schools, churches and public forums to needless gun violence. How can our militia be “well regulated” when driving a car has more restrictions and training requirements than the Wyoming Republicans’ Second Amendment interpretation? No insurance, licensing or background checks required, or even able to be considered.
Equality again is denied in the platform’s sixth plank: Religious Freedom, which gives privilege to Judeo-Christian viewpoints. Thomas Jefferson, who coined the phrase “Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of happiness” in the Declaration of Independence, was also the author of the foundational idea of separation of church and state. The First Amendment says “no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.” Instead, the platform elevates Christian beliefs and pushes specific versions of those beliefs on women and others. Women may have first gained the right to vote in Wyoming, but the Republican party platform denies them religious equality now.
Another notable example, Right to Work (plank No. 20) effectively discriminates against workers attempting to engage in collective action while ignoring that employers engage in what amounts to collective action through PACs, lobbyists and other means on a regular basis. Their wealth advantage, unbound from living paycheck-to-paycheck, enables them to generate governmental and business pressures on employees that need unions or similar structures to achieve equal consideration.
The history of these so-called “timeless truths” is mind-boggling. Gun control was considered common sense by the NRA and most Americans until the 1970s. Now, school violence is a multibillion dollar industry. 
Then there are the changes over time in the beliefs on unborn children. In 1968, Christianity Today issued the following statement regarding abortion: “Whether the performance of an induced abortion is sinful we are not agreed, but about the necessity of it and permissibility for it under certain circumstances we are in accord.” It wasn’t until the 1980s that abortion became the wedge issue that it is today.
Right to Work laws originated in the 1940s as a strategy to weaken labor unions and was encoded in the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947. Timeless? Not even close. Michigan repealed right-to-work in 2023, showing that it is not a settled question. Judeo-Christian principles? Christians, including Martin Luther King Jr., have decried right-to-work as “a law to rob us of our civil rights and job rights.”
Limited government — except when controlling women. Individual liberty — except for medical decisions. Religious freedom — except for other religions. Constitutional government — except when the Constitution is inconvenient.
Ask yourself who benefits from these principles, and who they harm. A platform with these biases removed would be attractive and defendable by all Wyoming Republicans, not just the most extreme activists.

Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue. July 31, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A state senator is calling out Nebraska’s Department of Health and Human Services because he believes they have been “totally ineffective” in overseeing local abortion clinics. 
He raised the issue this week during a public hearing of the Legislature’s Health and Human Services Committee on several interim studies, including Legislative Resolution 238. That resolution, introduced by State Sen. Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue, examined the quality of patient services at Nebraska abortion clinics and the quality of the state’s oversight of the clinics. 
Holdcroft also introduced Legislative Bill 512 earlier this year, which seeks to increase requirements for patients looking to access abortion pills. The bill is pending in the Legislature, waiting on its first round of floor debate. Holdcroft said he intends to focus on the bill during the 2026 session and has no plans to introduce more abortion-related bills next session.

For the hearing and his interim study, Holdcroft did not reach out to either of Nebraska’s two abortion clinics — Planned Parenthood in Omaha and CARE Reproductive Health in Bellevue. He said he “didn’t expect much in return” had he requested information from them.
Instead, his five invited testifiers included representatives from regional and national anti-abortion groups, individuals who filed complaints against abortion clinics with DHHS, a former Planned Parenthood employee and written testimony from Creighton University pharmacy professor Edward DeSimone. Holdcroft mentioned that he also requested a DHHS official testify at the hearing, but he received no response. 
Holdcroft and his testifiers made a range of accusations against both clinics, though Holdcroft later told the Nebraska Examiner that the main focus of his concern is the CARE Reproductive Health clinic because it’s located just outside his district in Bellevue. 
Multiple testifiers, including Holdcroft, shared suspicions that both clinics worked with providers who lacked the proper licensing to work in Nebraska. Several others accused the Planned Parenthood clinic of having a range of hygienic concerns within the facility, including moldy ceilings, old carpeting stained by blood and other fluids, and one instance of a sewage leak that some testifiers claimed leaked into patient areas. 
“There was a gross dereliction of duty by the organization to care for its facilities, patients and employees,” said Mariah Arabalo, a former Planned Parenthood employee who currently works for State Sen. Rita Sanders of Bellevue, who has voted in favor of multiple abortion restrictions, including a total ban. 
Meanwhile, Omaha’s Planned Parenthood clinic finished a multi-year $1 million renovation project earlier this year. Erin Wagner, senior director of strategic communications for Planned Parenthood North Central States, said the project has tripled the clinic’s capacity, increasing the number of available exam rooms from four to 12. She said the organization is investing in similar renovations across the country. 
Wagner said during the 2024-25 fiscal year, the Omaha clinic saw roughly 4,000 additional patients compared to the previous year. This was partially due to the clinic seeing a rise in out-of-state clients, particularly from Iowa, which passed a bill in 2024 that banned abortions at around six weeks of pregnancy, when an ultrasound detects embryonic cardiac activity. As a result, the number of Iowa patients coming to Nebraska for abortion services rose from 222 in 2023 to 358 in 2024, according to DHHS data.

While Wagner couldn’t speak to every complaint made about conditions at the Omaha clinic, she acknowledged the sewage leak, though she wasn’t sure what specific areas it impacted. She claimed Planned Parenthood officials immediately began working to fix the issue.
“The minute that people were aware it was happening, they were trying to take care of it,” Wagner said. 
State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston, who sits on the HHS Committee, speculated that Planned Parenthood may go out of business naturally due to staffing issues. A report from The Guardian shared that at least 20 Planned Parenthood clinics have closed this year across seven states, mostly due to financial constraints after they were cut off from federal funding. 
While she worked at Planned Parenthood as a nurse, Arabelo said she witnessed a “gaslighting culture” that superiors imposed on employees. If a worker expressed hesitation about participating in a procedure they didn’t feel adequately trained for, she said they were told their refusal would lessen patients’ access to care. 
Andi Curry Grubb, executive director of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Nebraska, said staffing has been a challenge, but said it is no more extreme than staffing shortages affecting other medical clinics. 
Wagner said new abortion bans that have been implemented in multiple states since 2022 have made it harder to recruit workers. Curry Grubb said it’s additionally challenging that as a nonprofit, the group can’t pay employees as much as they could make at a hospital or other medical centers. 
Holdcroft and other testifiers alleged that both the Planned Parenthood clinic and CARE Reproductive Health work with out-of-state medical professionals not licensed in Nebraska. Officials from both clinics denied the allegations. 
Holdcroft argued that such out-of-state providers also violate a Nebraska statute that requires physicians who perform an abortion to be available for at least 48 hours to their respective patients, because often they leave the state after supplying their patients with abortion medication. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“If you’re sending a woman home with the intention that she’s going to have a miscarriage in her bathroom in the next 48-72 hours … you need to give her a phone number that she can call for help,” Holdcroft said. 
Holdcroft said DHHS officials have claimed the statute doesn’t apply to medication abortions, but Holdcroft argued it applies to all forms of abortion. The statute states that physicians must be available “for a period of at least forty-eight hours for postoperative care,” but the statutory definition of abortion referenced in law is broad and includes abortions via medication. 
Wagner said Planned Parenthood offers all patients receiving a medication abortion a 24-hour phone line they can call with any questions or concerns about their symptoms. It’s also their policy to call all patients a week after their appointment, she said.

Most of the testifiers’ main concerns Thursday were that their complaints to DHHS have gone largely unanswered. Matthew Heffron, senior counsel for the nonprofit law firm Thomas More Society, said he submitted a 21-page complaint to DHHS in 2024 which made 229 allegations against the Bellevue clinic. 
In response, Heffron claimed DHHS officials told him they investigated just one of his allegations, and the case was quickly closed with no penalties given to the clinic. He said he suspects department officials he communicated with did not even read his complaint. 
“This sort of result cannot be the way DHHS oversees health facilities in Nebraska,” Heffron said. “Because if it is, the people of Nebraska cannot trust DHHS.”
Amy Gehrke, chief impact officer for the national nonprofit Center for Client Safety, shared a similar story. She said she filed 12 complaints to DHHS about the Bellevue clinic, and no formal consequences followed. 
Gehrke said her nonprofit investigates potential illegalities at abortion clinics across the U.S., and DHHS has been one of the hardest state agencies to work with. She said responses she received from department officials to her complaints were confusing and sometimes contradictory. 
When asked by committee member State Sen. John Fredrickson of Omaha, Gehrke clarified that the nonprofit does not investigate possible law violations at crisis pregnancy centers, saying “there’s no need for that.”
Fredrickson noted that a large portion of Nebraska’s government leaders, including Gov. Jim Pillen, Attorney General Mike Hilgers and DHHS CEO Steve Corsi, are vocally anti-abortion. He questioned why they wouldn’t jump on the opportunity to act on these complaints. 
“This seems like right up (Corsi’s) alley, to be frank,” Fredrickson said. 
In response, both Heffron and Holdcroft said they don’t believe Corsi is responsible for the lack of oversight. Instead, they suspect that lower level employees are controlling these issues. Holdcroft added that investigating clinics falls under DHHS’ purview, not the governor’s or AG’s. 
DHHS spokesman Jeff Powell shared a written statement in response to the hearing’s allegations. 
“DHHS thoroughly investigates each complaint. Per Neb. Rev. Stat. 38-1,106, all complaints and investigations are confidential,” Powell wrote.
If little changes, Holdcroft said he is considering requesting the new Legislative Oversight Committee to investigate DHHS. 
State Sen. Brian Hardin of Gering, chair of the HHS committee and a member of the oversight committee, said he would take the matter to Corsi and committed to pursuing the issue in the oversight committee if there is no progress. 
After Nebraska made its abortion ban stricter in 2023, banning the procedure after 12 weeks post-gestation, the percentage of medication abortions jumped to 81%, according to DHHS data. Holdcroft said because of this, the department ought to adjust its oversight to account for this shift. 
Although Nebraska’s abortion restrictions are not as extreme as some neighboring states, Curry Grub said the move from a 20-week to a 12-week ban has forced many clients to make decisions faster. Wagner added that it has also prompted Planned Parenthood to increase patient education efforts. 
“We’re not going to shy away and back off on what our goals are for increasing access to health care, even if there’s more barriers being put up,” Wagner said.

(Photo illustration by Winslow Productions/Tetra Images)As the residents of Ketchum will be asked on Election Day to decide which form of government is best for the town, the public is invited to learn more about different types of local government and the role that city councils and mayors play in that governance in Idaho.
On Nov. 4, Ketchum residents will find a measure on their ballot that states:
“Shall the City of Ketchum adopt the council-manager plan of government as set forth in sections 50-801 through 50-812, Idaho Code?”

A “yes” vote would change the City of Ketchum’s form of government to a council-manager plan, where the City Council appoints a city manager as the chief administrative (executive) officer.
A “no” vote would retain the City of Ketchum’s current mayor-council form of government, in which an elected mayor is the chief administrative (executive) officer of the city.

To ensure voters have information about that decision, The Community Library will host a civics-focused event with Stephanie Witt, a professor in the master of Public Administration and Political Science programs at Boise State University. Witt will present a brief history of local governments with a focus on Idaho, discuss the role of councils, and analyze the differences between the “strong mayor” and “city manager” forms of government, according to a press release from the library.

The event is planned for 5:30 p.m. Thursday at the library’s John A. and Carole O. Moran Lecture Hall. Registration is recommended to save a seat, and space is limited, the press release said. The event will also be livestreamed, and the link to watch online can be found on the library’s event calendar at www.comlib.org. A recording will be available to watch later on the library’s event archive.
“This is one of the major questions in front of Ketchum voters this fall, and we are eager to help people more objectively understand what these different styles of government are,” said Martha Williams, The Community Library’s director of programs and education, in the release. “Dr. Witt will be an excellent guide in deepening our understanding of these options from a non-partisan perspective. From her decades of research, she’ll also help us examine larger questions about the role of city government in our everyday lives. We hope that people can attend – whether you live in Ketchum or elsewhere – learn, ask questions, and leave better informed to make your own decision at the polls.”
Witt’s research centers on intergovernmental relations and human resource management, and she writes about Idaho, city, and county governments in the West, human resource management, and public administration. She is also the director of training for the School of Public Service at BSU, the former editor of the Social Science Journal, and has served as department chair, associate dean, and the associate vice president for academic affairs at BSU. Her recent and relevant publications have focused on civility in state legislatures, the collision of culture and governance, and governing cities in uncertain times.
Other measures also on the Nov. 4 ballot for Ketchum voters include:

Idaho State Treasurer Julie Ellsworth noted in a press release: “This reaffirmation highlights the strength of Idaho’s economy and the sound financial management that protects our taxpayers. By keeping Idaho’s top-tier rating, we ensure continued confidence in our state’s fiscal stability and investment quality.”
In May of this year, Fitch Ratings also reaffirmed its highest credit rating for Idaho. Fitch said: “Fitch believes the state is well positioned to absorb multiple rounds of recent tax cuts and dedicated spending allocations from the general fund, given Idaho’s prudently managed budget with significant one-time spending that rolls off to create fiscal capacity.”
According to a new report from Pew Charitable Trust, Idaho has approximately 87 days’ worth of spending capacity in its rainy day reserve. This is the eighth best nationally for budget savings. For comparison, Washington state has only 13 days’ worth of savings for spending, which is 49th worst. The national average was 47 days.
Although states across the country are facing a tightening budget outlook, the continued decisive action of policymakers to right-size Idaho’s spending, combined with an $880 million general fund reserve (15%) and $1.3 billion in total reserves (22%), provides the Gem State with ample resources to weather economic changes.

Reporting Highlights

Aggression: Under President Donald Trump’s deportation mission, ICE officers are using force to detain and jail immigrants.
Impunity: The administration gutted guardrails and offices meant to rein in abusive actions.
Disappeared: Some families say they have no idea where their loved ones were jailed after immigration raids.

These highlights were written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

When Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers stormed through Santa Ana, California, in June, panicked calls flooded into the city’s emergency response system.
Recordings of those calls, obtained by ProPublica, captured some of the terror residents felt as they watched masked men ambush people and force them into unmarked cars. In some cases, the men wore plain clothes and refused to identify themselves. There was no way to confirm whether they were immigration agents or imposters. In six of the calls to Santa Ana police, residents described what they were seeing as kidnappings.
“He’s bleeding,” one caller said about a person he saw yanked from a car wash lot and beaten. “They dumped him into a white van. It doesn’t say ICE.”
One woman’s voice shook as she asked, “What kind of police go around without license plates?”
And then this from another: “Should we just run from them?”
During a tense public meeting days later, Mayor Valerie Amezcua and the City Council asked their police chief whether there was anything they could do to rein in the federal agents — even if only to ban the use of masks. The answer was a resounding no. Plus, filing complaints with the Department of Homeland Security was likely to go nowhere because the office that once handled them had been dismantled. There was little chance of holding individual agents accountable for alleged abuses because, among other hurdles, there was no way to reliably learn their identities.
Since then, Amezcua, 58, said she has reluctantly accepted the reality: There are virtually no limits on what federal agents can do to achieve President Donald Trump’s goal of mass deportations. Santa Ana has proven to be a template for much larger raids and even more violent arrests in Chicago and elsewhere. “It’s almost like he tries it out in this county and says, ‘It worked there, so now let me send them there,’” Amezcua said.

Current and former national security officials share the mayor’s concerns. They describe the legions of masked immigration officers operating in near-total anonymity on the orders of the president as the crossing of a line that had long set the United States apart from the world’s most repressive regimes. ICE, in their view, has become an unfettered and unaccountable national police force. The transformation, the officials say, unfolded rapidly and in plain sight. Trump’s DHS appointees swiftly dismantled civil rights guardrails, encouraged agents to wear masks, threatened groups and state governments that stood in their way, and then made so many arrests that the influx overwhelmed lawyers trying to defend immigrants taken out of state or out of the country.
And although they are reluctant to predict the future, the current and former officials worry that this force assembled from federal agents across the country could eventually be turned against any groups the administration labels a threat.
One former senior DHS official who was involved in oversight said that what is happening on American streets today “gives me goosebumps.”
Speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, the official rattled off scenes that once would’ve triggered investigations: “Accosting people outside of their immigration court hearings where they’re showing up and trying to do the right thing and then hauling them off to an immigration jail in the middle of the country where they can’t access loved ones or speak to counsel. Bands of masked men apprehending people in broad daylight in the streets and hauling them off. Disappearing people to a third country, to a prison where there’s a documented record of serious torture and human rights abuse.”
The former official paused. “We’re at an inflection point in history right now and it’s frightening.”
Although ICE is conducting itself out in the open, even inviting conservative social media influencers to accompany its agents on high-profile raids, the agency operates in darkness. The identities of DHS officers, their salaries and their operations have long been withheld for security reasons and generally exempted from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. However, there were offices within DHS created to hold agents and their supervisors accountable for their actions on the job. The Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, created by Congress and led largely by lawyers, investigated allegations of rape and unlawful searches from both the public and within DHS ranks, for instance. Egregious conduct was referred to the Justice Department.
The CRCL office had limited powers; former staffers say their job was to protect DHS by ensuring personnel followed the law and addressed civil rights concerns. Still, it was effective in stalling rushed deportations or ensuring detainees had access to phones and lawyers. And even when its investigations didn’t fix problems, CRCL provided an accounting of allegations and a measure of transparency for Congress and the public.
The office processed thousands of complaints — 3,000 in fiscal year 2023 alone — ranging from allegations of lack of access to medical treatment to reports of sexual assault at detention centers. Former staffers said around 600 complaints were open when work was suspended.
The administration has gutted most of the office. What’s left of it was led, at least for a while, by a 29-year-old White House appointee who helped craft Project 2025, the right-wing blueprint that broadly calls for the curtailment of civil rights enforcement.
Meanwhile, ICE is enjoying a windfall in resources. On top of its annual operating budget of $10 billion a year, the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill included an added $7.5 billion a year for the next four years for recruiting and retention alone. As part of its hiring blitz, the agency has dropped age, training and education standards and has offered recruits signing bonuses as high as $50,000.
“Supercharging this law enforcement agency and at the same time you have oversight being eliminated?” said the former DHS official. “This is very scary.”
Michelle Brané, a longtime human rights attorney who directed DHS’ ombudsman office during the Biden administration, said Trump’s adherence to “the authoritarian playbook is not even subtle.”
“ICE, their secret police, is their tool,” Brané said. “Once they have that power, which they have now, there’s nothing stopping them from using it against citizens.”
Tricia McLaughlin, the DHS assistant secretary for public affairs, refuted descriptions of ICE as a secret police force. She called such comparisons the kind of “smears and demonization” that led to the recent attack on an ICE facility in Texas, in which a gunman targeted an ICE transport van and shot three detained migrants, two of them fatally, before killing himself.
In a written response to ProPublica, McLaughlin dismissed the current and former national security officials and scholars interviewed by ProPublica as “far-left champagne socialists” who haven’t seen ICE enforcement up close.
“If they had,” she wrote, “they would know when our heroic law enforcement officers conduct operations, they clearly identify themselves as law enforcement while wearing masks to protect themselves from being targeted by highly sophisticated gangs” and other criminals.
McLaughlin said the recruiting blitz is not compromising standards. She wrote that the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center is ready for 11,000 new hires by the beginning of next year and that training has been streamlined and boosted by technology. “Our workforce never stops learning,” McLaughlin wrote.
White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson also praised ICE conduct and accused Democrats of making “dangerous, untrue smears.”
“ICE officers act heroically to enforce the law, arrest criminal illegal aliens and protect American communities with the utmost professionalism,” Jackson said. “Anyone pointing the finger at law enforcement officers instead of the criminals are simply doing the bidding of criminal illegal aliens and fueling false narratives that lead to violence.”
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, the Trump pick who fired nearly the entire civil rights oversight staff, said the move was in response to CRCL functioning “as internal adversaries that slow down operations,” according to a DHS spokesperson.
Trump also eliminated the department’s Office of the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman, which was charged with flagging inhumane conditions at ICE detention facilities where many of the apprehended immigrants are held. The office was resurrected after a lawsuit and court order, though it’s sparsely staffed.
The hobbling of the office comes as the White House embarks on an aggressive expansion of detention sites with an eye toward repurposing old jails or building new ones with names that telegraph harsh conditions: “Alligator Alcatraz” in the Florida Everglades, built by the state and operated in partnership with DHS, or the “Cornhusker Clink” in Nebraska.
“It is a shocking situation to be in that I don’t think anybody anticipated a year ago,” said Erica Frantz, a political scientist at Michigan State University who studies authoritarianism. “We might’ve thought that we were going to see a slide, but I don’t think anybody anticipated how quickly it would transpire, and now people at all levels are scrambling to figure out how to push back.”

 “Authoritarian Playbook”

Frantz and other scholars who study anti-democratic political systems in other countries said there are numerous examples in which ICE’s activities appear cut from an authoritarian playbook. Among them was the detention of Tufts University doctoral student Rümeysa Öztürk, who was apprehended after co-writing an op-ed for the campus paper that criticized the school’s response to the war in Gaza. ICE held her incommunicado for 24 hours and then shuffled her through three states before jailing her in Louisiana.
“The thing that got me into the topic of ‘maybe ICE is a secret police force’?” said Lee Morgenbesser, an Australian political science professor who studies authoritarianism. “It was that daylight snatching of the Tufts student.”
Morgenbesser was also struck by the high-profile instances of ICE detaining elected officials who attempted to stand in their way. Among them, New York City Comptroller Brad Lander was detained for demanding a judicial warrant from ICE, and U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla was forcibly removed from a DHS press conference.
And David Sklansky, a Stanford Law School professor who researches policing and democracy, said it appears that ICE’s agents are allowed to operate with complete anonymity. “It’s not just that people can’t see faces of the officers,” Sklansky said. “The officers aren’t wearing shoulder insignia or name tags.”
U.S. District Judge William G. Young, a Ronald Reagan appointee, recently pointed out that use of masked law enforcement officers had long been considered anathema to American ideals. In a blistering ruling against the administration’s arrests of pro-Palestinian protesters, he wrote, “To us, masks are associated with cowardly desperados and the despised Ku Klux Klan. In all our history we have never tolerated an armed masked secret police.” The Trump administration has said it will appeal that ruling.

 Where the Fallout is Felt

The fallout is being felt in places like Hays County, Texas, not far from Austin, where ICE apprehended 47 people, including nine children, during a birthday celebration in the early morning of April 1.
The agency’s only disclosure about the raid in Dripping Springs describes the operation as part of a yearlong investigation targeting “members and associates believed to be part of the Venezuelan transnational gang, Tren de Aragua.”
Six months later, the county’s top elected official told ProPublica the federal government has ignored his attempts to get answers.
“We’re not told why they took them, and we’re not told where they took them,” said County Judge Ruben Becerra, a Democrat. “By definition, that’s a kidnapping.”
In the raid, a Texas trooper secured a search warrant that allowed law enforcement officers to breach the home, an Airbnb rental on a vast stretch of land in the Hill Country. Becerra told ProPublica he believes the suspicion of drugs at the party was a pretense to pull people out of the house so ICE officers who lacked a warrant could take them into custody. The Texas Department of Public Safety did not respond to a request for comment.
The Trump administration has yet to produce evidence supporting claims of gang involvement, said Karen Muñoz, a civil rights attorney helping families track down their relatives who were jailed or deported. While some court documents are sealed, nothing in the public record verifies the gang affiliation DHS cited as the cause for the birthday party raid.
“There’s no evidence released at all that any person kidnapped at that party was a member of any organized criminal group,” Muñoz said.
McLaughlin, the DHS spokesperson, did not respond to questions about Hays County and other raids where families and attorneys allege a lack of transparency and due process.
 In Plain Sight

Months after ICE’s widely publicized raids, fear continues to envelop Santa Ana, a majority-Hispanic city with a large immigrant population. Amezcua, the mayor, said the raids have complicated local policing and rendered parents afraid to pick up their children from school. The city manager, a California-born citizen and Latino, carries with him three government IDs, including a passport.
Raids of car washes and apartment buildings continue, but the community has started to “push back,” Amezcua said. “Like many other communities, the neighbors come out. People stop in the middle of traffic.”
With so few institutional checks on ICE’s powers, citizens are increasingly relying on themselves. On at least one occasion in nearby Downey, a citizen’s intervention had some effect.
On June 12, Melyssa Rivas had just started her workday when a colleague burst into her office with urgent news: “ICE is here.”
The commotion was around the corner in Rivas’ hometown, a Los Angeles suburb locals call “Mexican Beverly Hills” for its stately houses and affluent Hispanic families. Rivas, 31, the daughter of Mexican immigrants, belongs to Facebook groups where residents share updates about cultural festivals, church programs and, these days, the presence of Trump’s deportation foot soldiers.
Rivas had seen posts about ICE officers sweeping through LA and figured Downey’s turn had come. She and her co-worker rushed toward the sound of screaming at a nearby intersection. Rivas hit “record” on her phone as a semicircle of trucks and vans came into view. She filmed at least half a dozen masked men in camouflage vests encircling a Hispanic man on his knees.
Her unease deepened as she registered details that “didn’t seem right,” Rivas recalled in an interview. She said the parked vans had out-of-state plates or no tags. The armed men wore only generic “police” patches, and most were in street clothes. No visible insignia identified them as state or federal — or even legal authorities at all.
“When is it that we just decided to do things a different way? There’s due process, there’s a legal way, and it just doesn’t seem to matter anymore,” Rivas said. “Where are human rights?”
Video footage shows Rivas and others berating the officers for complicity in what they called a “kidnapping.” Local news channels later reported that the vehicles had chased the man after a raid at a nearby car wash.
“I know half of you guys know this is fucked up,” Rivas was recorded telling the officers.
Moments later, the scene took a turn. As suddenly as they’d arrived, the officers returned to their vehicles and left, with no apology and no explanation to the distraught man they left on the sidewalk.
Through a mask, one of them said, “Have a good day.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/gettyimages-2224603707-1024x692.jpg,,,2025-10-20 07:37:22.964745

(Photo by Steve Fala)At the 2025 York Paw Paw Festival, I stopped by the Lancaster Conservancy booth and encountered a retired gentleman who brought up the subject of a local waterway being considered for a large energy project. He favored developing it for power generation over preserving the natural landscape. After some courteous but lively debate, he exclaimed “well, we will just have to ‘agree to disagree,’” and moved on.
Cuffs Run is a small stream running down a steep valley and draining into Lake Clarke on the western side of the Susquehanna River. York Energy Storage (YES) received approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in November 2024 to study the area for a pumped storage facility to generate electricity. The project will flood almost 600 acres of the surrounding area creating a large reservoir for producing power.
To understand the potential impacts of this proposal, one can look 10 miles downriver to Constellation Energy’s Muddy Run Pumped Storage Facility and adjacent reservoir. This project would be similar in scope and size. 
The Lancaster Conservancy is leading a coalition of partners fighting this project which includes the Susquehanna National Heritage Area, Lower Susquehanna Riverkeeper Association, Farm & Natural Lands Trust of York County, and the Chesapeake Bay Foundation along with local Republican politicians. Unfortunately, political involvement in today’s climate is more about assigning blame than finding solutions. A request to reconsider the YES permit submitted by the coalition failed in January when the commission ran out the clock procedurally, automatically denying the request.
The arguments against development assert it would destroy preserved farmland, scenic trails and forests, displacing over 40 residents. According to the conservancy, “the viewshed from the popular multimodal Enola Low Grade Trail in Lancaster County” would be permanently scarred. Which brings us back to the gentleman at the booth and his straight-forward reason for supporting the project, “I need electricity to run my AC.”
That simple explanation encapsulates why the effort to stop this project will fail unless the coalition drastically changes its approach.
There are over 13 million residents in Pennsylvania presumably most who need cooling in the summer months. Is relocating 40 residents that high of a price to pay? Removing farmland, trails, forests and displacing residents in the name of development has been done countless times in the name of progress. What percentage of the 13 million residents know or care about a “viewshed.”
Has the current administration shown any greater inclination to support environmental preservation over business development than previous administrations, especially in a congressional district solidly in its corner?
It’s only a matter of time before this project is approved, permitted, and construction begins. The results will be irreparable with the landscape gouged out and cut up permanently spoiling the countryside just to pump water up to a reservoir during low electricity demand periods (typically at night) and releasing the flow to power the turbines and create electricity during peak periods.
Fortunately, there may still be a path forward but it involves reaching across the aisle to find unnatural allies. In total, the coalition partners have approximately $50 million in annual revenues. In comparison, Constellation Energy and Brookfield Renewable Partners, which operate several hydro and nuclear plants along the river, have close to $30 billion in annual revenues with continuing items on the regulatory docket.
On October 2, Constellation Energy and the State of Maryland announced a comprehensive agreement paving the way for the Conowingo Hydroelectric Station license renewal. The agreement includes better water quality and pollution standards and healthier fisheries management.
This endeavor can represent a new paradigm going forward as Brookfield’s Safe Harbor and Holtwood hydroelectric dam licenses expire in 2030 and are beginning their recertification process now.
The Conservancy has estimated in the last 10 years, over $100 million has been invested by governments and nonprofits along the river to support a thriving and growing outdoor recreation and tourism economy. This amount pales in comparison to the expected $1.6 billion investment for a single project by Constellation Energy to restart the Three Mile Island Unit 1 nuclear reactor.  These corporations possess the resources to purchase land and obtain permits while having powerful lobbyists and allies in Washington, D.C.
While it may appear on the surface to be “dancing with the devil” to partner with large conglomerates, this is not the case as these energy facilities produce renewable clean energy.
If a broader holistic approach to the region’s energy demand and environmental needs is not embarked upon soon, then an isolated effort to preserve Cuffs Run is doomed to failure. While a “David and Goliath” story makes for a good fairy tale, it rarely happens in real life.
To engage with these corporations, the coalition requires knowledge outside their current capabilities including urban planners, energy grid experts, corporate policy, and renewable energy experts.
Preserving Cuffs Run for future generations while ensuring they have affordable, clean energy are intertwined and reachable goals. Today’s reality requires an alternate approach than previous environmental showdowns. Pursuing this path will benefit us all.

(Photograph by John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)MEMPHIS — A Tennessee Highway Patrol officer rested his hat on the roof of a white sedan — its front plastic bumper slightly sagging, doors and trunk open — as he searched between the front seats with a flashlight.
The car’s driver, a middle-aged Black man with dreadlocks pulled back into a ponytail, stood between another Highway Patrol officer and a man in an FBI vest near the hood of a THP vehicle and an unmarked pickup truck. The driver crossed his arms and stared at his feet, outfitted in white socks and slides. Two more officers wearing Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) vests walked between the sedan and the flashing blue lights of the THP car.
It was just after dusk on a Tuesday at a Sunoco gas station on Lamar Avenue, a main roadway that runs through several of Memphis’s most poverty-stricken neighborhoods, where the overwhelming majority of residents are minorities, according to the U.S. Census.
Two additional unmarked vehicles pulled into the small gas station and three more officers emerged: one U.S. marshal and two others wearing vests labeled only, “POLICE,” bringing the total to eight law enforcement officers and four vehicles.
At least 45 minutes into what one HSI officer at the scene described to Tennessee Lookout as a “simple traffic stop,” a Highway Patrol officer handed the driver a pink ticket.
The violation: The dangling front bumper.
The driver silently walked around his car, closing the trunk and each of the doors as the eight law enforcement officers slowly withdrew. “Nice talking with you, man,” one officer called over his shoulder as he walked away.
A few minutes later, the driver, who declined to give his name, emerged from his car with a cellphone in his hand.
“That’s the craziest s–t ever,” he said as he lifted the hood and popped the plastic bumper back into place.

Nearly three weeks after the Memphis Safe Task Force was launched at the direction of President Donald Trump with the support of Gov. Bill Lee, officers from multiple federal and state agencies have issued more than 4,600 traffic citations — far outpacing the task force’s 1,044 arrests and 206 firearm seizures reported by the U.S. Marshals Service as of Friday morning.
Local advocacy groups have logged hundreds of reports from community members of multi-agency traffic stops, some posting videos of the interactions to social media.
Trump established the task force through a presidential memo on Sept. 15 to “end street and violent crime in Memphis to the greatest possible extent.” His memo specifically calls for “strict enforcement” of laws “prohibiting assault, battery, larceny, graffiti and other vandalism, unpermitted disturbances and demonstrations, noise, trespassing, public intoxication, drug possession, sale, vagrancy and use, and traffic violations.”
But federal and state agencies have thus far refused to release details of the citations and arrests — charges, names and circumstances — to the Tennessee Lookout beyond broad categorizations. A Department of Justice  spokesperson cited “operational security” as the reason for the limited information but declined to elaborate on the record. 
The Tennessee Highway Patrol did not respond to requests for the overall number of traffic stops performed, including those that did not result in citations or arrests. It is also unclear how many of the task force’s arrests resulted from traffic stops.
Lack of data leaves unknowns about impact on ‘violent crime’
Trump, Lee, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and other public officials have celebrated the arrest numbers, crediting the task force with taking hundreds of “career criminals” and “known gang members” off of Memphis streets. But the limited data released by the task force so far does not provide enough information to support these statements, and community advocacy groups contend that the majority of the people being arrested or cited are not violent criminals.
The U.S. Marshals Service’s broad breakdown of the 1,044 arrests includes eight homicides, 48 sex offenses, 110 firearm arrests and 116 arrests involving narcotics charges. Two arrests were due to probation or parole violations, 418 were for “warrants” with no additional explanation provided, 155 were for “other” reasons, and 187 were for Administrative ICE Warrants, which are signed by U.S. Immigration and Customs officials and do not carry the same investigative powers as criminal warrants signed by a judge. 
Among those arrested were 92 “known gang members,” according to the U.S. Marshals Service, though the data released does not include any further information about these individuals’ alleged gang ties. U.S. marshals also reported 56 missing children have been located by the task force, but did not include the circumstances of those cases.
A report to local officials of the task force’s actions on Oct. 13 showed that 37 out of the 51 people arrested that day were not charged with violent offenses, according to reporting from MLK50: Justice Through Journalism. This includes seven arrests for people “unlawfully present in the United States” — a civil offense — with no other criminal charges listed. The document also listed 59 misdemeanor citations.
Shelby County District Attorney Steve Mulroy reported that his staff had 52% more felony cases and 30% more misdemeanor cases to handle after the task force’s first week, compared with his office’s normal volume. Felony charges can include both violent and nonviolent crimes. Mulroy’s office could not be reached for updated information.
‘Needle in a haystack approach’
Minutes after the stop at the Sunoco station, Tennessee Lookout observed another Highway Patrol vehicle and unmarked pickup truck pulling into a different gas station on Lamar Avenue behind a vehicle with a duct-taped rear window, damaged door and missing front grill.
THP, ATF and FBI officers surrounded the car with a handicap placard hanging from the rearview mirror driven by an elderly Black woman and man. The officers left roughly 15 minutes later. The woman driving the car, who declined to share her name, said the officers told her they pulled her over because the registration tags were not up to date and let her go when they discovered that wasn’t true.

Scarlet Neath, a senior adviser for The Policing Project at the New York University School of Law, said stops like this are examples of “pretextual stops,” or “low-level traffic stops that are made for equipment, administrative (or) other minor violations — like objects hanging from a rearview mirror, a single broken tail light or missing registration sticker — that really have no connection to road safety and which are frequently used as an excuse to look for evidence of an unrelated crime.” 
“Police use them as a pretense for fishing for evidence of activity like possessing drugs,” Neath told Tennessee Lookout.
Memphis barred the use of such stops in 2023, a few months after 29-year-old Tyre Nichols died after police beat him during a traffic stop. But state legislators passed a law in 2024 that blocked local governments from instituting such rules, nullifying the Memphis ordinance.
Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers materials describe pretextual stops for traffic violations as the easiest way to investigate a driver or vehicle for a suspected crime when an officer might not have enough facts for “reasonable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot.”
Regardless of an officer’s intent for the stop, the training materials state that pretextual stops don’t violate Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable search and seizure, so long as they are not “based solely on race or religion.” Pretextual stops must also be “reasonable,” and no longer than necessary to investigate “reasonable suspicion.”
Studies of such stops have called their effectiveness and fairness into question.
A study of the Metro Nashville Police Department’s traffic stop practices conducted by Stanford Computational Policy Lab and the Policing Project in 2018 found that “Black drivers were stopped substantially more than white drivers” and “these disparities were particularly pronounced among stops for non-moving violations, such as broken tail lights and expired registration tags.”
The study also found that these stops “had no discernible effect on serious crime rates, and only infrequently resulted in the recovery of contraband or a custodial arrest.”
Tennessee rep calls Memphis preemption bill worse than “overreach”

“Evidence to date on using random low-level traffic stops to interrupt or detect serious and violent crime shows that it’s a needle in a haystack approach,” Neath said.
Another study examining California traffic stop data from 2019 estimated that the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department made 58,292 stops that year, but “only 487 (less than 1%) were for suspicion of a crime that could be classified as a felony.” Deputies in Riverside County spent about nine out of every 10 hours on the clock on traffic stops initiated by deputies, adding up to an estimated annual cost of more than $258 million.
The cost of running the Memphis Safe Task Force and the amount of time it spends on stops that don’t result in arrests or citations are unclear.
Neath said more data would be needed to examine whether the task force’s traffic stops are effective, including why a stop was made, its outcome (arrest, deportation, seizure, charges brought, etc.), and whether the person who was arrested or faced an immigration consequence had a history of criminal charges.
“All charges are not created equal in terms of public safety, just like all traffic stops are not equally important to road safety,” she said.
Shelby Co. mayor, advocates say traffic stops generate fear
Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris expressed concern about potential racial profiling in the task force’s traffic stops during a Tuesday news conference alongside immigration lawyer Colton Bane and community organizer Carlos Ochoa. 
Harris said task force members pulled over one of the county’s employees — a Latino man — and “detained him for a small while, while they investigated his paperwork,” before letting him go without an explanation of why they stopped him.
Bane said he has received “numerous” reports from clients and non-clients of task force officers refusing to return driver’s licenses to Hispanic people after traffic stops. In one instance, a client called Bane during a traffic stop in which Department of Homeland Security and Highway Patrol officers returned the man’s work permit and Social Security card but refused to return his state-issued ID. When Bane arrived and introduced himself as the man’s attorney, a Department of Homeland Security officer retrieved the ID from his pocket, returned it to Bane’s client, and released him.
Bane said the traffic stop was initiated because of his client’s “drive-out” tags — the temporary paper tags that come with vehicles purchased from car dealerships. The client’s temporary tags are valid until Nov. 30, Bane said.
A DOJ spokesperson referred Tennessee Lookout to local law enforcement when asked whether task force members have seized state-issued identification during traffic stops. Tennessee Highway Patrol did not respond to Tennessee Lookout’s questions.
Ochoa, a member of Vecindarios 901, said members of immigrant communities are afraid to leave their homes, seek medical care, take their children to school or visit local parks.
“The most important thing here is to balance safety and liberty,” Ochoa said. “Everyone is interested in reducing crime. Nobody here is interested in reducing liberty … As a community, we need to balance those two things.”
When asked about community response to the task force, a spokesperson for the United States Marshals Service told Tennessee Lookout, “Though some in Memphis are not supportive of the effort, we have found the overall attitude of the residents, as well as local and state leaders, is positive and they are glad to see the efforts being made are reducing crime and putting the dangerous people behind bars and off the streets.”

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)On Oct. 13, Group Health Cooperative held what appeared to be its largest membership meeting in at least a decade. Scores of GHC patients filed into the Alliant Energy Center’s Exhibition Hall, packing the meeting room until there were no seats left. They voted unanimously to direct their cooperative to change course and voluntarily recognize GHC workers’ chosen union. 
This win was a long time coming for GHC workers like me. We are unionizing for many reasons. Personally, I started working as a family medicine physician at GHC 22 years ago, and was excited about working for a primary care-based, member-owned cooperative that valued clinical staff voices. But GHC has changed. Through my union involvement I’ve come to see that many of my coworkers also face struggles with high turnover and understaffing, unfair pay and discipline and racial inequities. These struggles collectively hurt our ability to provide excellent patient care.
By supporting each other and working together through a union, we can better advocate for ourselves and improve our ability to provide the best patient care. Our input as employees is not only useful, but critical, to making GHC the best it can be.
But since we announced our intention to unionize in December, GHC has waged a relentless union-busting campaign. Following the legal counsel of antiunion law firm Husch Blackwell, administrators have engaged in surveillance and other intimidation tactics, and even used union activity as a factor in discipline. Their actions are under investigation by the National Labor Relations Board. GHC has also consistently parroted legal arguments straight from the Trump administration’s attacks on workers’ rights. 
GHC’s most fundamental attack, however, has been on our ability to choose for ourselves what our union looks like. We are creating a union of providers and nursing staff in primary and urgent care and closely related units – basically, the generalists you first see when you get care – since we all share issues in common and would benefit from bargaining together.
But GHC administrators are seeking to forcibly add on workers in specialty care units like optometry and radiology who haven’t even sought collective bargaining. Why? They hope to dilute our Yes votes and make it impossible for us to win a union election. They like to claim that the National Labor Relations Board sides with them, and that these specialty care workers must join with us – but don’t believe it. While the NLRB has said that the employer’s version of our union was feasible, they also said they weren’t offering an opinion on the appropriateness of a primary and urgent care union. GHC is still free to recognize the union we chose. 
GHC has also been confused, or is misleading, about what it is we’re asking for. Speaking with Wisconsin Examiner’s Erik Gunn, GHC representative Marty Anderson said “voluntary recognition” wasn’t likely, because they’d want “an NLRB sanctioned and overseen vote.” But voluntary recognition is an NLRB-sanctioned process: all GHC needs to do is tell the NLRB that they recognize our chosen union, either with or without an NLRB-sanctioned card check or secret-ballot demonstration of majority support. That’s voluntary recognition. It would save everyone further time and expense, not to mention cultivate a positive relationship between both parties going forward. We look forward to a collaborative relationship with GHC as we move forward as a union. 
Attending the meeting on Oct. 13 and seeing the support from our patients and community was truly heartwarming. It reinforced my decision to become active in our union movement – both for ourselves and for the care that we provide to our dedicated patients. Excellent patient care is at the heart of our union movement.
And GHC patients have made it clear, with a unanimous vote, that they stand shoulder to shoulder with their caregivers. As a cooperative where members stand “at the top of the leadership chart,” GHC’s Board should respect membership’s vote by voluntarily recognizing our union, effective immediately. To do anything else is unthinkable in any cooperative that claims to be democratically run.
To show your support, please send an email to the GHC Board telling them to respect the will of the membership and recognize our union: https://act.seiu.org/a/ghc-board-1.

But most of the attention will be on three specific elections that were at the heart of  federal redistricting litigation.,"Absentee voting has begun for several special legislative elections in Mississippi, which have the potential to add more Democratic seats in a state controlled by Republicans. 
​​A federal three-judge panel ordered Mississippi to conduct special elections for 14 legislative seats this year because the court determined lawmakers diluted Black voting strength when they redrew districts in 2022.
Seven races are on the ballot for the Nov. 4 general election: six in the Senate and one in the House. But most of the attention will be on three specific elections that were at the heart of the federal litigation. 
SEE THE MISSISSIPPI TODAY 2025 SPECIAL ELECTION GUIDE
The state complied with the federal panel’s order by creating two majority-Black Senate districts with no incumbents in them and by significantly redrawing one House district. 
Senate District 2 contains portions of DeSoto and Tunica counties. Charlie Hoots is the Republican nominee, and Theresa Isom is the Democratic nominee. Neither has been elected to the Legislature before. 
Sen. David Parker, a Republican from Olive Branch, was the incumbent in this district, but he announced over the summer that he would not run in the new district. 
Senate District 45 includes portions of Forrest and Lamar counties. This is a new district without an incumbent. Johnny DuPree is the Democratic nominee, and Anna Rush is the Republican nominee. DuPree is the former mayor of Hattiesburg, and Rush is an attorney in Hattiesburg. 
House District 22 involves portions of Chickasaw, Clay and Monroe counties. Jon Lancaster is the Republican nominee, and Justin Crosby is the Democratic nominee. 
Unlike the two Senate races, Lancaster is an incumbent,  currently in his second term. First elected as a Democrat in 2019, Lancaster switched to the Republican Party in 2021. 
Republican House members are expected to fight to keep Lancaster in office, while national and state Democratic leaders are hoping to flip a GOP seat to a Democratic one in a rural area. 
Seven candidates are also vying for a state Senate seat left open by John Horhn after he became Jackson’s mayor in July. He had represented District 26, which spans across north Jackson into parts of rural Hinds and Madison counties, since 1993.

After President Donald Trump lost his reelection bid in 2020, he and his allies were pushing false narratives about the election being stolen, pressuring state and local officials, and calling for audits of the results.
In Fulton County, Pennsylvania, a Republican stronghold where Trump won a larger percentage of the vote than anywhere else in the state, local leaders wanted to help.
“Sending this email to see what’s going on with this rigged election,” County Commissioner Randy Bunch, a Republican, wrote to state Sen. Judy Ward, also a Republican, in a Nov. 12 email obtained by watchdog group American Oversight. “We can’t let this election get stolen if there is anything I can do please let me know.”
A few weeks later, according to court documents, the county let an outside company examine its voting machines and download data from them. In text messages sent shortly afterwards, one county commissioner said that if the county hadn’t given the company access, a Trump ally would have forced it to do so via a subpoena.
That decision to allow a third party to access sensitive voting equipment set off far-reaching consequences for Fulton County. As a result of a state order, it had to purchase all-new voting equipment. After years of legal proceedings, the county is facing more than $1 million in fines, an amount equal to roughly one-eighth of the county’s yearly budget.
“It sure is a mess,” said Paula Shives, a Democrat who was a county commissioner at the time, but didn’t approve granting access to the voting equipment. “And unfortunately, it looks like the residents of Fulton County will be responsible for the damages.”
Five years later, election officials in predominantly Republican counties around the country are again getting requests to inspect their voting equipment in connection with the 2020 election.
Recently, The Washington Post reported that a Republican consultant reached out to clerks in Colorado to ask if they would allow a third party to review whether their voting machines complied with federal law. The consultant claimed to be cooperating with “officials working on the President’s executive order.”
A representative of the U.S. Department of Justice also recently approached counties in Missouri asking for access to election equipment used during the 2020 election, though the exact purpose of the request was unclear.
In both cases, officials said they declined the requests. But Lawrence Norden, vice president of the elections and government program at the Brennan Center, noted that election officials in other states might act differently.
“This is just one more thing that election officials are going to have to grapple with,” he said. “They need support from the states to make clear to them what the rules are and the protocols are for dealing with the request for access to the equipment.”
All of this gives new relevance to the choices officials in Fulton County made five years ago — and the expensive consequences the county is still dealing with today.
Commissioner asks: ‘Who authorized this?’
Fulton County sits along the state’s southern border with Maryland west of Gettysburg. Its roughly 15,000 residents are reliable Republicans who haven’t voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since 1964, when Lyndon B. Johnson won the state by a landslide.
Even though Trump romped to victory in Fulton County in 2020, two Republican commissioners there still pushed for an audit in the chaotic period following the election.
Court documents say Bunch and fellow Republican Commissioner Stuart Ulsh allowed a Pennsylvania-based technology company called Wake TSI to “inspect and copy components of” its Dominion Voting election equipment. Wake TSI was also involved in the review of the Maricopa County, Arizona, 2020 election.
Wake TSI was contracted at the time to a nonprofit company run by pro-Trump attorney Sidney Powell, who was challenging election results around the country, according to The Washington Post.
Text messages obtained by American Oversight showed that pressure from a Pennsylvania state senator, Doug Mastriano, may have contributed to the county’s decision to let Wake TSI examine its machines. According to the Post, Mastriano, who is from neighboring Franklin County, told Trump he could arrange an audit in the state, something Trump and his allies had been pushing for.

Shives, who found out after the fact that the examination had gone ahead, expressed consternation in a group text message with the other two commissioners, the records show.
“Who did that,” she asked.
Patti Hess, then the county’s election director, replied with a photo of paperwork from Wake TSI, adding that it was “sent by Senator Mastriano” and that “all counties are to do this.”
“‘All counties are to do this’ by whose order?” Shives asked. “Who authorized this? When was it scheduled? Who was notified and who was present during this process?”
“It was happening this way or in a subpoena,” Ulsh said after some back and forth.
No county appears to have ever received a subpoena in connection with Mastriano’s review.
Why state law restricts access to voting equipment
After commissioners released Wake TSI’s report — which uncovered no fraud — on the county’s website, officials at the Pennsylvania Department of State were alarmed that the county had given a non-governmental outside organization access to its voting equipment. State laws and regulations require such equipment to be kept secure and accessible only to a limited number of government officials and employees of the manufacturer in order to prevent the introduction of any malware.
Attempts to access voting systems occurred elsewhere around the country. In Coffee County, Georgia, Trump attorneys and local election officials allowed an outside company to access voting equipment, which factored into an indictment against Trump and those officials, though that case has since stalled.
In Colorado, Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters received a nine-year prison sentence for allowing an outside individual to access and copy data on voting machines. Peters is appealing her conviction, and Trump has advocated for her release.
Trevor Timmons, a former chief information officer with the Colorado Department of State who now serves as chief technology officer with elections consulting firm The Election Group, said access to voting equipment across the country is generally “severely limited.” Poll workers will have some access, needed to run the machines on Election Day, with election directors and vendors typically having the type of higher-level access needed to program machines.
The logic behind keeping access tight is that if someone has physical access to the machine’s programing, they could potentially reprogram the machine to influence the outcome of elections. For example, he said, in a demonstration at a recent hacking conference, he saw someone add the letters “il” in front of the word “legal” in a ballot question, changing the meaning of a question on marijuana legalization.
In the Mesa County case, Peters “allowed somebody in and they imaged the disk, they got a copy of everything that was sitting on that disk,” he said. “To a sophisticated attacker, it allows them to make it easier to learn how the system works and to customize targeted attacks against that software and against those hardware devices.”
County defies court order
In July 2021 the state decertified Fulton County’s machines, telling county officials that no one could “verify that the impacted components of Fulton County’s leased voting system are safe to use in future elections”
The county sued the state over the decertification, and while that case was playing out, the Department of State secured an order from the state Supreme Court temporarily barring any more third-party access to the equipment.
But there was more to the story.
Fulton County had separately sued Dominion Voting for breach of contract, claiming Dominion “failed to provide a system that was free from defects and compliant.” As part of that lawsuit, county officials allowed another company, Speckin Forensics, to examine the machines — an inspection that occurred after the Supreme Court order went into effect.
The Department of State asked the courts to hold the county in contempt for violating the order. After two years of litigation, a special master appointed by the state Supreme Court ordered the county and its attorney to pay $711,252.21 to the department and $324,672.88 to Dominion Voting.
Ulsh, who lost his 2023 reelection bid, told Votebeat and Spotlight PA that he didn’t want to talk about the decision to allow Wake TSI’s examination and the aftermath, calling it “fake news.”
A bill awaits the county’s taxpayers
The county is nearly out of options to avoid paying the fine. It recently lost an appeal in the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in its breach-of-contract case against Dominion, but it also is separately appealing to the state Supreme Court its loss in the case the county had brought against the Department of State.
Both the Department of State and Dominion Voting said they hadn’t yet been paid. Last week, Dominion was purchased by a new company, Liberty Vote. A spokesperson for the new company did not return a request for comment.
“I don’t know how the current board of commissioners are going to (pay) that,” said Shives, who lost her reelection bid in 2023.
Bunch, who is still a commissioner, did not respond to a call seeking comment, or an email to him and the other two current commissioners asking how the county would pay the bill if its appeals are unsuccessful.
“I thought they were crazy,” said Stanley Kerlin, a local attorney and Republican who served as solicitor for the county’s board of elections from 1981 to 2019. “They got sold a bill of goods that that machine was no good and it doesn’t count votes correctly.”
He said it was illogical, in his view, that a conspiracy would involve Fulton County, which voted overwhelmingly for Trump. And if commissioners had doubts about the performance of the machines, he said, a better move would have been hand-counting a precinct or two.
Now, as a result, he said, the county will have “squandered” hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars.
Kerlin said the commissioners have said they won’t increase taxes to pay the fine. The other option, taking it out of the county’s savings account, still requires taxpayers to foot the bill.
Kerlin said the audit and the fine don’t get talked about much in the county, which shocks him.
“I think a lot of people don’t understand it,” he said, but added, “they’ll understand when they see the headline that the county has to pay ($700,000) to the state.”

 Kentucky Chief Justice Debra Hembree Lambert is urging attorneys to step up for what she admits is a stressful and low-paying job but one that is also rewarding: Protecting the interests of vulnerable children as guardians ad litem.
Guardians ad litem are court-appointed attorneys who represent children in dependency, neglect and abuse court cases. Kentucky needs more of them, especially in rural areas, Lambert said.  
Guardians ad litem are well positioned to connect families to resources like counseling and food pantries while fighting for children’s safety, essentially supplementing social workers’ jobs, Lambert said. 
The Administrative Office of the Courts is hosting legal trainings in November to help prepare more attorneys for the role. Registration is required for the trainings, which will be held in Covington, Lexington and Paducah. As of Friday, there were 61 attorneys registered to attend November’s trainings. 
Since this training became mandatory for guardians ad litem in Kentucky in 2020, the Administrative Office of the Courts has trained 1,050 attorneys, an AOC spokeswoman said.  
Each training will include an overview of the federal and state statutes, state case laws that apply to dependency, neglect and abuse cases and information on Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs), Lambert said. 



The following trainings are scheduled: 
Nov. 7, 2025
Kenton County Justice Center
230 Madison Ave.
Covington, Ky. 41011
Time: 9 a.m. – 4:30 p.m. EST, subject to change. 
Nov. 14, 2025
Robert F. Stephens Circuit Courthouse
120 North Limestone
Lexington, Ky. 40507
Time: 9 a.m. – 4:30 p.m. EST, subject to change.
 Nov. 21, 2025
Paducah Innovation Hub
500 South 25th Street
Paducah, Ky. 42003
Time: 9 a.m. – 4:30 p.m. CST, subject to change.



Guardians ad litem fight for a child’s best interest — even if it goes against what the child wants at the moment. 
“What makes that role a little bit different is that the attorney filling that role doesn’t have to do what the client wants or doesn’t have to recommend what the client wants,” Lambert explained. “A child who’s abused may actually want to go back home, depending on the circumstances, or not be removed from the home, but if the guardian ad litem attorney doesn’t believe it’s in that child’s best interest, then they are not bound to advocate for that to the family court or the district court who might be hearing the case.” 
As of Friday, there were 8,538 Kentucky children in foster care, Lambert said. Guardians ad litem “play an important role in ensuring that these children receive fair and expeditious attention from the judicial system and are placed in appropriate homes,” AOC said.  
Many times, these cases involve parental substance use disorder or serious mental health issues, Lambert said, adding that there are often more resources for treating substance use disorder than mental health issues. 
“While that number is a heavy number and a big number, it clearly is not all the children in Kentucky who are abused because we can’t do a perfect job,” she said. “Social workers can’t do a perfect job. There are many more children in Kentucky who live in traumatic circumstances, if you will. So, that is just the number of children who, by court order, have been removed from a home for rather significant amounts of neglect or abuse or even dependency.”
Each of these foster care cases is reviewed by Citizen Foster Care Review Board volunteers who make recommendations to judges about children’s placements, and more. Lambert said getting involved in that work is another way for non-attorneys to make a difference in the lives of Kentucky’s children facing the foster care system. 
“I would just encourage Kentuckians to get involved in some way with making their community better for children and their parents,” she said. “And most people do that through community organizations, church organizations, civic organizations, and that involvement can make us all heal a little bit.” 
A financially ‘thankless’ job 
Guardians ad litem have a fairly financially “thankless” job, Lambert said, with a $500 fee cap for cases that sometimes take hundreds of hours of lawyering. 
“It makes it a real passion project,” she said. “I think our guardian ad litems do a wonderful job for the most part, but they are almost in a volunteer situation. Some of these cases can linger for a long time and require long days at court while you’re waiting for that case to be called.” 
Lambert, who once served as a guardian ad litem, said it would fall to the Kentucky legislature to raise the maximum fee. 
“We have advocated for it to be more, because, obviously, that’s not a very large sum,” she said. “Talks go on every year right before session about raising those fees. And we hope that there will be an organized effort this time to raise the fee.” 
The 2026 legislative session begins on Jan. 6.
“I’m very proud of the attorneys who do this work, because I know how thankless it is in terms of the financial piece, but I do believe that most of the attorneys who work in this area do work for for the good outcomes,” Lambert said.
The job also exposes attorneys to second-hand trauma, which can be mentally challenging. 
“There’s certainly secondhand trauma from so much that we deal with today in the court system,” said Lambert. “I know when I worked in the field, both as a judge and an advocate for either children or parents, I think perhaps the best help, if you will, you could give yourself is to problem solve and make this circumstance better for the family or the child.”

(Photo by Parker Michels-Boyce for The Virginia Mercury)This article, Part One of the Mercury’s Pulse Check series, was produced as a project for the USC Annenberg Center for Health Journalism’s 2025 Impact Fund for Reporting on Health Equity and Health Systems.
In late March of this year the Virginia Department of Health (VDH) was notified that three COVID-19-era grants were being prematurely cancelled. This resulted in a loss of $219 million dollars the state had used to support public health initiatives, the layoff of hundreds of employees around Virginia and the compounding of existing challenges, including a $33 million deficit and burned-out staff. 
VDH is a state agency with several branches of public service, not all of which are as publicly-facing as local health districts were at the height of the pandemic and COVID vaccine rollout in 2020 and 2021. VDH plays many roles in public health; it performs safety inspections of public facilities and long-term care centers, conducts water quality testing, oversees local health districts around the state that operate clinics, and disburses state and federal funding to nonprofit organizations and free clinics. 
For Alexandria’s health district, the sudden cancellation of three federal grants meant 11 people were laid off. 
As he cleared his throat and stared at a note offscreen on a recent Zoom call with The Mercury, district director Dr. David Rose listed out the numerous duties those workers had carried out. 
“I’m just gonna read it because I can’t do it justice,” he said, describing how staff assisted in community immunization clinics, operated IT systems, and connected clients between the VDH district and local community resources. He explained how community health workers conducted public health outreach to various groups in the region as well. 
Alexandria, like much of Northern Virginia, typically has many affluent residents and a sizable portion of federal employees that commute to Washington D.C. for work. But the area is also home to immigrants from many countries like Afghanistan, El Salvador and other South American countries as well as those in East Africa, Rose explained. As such, VDH’s health district there offers information in multiple languages. 
The shock to the system didn’t last too long, he said, as he was able to tap into another federal funding source — the American Rescue Plan Act, a 2021 law that dispensed public health funding to states and localities. Rose said he was able to shift some people’s salaries into ARPA funds and in a Hail Mary, Alexandria’s city council earmarked some funding for the local health district as well. This means that nine of the employees were able to return to work for the time being. 
While Rose’s district has been able to pivot, he emphasized that each local health district around the state has different needs unique to their populations. 
“If you’ve seen one health district, you’ve seen one health district,” Rose said. “You can’t make too many generalizations about what their finances are like, what the politics are like, what the needs are.”
 ‘Billiard balls hitting each other’

Rose likened the grant cancellations and various federal health care changes to “billiard balls hitting each other.” 
This is because he’s also watching for the looming impact of changes to hospital funding mechanisms and Medicaid that were outlined in a reconciliation bill that Congress passed and President Donald Trump signed this summer. As thousands of Virginians stand to potentially lose health coverage through Medicaid and hospitals brace for cost increases that may lead to service cuts, staffing issues, or in some cases, closures, patients may rely even more heavily on local health districts, free clinics and nonprofit organizations. 
Additionally, long before state health departments across the country had to grapple with changes in federal funding, Virginia’s already had a grim diagnosis —- staffing issues, low morale and a $33 million dollar deficit in its emergency office, $4 million of which stemmed from fraudulent spending. 
An audit of VDH’s Office of Emergency Medical Services revealed embezzlement by a former department head and lack of accountability among staff. Millions of dollars had gone towards unnecessary spending and the ousted manager has since been convicted. 
Issues upstream meant that trauma centers had received critical funding late and an annual educational symposium for first responders was cancelled last year. A study of VDH at-large conducted by the state’s Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission in 2024 found high staff turnover and a problematic hiring process alongside low morale, training and procurement issues. 
While the prominent issues plaguing the department came to light last year, they’d been developing for a while. 
“Lack of accountability is contributing to low morale and high turnover,” JLARC analyst Andrew Dickinson told state lawmakers last year while presenting the audit. 
Beyond staffing, financial mismanagement extended beyond the troubled emergency office. Following repeated procurement issues with the Environmental Protection Agency, VDH had to begin fronting its own cash and seek payback through grants later. 
“In 2022 EPA was not happy with the way that we were handling our grants. So we went under a reimbursement system with them,” VDH Commissioner Karen Shelton told The Mercury in an interview. 
As grim as the findings were, they also pointed to pathways for solutions — a healing process VDH has been undertaking for more than a year. 
 VDH’s treatment plan

JLARC outlined 30 recommendations  for VDH to work on in its report, which revealed the range of issues state lawmakers deemed “disturbing.” 
Some, Shelton emphasized, had been underway prior to the publication of the reports, but some “have definitely been concentrations over the last year.”
In restructuring how VDH operated, officials created a chief financial officer position as well as an office of grants applications. 
The EPA grant was moved out of its reimbursement structure this summer, which Shelton pointed to as a benchmark of success.
The department has also worked to retain existing staff and fill vacancies with urgency. 
“As we looked at coming out of (the pandemic), our agency had a lot of needs with employee burnout,” Shelton said. 
She wanted to look at “employee resiliency and what we can do to kind of replenish and nourish from within.” 
The agency created an employee advisory council and hired a workforce development and engagement director, actions Shelton believes have improved staff morale. 
Chief Operating Officer Christopher Lindsey said that he began implementing monthly operating reviews in late 2022 to start fostering better communication between staff. Those meetings began to bring to light some of what would later come up in the audits, he said. 
Shelton said that the whole agency has gone through training refreshers over the past winter and spring to “make sure we hold people accountable to do their jobs but also to make sure they have what they need.”
Shelton also credited ARPA funding and allocations from Virginia’s state budget with helping the department update its information technology systems. 
VDH now monitors the emergency office more closely with new accountability measures. For example, an online dashboard that allows municipalities to track funding in real time helps ensure that the rescue squad funding indeed goes towards essential equipment and training that emergency responders need. 
A 2022 change in state law also helped VDH broaden its candidate pool to fill local health district director positions in recent years. Previously, only physicians could helm the districts before state lawmakers allowed people with public health degrees to serve in those roles. Now, with all 35 health director positions hired, Shelton said VDH has had regional health directors report to the commissioner of community health service. 
“Having the regional health directors on board has been a wonderful thing to help with our leadership and accountability and span of control,” Shelton said. 
As VDH continues to rehabilitate itself so that it can continue to serve people around Virginia, Rose said district directors are watching how federal changes affect things locally, from regional economies to health care access needs. 
“One thing impacts another and people don’t always see how they are all connected,” he said.
Rose used another analogy to liken VDH to  part of a cork board of pins and strings that connect the agency with social service departments, religious institutions as well as public and private health care institutions. 
“That really is public health,” he said. “We can’t do it alone.”

Part Two of the Virginia Mercury’s Pulse Check series, on how hospitals and free clinics are shoring up ahead of big federal health care changes and what it means for patients, will be published Tuesday, Oct. 21, 2025.

(Photo by Shannon Heckt/Virginia Mercury)Clean Virginia’s “The Energy Bills are Too Damn High” tour of the state stopped in Richmond Thursday night. It was promoted as a way to allow community members to hear from Democratic elected officials and candidates about how they want to address rising utility bills in coming legislative sessions. It ultimately was a rally for Democrats leading into Election Day. 
“I implore the utility companies, elected officials and regulators to maintain electricity rates that every Virginian, regardless of their finances can afford,” said Hope Elliot, a Richmond community advocate. 
The event kicked off with a discussion between Clean Virginia’s Executive Director Brennan Gilmore and state Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico, about legislation and regulations that have been proposed in the General Assembly. The senator said one of the most pressing issues facing the legislature is how to manage data center growth which is putting a strain on the energy grid. He pointed to gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger’s stance in the Oct. 9 gubernatorial debate that data centers need to pay a fair amount of the energy infrastructure costs.
“They need to pay their fair share. But it needs to be more than that, it needs to be about energy standards and tying them to energy standards so they’re not using so damn much energy,” VanValkenburg said. “I think we really need to be thinking about if we are going to be a home for them. … We need to figure out how we’re going to make up our energy deficit.”
There have been multiple attempts to implement some kind of statewide oversight into the permitting and impacts of the data center industry – as over a third of the entire world’s data centers reside in the commonwealth. One bill vetoed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin, House Bill 1601, would have required certain environmental and sound studies in areas where data center companies were applying for zoning permits. 
The Virginia Clean Economy Act calls for the retirement of carbon energy production methods for utilities by 2045. Democrats have pushed to expand solar and wind production, but faced heavy opposition from Republicans. Conservatives believe that renewable energy sources are not reliable and should not be the priority. Gubernatorial candidate and current Lt. Gov. Winsome Earl-Sears said in the debate against Spanberger: “What happens when the sun goes down?”
“Thankfully, battery storage is getting more and more robust by the day,” VanValkenburg told the crowd Thursday night, as if in answer to Earl-Sears. “The governor vetoed a bill on that, which hopefully will pass (next year) and we’ll have more and more battery storage.” 
Also in attendance at the event was state Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond, the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor. She told the Virginia Mercury that while locals can benefit from the tax revenue from data centers, there are statewide implications to the energy use and how it can translate to everyone’s bills going up.
“We need to have some more regulations in place so that we can be more thoughtful in where we site data centers, that we know the actual environmental impact that’s going to happen, that we have full data and appreciation for the impact on our electric consumption,” Hashmi said.
Hashmi sponsored legislation in the 2024 session that focused on energy efficiency programs to help reduce the power being used by utility customers. It failed to pass but VanValkenburg said he plans to bring that bill back in the future.
The speakers denounced the proposed Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center project that is awaiting approval from the State Corporation Commission. The gas peaker plant has been a source of controversy with neighboring communities pushing back against new carbon power. Dominion Energy has said it is a necessary project to meet demand on the hottest and coldest days of the year when the grid is seeing strain.
Proposed Chesterfield gas plant draws community objections, industry support

Republican candidates have frequently echoed the message of an “all of the above” energy profile for Virginia that has been the talking point for Youngkin. They often put more emphasis on small nuclear reactors and gas plants as more reliable sources of energy than solar and wind. They also put the blame of rising costs on the Virginia Clean Economy Act.
“The so-called Virginia Clean Economy Act makes ratepayers foot the bill for energy that doesn’t deliver — solar panels that don’t work at night and wind farms that produce barely 40 percent of what they promise, at best,” said Del. Kim Taylor, R-Petersburg, in a statement to the Virginia Mercury in response to questions about the discussions at the event.
Candidates running for the House of Delegates, Kimberly Pope Adams and Leslie Mehta, were invited to briefly speak about key issues in their districts which mostly centered on housing issues and connecting with voters.
Spanberger said in the debate that she supports the buildout of nuclear power as small nuclear reactors are being built in other states and Virginia utilities are asking the SCC to recover funds for future projects.
VanValkenburg said that Democrats in the General Assembly have to be more dedicated to building solar. He said there needs to be votes on allowing more third party companies to have a share in the solar portfolio as well as solar being put on rooftops, landfills, brownfields, and anywhere that is allowed.
“We voted for the Virginia Clean Economy Act, we have to make that real. That means building clean energy,” VanValkenburg said. “So if we want to say we don’t want gas plants, which I think ultimately, should be the goal, we have to build out the clean energy that we want. We have to take the hard votes to do that.” 
There is on-going back and forth around the desire for statewide regulations on solar projects while respecting local authority over siting projects.
“Democrats even tried to strip local governments of their right to decide where massive solar farms can go. That decision belongs to local communities, not Richmond bureaucrats.
The way forward is clear: restore local control, end costly ‘net-zero’ mandates, and put affordability and reliability first,” Taylor said in her statement to the Mercury.
The discussion at the rally also centered on campaign finance reform to not allow utility companies to donate to political campaigns. Some said such donations allow the companies to have unfair sway over legislators.
“We are one of only five states in the country where there are unlimited political contributions from corporations to the folks that represent you all,” Gilmore said in his panel with VanValkenburg. “And this is particularly egregious and acute when it comes to a public utility, a monopoly that you all regulate and are elected to regulate in the general assembly.”
VanValkenburg said he agrees that political campaigns should not be allowed to accept corporate donations from those they are tasked to regulate. Campaign finance reform has been a topic of discussion for years, but little has advanced in the General Assembly.

As rector of George Mason University’s Board of Visitors, he co-authored “Rogue Prosecutors: How Radical Soros Lawyers Are Destroying America’s Communities”— a jeremiad warning that the rule of law collapses when officials disregard their obligations. The irony is unmistakable: Stimson now presides over a rogue Board of Visitors that embodies everything his book condemns.
In his book, Stimson describes how rogue district attorneys adopt a coordinated “playbook”— issuing “remarkably similar ‘Do Not Prosecute’ memoranda” that substitute a partisan template for reasoned judgment. Mason’s rogue Board majority is running its own playbook: circumvent quorum rules, ignore recess requirements, and rush through structural changes under the cover of secrecy.
Stimson’s hastily convened October 15 Executive Committee meeting was his latest rogue maneuver. Back in August, at its last meeting, the Board adjourned — it did not recess. That distinction is decisive under Virginia law. An Executive Committee may act only when the board is in recess or when a special meeting has been called and fails to convene due to lack of quorum. Neither condition was satisfied, yet Stimson convened the committee anyway.  He obviously knows the difference since, at the end of the October 15 meeting, he moved that the Executive Committee recess, not adjourn.
And the agenda was no routine housekeeping. Most disturbingly, the rogue Executive Committee — just five out of sixteen members — approved an affiliation agreement with a separate fundraising foundation for the Antonin Scalia Law School. This unprecedented move fragments oversight and hands disproportionate influence to donors with minimal accountability. Such a consequential matter demands full board deliberation, public transparency and faculty input. Instead, it was jammed through by an improperly constituted, and thus illegitimate, rogue committee.
Excuses not accepted

The parallels to Stimson’s own critique grow sharper still. At one point, his book mocks rogue prosecutors who claim their approach is “backed up by ‘data and science’” despite lacking an empirical foundation. How fitting that Mason’s rogue board now cites self-serving “interpretations” of bylaws and legislative silence to justify actions that violate plain statutory text and basic governance norms.
The pattern of rogue behavior is not confined to bylaws. Just days before the improper Executive Committee meeting, Stimson reposted Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s attack on a political opponent. For a sitting rector of a public university — bound by Mason’s policies of institutional neutrality —  to use his position to amplify partisan attacks was not merely inappropriate. It was yet another example of rogue leadership substituting personal politics for the self-restraint and impartiality required of university governance.
The irony deepens when you consider that one of Stimson’s predecessors as Mason’s rector, Edwin Meese III, now lends his name to Stimson’s own workspace at the Heritage Foundation — the Edwin Meese III Center, where Stimson serves as Deputy Director.  Meese warns in the review of Stimson’s book that “when these officials abdicate their responsibilities and substitute their own ideas for what the law actually provides, the result is …a breakdown of the system … and civic incivility.” Yet under Stimson’s tumultuous leadership, Mason’s rogue board has done precisely that: abdicated the constraints of state law and its own bylaws to substitute tactical convenience for legal obligation.
This is not parliamentary pedantry; it is a breach of fiduciary duty. Trustees of a public university are bound by duties of care, loyalty and obedience to law. Acting ultra vires — beyond legal authority — is not just improper. It is rogue governance, and therefore illegitimate.
In his book, Stimson argued that when prosecutors refuse to enforce the law, communities suffer from lawlessness. The corollary is equally true: when trustees refuse to follow their bylaws and state statutes, the university community suffers from rogue governance without legitimacy. Faculty lose faith. Students see principle subordinated to politics. Donors question stewardship. And Virginia’s taxpayers are left to wonder whether the commonwealth’s largest public university serves the state — or the ideological ambitions of a few well-connected actors.
The dysfunction at Mason reflects a troubling trend across Virginia’s public universities: increasingly partisan board appointments, accelerating board politicization, the sidelining of faculty and student voices, and a concerted effort to subordinate public universities to narrow political agendas. These are precisely the conditions that enable rogue governance. What is at stake is not just one affiliation agreement for one public law school. It is whether a public university will be governed openly, lawfully and with fidelity to its mission — or whether those entrusted with stewardship will place expedience above legality and betray the public trust.
Charles Stimson is right about one thing: When those in power disregard the law, the consequences are grave. The tragedy for Mason is that the rector who wrote the book on rogue actors is presiding over — indeed, has himself created — precisely that: a rogue board. Virginians who care about the integrity of their public universities cannot allow this rogue regime to continue unchecked. The rule of law does not stop at the campus gates.

(Photo by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)A superintendent search firm that advised at least one school division in Virginia is now being sued in Iowa for allegedly failing to properly vet an undocumented immigrant before he was hired as the division’s superintendent, creating questions from school board members in the commonwealth. 
Last year, Stafford County School Board hired the same search firm, JG Consulting, which also does business as One-Fourth Consulting LLC, for its search that resulted in the hiring of Daniel Smith, former chief of staff and acting superintendent of Loudoun County Public Schools.
The Des Moines School Board in Iowa filed a lawsuit against JG Consulting, claiming the background check missed former Superintendent Ian Roberts’ lack of work authorization and past criminal charges, which has led to questions of if the firm could have missed details during their vetting process for Stafford and other school divisions.
Des Moines Public Schools declined to comment when asked if it has any advice for other school districts after its dealings with the firm. However, in a response to the lawsuit filing, the board chair said the search firm “failed in their duty to properly vet the candidates” and that Roberts should have not been presented to the board.
“JG Consulting’s contract required them to bring all known information of a positive or negative nature to the board, and since that did not happen the board will pursue aggressive legal action in accordance with the law,” Des Moines School Board Chair Jackie Norris said in an Oct. 3 statement. 
Stafford County Public Schools also declined to comment on whether it plans to work again with JG Consulting/One-Fourth Consulting in the future or take any other actions.
In an earlier statement, Maureen Siegmund, Stafford’s school board chair, spoke highly of Smith, saying he is an “exceptional educator and leader who is clearly focused on preparing students for life after high school.”

The national salary average for a school superintendent, supported by tax dollars, is $169,343, according to a recent study conducted by AASA, The School Superintendents Association, informed by 2,077 respondents including 23 from Virginia. Factors like the types of communities school districts serve such as rural, suburban and urban influence superintendent salaries. 
In a statement to the Mercury, Verjeana McCotter-Jacobs, executive director and CEO of the National School Boards Association, said selecting a superintendent is one of the most “important responsibilities” a school board undertakes and requires the board to keep in my mind the district’s goals and community values.
“School boards should take time to establish strong selection criteria, engage parents and the community in the process, and thoroughly vet candidates to ensure alignment with the district’s vision for student success,” McCotter-Jacobs said. “Equally important is choosing a search firm that understands the significance of comprehensive background checks and is committed to due diligence at every step. Boards must be able to trust that the firm representing them is conducting a thorough, ethical, and transparent process.”
The Mercury contacted JG Consulting, but did not receive a response. 
 Licensing

In addition to having a school board’s approval, a candidate to become a division superintendent in Virginia must have their license approved by the Virginia Board of Education.
Virginia has a set of requirements for candidates to receive a license, but the pathways can vary and have at times come under scrutiny. In some cases, superintendents may already have their state board approved licenses before being hired by a district level school board.
The first three pathways to licensing, “Options 1-3,” are meant for candidates with formal training and experience in education. However, “Option 4,” which is designed for non-educators with significant leadership experience, has been a point of contention. Teaching and administration experience are not required. 
One of the most widely known cases involving a candidate seeking a license under Option 4 involved a former county administrator being considered as a division superintendent in Spotsylvania County. 
In March 2024, the Spotsylvania County School Board hired Mark Taylor as its superintendent. His hiring came as members of the Spotsylvania community expressed concern about his lack of experience in public education and connections to a former board member who was responsible for his hiring. 
Later, the state Board of Education approved Taylor’s license, only reviewing the requirements for him to receive a license, such as having a master’s degree or its equivalent from an accredited institution, a minimum of three years of successful, full-time experience in a senior leadership position, and a recommendation by a Virginia school board.
But less than two years later, Taylor was fired in March 2024 by the newly-elected school board. 
Taylor and the school division were expected to settle on an agreement by the end of the year, according to a judge’s orders.
 Boards’ approaches to finding candidates

While a small group of school boards have used search firms, others have leaned on the Virginia School Board Association (VSBA) for assistance in finding their next chief executive officer. The association often posts vacancies on its website.
“School boards are equipped locally to decide what direction works best for their division when conducting a superintendent search,” said Gina Patterson, VSBA executive director, in a statement to the Mercury. “Each board has access to legal counsel to help navigate and guide them through the process. Candidates often come from across the country, not just Virginia, and the beauty of local control is that each board determines what approach best serves their community.”
As the story of the Iowa case has spread, education leadership groups including the School Board Members Alliance, have jumped in to make sure their Virginia members are protected. Des Moines Public Schools system is now considering a federal system called E-Verify to check a job applicant’s ability to legally work in the U.S., the Iowa Capital Dispatch reports.
In a statement to board members, the alliance told members that one of their most important decisions is hiring a superintendent.
“The choice impacts students, staff, and the community for years to come,” the alliance stated, “but recent events in Pennsylvania and Iowa serve as a serious warning: relying too heavily on search firms without requiring strong safeguards can expose your district to risk, embarrassment, and legal liability.”
The alliance advised boards against accepting “vague assurances” and insisted on obtaining “contract language and procedures” that protect the division and taxpayers.
“School boards often spend tens of thousands of dollars on superintendent search firms to identify candidates they believe will best meet the needs of their divisions,” said Shelly Norden, SBMA executive director, in a statement. “Ultimately, however, it is the responsibility of the local school board to ensure that the individual they hire has been thoroughly vetted.”

(Courtesy photo from the University of Rhode Island)Just how unique is the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution?
It’s the question the nation’s preeminent First Amendment attorney is slated to discuss at the University of Rhode Island (URI) next month as part of its upcoming Christiane Amanpour Lecture.
Floyd Abrams will appear at the Kingston campus at 4 p.m. on Monday, Nov. 3, for the event named after the famed CNN host and URI alumna hosted by the university’s Harrington School of Communication and Media. His lecture takes place in the Robert J. Higgins ’67 Welcome Center, 45 Upper College Road.
Abrams has been dubbed by his contemporaries as “the most significant First Amendment lawyer of our age,” having argued 13 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court.
That includes being part of the legal team that defended the New York Times’ decision to publish a number of confidential documents containing information about the cost of the Vietnam War known as the “Pentagon Papers.”
In 2010, he was one of the lead attorneys who persuaded a narrow Supreme Court majority that the First Amendment bars the government from limiting corporate spending on political campaigns — the basis of the controversial Citizens United ruling.
“I can’t think of a better person to speak with our community, especially our journalism students, about how press freedoms are interpreted in court,” Daniel S. Hunt, chair of the Harrington School’s journalism and public relations department, said in a statement. “ “First Amendment cases often set the legal precedent for future interpretations of our constitutional rights.”

In part, this is due to continuing development, including more parking lots, roads, and other paved areas that are destined for salt treatment in winter. (Getty Images)Every year, more road salt seeps off roads into New Hampshire’s waterways, posing a mounting threat to drinking water and wildlife. While the state has voluntary programs in place to try to keep salt at bay, levels continue to rise — and experts said it may take more to solve the problem, whether that means stricter regulations or a cultural adjustment of the public’s winter salt expectations.
“Things are still getting worse. I think it will be a while before we crest,” said Ted Diers, assistant water division director with the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services. 
Because the ions that make up road salt don’t evaporate or break down, and plants don’t significantly filter them out of the soil, road salt accumulates in the environment after it is applied. Today, more than 50 water bodies across the state have more chloride — a component of road salt — than is deemed safe by the Environmental Protection Agency, according to NHDES. This threatens aquatic life, because chloride is toxic to fish, Diers said. 
Salt also seeps into aquifers and affects drinking water supplies. According to NHDES, the number of salt-contaminated wells in New Hampshire has risen by 150% over the last 30 years. Salt in drinking water can affect taste and drinkers’ health; by corroding pipes, it can also release dangerous heavy metals like copper and lead into the water supply. 
Removing salt from drinking water is expensive and complicated, Diers said. In extreme cases, seeping road salt can force wells offline. The Merrimack Village District saw this play out in 2023: after documenting a more than 1,000% increase in sodium over 30 years and seeing levels in one of their five wells rise past what the town could afford to treat, the town closed it, increasing demand on their other four to compensate.
The threat of road salt has been apparent to NHDES for some time, said Aubrey Voelker, NHDES salt reduction program coordinator. Before ground was broken on the expansion of the southern portion of Interstate 93 in the early 2000s, routine environmental impact studies revealed high chloride levels in various waterways along the highway corridor, Voelker said.
Calls for a reduction
It became clear from those studies that “a very large reduction (in road salt) was needed,” Voelker said. 
NHDES observed that far more road salt was being used than was required to keep roads and sidewalks safe, she said. When the agency conducted a survey to trace all that salt to its source, they determined that about half of it was applied by contractors that perform winter maintenance at businesses and residential properties. 
In response, NHDES implemented the Voluntary Commercial Salt Applicator Certification Program, or “Green Snow Pro” initiative, which allows commercial applicators to train in safe, efficient salt application, become certified, and receive limited liability protection in return.
Later, the state extended this program to municipalities, another group that contributes significantly to the state’s road salt load.
Voelker said companies responded positively to the program, reporting cost savings and reduced salt usage to NHDES. During the winter of 2023-2024, 177 commercial companies participated, according to a presentation by Diers, Voelker, and NHDES Watershed Assistance Section Supervisor Stephen Landry. 
“Our commercial applicators … one or two years into the program, they come back and say, just by calibrating my equipment better and my crews being trained, we saved up to, like, 40% on our operating budget, because we’re not over-purchasing salt,” Landry said.
Still, salt is on the rise
Despite increasing commercial and municipal participation in the opt-in program, salt levels are continuing to rise in New Hampshire. In part, this is due to continuing development, including more parking lots, roads, and other paved areas that are destined for salt treatment in winter.
“We’re still seeing a lot of buildings being put up, lots of parking lots,” Voelker said. “… More roadways, more salt.” 
Another factor driving up salt levels across the state, said Voelker, are warming winters. It may be counterintuitive, Diers added, but more salt is needed when freeze-thaw cycles allow water to melt, then re-freeze, on traveled areas. 
“On the coldest winters, we apply the least salt,” he said, because “the point of salt application on roads is not to melt the ice. … It is to keep the ice from adhering to the pavement, so you can scrape it off with a plow.”
Municipalities also face funding constraints and high workforce turnover that challenge their ability to invest in salt-efficient equipment and retain individuals trained in safe salt application, Diers said. 
And this season’s drought has further exacerbated the issue, including, potentially, worsening the effects on wildlife, Diers said. As less water is available in the environment while salt levels remain constant, harmful ions become more concentrated. Data collected by NHDES and volunteers working across the state show concerning chloride levels in many waterways this fall, he said.
“This summer, the data has been alarming, to say the least, due to the drought and the concentrated conditions,” Landry said.
It’s not clear how long it takes for a “slug” of salt to wash through a system, Landry said, but often, the process can take years. This means that even once poor salt protocols — like storing salt outside and uncovered — are corrected, the effects will linger.
Routes to change
Andrea LaMoreaux, president and policy advocate at NHLAKES, said she, like the residents who have reached out to her with concerns about salinity, is concerned about the effect of increasing salt levels on New Hampshire’s waterways. 
LaMoreaux said New Hampshire could take steps to address the issue with more force by imposing stricter rules on salt storage and application in addition to the voluntary program.
“The last thing we want to do in New Hampshire is have to legislate something,” she said. “We’d rather people just hear what the right thing to do is, and then just voluntarily go ahead and do it. But we know that sometimes we do need rules and laws.”
NHLAKES was working with Merrimack Rep. Rosemarie Rung on a proposal for legislation to codify some of the existing “best practices” regarding salt storage, LaMoreaux said. As submitted, the proposal calls for NHDES to adopt outdoor road salt storage requirements and penalties for noncompliance, according to a preliminary version shared by Rung.
Diers declined to comment on the specific proposal, but expressed skepticism about the difficulty of enforcing salt regulations generally, especially regarding restrictions on the application of salt to roadways. 
“Most of the programs around the nation focus on incentives to reduce salt use … or training for municipalities,” he said in an email. “… Enforcement (who and how) is always the challenge with any regulatory approach.”
Diers and Voelker said they felt a culture change would be needed to address over-salting in the Northeast. Within the last few decades, Diers said, excess salt has become normalized in a way that has been difficult to overcome.
“People somehow, all of a sudden within the last couple of decades, expected sidewalks to crunch throughout the winter,” he said.
This might make walkers feel safer, but in fact it signals that far more salt has been applied than is useful, he continued. This is because salt must be dissolved in water to be useful against ice, meaning that chunks of rock salt are not actively preventing icing, according to Diers. But while fighting that expectation may prove an important part of reducing statewide salt levels, it presents a tall task for advocates.
“This doesn’t change by people getting trained or improving technology. It changes because people have a different expectation, and that’s what is really, really hard to get across to people: That you can be safe and use less salt,” he said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/salttruck-1024x656.jpg,,,2025-10-20 07:37:22.964745

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)As the federal shutdown continues, states have been forced to fall back on their own resources to spot disease outbreaks — just as respiratory illness season begins.
The shutdown has halted dashboards and expert analysis from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which monitors indicators such as wastewater to provide early warnings of the spread of COVID-19, influenza, RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) and other infectious diseases.
The pause leaves states with less early warning on disease outbreaks, potentially endangering lives even as child vaccination rates drop amid increased exemptions and hesitancy fed by misinformation. State and local officials can combat outbreaks with targeted advice to get vaccinated and stay home when sick, but they need to know where to do that first. And residents won’t know to take precautions if they’re unaware when many in their community are falling ill.
Wastewater is particularly crucial to finding outbreaks before people start seeking treatment, said Dr. John T. Brooks, a former chief medical officer for CDC’s Emergency COVID-19 Response who retired last year.
‘This shutdown feels different.’ States might not get repaid when government reopens.

“This is one more piece of information to each American citizen to inform their decision, like, ‘Do I want to get vaccinated, and is now the time?’” Brooks said. “It really helps protect Americans by identifying communities where you may need to ramp up, raise awareness, remind people about hygiene.”
Ericka McGowan, senior director for emerging infectious disease at the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, said the absence of CDC involvement “could be a problem if there’s some major issue [states] miss.” Generally, states and localities gather their own health information, but many rely on the CDC for analysis and public display.
Washington state’s wastewater surveillance program, for instance, uses the CDC’s dashboards to display information to the public. Now, only state officials can see the information, and they would have to rethink the system if the shutdown continues, McGowan said.
Caitlin Rivers, an associate professor at Johns Hopkins University who studies infectious disease outbreaks, checked all 50 states for shutdown-related data issues. In a Substack post, Rivers said the result of the shutdown is “DIY surveillance.”
Georgia had to pause its influenza report, which would normally start this month, because of missing CDC data. However, health officials are working on a version using only state information, said Nancy Nydam, a spokesperson for the Georgia Department of Public Health. Some hospitals report cases to the state and some directly to the CDC, so there will be some information gaps during the shutdown, she said.
Shutdown forces Medicare patients off popular telehealth and hospital-at-home programs

In the meantime, Georgia has its own data on emergency room visits showing cases of suspected COVID-19, flu and RSV declining between August and early October.
Georgia also has its own wastewater surveillance program, which provides early warning of diseases spreading in the population before confirmed cases show up in hospitals. But some states rely on CDC wastewater surveillance.
Michael Hoerger, an associate professor at Tulane University, had to pause his state-by-state wastewater reports on COVID-19 because of the lack of CDC wastewater data and an unrelated pause in data from a private wastewater reporting collective called Biobot, he said. Biobot did not respond to a request for comment.
“The pause means that we won’t have a good sense of which states are dealing with elevated transmission [of COVID-19] until the data come back online,” Hoerger said. “I can still post useful national estimates and forecasts, but that doesn’t really help with states that are outliers from what’s happening nationally.”
Hoerger’s Pandemic Mitigation Collaborative released a report in August on COVID-19 hot spots in California, and the highest state rates for COVID-19 in late September were in Connecticut, Delaware, Nevada and Utah.











We’re in a bit of a blackout at the moment in terms of real-time rigorous data.


– Michael Hoerger, associate professor at Tulane University



For the time being, all Hoerger can do is rely on past forecasts predicting about 499,000 new COVID-19 infections a day as of Oct. 13, the first time it’s been under 500,000 since July.
“We’re in a bit of a blackout at the moment in terms of real-time rigorous data,” Hoerger said. “Fortunately, at least nationally, we’re in a relative lull in transmission.”
Like Georgia, many states can monitor wastewater on their own to track COVID-19, flu, RSV and other diseases, according to a list compiled by Hoerger’s Pandemic Mitigation Collaborative.
Texas, for example, has not had trouble updating its data during the shutdown, health department spokesperson Chris Van Deusen said. “We do our own surveillance for most metrics,” he said. However, the state no longer gets information on new COVID-19 and RSV deaths from the federal government, he said.
Economists say job losses likely, even as shutdown delays report

North Carolina also gathers its own wastewater data and interprets it with help from the University of North Carolina and local health departments. Normally, the CDC would weigh in with its own guidance and post results on a national dashboard — actions that are paused in the shutdown, said Hannah Jones, a spokesperson for the state health department.
But even if they have their own wastewater data, other state and local health departments may rely on the CDC for analysis and guidance, said McGowan, of the state health officials group.
“Even if you collect the data, you still have to have someone who is an expert to analyze that data to give you some kind of result,” McGowan said. “A lot of localities don’t have that kind of expertise in house and they rely on the CDC for that type of technical expertise and guidance. So there’s a gap there.”
Rivers, the Johns Hopkins associate professor, wrote in her post that she sees “clouds on the horizon” in some states. There are more young children, who are most susceptible to RSV, visiting emergency rooms in Louisiana, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia, she wrote, and also more hospitalizations in Texas.

(Courtesy of CVS Health)New England is facing a worsening shortage of primary care providers, and the trend is accelerating at the exact moment demand is rising. Across the region, aging populations, provider retirements, and workforce burnout are converging to create a serious access problem. States across the region will need to pursue new models of care delivery if they hope to protect community health and prevent deeper strain on hospitals and public health systems.
The scale of the challenge is already measurable. With nearly 26% of Rhode Islanders aged 60 or older and a median age approaching 41, demand for care in the Ocean State is only going up. As a former Rhode Island state representative who worked on health care policy and a senior citizen myself, I am acutely aware of this conundrum. Yet physicians are retiring faster than they can be replaced, and there were recently more than 1,300 open nursing positions in Rhode Island alone. Similar patterns are emerging across New England and the country as a whole, where physician shortages are projected to reach double digits by 2035. 
Without strategic interventions, vulnerable populations will wait longer for appointments, and emergency rooms will face pressure to absorb routine cases. This is why emerging hybrid care partnerships deserve close attention. 
One promising model that has taken root in Massachusetts has seen CVS Health’s MinuteClinic partner with Mass General Brigham to expand access to primary care services in underserved areas. Rather than functioning as walk-in clinics alone, these sites are being integrated into a broader care network — allowing nurse practitioners and physician assistants to deliver routine exams, manage chronic conditions, and coordinate telehealth consults with physicians when needed. 
This approach reduces pressure on hospitals and traditional practices while making preventive care more accessible to patients who would otherwise delay treatment. It is also not without precedent as similar partnerships have already been piloted in nearly a dozen other states across the country.
In Georgia, for example, the Emory Healthcare Network has partnered with MinuteClinic across 35 locations statewide. The collaboration allows shared electronic health records and coordinated referrals, expanding appointment access with same-day and evening hours while preserving continuity of care. Similarly in North Carolina, Novant Health’s affiliation with MinuteClinic integrates medical records, has encouraged better medication adherence, and connects patients back to primary care physicians. These examples – all designed to relieve wait times and prevent unnecessary emergency room use – show that coordinated retail-clinic models can reinforce local health care systems rather than replace them.










Without strategic interventions, vulnerable populations will wait longer for appointments, and emergency rooms will face pressure to absorb routine cases. This is why emerging hybrid care partnerships deserve close attention. 


The Massachusetts partnership between CVS and Mass General Brigham could produce similar benefits. By embedding primary care capabilities within a retail footprint, the program increases the number of accessible entry points for preventive services. It also strengthens referral pathways by plugging walk-in care into established hospital and specialty systems. For patients navigating long wait times or disrupted continuity of care due to provider turnover, these hybrid access points can serve as stabilizers rather than stopgaps.  
The primary care crisis will not be solved by expanding residency slots alone or by waiting for medical school graduates to fill decades of vacancies. As such, our leaders should be proactive in seeking out models that meet patients where they are — through partnerships, telemedicine integration, community-based clinics, and retail health collaborations that have shown results elsewhere.
Massachusetts has provided a timely blueprint with the MinuteClinic–MGB collaboration that should be watched closely. For Rhode Island, the lesson is not to replicate it blindly, but to recognize the urgency of adopting solutions that expand capacity without sacrificing quality and if they are successful, emulate them. That means supporting nontraditional care sites and ensuring regulatory decisions do not choke off innovation. 
New England has long been a leader in health care innovation, but it also faces some of the steepest demographic and workforce headwinds in the country. Elected officials throughout the region should make every effort to lower health care costs and increase access. It is their duty to deliver that to their constituents and those that propose legislation that would have an opposite impact should think twice.
If policymakers stay focused on preserving access rather than unintentionally constraining it, Rhode Island can position itself to strengthen its health care infrastructure before workforce shortages become full-blown crises. The alternative — ignoring successful models and jeopardizing existing access points — is a risk the state can no longer afford.

The $1.09 billion number is higher than the estimated $1.05 billion the nonpartisan Ohio Legislative Service Commission predicted when it came to the scholarship programs. 
“The thing that we’re concerned about is it seems like the EdChoice voucher program is expanding and skyrocketing with the money that’s being poured into that program, and there aren’t nearly as many students in that program to warrant that kind of infusion of money,” Ohio Education Association President Jeff Wensing said. 
The five private school scholarship programs are the Autism Scholarship Program, the Jon Peterson Special Needs Scholarship Program, the Cleveland Scholarship, the Education Choice Scholarship and the Educational Choice Expansion Scholarship Program. 
Students on the autism spectrum are eligible to receive vouchers up to $32,445 for the Autism Scholarship Program. 
Students who have an Individualized Education Program (IEP) from their district are eligible for the Jon Peterson Special Needs Scholarship. 
The Cleveland Scholarship is for all students living in the boundaries of Cleveland Metropolitan School District. 
Students living in the boundaries of a low-performing school district are eligible for Education Choice scholarships. 
Lawmakers expanded the Education Choice-Expansion eligibility to 450% of the poverty line two years ago through the state budget — creating near-universal school vouchers. 
K-8 students can receive a $6,166 scholarship and high schoolers can receive a $8,408 scholarship in state funding under the expansion. 
For the EdChoice Expansion, there were 100,930 scholarships awarded averaging to $4,958 per participant, according to the ODEW data. 
There were 42,602 traditional EdChoice scholarships awarded for a total of $283.1 million — with an average of $6,808 per participant. 
There were 1,652,539 students attending Ohio schools during the 2024-25 school year and 1,465,041 of those students attended public schools (88%), according to ODEW data. 
There were 16,691 less Ohio students enrolled in public schools during the 2024-25 school year compared to 2023-24, according to ODEW data. 
Nonpublic Ohio schools had 181,244 students enrolled in fiscal year 2025 — a 4.6% increase compared to fiscal year 2024. 
Aaron Churchill, Ohio’s research director for the pro-voucher Thomas B. Fordham Institute, was not surprised the private school voucher programs surpassed one billion dollars.
“I think it was understood that it would come to that amount,” he said. 
Churchill expects the total private school voucher program dollar amounts to continue to increase the next couple of years before leveling off a bit. 
“I wouldn’t expect (the total private school voucher program dollar amount) to go up as significantly as it has in the past few years,” he said, adding that the goal of the program is to give Ohio parents the ability to choose where to send their kids for school.
Total payments for the five scholarship programs for the past five fiscal years, according to ODEW data: 

$970.7 million in fiscal year 2024 
$610.2 million in fiscal year 2023 
$554.5 million in fiscal year 2022
$444.5 million in fiscal year 2021
$394.2 million in fiscal year 2020

Remaining scholarships
For the Cleveland scholarship, there were 8,345 scholarships awarded for a total of $55.1 million — with an average of $6,835 per participant. 
There were 6,016 autism scholarships awarded for a total of $159.9 million — with an average of $29,110 per participant. 
For the Jon Peterson Scholarship, there were 8,680 scholarships awarded for a total of $103.9 million — with an average of $12,796 per participant.

State officials want to clone Jonah Richard, an Orange County native who’s building housing at a clip in the town where his family has lived for generations.

This story, by Report for America corps member Carly Berlin, was produced through a partnership between VTDigger and Vermont Public.

FAIRLEE – Not so long ago, Jonah Richard spent his days working for a white-collar consulting firm in New York City. Now, he fills his time bopping between construction sites in the corner of Vermont where he grew up. 
On a crisp fall morning, 34-year-old Richard checked in with his crew. They were putting the finishing touches on six apartments carved out of an old barn behind a general store in Fairlee, which has been in Richard’s family since the 19th century and is now owned by his cousins. To fit a bonus apartment in the basement, Richard’s crew had lifted up the barn where his uncle used to run an antique shop. 
“We jacked it up a little bit and then dug it out underneath, poured new foundation – and created extra living space,” Richard said, showing off the unit’s well-equipped kitchen and heat pump system.
This philosophy – trying to squeeze more housing into any possible nook and cranny in a building, and in a town – guides all of the projects that Richard takes on through his small construction company and development business.
“Everything we do is infill development. There’s no…sprawl and subdivisions,” he said. “Maximizing density is a lot of what we try and do.”
And maximizing density he’s doing. Through his dual enterprises – a small-scale development firm called Village Ventures, and two-year-old general contracting outfit Réal Hazen Construction – Richard’s teams have built nearly 20 homes and are in the planning stages for 45 more in Fairlee alone. The Upper Valley town, a summer tourism hub, has a year-round population of about 1,000 residents.

Richard’s work has grabbed the attention of state leaders who want to see more homebuilding concentrated in Vermont’s small towns and villages, where the odds can be stacked against developers: It often costs more to construct new homes than builders can expect to sell or rent them for, public funding streams that can fill that gap often prove complicated for small outfits to navigate, and a dearth of public infrastructure limits where housing can go.
Pair those issues with the community opposition that so often meets new housing projects, and more risk-averse souls would simply walk away. But Richard has surmounted many of those problems, and state officials are desperate to convince more people to follow his lead.
“We need and want a Jonah in every town,” said Alex Farrell, commissioner of Vermont’s Department of Housing and Community Development.
How it started
Richard was raised in nearby Corinth, the son of a luthier and a stained-glass restorer. He eschewed his parents’ artist lifestyle and left home to earn an Ivy League chemical engineering degree. After he pivoted into management consulting in New York, he began to use some of his income to purchase fixer-uppers in Newark, N.J. 
During the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, when his grandmother was looking to sell a vacant post office-turned-bank building in Fairlee’s village center, Richard saw an opportunity. He bought it for $100,000 and began dreaming up an eight-unit apartment building with retail on the ground floor. Some neighbors balked.
“There was some pushback – some pushback on the appearance of the building, some pushback on the density of the building,” said Chris Brimmer, Fairlee’s zoning administrator. But Richard managed to work through those reservations, Brimmer said; his personal roots in town likely helped gain trust with wary neighbors, too. “And holy cow, you know, within less than a year there was a three-story building on the site.”

Richard had minimal building know-how when this first Fairlee project kicked off. He waded through the permitting and financing and construction process, learning everything as he went. He showed up to the jobsite each day, apprenticing under a master carpenter he hired. His own sweat equity helped keep the cost of the project astoundingly low: around $170,000 per unit. State grants and energy-efficiency funds helped finance the project, along with Richard’s own investment and money from extended family. Rents range from about $1,000 to $1,600 for studios to one bedrooms.
Fairlee has loosened its zoning rules in recent years in an attempt to encourage more home construction, Brimmer said, and in 2019, town leaders set an ambitious target to add 100 housing units to the town within a decade. Like many rural towns, it struggled to retain staff because of its lack of housing options. 
Richard had thought he’d finish the apartment project and then “flip that experience” into a development job back in New York. But something about it scratched an itch: He liked reviving the town where he’d spent so many childhood summers, and where he’d since watched shops shutter and home prices rise. Plus the work felt less transactional, more relational. Many of the people Richard worked with on the building he knew from growing up, and have remained his business partners. Together, they’ve put a sizable dent in Fairlee’s overall housing need.

Chris Brimmer, Fairlee’s zoning administrator, speaks about Jonah Richard’s housing contributions to the town on Oct. 9, 2025.
“We’re lucky to have him here,” Brimmer said, of Richard. “I don’t think we would get this far along in meeting that goal if it were not for him having come back to town.”
How it’s going 
All along, Richard has sought to teach others what he’s learned. When he began working on that first apartment building in Fairlee, he launched a newsletter, called Brick + Mortar, to document his progress. He’s taken on more and more ambitious developments since the first, like an affordable housing project financed by federal tax credits that’s currently in the planning stages and a 22-unit development with ground floor space for businesses that recently scored town approval.
But he has not shied away from sharing his foibles, either. Richard has catalogued his challenges building out septic systems in Fairlee, which lacks a town sewer. He’s written about the time he got hit with a surprisingly huge tax bill after accepting an affordable housing grant for rehabilitating an apartment building in nearby Bradford – “a cautionary tale” for other would-be small-scale developers, he wrote.
“He’s not thinking of it as competition,” said Farrell, the housing commissioner, of Richard’s ethos. “He’s trying to say – here’s what I’ve learned. Go benefit from my mistakes and my successes. That’s so cool.”
The newsletter isn’t the only way Richard has tried to prompt others to get into the building game. He gave input to state officials as they crafted a textbook for small-scale developers to use across the state, called the Homes for All toolkit. Officials are now gearing up to use that resource for a forthcoming training series, Farrell said.
“We think this could actually be something that has a snowball effect in spinning off more and more developers, more people doing this,” Farrell said.

That’s Richard’s ultimate hope, too. Sometimes he gets calls from people on the opposite side of Vermont asking if he’s interested in taking on a project they’re eyeing. Part of him is flattered, he said.
“But also…you need to develop your own network of developers there that can tackle those projects. And it all comes down to somebody…one, having the time, and two, being willing to take that risk,” Richard said. “The best person to do that is somebody in the community that knows it inside and out.”
There are many easier ways to make money in development than building in this corner of the Upper Valley, Richard said. But for now, that’s where he plans to stay – living on the top floor of that first apartment building he built in Fairlee.

,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-10-20 09:00:00+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,Mass. faces grim reality of fewer international students,Jon Marcus,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/education/mass-faces-grim-reality-of-fewer-international-students/,"Massachusetts’s schools have recruited higher proportions of international students than colleges and universities almost anywhere else because of a demographic decline and the comparatively high cost of higher education here. But even before the second Trump administration, there were signs the bottom was falling out.","It was three months into the second presidential administration of Donald Trump when a small group of New England university administrators convened at a 1902 Beaux-Arts mansion owned by Boston University, just a few blocks from the main campus on an unobtrusive treelined side street in Brookline.
They filed into a high-ceilinged conference room in a one-time steel magnate’s estate turned events center, with huge picture windows overlooking the sleepy residential neighborhood. Representatives of the international student recruiting company that was hosting the meeting strategically positioned themselves at the entrances, handing out agendas.  
The peace and quiet were a stark contrast to the growing chaos in the broader world outside. Billions of dollars of federal research funding for many of the universities where these administrators worked was being cut, and investigations and sanctions were being fired at them by the Trump administration. Soon budgets would be slashed, programs shut down, and employees laid off. This day-long event was about a group that seemed to be facing yet another threat — one with equally grave implications for these schools and the larger Massachusetts economy: international students.
Just days earlier, masked agents had arrested a Tufts University doctoral student on a street in Somerville and whisked her to a detention center in Louisiana. Thousands of student visas were being revoked. International students already admitted to US universities faced a slowdown in appointments for required consular interviews and would soon be required to provide their social media histories. The administration would later try blocking Harvard from enrolling international students at all, limit the proportion other elite schools others could admit, restrict the time these students could stay in the country, and increase the cost of the follow-on visas many have historically used to remain and get jobs here.
A succession of speakers broached these topics at the conference, which was sponsored by the Norwegian international student recruiting company Keystone Education Group. Some triggered nervous laughter, and there were anxious whispers between sessions and over the buffet lunch, from which some attendees had to excuse themselves to take phone calls from colleagues helping international students worried they might also be detained or wouldn’t be allowed to return to the US if they went home for the summer. 
I’ve always worried about Massachusetts being a little too complacent about our position in the academic world. Massachusetts has a brand internationally, so some of these international students have just come to us because of who we are.Richard Freeland, Northeastern’s former president
The message of the gathering was grim. The seemingly ceaseless flow of international students so critical to Massachusetts universities and colleges would almost certainly slow — probably dramatically.
“You cannot pretend that students from X countries are going to be coming us in Y numbers anymore,” Vera Grek, director of graduate and international enrollment at Wentworth Institute of Technology, told the meeting.
That’s a $4 billion-a-year problem for Massachusetts alone, which ranks fourth among states  — after California, New York, and Texas  —  in the number of international students at its universities and colleges. More than 82,000 international students studied here last year, supporting an estimated 35,849 jobs.
But there was something else the officials in this room knew. The institutions that they represented largely had themselves to blame for becoming so financially dependent on international students. Many schools in Massachusetts recruited higher proportions of international students than colleges and universities almost anywhere else, federal data show, increasing their numbers year after year to help fill each successive class. That’s largely because of a demographic decline in the number of domestic students in the Northeast, and the comparatively high cost of higher education here, which makes it less appealing to American applicants from places in the country where the number of 18-year-olds is steady or rising.
While international students comprise less than 5 percent of total enrollment at US universities, they make up 35 percent at Northeastern University, 34 percent at Clark University and Babson College, 31 percent at MIT, 29 percent at Berklee College of Music, 27 percent at Brandeis University, and 26 percent at Harvard. Even onetime commuter schools like the Boston and Lowell campuses of the University of Massachusetts state system have hugely increased their number of international students. International graduate students in particular proved so lucrative that, on one Massachusetts campus — Northeastern — they had come to make up more than two-thirds of graduate enrollment.
Yet as international students became increasingly essential, there were signs that fewer of them were coming, even before the turmoil of Trump’s second term. Global demand for American higher education had already started slipping under pressure from geopolitical tensions, increased competition, and concerns among prospective applicants about cost and safety. Fewer of the international students who were still coming could afford to pay full tuition. While the United States is still where the largest proportion of international students end up, its lead has been eroding, Keystone data show, In the fall before Trump’s reelection, the number of international graduate students and new undergraduates had already started to decline, according to the Institute for International Education, or IIE, threatening Massachusetts colleges’ reliance on them.
“I’ve always worried about Massachusetts being a little too complacent about our position in the academic world,” says Richard Freeland, Northeastern’s former president, who was also state commissioner of higher education from 2009 to 2015. “Massachusetts has a brand internationally, so some of these international students have just come to us because of who we are.”
That complacency now presents a potential multibillion-dollar hit to the economy, if international student flows further decline, as projections suggest they will. The number of international students arriving in the United States in August, before the start of this semester, was down nearly 20 percent compared to the same period last year, new figures show. International students don’t only help universities balance their books and inject dollars into the local economy by patronizing restaurants, buying cars, and renting off-campus apartments. They also create research that fuels business, fill jobs in knowledge industries, and create their own startups.
“The calling card for the Massachusetts economy for decades has always been access to the best talent in the world. That’s our sweet spot,” says JD Chesloff, president and CEO of the Massachusetts Business Roundtable, an industry group. “People coming here to be educated and staying here has been a foundation of our innovation ecosystem for decades. You can’t help but appreciate how devastating that would be to our economy if they stopped coming.”

Massachusetts universities and colleges started doubling down on international student recruitment around 2011, when domestic enrollment began a long decline. Since then, the number of students overall has fallen by more than 14 percent, but the number of international undergraduates at Massachusetts colleges and universities jumped by about 20 percent, an analysis of federal data show. The number in graduate programs, which are big money makers for universities, nearly doubled.
University admissions offices employ designated international recruiters who spend months living out of suitcases as they travel across the globe to entice students. Some team up with schools that teach English to prospective applicants and with companies like Keystone, which works with 5,500 institutions in more than 190 countries. These recruiting agents generate leads from online inquiries and help students pick countries and schools, complete their applications, and find places to live. As an indication of how important international students have become, many universities pay commissions to these agents, according to the National Association of College Admissions Counselors.
However they recruit, there were plenty of signs, even before Trump, that it was becoming harder for US universities to enroll international students — especially those who could afford to pay full American tuition. Instead, the market has shifted away from China and the Middle East to students from Latin America, Southeast Asia, and Africa, where many need financial aid. This means less revenue than in the past for the US universities they choose.
“The countries where [cost] is not a hurdle are flattening,” Anne Corriveau, BU’s director of international admissions, told the meeting at the mansion.
In 2023, the last year for which the figures are available by country, the number of international students from China fell by four percent after years of increases, the IIE reports. Numbers were also down from other more affluent nations, including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, and Japan, and flat from Europe, but up from places in the world with less wealth, including Mexico, Bangladesh, Colombia, and Ghana.
Meanwhile, there has been intensifying competition from other countries — notably Canada, Australia, and the UK, which last year surpassed the United States as a preferred destination, according to a 2024 Keystone survey. Interest in Italy and Spain is also up. Schools in these countries charge less, on average, than colleges in the United States, and generally make it easier for international students to stay and work when they graduate. Far higher proportions of prospective international students also say they feel more welcome and safe in those places than the United States, another Keystone survey of more than 41,000 students worldwide found in April — though two-thirds said their biggest concern about going to college in the US was the cost.
How vulnerable US universities and colleges were to their reliance on international students was laid bare by the pandemic, federal data show; the number fell by 72 percent in calendar year 2020 alone. The greatest decline was in the Northeast, which saw a drop of nearly 20 percent. Even before Trump returned to office, more than 40 percent of student visa applications to the United States last year were denied under the Biden administration, up from 15 percent 10 years ago.
The impact on enrollment of the Trump administration’s visa revocations and research funding cuts will take time to know conclusively. NAFSA: Association of International Educators, which represents international education professionals worldwide, projects based on available State Department data that the number of international students will decline by 30 percent to 40 percent this year nationwide with an estimated $7 billion economic hit. The association’s numbers suggest the Massachusetts economy will lose nearly $620 million — more than any other state except for California and New York. (Other estimates are less dire, an indication of how hard it is to track this, and of mistrust in federal data.) Even before the election, however, the enrollment of international students declined in two key nationwide measures. The number in graduate programs dropped by 2 percent last fall, or more than 10,000 enrollees, according to IIE, after years of increases and in spite of pent-up demand that accumulated during Covid. The number of first-time international undergraduates also fell by 5 percent.
“We often think about year-to-year enrollment, and really that’s not where we can see change. It’s about the slow erosion of what America represents,” says Chris Glass, a professor of higher education at Boston College who studies international shifts. “There are actually concerning trends that have been happening for years.”
Massachusetts universities prefer not to talk about this. Northeastern, for example, did not respond to repeated requests to for an interview. Most of the international student administrators at that Brookline conference wouldn’t go on the record. Another school, Gordon College, gave a response that has become typical across higher education. It “decided to pause on providing comment due to the deep sensitivity surrounding international students and ongoing current events,” a spokeswoman wrote.
All of this comes at a time when university enrollment overall is projected to decline further starting next year, as the number of 18-year-old prospective first-year students plummets – a product of the low birth rates coming out of the 2008 Great Recession called the “demographic cliff.” US high school graduates have also started going to college at lower rates, questioning the return on the investment.

A mile and a half from the Wightman Mansion, where university officials huddled to discuss international student enrollment, the smell of Korean barbecue wafted through a neighborhood of boba tea cafes, dumpling dives, ramen shops, and restaurants that sell malatang, a particularly spicy kind of hot pot. Young people balancing book bags and backpacks pedaled on Blue Bikes past storefronts advertising rental apartments. Others fidgeted with their phones while waiting for the 57 bus to Boston University. This bustling enclave in the student-packed Allston neighborhood of Boston is increasingly embracing its identity as a reminder of home for some of the tens of thousands of students who pour into Massachusetts from around the globe to go to college.
Upstairs at Stage Karaoke, a sleek space hung with video screens, LED lights, and lyrics projected in various languages, owner Alex Vichienrat says international students make up most of his business. Private, soundproofed VIP rooms encircle a communal main stage, where karaoke brings cultures together. “This is our melting pot space,” Vichienrat said. Without international students, he added, “this entire neighborhood would be gone.”
These more nuanced contributions of international students are often celebrated by advocates of international education. They’re also easy to see, in places such as Allston.
International students broaden the experience on campuses for everyone, says Max Page, president of the Massachusetts Teachers Association, which represents public college and university faculty and staff.
“This is an increasingly interconnected, global world. We want to train our young people to understand the rest of the world,” Page says. Without international students, “you don’t get exposed to other people and their ideas and it can breed a narrowness of thinking. That would be a real loss, if that kind of thing was to stop.”
The calling card for the Massachusetts economy for decades has always been access to the best talent in the world. That’s our sweet spot. People coming here to be educated and staying here has been a foundation of our innovation ecosystem for decades. You can’t help but appreciate how devastating that would be to our economy if they stopped coming.JD Chesloff, president and CEO of the Massachusetts Business Roundtable
Less evident are the long-term economic implications of what could happen here if international students stop coming. 
The preponderance of international students in graduate programs isn’t entirely because of universities trying to meet revenue targets. It’s also because Americans are comparatively less well prepared for science, technology, and other fields. US students score lower than those in 36 other countries in math on the Program for International Student Assessment, a test  that measures how well 15-year-olds can solve real-life challenges using skills they’ve learned. Only one in five college-bound American high school students is equipped to pursue a major in science, technology, engineering, or math, the National Science and Technology Council has found.
International students now earn nearly two-thirds of all master’s degrees from US universities in computer science and more than half in engineering. Two-thirds of graduate students in artificial intelligence at American universities are foreign born.
This portends another grim scenario for Massachusetts if the slide continues or accelerates in the number of international student numbers already under way: There will be fewer of them to work in or help start businesses in increasingly competitive industries. More foreign-born than native-born residents in Massachusetts have graduate degrees, and nearly three in 10 workers here in science, technology, engineering, or math come from other countries, according to the American Immigration Council, a nonpartisan nonprofit that supports immigration.

One bright spot — for US universities, if not for students — is that competing destinations have begun to impose their own restrictions. Canada has tightened international student caps. In Australia, the government failed in a proposal to put a limit on international students last year. But it increased visa fees and slowed down processing times. While the UK has a goal of increasing the number of international students, it has restricted most of them from bringing dependents, required them to prove they have enough money to support themselves, and banned them from working until they finish their degrees.
Massachusetts could have an edge with international students who still want to come to the United States but to a place more outwardly accepting of migrants, some experts say. That’s been a concerted approach at BU, for instance, Corriveau said at the April conference in Brookline. “I used to try to sell the US in general, and now I focus more locally,” she said. “I think it’s more important that students understand what it means to be in Boston.” BU even produced a video for prospective international students acknowledging “recent events” but promoting Boston as “remarkably diverse and inclusive.”
Many international students in Massachusetts stuck around for the summer, instead of going home, out of fear they might not be allowed to re-enter the country, university administrators say. Schools including Wentworth helped find them houses and summer jobs, Grek said at the BU meeting. UMass Amherst set up a fund to help them. Bunker Hill Community College canceled summer study abroad programs out of fear that international students wouldn’t be allowed to come back.
Over the longer term, however, the state’s strength in attracting international students makes it more vulnerable than other places in the United States to a continued decline in the number of them, says Chris Slatter, Boston-based managing director at the education consulting firm Huron.
“They rent apartments, they spend in local businesses, they support innovation through research, and in many cases they contribute to the workforce,” Slatter says. “International students are the cornerstone of both institutional strategy and regional economic vitality in Massachusetts.”
If they don’t keep coming, “and, when appropriate stay, and work here, what we’d have is a different economy,” says Tom Dretler, CEO of the Boston-based international student recruitment company Shorelight. “We would be a poorer state.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/intlstudentBU-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C744&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-20 07:37:22.964745

Ohio Republicans have recently ramped up a push to make cryptocurrency more mainstream, coinciding with specific GOP leaders’ wishes.
Mining for new topics to make policy on, many Ohio politicians think they struck gold.
“We chose to lead instead of follow,” Ohio Treasurer Robert Sprague said in an interview.
Numerous bills have been introduced to make crypto more accessible, with lawmakers eventually wanting Ohioans to be able to pay their taxes with it.
These online “coins” are stored in a digital database known as a blockchain. Like stocks, they can be traded and sold. One Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, fluctuates and is worth about $108,000 as of Thursday.
Ohio Senate Bill 57 would create a Bitcoin reserve fund, allowing Ohioans to pay taxes and fees in Bitcoin. It would also allow residents to donate Bitcoin to the fund.
Ohio House Bill 116 would ensure that crypto owners can use their digital assets to pay for goods and services, as well as protect the currency from certain taxes.
Ohio House Bill 18 would allow the treasurer to invest in “high-value digital assets” in the general or reserve fund.
Ohio House Bill 426 puts regulations in place for “abandoned” currency.
Although digital currency bills were introduced in the last general assembly, the two main pieces of legislation were introduced in late 2024.
Sprague has been a leading voice in the crypto push. Just recently, the treasurer allowed state agencies to soon start collecting payments in digital coins.
“The world is moving rapidly toward digital payments, and we don’t want the state of Ohio to be left behind,” Sprague said.
It’s actually a topic that is bringing the top House Republican and Democratic leaders together.
“I think these kinds of risky things, we need to have a long, hard look at… I’m still scratching my head over cryptocurrency,” House Speaker Matt Huffman, R-Lima, said.






Both Huffman and Minority Leader Dani Isaacsohn, D-Cincinnati, raised red flags. Crypto spikes and falls rapidly, and bitcoin payments can be hard to calculate.






“We have to be very careful with the crypto industry,” Isaacsohn said. “We’ve seen a lot of abuse; Because of a lack of oversight, we’ve seen a lot of people losing their livelihoods.”
In 2024, the FBI reported $9.3 billion in losses due to cryptocurrency cybercrime.
When I asked the treasurer about possible fraud, Sprague said that the state system would immediately change the currency format once submitted. This is a thorough plan that has taken months to evaluate, he said.
But at one point, the process wasn’t as transparent.
In 2018, WEWS spoke with a Cleveland car salesman named Bernie Moreno — now Ohio’s U.S. senator — who advocated back then for the state to move on this emerging tech.
“By adopting a technology first, and being a leader, you really get an advantage in technology,” Moreno said.
At the time, Moreno became the first person, not only in Ohio, but in the U.S., to pay his taxes with crypto when the state became the first in the country to accept digital currency as payment.
In WEWS’ video of Moreno submitting his payment, then-Treasurer Josh Mandel stood beside him.
Mandel decided in 2018 that Ohioans could pay their taxes in crypto.
Within a year, the program was suspended because Attorney General Dave Yost issued an opinion that Mandel didn’t follow correct protocol in setting up the system.
For the years following, policy remained stagnant, and crypto was mainly ignored by the legislative leaders.
“I don’t know that it is a good idea,” Huffman said. “(A crypto bill) is not a priority.”
Both the House leaders continue to say there is more important policy to tackle — property taxes, education and the cost of living.
Asked who is asking for these changes, and if this should be the focus of the treasurer’s office and lawmakers right now, Sprague pointed to economic uncertainty.
“Actually, I think it’s really important because if we do dip into a recession, we want to be one of the states that is the most advanced,” the treasurer responded.
Businesses have been expressing more interest in crypto, he said, so Ohio accepting the coins could help boost the economy.
Timing
The Trump administration continues to push cryptocurrency, as the president’s own coin and his family’s companies have earned $1 billion from the digital asset.
But another high-profile politician is outspoken in his support.
“Bitcoin and what it represents, more than as a financial asset, also helps fill that void, fill that hunger for a symbol, a reminder of what American greatness was all about,” Vivek Ramaswamy said while speaking at the Bitcoin Policy Institute in March.
Ramaswamy, the GOP-endorsed candidate in the 2026 governor’s race, had long been an advocate for digital currency.
Sprague was asked about his potential as Ramaswamy’s lieutenant governor pick, given his work on the cryptocurrency issue.
“I don’t know about that,” he responded. “But I can say this: I think Vivek is a bold innovator, and he’s looking at the future of the state.”
Strategists believe Sprague is on the shortlist for Ramaswamy’s second in command.
Outside of his official role in government, the treasurer is running for secretary of state. He just announced that he would be the first candidate for a statewide seat to accept crypto.
“We want to be current and we want people to be able to participate in their political campaigns using all the new technology,” Sprague said.
He clarified that the cryptocurrency vendor chosen for state payments is not the same as the one chosen for his campaign.
“Is there any reasoning with crypto being harder to track?” we asked him.
“The way that we’re doing it is we would accept the crypto — we obviously have reporting requirements — we’re actually gonna convert it into United States dollars, and it’ll be put in the campaign and we’ll report everything just like we normally do,” he said.
Sprague said he doesn’t own any digital assets; however, some other politicians pushing for it have confirmed they invest.

Stebbins was arrested in late September on charges of pandering child pornography, according to records at the Franklin County Clerk’s office.
Stebbins, 77, had represented many clients on Ohio’s death row, and supervised more-junior public defenders doing so.
According to a charging document, Stebbins in May transmitted images of a boy engaged in sexual activity. He was arrested in late September and posted bond on Sept. 25. 
His was one of 135 arrests as part of the Operation Next Door crackdown announced by Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost. Others were charged with compelling prostitution, seeking sex with a minor, or being “johns” seeking sex with a prostitute.

(Illustration by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)While I was off last week writing about Kansas journalists of the past, Kansas journalists of the present had a hell of a story drop in their laps.
Kansas Young Republican leaders were caught exchanging racist, homophobic and white supremacist messages through a group chat with others of their ilk throughout the nation. First reported by Politico, the messages included vice chairman William Hendrix using the words “n–ga” and “n–guh” and saying he admired an adjoining state’s GOP because “Missouri doesn’t like f–s.” Chairman Alex Dwyer used the racist code number “1488,” reacted with a happy face to another Young Republican saying he loved Hitler, and — somewhat perplexingly — wrote that “sex is gay.”
High-profile Kansas Republicans promptly denounced the two men, going out of their way to claim their words didn’t represent the party. Hendrix, who worked in Attorney General Kris Kobach’s office, was fired.
That’s all well and good. But was it enough? Does it actually address the dark clouds of hatred rolling across our state?
If you catch me on a good day, I might say yes. If you catch me on a particularly cranky day, I might say it doesn’t come close. So I wrote two versions of my take, and you can pick the one you prefer. Make sure to read through the end, though, because that’s where we figure out what’s actually happening.
 
The nice version
Kansas Republican leaders have shown that they have more courage and moral fortitude than U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance. 
In quickly and unequivocally denouncing the hate-filled messages from Kansas Young Republicans, party leaders have taken a painful but necessary step. A country with two main political parties can not allow one of them to become a haven for racism, misogyny, homophobia and Nazi sympathizers.
For his part, the vice president claimed last week that too much was made of the messages — that “kids do stupid things, especially young boys.” Never mind that the Young Republicans court those ages 18 to 40. His words might sound hypocritical, given that he just demanded mass punishments against those criticizing the late Charlie Kirk, but he was elected vice president, and you weren’t.
Thankfully, Kansas GOP bigwigs took a more honest and searching look. They even deactivated the state’s Young Republicans chapter. All those who spoke out — Kobach, state party chairwoman Danedri Herbert, Senate President Ty Masterson, former Gov. Jeff Colyer and insurance Commissioner Vicki Schmidt should be praised for understanding the seriousness of the moment and the necessity of acting quickly and decisively.
 
The mean version
Kansas GOP leaders have turned a blind eye to racism, homophobia and violent rhetoric for years.
Statements from prominent Republicans in the state have proclaimed that these shameful text messages don’t represent the party or what it stands for.
But as someone who has followed and covered Kansas politics for the last decade, I can tell you that these messages absolutely reflect a growing tendency within the party — especially the beliefs and rhetoric of younger staffers and activists.
Party leaders could have stepped in at any point to stop this problem. Kobach, Masterson and House Speaker Dan Hawkins could have said that while they might not support legislation protecting LGBTQ+ Kansas children, they believe that everyone should be treated with dignity and respect — including gay and trans folks. Instead, they strip fellow Kansans of life-saving medical care and persecute them through government agencies.
They could have actually forced Rep. Nick Hoheisel, R-Wichita, to face consequences after clashing with a Rep. Ford Carr, D-Wichita, on the House floor. They could have condemned actions by Reps. Patrick Penn, R-Wichita, and Kyler Sweely, R-Hutchinson, after they joked about shooting former Hutchinson Rep. Jason Probst. They could have cautioned Rep. Kristey Williams, R-Augusta, that focusing on the hurt feelings of “a little white girl” in learning about racism missed the point. They could have pushed back against transphobic rhetoric from former Rep. Cheryl Helmer, R-Mulvane. They could have condemned racist incidents faced by Rep. Rui Xu, D-Westwood. The GOP-supermajority House couldn’t even bring itself to oppose racism while passing a bill declaring antisemitism against the public policy of Kansas.
For that matter, party leaders could made it clear that they didn’t want to associate with Kobach after accusations that he employed white nationalists. 
But here we are. We’ve lived through years of willful blindness to shameful bias. Kansas GOP leaders were more than happy to continue paying these folks’ salaries and allowing them to serve in government. Until last week, no one paid much of a penalty for racism, homophobia or violent rhetoric. (At least if that person was a Republican. Democrats who point this out can face dire consequences.)
The only reason bigwigs blinked this time was that a story appeared in a national outlet and included clear proof of these activists’ words. That’s it. Other reporting — like the multiple instances I’ve just mentioned — are dismissed as distractions at best and partisan attacks at worst.
Meanwhile, the Kansas Republican Party has leaned into racist trolling during the government shutdown. In social media posts, they put Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly in a sombrero and Department for Children and Families secretary Laura Howard in a Mexican wresting mask. Maybe you find the images funny, maybe you don’t, but I’m not sure how you can square them with Herbert’s claim that “we strive to eliminate racism and we condemn all racist acts and groups.”
Democrats have run people who say terrible things too. The Kansas party has faced its own internal strife. Partisans can lob “whatabouts” until their arms get tired.
But this story is about the Kansas Republican Party and its leaders. Until they clean house and turn their backs on years of winking and nodding at the worst among us, they have no standing to lecture anyone else about morality or good judgment. They have proved that they lack both.
 
The other version
I’m afraid that neither of the preceding versions of this column cover everything. As I thought about the situation more, I came to a conclusion that’s neither nice nor mean.
Kansas Republican leaders have nothing to lose by cutting young idiots loose. The ongoing GOP project in Kansas has one goal, and one goal alone: lowering tax rates for the obscenely wealthy and reducing restrictions on their businesses.
Any other controversy or infighting distracts from those goals.
People like William Hendrix and Alex Dwyer might have seen themselves as important to the state party and its future. Instead, they were pawns being used by entrenched oligarchs to further cement their power in the Sunflower State. The instant that these men became a liability for the state party, they were excommunicated. Masterson went out of his way to “categorically deny any association” with either.
The big-money interests who want to turn Kansas into a zero-tax paradise read the big national newspapers and websites. They don’t want to be embarrassed. A splashy story from Politico threatens their goals in a way that local news stories don’t.
Put succinctly, they can live with racism until it harms their larger project. Then, all those poor suckers who ironically embraced Hitler find themselves on the street.
In Kansas, like a casino, the owner always wins.

For uninsured, low-income, and vulnerable patients in our state who require these treatments to manage their health, federal programs designed to close gaps in access and affordability exist. Yet, many eligible providers in Ohio abuse the country’s largest safety net program.
The 340B Drug Pricing Program allows hospitals serving significant numbers of low-income, uninsured, and vulnerable patients to purchase outpatient drugs at significant discounts from manufacturers.
The goal of the program was to ensure that 340B hospitals reinvest the savings from drug discounts into providing affordable care for those individuals.
However, no such condition in the 340B statute requires participating hospitals to invest these savings in any designated way.
Put simply, 340B savings become 340B hospital profits.
Ohio-based hospital chain said to profiteer from massive charity-care program

Across Ohio, eligible 340B covered entities, hospitals, and clinics authorized to purchase discounted drugs under the federal 340B program reap massive profits without passing savings on to patients.
Providers then turn the equation around and receive higher reimbursements than independent practices like ours, costing Ohio employers, taxpayers, and patients millions more in health care costs.
The Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee found that, from April 2020 to June 2023, Cleveland Clinic generated nearly $1 billion in 340B profits while contributing less than 2% of their revenue towards charity care.
This widespread misuse of the 340B program has resulted in patients being left behind.
Instead of using its savings to expand access for the low-income and uninsured, many hospitals limit in-house infusion services to full paying, privately insured patients, whom the program was not designed for — redirecting those needing financial assistance to clinics like ours, which do not receive 340B discounts and operate with fewer resources.
Ohio’s Cleveland Clinic faces questions over booming subsidies

Despite receiving steep discounts, Ohio 340B hospitals provide less of their operating expenses towards charity care than the national average.
In addition to failing vulnerable patients, misuse of 340B has allowed large health systems to expand their market power.
Today, 340B pads Ohio’s largest health systems’ bottom lines, squeezing out smaller practices and limiting patient options for care.

Despite ongoing calls for federal action aimed at improving transparency and accountability in the federal 340B program, Ohio lawmakers introduced legislation that would enable hospitals to continue exploiting this safety-net program at the expense of patients.
For example, at the Ohio Statehouse, HB 588 and SB 269 would allow covered entities, contract pharmacies, and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) to continue generating unchecked 340B profits through a program with little oversight and transparency guardrails.
Our state lawmakers have a responsibility to protect Ohio’s most vulnerable patients, and advancing these bills does exactly the opposite.
The data paints a clear picture: 340B fails to serve Ohio’s most vulnerable patients.
Helping patients access and afford their treatments is part of my passion and why I do what I do, but 340B hospitals need to do their part.
The lack of effective guardrails enables large health systems to exploit the 340B program as a cash cow rather than a safety net, squeezing out independent providers like me and raising patient costs.
Policymakers should fight for regulations that restore the program to its original intent — protecting Ohio’s most vulnerable patients.

(Photo by Elaine S. Povich, Stateline)After years of declining test scores, the Maine Department of Education is introducing a plan to bolster math and literacy skills statewide.
The department is taking a more hands-on approach than it has before, from helping districts identify evidence-based teaching materials and offering professional development for teachers to including families in learning plans. 
While it can’t mandate that districts use the plans developed by expert advisory councils to promote better instruction, teachers and schools across Maine have been looking for guidance, and would benefit from the support the department is now offering, according to several education experts that spoke with Maine Morning Star. 
Maine students in 2024 had the lowest test scores in three decades in both reading and math, according to data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP, pronounced nape), which is administered by the U.S. Department of Education. Although national assessments only offer a snapshot into student achievement, some members of the Maine Legislature and several education experts expressed concerns about the consistent decline in learning outcomes. 
While the department said the work to strengthen math and reading instruction was already underway, the poor test results underscored the importance and timeliness of offering districts additional support, according to Beth Lambert, the department’s chief teaching and learning officer.
“The national assessment results definitely reinforced what we already knew: too many students are struggling with these core skills,” Lambert said. 
The department is hoping this effort will provide more sustained support that will turn the tide, she said, versus a quick response that “fizzles out.” 
Over the past few months, the department formed councils led by school leaders and curriculum experts from across the state to develop plans to improve literacy and numeracy. The plans, which are now public, outline what the department will prioritize. The literacy plan is focused on using learning materials proven to help students read better, while the math plan aims to incorporate the subject more ubiquitously and remove some of the common student fears associated with it. Both plans focus heavily on teacher training and ongoing support. 
The department will start by internally training staff to be coaches sent to districts for curriculum support and professional development, Lambert said. The feedback has already been positive, with many districts asking for resources like these to help them develop better methods to teach literacy and math, she said. 
Maine students score lowest in three decades on nation’s report card

“I feel very hopeful and reassured by the department’s announcement,” said Janet Fairman, a University of Maine professor and co-director of the Maine Education Policy Research Institute (MEPRI,) which conducts legislative research. “That is exactly what’s needed, and I think educators in schools will welcome it.”
Both plans also address some gaps in support that educational experts and district leaders have pointed to as potential reasons for consistently falling scores. Some reasons students weren’t doing as well included the likely failure of schools to use evidence-based literacy and math programs; changing state-level assessments, which resulted in an unclear picture of academic performance over a period of time; and Maine’s strong prioritization of local control, which means the state doesn’t intervene enough, leaving it up to districts to figure out their own academic recovery strategies. 
Evidence-based literacy
A 2023 Maine Education Policy Research Institute report found that the literacy programs used by schools vary widely, and aren’t always evidence-based.
The two most common reading programs Maine teachers were relying on in elementary grades did not meet quality standards, according to EdReports, a national nonprofit that studies and reviews instructional materials that was cited in the report.
Only 20% of administrators who responded to the research institute’s survey were using programs that met the EdReports quality requirements, which are based on the widely accepted Common Core standards.
Fairman, one of the report authors, said that’s because some districts did not have any specified reading curricula, and teachers aren’t sure what to use so they go online, ask their colleagues for ideas and materials, and rarely find resources that align with what’s been proven best for literacy. That’s one of the big reasons why reading scores have not been improving, particularly since the pandemic, Fairman said.
Now, the department plans to align all literacy plans with the science of reading, a vast body of research into what works when teaching students to read. The literacy plan also includes ensuring teacher preparation programs align their reading courses with evidence-based practices and make sure incoming teacher candidates complete a dedicated reading methods course.
The teacher training aspect is critical to improving reading outcomes, according to Sara Flanagan, an associate professor within the University of Southern Maine’s College of Education and Human Development.
Flanagan said professional development is “a critical part of the literacy plan so that teachers receive guidance and feedback on their instruction, and access to training to help implement and evaluate instruction in a way that aligns to evidence-based practices.” 
Research has shown that when teachers have the preparation and support they need to deliver effective reading instruction, their students are more likely to also have positive gains in reading, Flanagan said.
Incorporating math into all instruction
Renita Ward-Downer, director of instruction at the Brewer School Department and a member of the math advisory council, said the new numeracy plan she helped design is focused on building children’s confidence in math at an early age, integrating numeracy into everyday life, and addressing the negative attitudes towards math.
“Our big push is to really think about how we can get it out there that everybody has to do math every day,” she said.“Math has such a negative connotation, but it is all around us. This is about building the culture of thinking in that mathematical format.”
That will start by introducing math into other subjects, particularly at the elementary level, and training elementary school teachers accordingly, Ward-Downer said. The Brewer School Department is already partnering with the Maine Center for Research in STEM Education (called the Rise Center) within the University of Maine to train teachers to adopt that approach this year, she said. She noted that professional development in math is not as widespread as it is for literacy.










Math has such a negative connotation, but it is all around us. This is about building the culture of thinking in that mathematical format.


– Renita Ward-Downer, Brewer School Department


The plan is also focused on demonstrating to students how math can be used in the real world, which will include close partnerships with the career and technical education centers.
“For example, you’re pulling in that construction person and talking about how they’re using math every day to build a house or build a deck,” Ward-Downer said.
At the end of this year, Brewer schools will survey teachers, students and families about their relationship with math to gauge whether they see themselves as problem solvers or mathematical thinkers as a result of the more integrated curriculum, and use the results to adjust instruction and professional development accordingly, she said.
Legislative support
Earlier this year, during a meeting of the Maine Legislature’s Education and Cultural Affairs Committee,, Republicans and Democrats expressed their disappointment in the national test scores and told Maine Department of Education representatives that their response was “not sufficient.”
“I’m very, very unhappy,” Rep. Holly Sargent (D-York) said during the meeting.
Three members of the committee told the Maine Morning Star hey’re encouraged by the department’s new initiatives.
“Student success depends on so many factors, including family life outside of the classroom, and improving student performance requires a comprehensive approach,” said committee co-chair Rep. Kelly Murphy (D-Scarborough).
“Focusing on evidence-based practices in reading and math and providing teachers with better access to high-quality instructional resources will have a positive impact on students throughout Maine.”
Pointing to the $10 million in literacy grants the DOE awarded to districts last year, Rep. Mike Brennan (D-Portland) said the reading and math plans are “the next step,” but added that there still needs to be accountability to ensure that the curricular support and teacher training is working.
“What I’m going to be looking for and talking DOE about is some further ways that we can measure outcomes and see if some of the training that we’re doing is effective with teachers,” he said. “Ultimately, we want to be able to monitor pretty closely how well students are doing and increase proficiency in both math and reading.”
The national test scores aren’t the best way to measure proficiency, Brennan pointed out, but since Maine has changed its state assessment system frequently over the last decade, it is not yet clear how the state will determine how successful these initiatives are.
Republican Rep. Barbara Bagshaw from Windham partly credited the Trump administration’s focus on “traditional academic learning” and Maine’s compliance with federal executive orders for the learning plans.
“For years, Republicans have been calling on the DOE and the Mills administration to focus on the basics in order to boost student achievement, so this represents a positive step in that direction,” she said. “I can’t help but think that federal support for children’s wellbeing is helping bring this about.”
Brennan disagreed, saying this is the culmination of work the department and the Legislature started five years ago.
While the department is using “back to basics” to describe the initiative, which is a phrase used nationwide by some Republican leaders to signal a shift from social emotional learning to more traditional education, both Brennan and the department emphasized that the label refers to a renewed focus on core learning principles, not a move away from the additional supports schools have added for students over the recent years.
“When we talk about ‘back to basics,’ we’re really talking about going back to what research shows us works, which is explicit and systematic instruction and reading and math,” Lambert said.
“It’s not a shifting of resources or moving of priorities.”

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)I spent some time Saturday among a couple thousand or so who gathered at the Nebraska State Capitol for the No Kings rally. 
As a journalist, a big part of being at Lincoln’s version of No Kings (one of 15 across Nebraska) — as it is with any similarly-situated event — was to see the numbers, measure the vibe and determine what, if anything, was new or newsy. 
To wit: While the enterprise was peaceful, people did express their considerable displeasure and growing frustration with the country’s current leadership. Call it good trouble with a joyful noise of cheers, chants and a chorus of supportive car horns along Capitol Parkway.
Much of that sentiment was displayed on hundreds of fierce, funny signs, some pointed — and a few profane — but each adding to an undercurrent of commitment that permeated the proceedings. Prominent, too, as was the case in June’s No Kings event, as was the presence of the American flag. Just saying.
While I was there to exercise my rights associated with the press — a Constitutional guarantee under siege in some cities — I also happily exercised my right to be part of a peaceable assembly attempting to petition the government to stop with all its illiberal nonsense. 
One could also argue the signs and voices of thousands fell within the confines of their speech rights, which meant had I fallen to my knees in an unencumbered prayer of my choosing, or intentionally refrained from doing so, I could have made a clean sweep of exercising the First Amendment’s quintet of liberties.
I mention those democratic principles on which we conduct (or are at least supposed to conduct) civic and political discourse, because before the rally, some of official Washington sounded as though the nation was about to be overrun by conquering hordes of subversives, desperadoes bent on destroying all we hold dear. 
Normally, one might attribute such hyperbole (the details of which you’ll find in the next two paragraphs) to political puffery, simple blather or plain gasbaggery. But, as you’ve noticed, we no longer live in normal times.
For the record: I neither hate my country nor support Hamas, ideas trafficked by some Republican leaders such as House Speaker Mike Johnson, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise and House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, who went as far as to declare our Lincoln assembly a “terrorist” event. 
While I read no specific comment from Nebraska’s congressional delegation on No Kings events, there is unfortunately more: I am not a Marxist, the appellation I might have trouble defining in terms relevant to modern politics but one Johnson used to describe the millions in the streets on Saturday. I am, however, an unrepentant fan of the Constitution and its principles. 
Oh, and that whole antifa boogeyman shtick, the one Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy used to insist No Kings participants were members? Turns out antifa, as in anti-fascism, is an idea, not an organization of which people can become a member like the YMCA or Young Republicans. Go figure.
Finally, in response to one more charge of those trying to diminish the impact of a gathering of millions of Americans to express their unhappiness with the current administration, no one, including oft-cited bogeyman George Soros, paid me, offered to pay me or even handed me a coupon for a free sub sandwich or discounted car wash for my attendance.
That about covers everything from the let’s-just-make-it-up-and-see-what-happens crowd. To the obvious chagrin of many, the No Kings assemblage was also a diverse lot, a constituency of colors, genders, ages and abilities. The group’s individuals were clearly equal in their rally status, too. 
They were eager to include and encourage friends and strangers alike. All of which meant that if Lincoln’s No Kings rally was a government agency, it would have been unceremoniously closed, lest its DEI energy infect the local body politic.
I saw no masked federal agents, but the faces and nametags of two local police officers riding by on bicycles were in full view. Sprinkled among the crowd were some counter-protestors, others touting personal causes and, I’m guessing, a few professional people watchers and assorted looky-loos there to enjoy the view. 
News reports peg the total number of people at No Kings events at 7 million, a couple million more than showed up in June. Despite the sophomoric, name-calling and lies about who was there and why, that’s a whole lot of dissent. Which, last I checked, is a hallmark of our democratic republic and the right and responsibility of citizens living in one.

Moneywise, WalletHub, Forbes, and Yahoo Finance reported recently that Florida is the second most distressed state in the union in terms of its residents’ debt obligations.
The state saw a 23% increase in the share of people with distressed bank accounts between 2024 and 2025, the data show. In addition, Florida holds the sixth-highest overall share of people with accounts in distress, at 7.3%.
“Measuring the share of residents in financial distress is a good way to take the pulse of a state and see whether people are generally thriving or having trouble making ends meet,” said Chip Lupo, a WalletHub analyst.
“When you combine data about people delaying payments with other metrics like bankruptcy filings and credit score changes, it paints a good picture of the overall economic trends of a state,” he added.
In human terms, this financial distress looks like a sharp increase in bankruptcy filings; residents with accounts in forbearance or deferred payments; America’s lowest average credit scores; and higher prices for groceries, rent, mortgages, gasoline, and health care.
Americans are struggling to pay their bills, even turning to credit to pay for essentials. A recent LendingTree survey found that one-quarter of buy-now-pay-later users have used these loans to buy groceries.
“The last few years have been a whirlwind for Americans’ finances, with inflation, fluctuating unemployment, public health crises and natural disasters making it hard for people across the country to pay their bills,” the WalletHub website says.
In the most recent presidential election, political pundits say, the electorate voted for Donald Trump because of their anxiety and deep frustration with the price of everything.
Electoral implications
According to Clare Goudreau of the Johns Hopkins Hub, “Rising costs were top of mind as voters cast their ballots in the 2024 presidential election. According to exit polls from CBS News, 75% of voters reported that inflation had caused moderate or severe hardship for them over the past year, with 45% saying they were worse off now than they were four years ago. During his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump vowed to end inflation and strengthen the economy.”
Trump’s promise has fallen flat as inflation has spiraled upwards since he assumed office in January. Corporate greed; Trump’s zig-zag, on-again-off-again tariff folly; and economic factors that most folks don’t understand continue to upend ordinary people’s lives.
A significant swath of Floridians are feeling considerable pain, caught in “working homelessness,” trying to cope with the affordable housing crisis, stagnant wages, medical debt, and student-loan and credit card debt. Meanwhile, wages and salaries fall far short of supporting families.
Meanwhile, economic data show that Florida’s economy ostensibly is strong, with a GDP of $1.76 trillion after years of explosive expansion. While the state is expected to continue outperforming the national average in GDP growth, the rate is expected to slow to more typical, sustainable levels in coming years.
This is not unlike the stock market, which has experienced heady growth for the last several years. The market closed the first half of 2025 at record highs, recovering from an April drop. Some analysts see potential for further gains. Experts see Big Tech, international stocks, and AI-related companies as potential areas of continued outperformance.
The downturn has already begun
But the wealth isn’t trickling down.
A Florida Realtors report notes that, as of mid-2025, a family of four in Florida needs an annual income of $217,651 to live “comfortably,” including savings and discretionary spending. This is significantly higher than the state’s median income.
As deleterious as these circumstances for Florida families, more danger lies ahead.
Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody’s Analytics, says the U.S. economy is standing on shaky ground and, for many states, the downturn has already begun. Twenty-two states and the District of Columbia are showing clear signs of recession, marked by economic weakness and job losses that are likely to continue. Another 13 states are “treading water,” he said.
Zandi told MarketWatch, “The economy is still not in recession, but the risks are very high. We’re on the precipice,” as quoted in the report. He warned that the overall U.S. economy is vulnerable and could be pushed into a contraction by even a modest shock.
Much of this weakness stems from economic policy, Zandi said. He noted that Trump’s tariffs on imported goods have created growing uncertainty, disrupted global supply chains, and forced companies to halt plans to expand. A lack of labor-force growth this year has also contributed to the slowdown, he said.
Their problems are driven largely by a mix of slowing immigration, increasing tariffs, and federal job cuts, Zandi argues.
Gov. Ron DeSantis and his MAGA cohort are distracted, however, consolidating political power at the expense of the populace, punishing their enemies and rewarding their friends, and leveraging state and federal funds to bully perceived enemies into compliance. Floridians must organize at the grass roots to fight back.
As the 2024 presidential election showed, in poll after poll, inflation was a major factor in how people voted; now, bubbling anger over the high cost of living can fuel the removal of incumbents.
Floridians concerned about the high cost of living must force government officials to spend more on healthcare, affordable housing, education, higher wages, and support of labor unions so that residents can gain higher incomes.
They have no choice.

Here is Part One.
In the face of current events, depolarizing our politics is imperative now more than ever. 


I attended Johnson & Wales University for culinary arts. I worked in kitchens 12 hours a day between class and my full-time job, and quickly became burnt out. This was at the height of the 2016 presidential campaign when I told myself, “There’s no way Donald Trump becomes President.”
Shortly after, I switched my major to political science. Since then, I have had countless political conversations turn into arguments. Some feel very silly in hindsight, such as when I argued with another student about whether college classes should require attendance. Others feel much more salient, such as my wife and I having different views on abortion.

David McGraw
After many political fights over the years, I knew something needed to change. So I contacted Braver Angels, an organization I was familiar with, but never truly engaged with. Integrating my experiences with what I learned from Braver Angels, the following skills are how I have better political conversations. Some of this advice may be self-evident, others more challenging, but trust the process.
Define your terms; not everyone means the same thing even if we use the same words. Do not go into a political conversation trying to change someone’s mind.  Lastly, we have more to learn from people we disagree with than those we agree with.
Toward the end of my Political Science degree study, I had the opportunity to spend a semester abroad in New Zealand. One of my roommates and I were up late one night, and politics came up. I do not remember the topic, but what stands out in my memory is that the conversation lasted three hours. Most of the conversation was spent in respectful disagreement until we approached the last hour. This is when I finally asked, “What do you mean when you say . . .” I finally realized that the past two hours had been spent talking around with each other because we had different definitions of the terms we were using. In fact, around 1 a.m., we decided to call it quits because we had actually agreed on the political topic the whole time, not having realized it.
Define your terms. My next principle for better political conversations is much more difficult: Do not try to change people’s minds.
What!? I know what you’re thinking, “Isn’t the point of talking to people about politics to change their minds?” Yes, it is, but how we change minds is more important. Many go into these conversations thinking, “If I just have the right argument, I can logic my opponent into a corner, then they’ll have to take my side! (insert corny maniacal laugh here)” People need to trust you have good intentions to be open to changing their minds. It goes without saying that we aren’t listening when we devote our mental energy to our rebuttal.
Right after college, I joined an AmeriCorps program called City Year.
As someone who believes a life well lived is done in service to others, helping at-risk youth succeed in their education seemed perfect for me. Behind the scenes, I encountered constant political disagreements with my coworkers. At first, we could remain cordial, hoping to convince each other to their side. As time passed, conversations became more tense until the worst of the arguments occurred about halfway through the school year. Looking back on my behavior, I was not listening to them. I thought I could logic my way to getting them on my side, but they did not trust that I had good intentions behind my political beliefs.
Like most of us, I have good intentions; none of the worst stereotypes levied against my side of the political spectrum apply to me. However, I did not earn their trust before expressing why I thought they were wrong. Changing people’s minds about a political position takes time. It stands to reason that few will keep an open mind to admitting they may have been wrong if they are not truly being listened to in the first place.
My frustration at City Year led me to act in ways that cost me friendships. So that your political differences don’t cost you yours, prioritize active listening, and seek to understand your conversation partner’s belief, not some caricature propagated by pundits you agree with. Develop a foundation of trust first, then make the case for your position.
This begs the question, why should we even want friendships across the aisle? After all, aren’t “those people” hateful or bigoted? Not as often as political pundits would have you think.
We have more to learn from those we disagree with than those we agree with. They fill the gaps in our knowledge and point to things we may never have considered. Only by rejecting homogeneous thinking can we gain the whole picture. As people become more geographically segregated by political beliefs, keeping and maintaining relationships across the aisle becomes increasingly tricky. This is where Braver Angels comes in. Many of their virtual events allow us to meet people we would normally never interact with.
I want a future with less political violence. Recently, we have seen quite a lot of it, between the assassination of Melissa Hortman, her husband, and Charlie Kirk. Political violence is unacceptable, no matter who the target, but it will continue if we allow our communication to break down. If you want to keep the conversation going, I hope to see you at a Braver Angels event soon!
Peace be with you.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-20 04:02:00+00:00,CT Mirror,The revenge of ‘elderly white hippies’,Viewpoints Contributor and Christine Palm,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/20/the-revenge-of-elderly-white-hippies/,"White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller dismissed the anti-Trump “No Kings” protesters as a bunch of “elderly white hippies.” Let's break that down.,","“We, the People” marched, shouted, sang, honked, hugged and high-fived in more than 2,600 cities and towns across the country on Saturday.
My husband, some friends and I chose to head to Old Saybrook, rather than Hartford, because a small local crowd has a different kind of visibility than does a large urban one. The GOP too often dismisses city protests because, you know, that’s where all the bad people are. Still, we were nearly 2,000 strong in Old Saybrook, a town nationally known more for Katharine Hepburn than anything else.
So, who, exactly, is protesting?
Recently, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller dismissed the anti-Trump “No Kings” protesters as a bunch of “elderly white hippies.” At that same Washington, D.C. press conference he also characterized the preponderance of protesters as “Communists” and “stupid.” And on several occasions, the Trump White House has characterized the resistance as “violent” and “dangerous.”
How accurate is Miller’s characterization? Let’s break it down.
Accusation No. 1: “Elderly.” Depends on where you live. Connecticut skews older (it’s the seventh oldest state, with 18 percent of its population over 65, and a median age of 41). Suburban towns historically skew older than do cities. So, yes, most of the folks I marched with Saturday had gray hair. However, in places where the median age is younger (around 38 in both New York City and Portland, Oregon, for example) the crowd was predominantly young.
And let’s pretend, for a moment, that all the protesters were old. So what? Many of us older folks are willing to take a hit to our reputations, even risking physical assault and arrest, if it means our children can remain safe, and our nation can survive this authoritarian takeover. I have a friend in her 80s who was arrested three times last summer protesting the fossil fuel industry. Stephen Miller, at the tender age of 40, probably can’t imagine being that brave.

And The Alliance for Retired Americans urged its members not to be offended by his remarks, saying, “Don’t let yourself think that he doesn’t understand the power of older Americans getting together and mobilizing.”
On to adjective No. 2: “White.”
Again, this gross characterization is only partially correct. People of color did, in fact, turn out. But the very question of their participation needs to be examined. More than 92 percent of Black women voted for Kamala Harris and Black women led the charge across the country in preserving voting rights against orchestrated voter suppression. Have they earned the right to kick back a bit? I think so.
And when ICE agents are clearly targeting Black and brown citizens, one cannot blame people of color for fearing the worst. While it’s too early for definitive demographic data on this weekend’s “No Kings” rallies, historically, Black and brown citizens have protested at disproportionately higher numbers than their slice of their overall population would indicate. 
In 2020, for example, a PEW Research Center survey reported that 17 percent of Blacks protested in race-related campaigns, while they composed just 14 percent of the general public. And 22 percent of people of Hispanic heritage protested in such rallies, despite making up just 19 percent of all American adults. In comparison, while white Americans make up nearly 64 percent of the population, fewer than 46 percent participated in a race-related protest.
Accusation No. 3: “Hippies.” Well, guilty as charged, if by “Hippy” Miller means someone who values peace over violence, justice over injustice, creativity over conformity, environmentalism over destruction of the planet, community over capitalist greed, and the best rock music of all time over whatever drivel plays in his poor tormented head.
No. 4, his broad umbrella of “Communists.” Well, many of the folks marching Saturday were U.S. Veterans. One of them, a Navy guy from Lyme named Pete Lang, said, “I’m here because I fought against everything that’s happening to our country.”
My friend Jane Cavanaugh of Deep River, whose husband is a veteran, unfurled the  enormous American flag given to her by the government upon the death of her father, who fought in WWII. While the White House insists there is a shadowy underground called “Antifa,” they are too stupid to (or deliberately obtuse) to acknowledge the 16 million men and women who served in WWII were the original Anti-Fascists.
And I imagine that the families of the 416,800 soldiers who died fighting the fascists are struggling to understand why those deaths have been officially disrespected by the U.S. government.
No. 5: “Violent and dangerous.” Um, when did we protestors go from “snowflakes,” “woke,” “cat ladies” and other monikers suggesting frailty, to, in Miller’s words, “a vast domestic terror movement?” If he’s afraid of people in frog costumes, a bunch of Portlanders riding nude on bicycles, and American-flag wavers singing “We Shall Overcome,” no wonder elderly white hippies are cause for concern.
Unfortunately for Donald Trump and his staff, once again, the facts don’t support their claim. Following the shooting of right-wing influencer Charlie Kirk, PBS did an analysis of political violence in America. They said, “Based on our own research and a review of related work, we can confidently say that most domestic terrorists in the U.S. are politically on the right, and right-wing attacks account for the vast majority of fatalities from domestic terrorism.”
Now, let’s look at “stupid.” From the ebulliently zany to the gravely dignified, I’ve met and talked with lots of protesters. I can’t think of one I’d characterize as stupid. Heartbroken? Yes. Indignant, fearful, and furious? Of course. But ignorant of the facts? Nope. Unaware of the fascist takeover and indifferent to the loss of our democracy? Not on your life.
Stephen Miller is a puffed-up little rooster who has forsworn his heritage in order to orchestrate the Trump regime’s anti-immigration stance. He wouldn’t be here had America not opened her Ellis Island gates to Wolf Glosser, Miller’s maternal great-great grandfather on January 7, 1903. Glosser was fleeing anti-semitic Russian pogroms, and followed a path not unlike that of many foreigners who emigrated to America. The difference is, the rest of us are proud of our ancestors, and many of us protest in their name. So while Miller has conveniently forgotten what he owes to immigration, we have not.
Finally, Miller is under the wrong impression that we “elderly white hippies” will “all need to go home and take a nap because  (we’re) all over 90 years old.”
We’ve lived through economic travails, assassinations, wars, illness and hardships he can’t even imagine. We’re not napping, we’re fighting back: loudly, proudly, and without end, for as long as it takes until Trump and his defenders are swept into the history books along all the other dupes and toadies who put the cult of personality over the Constitution.
No, we’re not napping, Stephen Miller. Our eyes are wide open, and we see you.

“People fought and died for us to have the rights we have,” 61-year-old Tracie Benner of Juniata County said outside the state Capitol in Harrisburg, where between 5,000 and 6,000 people gathered. “And now for Trump and the Supreme Court and the Congress to just throw it away, we won’t stand for that.”

Since taking office in January, Trump’s government has slashed federal agencies and congressionally approved funding, indicted political foes and massively ramped up indiscriminate immigration law enforcement. And with a conservative U.S. Supreme Court majority secured by Trump’s three first-term appointments, the high court has repeatedly allowed administration policies to move forward through its shadow docket.

“If you ever look around and think, ‘Am I going mad? Is this really happening?’ You’re not crazy. You’re not alone,” said Justin Douglas, a pastor and Democratic Dauphin County Commissioner at a rally Saturday afternoon in Hershey. “We need moments like this right here where we’re out of social media, we’re in the real world, we’re standing in a park together in our community.”
Similar demonstrations were held in Pittsburgh, State College, the Lehigh Valley and deep red Butler County as part of the national No Kings movement, organized by a coalition of civil rights groups that claimed 7 million people participated nationwide.
An estimated 20,000 people gathered at Philadelphia’s City Hall and marched a mile on Market Street to Independence Hall, where the nation’s foundational documents were drafted, debated and adopted by delegates from the 13 original states. 
Speakers included three of the Philadelphia region’s Democratic U.S. Reps. Brendan Boyle, Madeleine Dean and Mary Gay Scanlon; District Attorney Larry Krasner; and Democratic state Sen. Vincent Hughes.
On the Montgomery County Courthouse steps, protest leaders in Revolutionary War garb read passages from the Declaration of Independence and listed what they said are the Trump administration’s violations of the U.S. Constitution.
“Americans like their freedom,” Stephanie Vincent, a lead organizer of Community Change for Montgomery County, said. “It’s just getting to the point where people really need to know that they need to come out and stand up against it.”

Many of the estimated 1,500 people who filled the courthouse plaza in Norristown, seat of the commonwealth’s third-most populous county, were protesting for the first time, Vincent said. 
“A big part of these kinds of protests is just people realizing that they’re not alone,” she said. “That there are other people that think like they do and care about the things that they care about.”
In Harrisburg and across the U.S., protesters arrived wearing inflatable dinosaur, cow and shark costumes in order to dial back tension and draw attention to violent police tactics used against protesters elsewhere.

“Honestly, it just feels very American to me,” Amy, the woman wearing the pink axolotl costume, said. She declined to give her last name. “We’re just such a serious bunch, you know? We try our best to just fight for our rights and everything, but we still know how to have fun.”

Don Coleman, 69, said he attended the rally at the Capitol because he’s concerned about subversion of the constitution, especially with a Congress and Supreme Court that he views as beholden to the president. But beyond the actions of the U.S. government, he’s worried about polarization of the American people.
“My father was a veteran after World War II. My grandfather fought in World War I. I have friends who fought in Vietnam,” he added. “How did we get here? They didn’t fight for this.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DO01011607-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-20 07:37:22.964745

Authorities have not disclosed a possible motive for the shooting in Leland, but the FBI says it may have been “sparked by a disagreement among several individuals.” At least nine people have been arrested, several of them charged with capital murder.
The death of Ebanee Williams was reported Friday by the coroner’s office in Hinds County, which encompasses the state capital, according to a news release Saturday from LaQuesha Watkins, the coroner in Washington County where Leland is located. 
More than a dozen people were wounded in the shooting, and several were taken to other cities for medical care. The violence broke out late in the evening of Oct. 11 as people were gathered in Leland’s tiny downtown to celebrate homecoming weekend. It is the deadliest mass shooting in the U.S. this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive.
Leland, on the state’s western edge, is home to fewer than 4,000 people, and the FBI’s Jackson Field Office has been posting pictures of suspects wanted for questioning.

Oct. 18, 2025 | Photo by Erick Diaz VelizIt’s been almost four months since around 5,000 Detroit residents last gathered in the city’s oldest park to protest against Donald Trump and stand up for civil rights and democracy. 
On Saturday afternoon, a national day of No Kings rallies once again brought Michiganders out more than a hundred rallies and marches that stretched from Ironwood, the westernmost city of Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, to Detroit, all part of the nationwide “No Kings” protest against Trump and his current administration, which has affected immigrants, caused federal workers’ layoffs, and attacked freedom of speech.
Gathering at Roosevelt Park in southwest Detroit, thousands of people of all ages and backgrounds began arriving just before 3 p.m., holding up signs in Spanish and English as they stepped out of their cars or buses, many reading “America has no kings,” or “No National Guard in Detroit”. Large banners stretched above the crowd as people found their places to listen to the speakers.

For many Detroiters, shouting and holding up their signs is a way to resist the Republicans’ latest demand for Michigan: Deploy the National Guard to Detroit for what JD Vance called “serious crime problems” during a speech at a manufacturing plant in Howell last month. 
That prompted Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, a Democrat, to say “it’s only a matter of time” before Trump tries to send National Guard troops to cities in the Great Lakes State as he did to other cities like Chicago, Los Angeles, Portland, and others.
“Good luck with that,” Sandra Therrian, a Detroit resident, who attended Saturday’s rally, said. “No, they’re not going to be allowed in Chicago. They shouldn’t try to come too. We don’t need them. We don’t want them. They can go to their Republican places that have far more crime than we do. We take care of our own here.”
“The people united will never be defeated,” was one of the main chants heard around the crowd.

State Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak), who is running for the U.S. Senate next year, applauded the courage of the protesters and told the Advance she hoped that more protests like this one would continue.
“It is encouraging. I know protesting might be intimidating, but it is a good way to stand up and fight back,” McMorrow said to the Advance.” We have an opportunity to stay together and raise our voices against Donald Trump and his administration.”
By the end of Saturday, Trump had responded to the No Kings” protests with a 19-second AI-generated video in which he is portrayed as a crown-wearing bomber pilot, in a plane labeled “King Trump”, dropping excrement on protesters. 
A march downtown and an arrest
As the crowd of protesters began a peaceful march from the park, down Michigan Avenue toward the Patrick McNamara Federal building, “No Trump, no troops” was one of the chants the several thousand participants made along the way.

The sole disturbance came from Andre Williams, 24, a MAGA influencer with a megaphone who disrupted the march, circling the crowd of demonstrators in attempts to enter it. He was part of a small number of counter-protesters who also showed up at the No Kings rally and march.
“I came here by myself; I don’t respond to any organization. I am here for my country,” Williams said, while being surrounded by some protesters who tried to pull him away from the crowd. 
“Immigration is killing our country; it is killing Western values. It is taking away my jobs for the American working class,” said Williams.
“I’m unconcerned. He’s looking for views,” said Theoderic Strider, a Florida trans man who recently moved to Detroit to escape that state’s anti-trans and anti-gay legislation. 
“It’s more important to be kind to your neighbors than pretty much anything else right now,” said Strider.
Williams had also shown up at the June’s No Kings protest in Detroit, and as he was then, Williams was confronted by protesters attempting to de-escalate the situation. However, Williams avoided advancing further among the protesters on the road and ran toward those at the entrance of the federal building, where he was blocked by participants. 
Shoving then broke out between those who wanted to throw him out and those demanding that the situation stop. Police arrived and, pulling him by his arms, arrested Williams, and took him into custody. 
A request for comment to Detroit Police about what charges, if any, were filed against Williams was returned Sunday afternoon.
“Adult male was arrested for disorderly conduct. No further information is available regarding the arrest. He was the only one arrested during march,” the email stated.
After listening to final speeches, the protesters returned to Roosevelt Park, ending the No Kings protest with chants still echoing through the streets of Detroit.

,Mississippi Today,2025-10-19 13:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Southern lawmakers say infant mortality rates could worsen with health care cuts,Torrence Banks,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/10/19/southern-lawmakers-say-infant-mortality-rates-could-worsen-with-health-care-cuts/,"In Mississippi, which has the highest rate of infant mortality, health officials declared a state of emergency this year after the rate increased.","The infant mortality rate, a stat that tracks deaths of infants before their first birthdays, in many Southern states is higher than average for the U.S. — Mississippi’s health department even declared a state of emergency this year after the rate of infant deaths increased.
Lawmakers and medical experts say that health care spending cuts and restrictions on services could make things worse.
“These are states that historically have struggled both with infant mortality and maternal mortality,” Georgia Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock told NOTUS. “Medicaid is part of a safety net that impacts overall health. When that safety net is broken, things like infant mortality are impacted as well as chronic disease.”

Democrats warn that a confluence of factors could lead to fewer people accessing care, potentially with dire consequences. The reconciliation bill that became law this summer cuts $1.1 trillion in Medicaid. Enhanced subsidies in the Affordable Care Act will expire in December, resulting in increased premiums in 2026 for millions if not extended — something Democrats have demanded in exchange for their votes to reopen the government — and potentially lowering the rate of people getting care. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that by 2034, the number of people left uninsured could increase to 11.8 million.
States in the South would be disproportionately affected if the enhanced ACA subsidies aren’t extended. According to analysis from the Urban Institute, Louisiana would see the steepest decline in subsidized marketplace enrollment in the country.
Many of these states — including Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana, Georgia and North Carolina — have traditionally had infant mortality rates on the higher end of the spectrum. Nationwide, the infant mortality was 5.61 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in 2023; in Mississippi, which has the worst rate of infant mortality, the rate was 8.94 deaths per 1,000 live births. That number climbed in 2024 to 9.7 deaths per 1,000 live births.
Dr. James Bauerband, a retired OBGYN based in Georgia, told NOTUS that the strain that Medicaid cuts have put on rural hospitals could cause the infant mortality rates in Southern states to increase.
“I understand you don’t want to have to insure people that could get insurance on their own and want to incentivize getting a job and getting good insurance,” Bauerband said. “But, there has to be the safety nets, and I think that making sure Medicaid is well-funded is something they really ought to do.”
Alison Gemmill, an assistant professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, recently did a study analyzing the impact that the Dobbs Supreme Court case decision had on infant mortality in states and found that there were “higher than expected” mortality rates “in states after adoption of abortion bans.”
She said the Trump administration’s termination of the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System could lead to a lower understanding of infant mortality. The monitoring system collected insights from moms before and after giving birth, asking questions regarding alcohol use and stress during pregnancy, among others.
“Those are all things that we can’t capture in a birth certificate data source,” Gemmill said. “And that was a really important data for people like me to figure out what’s going on with pregnancy health in the nation, in a state over time. And they completely canceled that program.”
“So now it’s like we don’t even have the data to inform strategies on how to improve rates of pre-term birth infant mortality,” she added.
Democrats believe these reforms have lasting consequences.
“Not enough mamas get prenatal care, partly because of cost, and partly because of access,” Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren said. “Finding places that can treat them can be a real challenge. The Medicaid cuts will impact infant mortality, both for the people who are cut out of health care access, and also for people who depend on rural hospitals and community health centers that can’t survive the cuts and will close.”
Republicans have also raised concerns about infant mortality rates. Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican whose state has more than 60 rural hospitals, told NOTUS that he wants to extend the funding for rural hospitals provided under the law from 2026 to 2030.
If changes take effect after that time, cuts to Medicaid could cause infant mortality rates to go up, he said.
“I want to make sure that that doesn’t happen,” he told NOTUS. “Under the president’s reconciliation bill, there’s increased funding for rural hospitals now for the next couple of years. … I want to see that extended.”
Some of the Republicans who voted against the reconciliation bill stopped short of saying its Medicaid cuts could affect infant mortality rates.
“We’ve had an infant mortality rate problem in this country for years,” Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins, who cited health care as her reason for voting against the reconciliation bill, told NOTUS. “This is not new, and it does warrant research to find out why we also have huge racial disparities in maternal mortality rates.”
North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, who also voted against the bill, called the country’s infant mortality rate “unacceptably high,” with root causes including poverty and substance abuse. However, he didn’t see the correlation between Medicaid cuts and infant mortality rates.
“I haven’t seen any data,” Tillis said. “Maybe some people would say that. But they’d have to be statistically, not politically, motivated to catch my attention. I just haven’t studied it.”
Alabama Republican Sen. Katie Britt called on Democrats to support her legislation to help support women during the prenatal, postpartum and early childhood years of pregnancy. Britt told NOTUS that she will continue to work across the aisle to address it.
“That’s something we’ve got to get to the bottom of … find out what is the root cause,” Britt said.

It’s sunset

Step outside.
The breeze is blowing
wisps of cirrus cloud.
The sky is blue,
the geese are leaving.
Farewell,
we say,
and don’t mean it.
Mean it, please, for once.
The turning leaves will thank you.
The frost has come
quietly along, its hands bound.
Cut it free.
Run your hands through the asters,
the goldenrod…
through the sunlight at the end of the street,
always just around the bend.

This article was originally published by Bolts, a nonprofit newsroom.

On the afternoon of August 1, 1993, the Talladega County Sheriff’s Department got a call to check out the ballfields in Munford, Alabama. When they arrived, they discovered a man’s badly burned body lying underneath an oak tree where spectators would sit to watch softball games. A pair of cinderblocks were nearby, and a charred wooden board was next to him.
Unable to identify the body, the state’s forensic pathologist cut off a hand during the autopsy in order to take fingerprints. They came back as a match for Gregory “New York” Huguley, 32, who lived in Anniston, about 20 minutes north of Munford.
The following month, Maurice Boyd, who was in the third grade at the time, returned home from school to find his mother sitting at the counter frantically trying to track down his older brother, Anthony Boyd. Officers from the Talladega County Sheriff’s Department had visited their house looking to ask him some questions. After Anthony returned home from walking their dog, a rottweiler named Secret, he headed back out to talk with police, as his mother begged him not to go. Maurice remembered Anthony reassuring her that there was nothing to worry about because he didn’t have anything to hide.

“That was the last time he was around,” Maurice, now 42, told me. Soon after, he learned that his brother Anthony, along with three of his friends—Shawn Ingram, Moneek Marcell Ackles, and Dwinaune Quintay Cox—had been arrested for Huguley’s death.
Prosecutors sought the death penalty for Anthony, charging that he didn’t kill Huguley but was equally culpable because he was an accomplice. Anthony maintained that he had no involvement in Huguley’s death.
Facing the threat of the electric chair, one of the men, Cox, struck a deal with prosecutors to testify against his co-defendants in exchange for a sentence that would allow him to eventually walk free on parole. There was no physical evidence tying Anthony to the killing, and so Cox became the star witness at his capital murder trial in March 1995. Prosecutors bolstered their case with witnesses who testified to seeing the men kidnap Huguley, but whose stories clashed in significant ways. When it came time to mount Anthony’s defense, his court-appointed lawyer said that he didn’t have enough time to prepare for the case and failed to call witnesses to corroborate Anthony’s alibi. He was quickly convicted.
Maurice testified during the second part of the trial, when the jury was tasked with deciding whether to sentence his brother to death or spare his life with a sentence of life without the possibility of parole. He spoke about Anthony coaching him in basketball, helping him with his homework, and taking him to the movies and to Six Flags, and asked that the jury let his brother live.
At the end of the trial, which lasted just three days, Anthony was sentenced to death by a jury vote of 10–2. (Alabama and Florida are the only two states that allow death sentences to be handed down even when all jurors don’t agree.) He told The Anniston Star through tears, “I’ll maintain my innocence until the day I die, which I guess will be in the electric chair.”
After Boyd’s trial, his co-defendant Ingram was also sentenced to death, while Ackles was sentenced to life without parole. Cox, who took the stand against all of them, was freed in 2009.
This past August, Maurice was at work when he saw on social media that Alabama had set Anthony’s execution date for Oct. 23. The state is planning to execute him with nitrogen gas, an experimental method that involves suffocating prisoners to death.
“I was thrown,” Maurice said of the news. “Being boxed in a cage for the majority of your life, it kind of sends me spiraling sometimes, and now it’s a little worse to know…there’s a date, and the clock is ticking, and it’s ticking fast.”
America’s death penalty capital 
Anthony Boyd and his co-defendants were tried in Talladega County, in the north central part of the state about an hour’s drive from Birmingham. The rural area is best known for its NASCAR racetrack and access to the Talladega National Forest, but it was also America’s death penalty capital during the 1980s and 90s. The county of around 74,000 was responsible for about 10 percent of Alabama’s death row population, and its juries and judges sentenced more people to die per capita than any other state at the time.
Leading the prosecution was then-District Attorney Robert Rumsey, a former district judge who took office in 1978. By the end of Rumsey’s tenure 20 years later, he had sent 12 people to death row. A 2001 investigation by The Birmingham Post-Herald found that half the people sent to death row from Talladega County were Black, Boyd among them. This mirrored the larger statewide trend; while Black people make up just a quarter of Alabama’s population, nearly half the people on the state’s death row are Black. In 1992, the Alabama Supreme Court found that Rumsey had illegally struck 11 out of 15 potential Black jurors in the capital murder case of a Black woman and ordered a new trial.
Boyd, unable to afford an attorney, was represented by William Willingham, who dabbled in criminal defense, juvenile work, divorce cases, and wrote up power of attorney authorizations and deeds. He’d also previously worked for Rumsey in the DA’s office for four years. In the five capital cases he later tried against Rumsey, Willingham lost all of them. He lauded his old boss in comments to the media on his prowess in death penalty cases. “It was pretty tough against him. As prosecutors go, he was one of the best,” Willingham told The Post-Herald in 2001 for its series “Talladega: Death Row Country.”
Willingham was paid just $1,000 for his work on Boyd’s case, the standard for court appointed lawyers at the time and an imbalance that judges were unsympathetic to. At one pre-trial conference, Willingham said he didn’t want to be appointed to the case because he had to prioritize better paid work. “I just didn’t have any time to prepare for it, plus it gets to be pretty much pro bono work after a certain point,” he told Judge Jerry Fielding, who was overseeing Boyd’s case.

At another hearing, Willingham learned that he would have just over a month to review discovery in the case before going to trial. When he pushed back against the short timeline, Fielding replied, “I think a month is a reasonable length of time for you to get ready.”
Boyd was 23 when the trial got underway. The prosecution said that he and his co-defendants kidnapped Huguley in a blue Astro van in Anniston in the early evening of Saturday, July 31, 1993, then drove him to Munford—where they then duct taped Huguley to a bench, doused him with gasoline, and burned him alive because he had stolen $200 worth of crack cocaine. Prosecutors said that someone else had forced Huguley into the van and lit the match to set him on fire, but argued that Boyd was complicit in Huguley’s death because he was in the van and had duct taped Huguley’s legs and feet to the bench.
Willingham’s lack of preparation was evident from the start. He hadn’t obtained the grand jury testimony a week before the trial, didn’t subpoena four witnesses, hadn’t interviewed any of the prosecutions’ witnesses, and largely relied on notes from Rumsey, his old boss, for his understanding of what they might say on the stand.
Willingham also failed to call witnesses who might have corroborated Boyd’s alibi that he was at a birthday party in Anniston and spent the night at a motel with his girlfriend when Huguley was murdered.
On the first day of the trial, Willingham told the judge that 12 of the witnesses he wanted to call were missing.
The state had its own problems getting witnesses to come to court, but unlike Willingham, it took forceful measures to get them on the stand, including rounding up some under detainers.
In his opening statement, Rumsey explained that he was able to seek the death penalty for Boyd because of the state’s felony murder law, which stipulated that Boyd was responsible for Huguley’s death even if he didn’t light the match that killed him. (Between 2009 and 2017, 83 percent of people charged with felony murder in Alabama were Black.)
“For example, in a bank robbery you’ve got three people in a car and one person sits there and drives the car and two people go in and rob the bank,” Rumsey told jurors. “The guy driving the car is just as guilty as the two that goes in.”
Joseph Embry, the state’s medical examiner and toxicologist who testified about the results of Huguley’s autopsy, said the presence of soot in Huguley’s lungs showed that he was burned alive, and there were traces of cocaine and alcohol in his system and food still in his stomach. Embry said there was evidence of duct tape on Huguley’s face and right forearm, but he didn’t note any such evidence on his legs—where prosecutors said Boyd taped him to the bench. He also said he couldn’t pinpoint Huguley’s time of death, only saying that his body, which was discovered on a Sunday afternoon, was “fresh” and consistent with dying over that weekend.
“And there’s nothing in your examination of the body or any of the findings you made which would link Anthony Boyd to causing the burns on that body is there?” Willingham asked the medical examiner.
“No, sir,” Embry replied.
Police investigators also testified that they’d lifted fingerprints from cans found near Huguley but none of them matched Boyd or his co-defendants.
Without any forensic evidence tying Boyd to the crime, the state relied on the testimony of nine witnesses, whose stories shifted and at times contradicted the facts that prosecutors had laid out.
Cox’s brother, Donique Cox, claimed during his trial testimony that Boyd had told him that “they” shot and killed Huguley, even though there was no evidence that Huguley had been shot. Under cross-examination, Donique, who was 18, said he only talked to police after his brother cut a deal with prosecutors.
Just four of the supposedly dozens of people hanging out near where Huguley was said to be abducted wound up testifying. Each story varied in significant ways—critically, whether they saw Ingram threaten Huguley with a gun or if they even saw Boyd in the van. The one witness who testified to seeing Ingram with a gun and Boyd inside the van was later contradicted by testimony from her aunt, who told jurors that she’d seen her in front of her house all day, miles away from the scene of Huguley’s abduction.
Another witness—who only testified after prosecutors obtained an arrest warrant and police searched five different houses to find and bring her to court—told jurors about hearing Boyd, Ackles, and Ingram discuss Huguley and accuse him of stealing their drugs prior to his death, though she said she couldn’t remember who said what.
During Ingram’s trial, which happened two months after Boyd’s, the same witness admitted to using crack during the time she was testifying about and was now in jail for an assault charge. Ingram’s trial also revealed how witnesses had changed their statements in key ways since first talking to police, like whether they’d even seen Ingram that day—with one man telling police during his initial statement that Ingram wasn’t there when he was shown a picture of him.
Mike McBurnett, the lead investigator on the case for the Talladega County Sheriff’s Department, told me last month that he remembered it well because of how difficult it was to find witnesses. Most were scared to talk or didn’t want to be labeled a snitch. “One of them was on probation, and I think we got his probation officer to find him for us,” he said. “I mean, none of them just jumped up.”
The threat of a death sentence
As police struggled to wrangle witnesses, prosecutors tried to get the co-defendants to testify against each other.
Boyd says he declined their offer of life without parole sentence in exchange for his testimony, because he believed he wouldn’t be convicted. Ingram, who initially struck a deal that would’ve given him a sentence of life with parole eligibility, backed out, even after Fielding, the judge, seemingly tried to convince him to testify. “Do you understand you are deciding your fate?” the judge asked.
When Cox also backed out of the plea deal, Fielding repeatedly reminded him that his decision could lead to him being sentenced to die in the electric chair. Even when Cox told him that he would not testify, Fielding continued to push the issue.
“You have set your life on a course that could very easily lead you to being electrocuted,” the judge said during Boyd’s trial while the jury wasn’t present.
Later that day, Cox decided he would testify after all. Under questioning, he said he’d reassessed his odds of winning his case after meeting with his aunt and grandmother back at the jail.
McBurnett, the investigator, said the threat of a death sentence played a large part in persuading him to talk. “You’re trying to always get somebody to turn against the other one,” he said. “None of them sit down and tell you the truth. You just got to get as much as you can, and then get somebody to cooperate.”
Cox was the only witness to testify about Huguley’s death at Boyd’s trial. He testified that he met up with Boyd, Ingram, and Ackles that Saturday evening, while there was still daylight but it was starting to get dark outside, to look for someone who’d robbed Boyd. After driving around with Ackles in his blue van, Cox said they spotted Huguley, who wasn’t the original target but had also stolen from Boyd. According to Cox, Ingram got out of the passenger side of the van with Cox’s gun, a MAC-11, and told him to get into the van. Cox testified that Huguley replied, “Please, don’t kill me. Just beat me.”
Cox said that Ingram then grabbed Huguley by the arm and pushed him onto the floor of the van. After that, he said that Ackles dropped him off at his car, which he then used to follow the van.
Cox testified that it was “dusk dark” once they arrived at the ballfield. He said Ingram ordered Huguley to lay down on a bench then Ackles taped Huguley’s mouth and hands, while Boyd taped his feet to the bench. According to Cox, Ingram then doused gasoline on Huguley and made a trail around him before lighting it with a match. He said they watched him burn for 10 or 15 minutes before Huguley rolled off the bench and the fire went out. After that, Cox said Boyd got into his car with him and told him, “We all in this together now.” Cox testified that he dropped off Boyd then went back to his aunt’s house, where he stayed the rest of the night.
Under questioning from Willingham, Cox admitted that a significant part of his story had changed between his initial statement to police in October 1993 and the one he gave as part of his plea deal, in late June 1994. In the first statement, for instance, he told investigators that he stayed with Ackles, Ingram, and Boyd in the van after the kidnapping and that they rode as a group to the ballfield. He later changed his story to say that he was dropped off at his car after they picked up Huguley and followed them on his own to the scene of the murder.
“But you weren’t telling the truth back in October, you saying now, when you say you were in the van the whole time?” Willingham asked.
“Right, because then in October I didn’t have an agreement,” replied Cox. “And then when I signed the agreement, [Cox’s lawyer] told me that if I testify falsely and get caught in a lie, that the agreement could be breached. So, that’s when I changed my story.”
Prosecutors said the murder happened between 7:30 and 8 o’clock that Saturday evening, but none of the witnesses who testified to seeing Huguley’s kidnapping could remember what time they saw it happen. Some said it was “dusk dark” outside, while another witness called it mid-dark but had said in his initial statement to police that he saw them after dark. (Sunset that day was at 7:46 pm.)
During Boyd’s defense, Willingham called a witness who was at the ballfields that evening around the time that Cox said Huguley was killed; the witness said that when he left at “dusk dark” there were “a lot of people still there… At least a few hundred anyway.”
The testimony suggested that there would have likely been other witnesses at the fields during the time when Boyd was said to have helped kill Huguley. Willingham did not pursue that discrepancy further, however, and called no other witnesses who were at the field.
Willingham also didn’t call William Mosley, a Munford local who had discovered Huguley’s body on that Sunday afternoon in 1993.
Mosley had told The Anniston Star that he’d discovered Huguley’s body when he got to the field around 3:40 pm on Sunday to assess conditions before the day’s game, and that Huguley was “still bleeding a little out of his head.” That would have been roughly 20 hours after the prosecution’s time of death.
Other witnesses cast doubt on Cox’s testimony, including three people who testified about seeing him and Boyd at a party late that Saturday night, even though he said he spent the entire night at his aunt’s following the murder.
In the years since, Boyd’s post conviction lawyers have said Willingham’s performance fell short of constitutional standards. For instance, they’ve said he never consulted an independent forensic expert to try and pinpoint Huguley’s time of death, which they say could have been done with testing on the cocaine, food and alcohol still in his system.
Boyd’s appellate lawyers also wrote that Willingham had failed to properly interview witnesses who would’ve corroborated Boyd’s alibi or call into question other parts of the prosecution’s narrative; for example, they say other witnesses recalled Ackles being out of town at the time Cox said they killed Huguley. They said Willingham failed to look into another prosecution witness who had a history of mental illness that could have called into question the veracity of her testimony.
And they accused prosecutors of illegally withholding records from Willingham, his original defense lawyer, including those that would have helped corroborate his alibi and showed that witnesses were offered “certain inducements” for their testimony.
In the petitions they’ve filed, Boyd’s lawyers have said the evidence they’d uncovered since their client was sent to death row would show that he couldn’t have been at the ballfields at the time Cox said Huguley was killed. But judges have refused to grant Boyd a hearing that would have given him the chance to present additional evidence, largely on the basis that his claims were either already addressed in other courts or found to be without merit.
When I spoke with Willingham in September, he dismissed the criticism of his performance as boilerplate legal arguments during capital case appeals. He also stressed the structural challenges of defending such cases at the time, saying judges then rarely approved funding for an appointed attorney to hire their own forensic expert—let alone pay them fairly for time spent on their own investigation.
“We had to pay rent, keep the lights on, those kinds of things,” he said. “So we were kind of handcuffed, and as far as resources and how much time we can spend on cases.”
Willingham told me he believes Boyd was sentenced to death because Cox got a plea deal first, which he attributes to Cox’s ability to hire a private attorney.
“It’s sometimes that the first one that can cut a deal [who] gets the benefit of either dodging a death penalty or life without parole, and that’s kind of what happened here,” Willingham said.
“It’s always seemed kind of unfair that one of them or maybe sometimes two of them may get a death sentence, and some of them get a life sentence with the possibility of parole, and some of them may get life without parole,” he said. “It seems unfair that they’re not treated all the same.”
Ingram’s appeal lawyers have continued to fight his case. In one petition they filed in federal court in 2017, Ingram’s lawyers alleged that law enforcement had coerced witnesses to testify, writing “There is also information that most of these eye-witnesses were, in fact, picked up by police during an illicit dice-game and forced to testify against Ingram through threats of prosecution.”
A federal district court denied Ingram’s petition and the witnesses’ credibility was never further investigated.
Ackles, Boyd’s co-defendant who is serving a life without parole sentence, told me he contests Cox’s account. “I have never killed anyone and the lies that were told during Anthony Boyd, Shawn Ingram, myself trials were just that, lies.”
Project Hope
I met Boyd in the summer of 2018, when I was working on a story about Project Hope to Abolish the Death Penalty, an anti-death penalty organization run by prisoners on death row in Alabama. I was interviewing members of the group about how they’d come to join it. Boyd, who was sergeant at arms of Project Hope, told me in a measured southern drawl that, “I didn’t even know Alabama had the death penalty. When they told me it was capital murder, I said ‘What is that? All in capital letters?’”
After joining Project Hope, Boyd says he worked to educate himself about the death penalty, and share what he was learning with the public.
“This justice system is set up for the ones who have and to keep the ones who don’t down,” he told me.
Two prisoners formed the organization in 1989 after an intellectually disabled Black man on death row, thought to be innocent, asked them for help. They put together a five-man committee to raise awareness about rampant problems with the administration of the death penalty in Alabama such as racial discrimination, misconduct, and its disparate application to poor people.
The group still meets weekly in the television room at Holman Correctional Facility, a maximum security prison in Atmore that houses the state’s death row. During the meetings, its 15 or so members talk about recent death penalty news and discuss legal strategies for their cases. The organization also publishes a quarterly newsletter, On Wings of Hope, where prisoners write about the death penalty and life on death row.

In 2018, Project Hope members learned that they only had five days to decide whether to choose to die by nitrogen over lethal injection, the method Alabama had been using and which appeared to cause long and painful deaths, drawing legal and media scrutiny. The state promised that nitrogen would be more humane than lethal injections, and that prisoners would fall unconscious within seconds. But the state did not share a protocol for how it’d use nitrogen, or give a timeline for when it expected to employ the method. Members of Project Hope spread the word for prisoners to call their attorneys so they could get advice on how to proceed.
Boyd at the time opted for nitrogen, but he says he wasn’t given enough information and that he later changed his mind. In response, the state has said that Boyd should be locked into using the method regardless.
In mid-July, his lawyers filed a challenge saying that Alabama’s plan to use nitrogen violates the Eighth Amendment’s protections against cruel and unusual punishment and that the state’s refusal to allow Boyd to see an unredacted protocol is a breach of his rights to due process. Boyd asked to be executed by either hanging, firing squad, or with drugs used for medical aid in dying.
They cited witness reports from the five nitrogen executions conducted so far in Alabama, which began using the method last year, plus one in Louisiana, which first executed a prisoner with nitrogen in March. During those executions, media, legal, and medical witnesses said that prisoners gasped for air, convulsed, and shook violently against the restraints in their final moments. (When I witnessed Alan Miller’s execution in September 2024, he thrashed and jerked on the gurney as his eyes darted back and forth.) Boyd’s lawyers argued that this showed that prisoners were subjected to “conscious suffocation, terror, and pain.”
In early September, Boyd’s team argued their case at an evidentiary hearing featuring testimony from a dozen witnesses, including journalists (among whom was a reporter with Alabama Reflector), lawyers, and medical experts. Deanna Smith, the wife of Kenneth Smith, the first person in the nation to be executed with nitrogen in January 2024, said that witnessing his death was like “watching somebody drown without water.” Other witnesses testified that prisoners appeared awake as they struggled to breathe for minutes.
In response, Alabama’s lawyers have pointed to Boyd’s critical writings about the nitrogen method in On Wings of Hope, Project Hope’s newsletter, as evidence that Boyd knew what he was agreeing to and is only suing now out of gamesmanship. The state has maintained that the method is working as planned and criticized his lawyers for relying on media accounts to build their case, saying that the courts have ruled they are “unreliable evidence” and “highly questionable hearsay.”
On Oct. 9, Emily Marks, the federal district court judge who heard the case, denied Boyd’s challenge, saying that it was filed too late and it was unlikely that he’d win based on the evidence he’d presented. In her ruling, she wrote that reports of prisoners remaining conscious for up to four minutes during their executions “are largely outside of the ADOC’s control and instead depend on the inmate’s behavior—whether voluntary or involuntary.”
Boyd has appealed his case to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. He’s also filed his own challenges in state and federal courts. In one, he alleges that the state has violated his rights by arbitrarily applying the death penalty while other people charged in murder-kidnapping cases received more lenient sentences.
After the state set his execution date, Boyd says he started working to tie up loose ends with Project Hope to pass on leadership to the group’s vice-chairman, Bart Johnson, and help him take over running the organization. Guards immediately moved him into solitary confinement, a policy the Alabama Department of Corrections adopted for prisoners with execution dates, and he can no longer attend the group’s meetings.
I remained in contact with Boyd after I initially spoke with him in 2018, and over the years he told me about the work he’d been doing with Project Hope, like conducting a study on racial disparities in Alabama’s death row population. He told me that he’d been involved with drugs back in Anniston and had his problems with the cops, but wasn’t involved in Huguley’s death.
In April 2019, Boyd told me that he’d been voted as chairman of Project Hope. It was a cause for celebration, and also an omen: Other members had said that the higher someone advances within the group, the closer they are to death.
Johnson told me that Boyd, who goes by “Ant”, is now “family” to him. “When difficulty arises, I always know he’s got my back,” Johnson said. “And he very much looks out for all of us here as the elder statesman who cares about and for his brothers.”
Esther Brown, Project Hope’s executive director and the only free person in the organization, told me that Boyd “has always taken care of others,” and recounted how he once helped get a prisoner moved to a different cell after he was having problems with people around him. Brown called him “the most effective chairman.”
“People know that he gives a damn about them,” she said.
Brown has protested Boyd’s pending execution since the state set a date this summer, attending demonstrations and a press conference, as well as sending out emails detailing problems with Boyd’s case to raise to Governor Kay Ivey, who will decide whether to grant Boyd clemency.
With each execution, Project Hope organizes a vigil where the men on death row dress in the formal white uniforms they typically wear when they have visitors and share memories of the person who is going to be executed.
Brown has gone through the executions of past Project Hope chairmen before: Brian Baldwin in 1999 and Darrell Grayson in 2007. Both had obtained evidence showing they were likely innocent. She was reticent about discussing the possibility that Boyd could be executed.
“How does one deal with things, you know?” she told me. “The thing is, we’re family. It sounds kind of strange or weird, but that is what we are.”
‘There is no justice system in the state of Alabama’
When I reached Rod Giddens, the lawyer who represented Cox at the time of Boyd’s trial, he was surprised to hear that Cox had gotten out of prison in 2009. Giddens told me that making a deal with prosecutors “was the right thing to do at the time,” and said he believed Cox had an “obligation” to tell police and prosecutors what he saw. “It certainly paid off for Cox when you’re comparing his outcome to the others,” he said. “It is striking.”
When I pointed out that the only evidence of what happened in the ballfields that weekend came from Cox, Giddens responded that prosecutors must have had more to go on. “There had to be some other evidence, because you can’t convict somebody solely on the base testimony of a co-defendant,” he said. “I just don’t remember.”
Cox declined to talk when I reached out to him for this story, telling me via text message, “Tell it like you want to tell it!”
With Boyd’s execution approaching, activists have been working to raise awareness about his case. Last month, the anti-death penalty organization, Execution Intervention Project, unveiled a billboard in Montgomery with the message, “Save Anthony Boyd.” They’ve put up an additional billboard in Talladega.

Despite his isolation, Boyd told me he spends his days as he has for the last 30 years: tackling tasks for Project Hope, working on his case, and talking and laughing with friends who stop by his cell. “This doesn’t change who I am,” he said. “This is something I’m going through.”
He said he hasn’t prepared himself for the possibility of dying by being suffocated with nitrogen gas. “There’s nothing you can do to prepare for something like that,” he said. “You can’t prepare a person for drowning.”
Boyd continues to profess his innocence and insists he wasn’t involved in Huguley’s death. “It’s easy to paint a picture when you got the paint brush in your hands,” he said of the prosecution’s case. “They painted the picture they wanted to paint.”
Though his family visits him at Holman, incarceration has taken a toll. His children have grown up, grandchildren have been born, and his father, grandmother, and great-grandmother have died while he’s been on death row. His execution is scheduled on his daughter’s birthday.
“There is no justice system in the state of Alabama,” he said. “There’s a lot of tyranny, a lot of oppression, a lot of racial profiling, racial discrimination and a lot of underhanded tricks to get what they want. What they have is a politicized injustice system.”
Last week, Boyd penned a letter for the latest edition of Project Hope’s newsletter. “This article has been a long time in the making,” he wrote. “I would love to tell all of you that I believe truth, justicе, and human dignity will prevail, but we’re in Alabama where such things are few and far between.”
Maurice Boyd said he doesn’t plan to witness his brother’s execution, should it happen. “I don’t think I can handle it,” he told me.
“We have an innocent man who has spent the majority of his life behind bars,” Maurice said. “The fight is not over and we’re gonna do everything we can to stop this and hopefully get him home.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Anthony-Boyd-for-Oct-19-2025-story-1024x778.jpeg,,,2025-10-20 07:37:22.964745

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota’s race for its lone seat in the U.S. House of Representatives got a little more crowded last month with the entrance of state Sen. Casey Crabtree, a Madison Republican. The seat will be up for grabs next year because Republican U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson is running for governor.
In making his announcement, Crabtree let people know, in no uncertain terms, that he will be loyal to President Donald Trump. Whether that kind of blind loyalty can get him elected remains to be seen.
“I am the only conservative Republican in the race who has always delivered on an ‘America First,’ ‘South Dakota Always’ agenda,” Crabtree said in an interview with South Dakota Searchlight. “He needs strong allies like myself who will be serving in Congress to make sure he can deliver the America First agenda.”
State senator from Madison formally launches congressional bid, pledges to be Trump ally

In the interview, Crabtree went so far as to back Trump’s tariff policy as well as his handling of the wars in Ukraine and Gaza. There are plenty of photos of Trump with his arms wrapped around an American flag. If Trump were a flag, it would be wrapped around Crabtree.
Like the Lloyd Bridges character in the movie “Airplane,” who picked a bad day to give up smoking, Crabtree may have picked a bad year to run for Congress. That’s particularly true if he is going to market himself as a Trump loyalist.
Off-year elections are traditionally tough on the party in power. With Republicans controlling the White House and both chambers of Congress, the GOP can expect to take a few hits in the 2026 election.
Something must be up, because South Dakota’s usually candidate-averse Democratic Party already has two announced candidates for the party’s nomination for the U.S. House with another who has filed the paperwork to run. It’s hard to imagine a Democrat getting elected to the U.S. House in South Dakota, but that level of Democratic interest is unprecedented in recent history.
By wrapping himself in Trump, Crabtree is betting that the president’s popularity in South Dakota will help him win a primary against another declared GOP candidate, Attorney General Marty Jackley (a third Republican, James Bialota, of Piedmont, has filed paperwork to run). Crabtree is likely to find that service in the Legislature doesn’t necessarily transform into recognition from the electorate.

In an April poll about gubernatorial hopefuls by South Dakota News Watch, state Rep. Jon Hansen, the only announced Republican candidate at the time, was at the bottom with 2% support from registered Republican voters, despite being the current speaker of the state House. That means Crabtree, a former legislative leader, has his work cut out for him. That’s especially true running against Jackley, a veteran of multiple statewide campaigns.
How Crabtree got to be a “former” majority leader in the Senate may also point to a weakness in his candidacy. He was on the wrong side of the carbon dioxide pipeline law that voters rejected in the 2024 general election. Voter opposition to that law contributed to losses by 14 incumbent Republican legislators in the 2024 primary, and also contributed to the Legislature’s adoption of a ban on eminent domain for carbon pipelines earlier this year.
Crabtree easily handled “election integrity” advocate Rick Weible in their primary, earning 72% of the vote, and was unopposed in the general election.
But Crabtree was ousted from his post as Senate majority leader last winter when Republican legislators gathered to elect their leadership, and the populist branch of the party is known for having a long memory and a love of primaries. That means a populist candidate for the U.S. House could still emerge and put Crabtree’s cloak of Trump loyalty to the test.

Vermont is in some ways a microcosm of the challenges states across the country are facing when it comes to health care, says political scientist Alex Garlick. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  UVM professor finds link between state-level lobbyists and rising health care costs.","The small scale of Vermont’s population and economy, as well as its aging population, are part of why the state sees such high costs to health care, said UVM political science professor Alex Garlick, in light of the publication of his new book.

In his new book on the role of lobbying in shaping health care policy, University of Vermont political science professor Alex Garlick opens with a scene from his days on Capitol Hill. 
Garlick worked as a congressional staffer for Rep. Joe Kennedy III, D-Mass., during the intense debates over the 2017 Republican effort to “repeal and replace” the Affordable Care Act, early in President Donald Trump’s first term, and he describes the scene just after the failed repeal vote — by a single thumbs-down vote from late Arizona Sen. John McCain — when he saw then-House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., kick off her shoes and leap for joy on the Capitol lawn.
Eight years later, the publication of “Pre-Existing Conditions: How Lobbying Makes American Health Care More Expensive” comes as Congress is engaged in another battle royale with the same law at its core. Senate Democrats — including Vermont Sens. Peter Welch, a Democrat, and Bernie Sanders, an independent —  are pushing for the continuation of expanded tax credits for Affordable Care Act marketplace plans in exchange for their votes on a continuing funding resolution that would end the federal government shutdown, now in its third week.
That the continuation of an existing tax credit program for purchasing private insurance is what Democrats are demanding speaks volumes about the influence that industry lobbying has in curbing big health care cost reforms, Garlick said. 
“I think one of the ways you really see the power of the industry is what kind of reform ideas that people will talk about,” he said in an interview on Oct. 10.
Specifically, he said, the tax credits make health insurance more affordable, not the health care itself. As Garlick sees it, the Affordable Care Act, by providing subsidies for the purchase of private insurance, is a more conservative approach to universal health care. 
The cost of health care — to an insurer — ultimately is an issue of supply and demand, Garlick explained. The most effective way to contain costs of care itself is to address those issues systemically. 
Structural Power in Vermont 
In Vermont, the most salient variable in this supply and demand equation is the scale, Garlick said. Namely, the state has a small population, a small economy, one main hospital network and one main in-state insurer. 
“There’s not big competition there, there’s not really any forces trying to push costs downward,” he said.
In “Pre-Existing Conditions,” Garlick develops the idea of “structural power,” explaining the outsized influence large players in a state economy can have on policy. In Vermont, Garlick sees UVM Health Network wielding this kind of structural power, he elaborated in an interview: For instance, in 2024, when the Green Mountain Care Board, a key state health care regulator, set a lower budget than what UVM had proposed, the hospital cut services.
“It probably reminded the care board that they can’t go too far and too fast. They need to tread carefully about how to rein costs in,” Garlick said.
He believes that having a powerful regulator like the Green Mountain Care Board is an important step toward curbing health care costs. “That said,” Garlick added, “limiting marginal growth year over year doesn’t make care more affordable. You can’t put the toothpaste back in the tube of how costs have gotten high in the first place.” 
How, then, to actually reduce health care costs?  “One way to push back on the structural power of institutions like the UVM Health network is to not rely on them so much,” Garlick said. 
“The legislature could be more proactive about trying to increase the supply of hospitals that exist.”
Garlick also pointed to the $50 billion allocated in the budget reconciliation law Congress passed this summer for “rural health transformation.” He expects Vermont to be well positioned to receive funding through the program. The state is already working on its application for the fund.
Expanding the number of clinics and hospitals, he says, is just one potential way to add more leeway in that supply-demand equation. 
The state would also be well served by thinking more holistically about how the rural health funds can support the health care system, Garlick said. For example, expanding housing options for hospital workers as a key way to ultimately invest in the long-term economic health of the state’s health care system. 
“When it comes to zoning and housing supply, Vermont is coming from a pretty restrictive place. It is difficult to build and difficult for people to find housing,” Garlick said. “When it comes to medical and hospital employees, their inability to find housing is making it difficult for (hospitals) to attract and retain staff.”
It can lead locally trained doctors and nurses to look outside the state for employment and the hospitals to pay high wages for traveling nurses, he added.
Informational Bottlenecks 
In “Pre-Existing Conditions,” Garlick also describes another type of leverage that industry can hold via its control of information. In health policy, especially, equal access to information is particularly challenging, he writes. Often people need medical training to really grasp what is medically necessary, privacy concerns keep many details and statistics protected, and a third-party insurance company can obscure the true cost of services.  
Vermont has relatively open access to information through the Green Mountain Care Board. Annually, the board collects financial data from hospitals and insurers, which it makes public. 
Still, the citizen state Legislature’s capacity to digest that information and act on these complex issues during the short legislative session is itself a type of informational bottleneck, Garlick says. 
“When (lawmakers) lack information, when they lack capacity, that builds a dependence on lobbyists and on the industry to help them make the decisions,” Garlick said. “When you’re depending on information from the industry. It’s hard to expect the industry to issue the recommendations that are going to reduce their own revenues.” 
In his book, Garlick calculates that the state legislatures with the highest presence of lobbyists end up spending the least amount of attention on health care in the agenda and see more expensive health care costs.
Each individual lobbyist in a state ends up costing people roughly $7 per capita in additional health care costs, his research suggests. 
The constraints on setting policy in Vermont, though, are often as much about process constraints, Garlick said. “Because the legislative session is not very long, we have these impasses that develop,” he said. “There are capacity issues of ‘Can we even do this ourselves?’”
Counterintuitively, perhaps, the fact that the cost of health care in Vermont, and in the country, has gotten so unwieldy has made him more optimistic that it will bring a desire for broader systemic change. 
One tool Garlick sees as having potential for creating change is the regional state coalitions emerging as an alternative to confusing — or absent — guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Department of Health and Human Services under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
“That type of outside the box thinking is probably something that’s going to be necessary, at least in the near future,” he said. “If a state like Vermont feels like a David versus Goliath taking on some of these well-moneyed interests in the health care industry, states should be working together to solve these issues.” 
Still Garlick also believes that state governments ultimately do have the ability to address the high cost of health care close to home, and that individual voters are capable of demanding more from their state legislatures to tackle these issues more broadly, boldly and holistically. 
“Yes, health care is affected by big, national forces but you also consume health care in a state health care market,” Garlick said. “Don’t overlook what happens at the states’ (level). That is the venue where a lot of key decisions about the health care that Vermonters will actually consume are made.”

Don Davis (D-N.C.) (Source: ncleg.gov)Republican leaders in the North Carolina General Assembly have made their priorities crystal clear, and the people of this state aren’t one of them. Instead of passing a state budget, repairing our mass teacher shortage, investing in schools, or fixing our crumbling infrastructure, Senate President Phil Berger and House Speaker Destin Hall have announced plans to redraw our congressional districts yet again, this time to help Donald Trump rig the 2026 midterm elections.
It’s a shameful, cynical move that would hand nearly 80% of North Carolina’s congressional seats to Republicans in what is, by every measure, a 50/50 swing state. Under Trump’s direction, GOP leaders are taking a page from Texas’ gerrymandering playbook, aiming to impose an 11-3 map that silences voters and stacks the deck for partisan power.    
This is truly unprecedented
Under the Rucho decision, the U.S. Supreme Court was not considering whether states could redraw maps purely for partisan gain. Normally, districts are redrawn in only two situations: after the census to rebalance populations and uphold the 14th Amendment’s “one person, one vote” principle, or when a court orders changes to fix legal violations.
What’s happening now is neither. Legislative leaders have openly admitted that this redraw isn’t about population balance; it’s about removing voters in North Carolina’s Black Belt to engineer partisan advantage. This is retaliation against voters for how they voted, a deliberate effort to silence communities of color and predetermine outcomes in Congress.
We’ve now seen four congressional map changes in just five years: 2021, 2022, 2024, and now 2025. That’s chaos. If this pattern continues, North Carolinians will live under new maps every election cycle, punished again and again for exercising their right to vote.
Targeting Black voters again
The proposed gerrymanders are not just partisan; they may be racially discriminatory. The target is North Carolina’s historic Black Belt district, Congressional District 1 (CD1). For decades, CD1 has been a vital voice for Black voters across northeastern North Carolina, reflecting our state’s long struggle toward equal representation.
Now, in an effort to rig until red, Senator Berger and Speaker Hall are working to rip that district apart. It’s a direct attack on the political power of Black North Carolinians and a slap in the face to every voter who believes elections should be fair and free.
This is not a democracy. It’s manipulation, plain and simple.
Trump’s priorities, not North Carolina’s
At a time when working families are struggling with high costs, teacher shortages, and crumbling public services, politicians in Raleigh are spending their time on backroom map-drawing. Why? To curry favor with Trump and secure partisan control, not to solve the problems that matter most to the people they represent.
North Carolinians deserve leaders who put our communities first, not a president’s political ambitions.
The people are watching, and they’ve had enough
Voters across North Carolina, Republicans, Democrats, and independents alike, are fed up with gerrymandering. A recent poll found that 84% of voters believe it’s never acceptable for politicians to draw districts to help their own party win more seats, including 78% of Republicans, 87% of Democrats, and 85% of unaffiliated voters.
Our message to Raleigh and Washington couldn’t be clearer: these maps don’t belong to politicians. They belong to the people of North Carolina.
The path forward: fair maps for a fair democracy
Every time politicians rig the maps, they rob North Carolinians of real choices and accountability. Our democracy can’t function when election outcomes are pre-determined by partisan cartography. The only way to end these rigged maps for good is through real reform, independent redistricting commissions to take power out of politicians’ hands, and proportional representation to ensure every voter’s voice truly counts. Fair maps should never depend on who happens to hold power this decade.”

That should not be a surprise since Mississippi has the highest percentage of Black people of any state in the nation.
Despite Missisisppi’s large Black population, without the Voting Rights Act of 1965 the number of African Americans serving in the Mississippi Legislature would be far fewer than it is now. There is no disputing the fact that the Voting Rights Act has resulted in more Black people serving in the Mississippi Legislature and indeed in every level of government in the state – from the local to the national level.
Even with the Voting Rights Act, the number of majority-Black districts in the Mississippi Legislature – about 34% of the 174 seats – is less than the percentage of Black people in Mississippi’s total population – about 38%.
Before the Voting Rights Act, there were no elected Black officials in Mississippi during the 20th century except for those in the all-Black town of Mound Bayou. 
This past week, the United States Supreme Court heard arguments on whether the section of the Voting Rights Act that ensures a certain level of minority representation in the drawing of political boundaries, such as for state legislative seats, city council seats and U.S. House seats, should be repealed.
Louisiana, which was forced by the courts to draw a second majority-Black congressional district this decade to meet the requirements of the Voting Rights Act, argued before the court that race should not be a factor in redistricting. Louisiana was assisted by President Donald Trump’s administration in its arguments.
The case before the Supreme Court is a big deal. A decision by the court to gut the Voting Rights Act could provide a monumental boost to the desperate and unprecedented efforts of the Trump administration to convince some states to redraw their congressional districts to provide Republicans more safe seats before the 2026 midterm elections. The effort is part of a strategy by Trump to hold onto the small Republican majority in the U.S. House.
It appears some members of the Supreme Court – perhaps a majority – believe that the protections from racial discrimination provided by the Voting Rights are no longer needed. The nation has moved beyond that, they argue.
No doubt, there has been substantial progress made toward halting racial discrimination since the Voting Rights Act was signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson.
But it is worth remembering that in the 2010s, provisions of the Voting Rights Act were used to successfully argue a Mississippi Senate seat that covered 102 miles in various nonsensical directions on the fringes of the Delta was drawn to dilute the Black vote while protecting a white incumbent. Or more recently, the principles of the Voting Rights Act were followed to create three additional majority-Black districts in the Mississippi Legislature.
And it is worth pointing out that state Auditor Shad White, a Republican who aspires to be Mississippi’s next governor, took to social media  to celebrate the possibility of the gutting of the Voting Rights Act. 
“I hope they will rule that the kind (of) gerrymandering that has protected Bennie Thompson for years is out,” White wrote. “If they do, Mississippi should immediately move to create simple districts that are not gerrymandered to protect Bennie Thompson.”
Thompson, first elected to the U.S. House in 1993, is Mississippi’s lone Black congressman. He has been the only Democrat in the state’s delegation in Washington since early 2011, when 22-year Rep. Gene Taylor left office after losing to a Republican in south Mississippi.
Perhaps Auditor White does not know that Thompson lobbied the Mississippi Legislature to draw his district more compact after the 2020 Census. But the Legislature opted to draw Thompson a sprawling district that extends almost the length of the western side of the state – at least in part to protect Republican congressmen by packing as many Black residents as possible into Thompson’s district and keeping the other three districts whiter.
In a 2018 interview with Mississippi Today, Thompson spoke of the impact of the Voting Rights Act.
As a student at Tougaloo College in the 1960s, he was working in the Delta to help register Black people to vote when he had a conversation with his mother, who said, “You know we don’t vote here in Bolton. It was a shock to me that I was up in Sunflower County helping register Black people to vote and even in my hometown they didn’t enjoy the same luxury.”
Thompson said that his father, an auto mechanic who died in 1964 before passage of the Voting Rights Act, never voted. His mother, a school teacher, did and most likely cast her first vote for her son when he ran and was elected in 1969 to the Board of Aldermen in his hometown of Bolton.
Without the Voting Rights Act, that would not have been possible. And without the Voting Rights Act today, it is safe to assume there would be fewer Black people elected to office, not just in Mississippi but throughout the nation.
Some might say that is a good thing. But is it really?",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/15182900/AP25288543891896.jpg,,,2025-10-20 07:37:22.964745

Leading 19th-century landscape painter Charles Heyde struggled with financial hardships and personal demons.

The visit was almost more than artist Charles Heyde could have hoped for. One day in the early 1850s, Heyde was called upon at his Brooklyn painting studio by a pair of poets, one in his early 30s, the other in his mid-50s. Heyde must have been particularly excited to meet the older man, William Cullen Bryant.
Though little remembered today, Bryant wrote widely popular poems in which nature often served as a metaphor for spiritual truth. His activism on a range of issues — from opposing slavery to supporting the creation of a large, central park in Manhattan — made him a leading cultural figure in New York City and the nation. 
For a young artist like Heyde (pronounced Hi-dee), the fact that Bryant would take the time to visit his studio, admire his landscape paintings and talk with him, must have felt like a benediction. Perhaps this connection with Bryant was a sign that he too had what it took to be a great artist.
Walt Whitman, right, introduced Charles Heyde to his sister, Hannah, at the Whitman family home in Brooklyn. Charles courted Hannah and the couple soon married and moved to Vermont. Whitman later regretted introducing Heyde to his sister when it became evident that he was abusive to Hannah.

Heyde might have believed this meeting with Bryant would change his life, but it was his connection with the younger poet that proved far more significant. That man’s name was Walt Whitman. Though a virtual unknown at the time, Whitman had recently begun writing some of the poems he would include in “Leaves of Grass,” the poetry collection that would make him a household name. 
Walt liked Heyde enough that he invited him to visit the Whitman homestead. There Heyde met and soon wooed Whitman’s favorite sister, Hannah. The couple married in March 1852. That same year, Charles and Hannah traveled north to Vermont, taking the train to North Dorset.
Like other members of the so-called Hudson River School of landscape painters, Heyde was looking for inspiring views. Named after one of their favorite subjects, the Hudson River School painters were a group of artists who, from roughly 1825 to 1875, strove to depict the natural beauty of their young country. In addition to the Hudson River Valley, many painters made regular pilgrimages to the White Mountains of New Hampshire.
Perhaps seeking something off the artists’ beaten path, Heyde chose Vermont. He would make the state his principal subject, and soon his home, for the final four decades of his life. In the process, he became one of Vermont’s most prominent landscape painters of the 19th  century, along with James Hope of Castleton.
In a letter, Heyde wrote rapturously of the scenery: “Nothing can exceed the wild, bold, natural beauty of this place at present. The hues are incomparable and the artist who in his studio imagines himself a creator or interpreter of nature and her glorious beauties, he finds himself humbled … a child in power, only possessing wonder, admiration and the conviction of his weakness.”
For the next four years, the Heydes divided their time between Brooklyn and Vermont. Visiting Dorset, Rutland, Arlington and Bellows Falls, Charles painted scenes along the Connecticut River, Saxtons River, the Batten Kill and the Black River. During that time, the Heydes moved from boardinghouse to boardinghouse. While Charles found the work stimulating, Hannah wrote home that she felt lonely and found it difficult to form friendships because of their transient lifestyle. 
In 1856, he and Hannah moved to Vermont permanently. They picked the bustling port community of Burlington, an area ripe with scenery that Heyde would paint again and again — the peaks of Mount Mansfield and Camel’s Hump, as well as Lake Champlain backed by the distant Adirondacks. 
Burlington’s comparatively small population posed a challenge for an artist trying to earn a living. While most Hudson River School painters lived in New York, Boston or Philadelphia, Heyde had chosen a town whose population was less than 8,000 when he and Hannah arrived. The population would peak at about 14,000 during their time there, but that was still a small pool of potential buyers.
Heyde was enterprising, selling paintings directly from his studio and arranging to exhibit his work in downtown storefront windows and hotel lobbies, where they might catch the eye of travelers.
Greenville Benedict, editor of the Burlington Daily Free Press, quickly became an admirer and frequently mentioned Heyde’s paintings in his paper. A typical article from 1858, headlined “A Fine Painting,” informed  “Lovers of art and Vermont scenery” that a Heyde landscape could be viewed at James Brinsmaid’s store on Church Street, but warned that it would only be on display for 10 days. Such notices helped attract Heyde’s main collectors, middle- and upper-class Burlingtonians who wished to show hometown pride in how they decorated their homes.
Heyde soon established a studio at the corner of Maple Street and Water (now Battery) Street, in the Rutland and Burlington Railroad depot. The location was extremely convenient for his painting forays. In preparing for a 2001 retrospective of the artist’s work at the University of Vermont’s Fleming Museum, exhibit co-curator Thomas Pierce scouted nearby locations from which Heyde had painted. He found that many of the spots were near the train tracks, leading Pierce to theorize that Heyde took advantage of the rail lines that were fast expanding in his era. 
In his research, Pierce noted how Heyde must have visited the locations many times. Over the years the painter’s canvases recorded changes to the landscape. Early views of Mount Mansfield from across Browns River in Jericho, which would become a classic Heyde composition, show a line of trees along the water. In later canvases, the trees are gone — possibly the result of flooding, Pierce suggests — and a barn, missing in the early pieces, appears in the midground. In that way, surveying Heyde’s works can feel like watching a time-lapse film of Vermont’s development during the second half of the 19th century. 
Unlike many Hudson River School painters, Heyde didn’t erase all evidence of human habitation. His paintings often show signs of expanding settlement, including tree stumps and dirt roads leading into the wilderness, as well as technological advancements: trains dwarfed by the serene scenery and steamboats set upon a luminous Lake Champlain. His paintings suggest he believed that in Vermont modern innovations and awe-inspiring nature were compatible.
Charles Heyde didn’t shy away from depicting signs of human impacts on nature, like these tree stumps in a cleared field in “Shelburne Point at Sunset,” painted circa 1857. Contributed

Heyde’s paintings still resonate today. As William Lipke, a UVM art professor noted in a 2001 essay, many of the views Heyde chose to depict are relatively unchanged today and are “‘places of delight’ that identify the unique topographical and scenic features of the Champlain Valley.”  
In 1862, Heyde won a prestigious commission from the Vermont Legislature to redesign the state coat of arms. Heyde’s version included symbols from the previous coat of arms: a pine tree, sheaves of wheat and a cow. These he set against a backdrop of mountains clearly identifiable as Camel’s Hump and Mount Mansfield.
The Heydes finally found a permanent home in 1864 when they purchased a brick house at 21 Pearl Street, right next to Battery Park, which has a spectacular view of Lake Champlain and the distant Adirondacks. 
The tranquil landscapes Heyde depicted contrasted sharply with life at home. In fact, the Heydes’ marriage was an increasingly rocky one. Hannah wrote regularly to her mother and siblings of her husband’s abusive behavior.  “He does not hurt me much when he gets angry,” she had written her mother in 1856, “he threatened to choke me to death(,) he has struck or pushed me about some, once he bit me a little on the shoulder(,) more to hurt(,) tore or ripped the sleeves of my dress that I wore but all that I care nothing at all about, if he would not talk so to me.”
It would have been easier for Hannah if her husband also treated other people this way but, she wrote, “he can leave my room with the most horrid mouth and be as pleasant as any one you ever saw to any one he meets.”
The Whitmans would sometimes mail Hannah books, or money when the Heydes ran into financial trouble, which she said “Charlie,” as she called her husband, would sometimes take. Heyde made a habit of reading the letters Hannah exchanged with her family.
For his part, Heyde complained about Hannah, or “Han,” as he referred to her, in letters to her family. Writing to Mrs. Whitman and to Walt, who he addressed as “Brother Walter,” Heyde called Hannah lazy and neglectful of her housework; said she often took to her bed, saying she was ill; claimed she would noisily interrupt him in his home studio and rifle through his things; and was suspicious when he returned from outings, sniffing his coat, gloves and handkerchief, accusing him of having an affair.
The Whitmans fully supported Hannah and helped her the best they could. But they lacked the financial resources to extract her from her apparently abusive marriage. If Hannah wanted to leave Charles, she would have found it challenging; married women had few legal rights. Walt Whitman clearly regretted introducing his sister to this man who he now called “a damned lazy scoundrel.”
Meanwhile during this time, Heyde faced a serious professional challenge. The new field of photography was muscling in on the turf that had been painters’ sole domain. 
“Because he was up against photography as competition he had to keep his paintings at a price that was affordable,” explained Pierce. As a result, critics say that Heyde’s later works don’t measure up to his earlier ones. “He couldn’t spend a week doing a painting anymore,” Pierce said, “he had to spend two days, because the more you work it, the more expensive it becomes.”
Some also claim that Heyde’s work started to suffer because he was drinking too much and showing signs of dementia. Pierce thinks that’s not accurate. He pointed to a set of four paintings that recently came up for auction. They are fine examples of the artist’s skill, even though they were painted in the 1880s, late in his career. Heyde hadn’t lost his touch, said Pierce, who suspects the paintings were well-paid commissions, so he didn’t have to rush them.

The only known surviving portrait of Heyde is an etching that appeared as part of a newspaper advertisement for a patent medicine in spring 1892. In the ad, Heyde and a half dozen other prominent Vermonters offered testimonials about the virtues of Paine’s Celery Compound, which had been devised by Windsor druggist Milton K. Paine and was manufactured and sold nationally by a Burlington company. The product claimed to cure a variety of ills, including neuralgia, dyspepsia, constipation and biliousness, as well as liver and kidney ailments.
“I avail myself of the privilege of thanking you — sincerely — for the refreshing sleep I have enjoyed through the efficacy of Paine’s Celery Compound,” Heyde said in the ad. 
(The product’s ingredients included celery and coriander seed, orange and lemon peel, hydrochloric acid, glycerin and simple syrup. An analysis of the compound after passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act in 1906 revealed that it was also about 20% alcohol.)
Heyde was diagnosed with chronic dementia and admitted to the Vermont State Asylum in Waterbury, where he died on Nov. 3, 1892. He is buried a short distance from the home he shared with Hannah, in Burlington’s Lakeview Cemetery.
Hannah remained in their Pearl Street home for the rest of her life. After she died in 1908, her body was transported back to Brooklyn for burial. The Heydes’ home stood until 1968, when it was demolished as part of an urban renewal project. St. Paul’s Cathedral now stands at the site.
Of course, artists’ work outlives them. 
Like many Charles Heyde paintings, “Lake Champlain and Rock Point,” painted in 1858, is owned by a Burlington-area family. Contributed
The Fleming Museum staged its first Heyde retrospective in 1965, three-quarters of a century after the artist’s death. At the time, 80 paintings were known to exist. For the 2001 show, Pierce and his co-curator Eleazer Durfee tracked down another 74 paintings. Although they found Heyde paintings as far away as Alaska, most had never left the area. They had been passed down through families. Some hung over fireplaces, while a few had been stored and forgotten in attics.
In the quarter century since that show, Pierce received numerous tips about other Heydes held in private collections or being offered for sale. Pierce meticulously logs each newly discovered piece in a digital catalogue he created. By his count, Heydes’ known surviving works now number 226. 
Among the more unusual paintings Pierce has discovered are four from the early 1850s, before the painter had ever visited Vermont. They feature views of New York’s Hudson River. “So now,” said Pierce, “our Hudson River painter has a Hudson River painting.”

Plans include sprucing up the old depot foundation and renovating the old schoolhouse.

This story by Patrick Bilow was first published by the News & Citizen on Oct. 16, 2025.
Recreationists exploring the Lamoille Valley Rail Trail could be forgiven for bypassing Wolcott, but there’ll soon be no excuse.
There’s a one-room library, an inviting gazebo and parking lot at the trailhead on School Street, but without public bathrooms or much indoor space, the area serves as more of a launch pad for the trail than a destination for people using it.
With 20,253 users in the second half of 2024 and 15,699 in the first half of 2025, Wolcott is the fourth most popular town on the trail, just behind Cambridge and Johnson, despite having a fraction of the accommodations as those towns. The Wolcott Store is half a mile away, over a one-way bridge and along Route 15 with its narrow shoulder.

But for eastbound travelers, some say the best of the rail trail starts in Wolcott. From the parking lot on School Street, riders, runners and walkers typically hang a left toward Hardwick — over the Fisher Bridge, the last covered train bridge to operate in Vermont, and along the Lamoille River to the front gates of the Northeast Kingdom, right now dipped in gold and red for a few more short days.
The stretch of rail trail from Wolcott to Hardwick is one of Michelle Gudorf’s favorite sections, and it’s definitely her husband’s. They live in Wolcott, but they’ve walked the entire length of the rail trail in chunks since it opened last year, and still their home section stands out.
As a resident who works at the town offices just steps away from the rail trail, Michelle is happy to live and work so close to such a beautiful part of the trail. Not everyone is so lucky, and for those who travel to Wolcott to hop on the rail trail, there hasn’t been much of a reason to hang around, post-adventure. But that’s all changing.
For starters, Wolcott is boosting its curb appeal and creating a clear connection to the trail. In addition to clearing overgrown trees and vegetation and planting a new kiosk with fresh maps along the trail, the town received a grant to resurrect the old train depot foundation at the intersection of the rail trail and the connector trail.
When the railroad was operational, the current library operated as a depot on the foundation. The building was later relocated to serve a more useful purpose as a library a few hundred yards away, but the foundation still stands beneath long grass and short trees.
Utilizing a grant, the town has plans to cut back the vegetation and fill the foundation with gravel to create a rest area with picnic tables and two giant outdoor planters, which were hand-painted at a community event. The new kiosk will also have historical information about the depot and its relocation.

Data provided by the Department of Transportation shows that, even if most towns along the rail trail only see the same amount of traffic they saw on their sections of the rail trail as they did the second half of last year, most of them are set to well exceed the previous year’s use. Graph courtesy of the Vermont Agency of Transportation
On the other end of the connector path, the rail trail has helped justify some major community upgrades in Wolcott.
Different town entities are developing a plan to renovate the old schoolhouse on School Street, which is connected to the town offices, and move the library next door into the renovated schoolhouse. The current library would then be leased as a café or restaurant with ice cream, accommodating residents of Wolcott and trail users alike.
A coinciding effort to build a decentralized wastewater system in Wolcott — the first of its kind for the town — would also mean public toilets and running water at the trailhead.
Although the area is removed from businesses on Route 15 in Wolcott, the nexus of the rail trail, library, town offices and a new business would create an important community hub, according to Linda Martin, Wolcott selectboard chair.
“There’s been a lot of interest for years to see something done with the old schoolhouse,” Martin said, saying rail trail momentum has helped the town bring those desires to fruition.
Trust in Wolcott
Reigniting an old effort, a few townspeople earlier this year established the Wolcott Community Trust and began fundraising to pay for the schoolhouse renovation. The project is expected to cost $1 million, and the trust has secured $300,000 through a Village Trust Initiative grant, which should cover the planning and early-construction phases, Martin said, adding she’s confident in various fundraising efforts for the remainder of the cost. In most of those grant applications, the rail trail is listed as a burgeoning community asset.
“We’ve got these big goals we’re working towards as a town, and the rail trail has opened up some good opportunities,” Martin said.
The trust initially considered opening the café in the old schoolhouse, but the library could use more space, and its current building fits an intimate café setting, Martin added.

For gas station purchases, used books, cannabis and smoked fish — all nearby on Route 15 in Wolcott — a renovation to the bridge on School Street will create a safer path to and from the rail trail.
The bridge will be closed from March to September next summer. It will have a pedestrian walkway when it opens again, replacing the current right of way that’s barely large enough for one vehicle.
The bridge has sustained damage over years of floods. It’s been stabilized but needs a permanent fix. Because the town opted to close the bridge during construction, and not build a temporary bridge, the state is covering the cost of the project, save for initial, planning costs of around $80,000, Martin said.

We need a permanent mind shift in how we think about local businesses and how we value their role as economic cornerstones of our communities.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Drew Simmons: It’s time to invest in Vermont’s outdoor businesses.","This commentary is by Drew Simmons, of Waitsfield. He is the president of Pale Morning Media, a public relations and strategic communications agency specializing in the outdoor world. He is a board member of the Vermont Outdoor Business Alliance and a founding steering committee member of the Vermont Outdoor Recreation Economic Collaborative.


​​In late May, as the first wave of tariff impacts seeped into the outdoor industry, The New York Times profiled two Vermont business owners, Carina Hamel and Robby Ringer of BIVO, who detailed how the erratic and weighty new tariffs had fundamentally changed the math of their business. 
“I still feel super optimistic we can make it through this,” said Hamel, explaining how she could only afford 8,000 of 30,000 bottles in an incoming order because of the tariffs. “But I think it’s going to be really freaking hard.”
Tariffs are fees charged to manufacturers the moment a product arrives in the United States. When tariff levels go up or go down, so does the amount of fees charged on arriving shipments. Like a pebble thrown in a pond, every tariff adjustment has a ripple effect, adding a fresh layer of complexity for the manufacturer. 
When dozens of pebbles are thrown? The overlapping ripples can make planning for the most basic business efforts a daunting task. 
Early on, outdoor gearmakers absorbed the new fees in hopes they would vanish by mid-summer. Yet as tariffs have risen and fallen (and risen again), gearmakers understandably began adjusting prices and passing along some of the new costs to their retailers. But along with passed-down costs has come a passed-down dilemma: Raise prices and risk losing customers? Or hold the line and risk losing your business?
Caleb Magoon, owner of Waterbury Sports, recently told me about “nearly daily updates” on price changes, speculations on price changes and changes to existing changes. He likened it to “whack-a-mole” and expressed how huge the challenge has been. Jen Roberts, co-owner of Onion River Outdoors, got more specific with me about the impacts of these retroactive price changes: “Will we trim our fall orders and carry less to meet our budget? If so, will our sales decrease and threaten a death spiral? Will we pass on the price increases in whole or in part to our customers?”
In Vermont, outdoor recreation delivers $2.1 billion of annual economic impact, and retailers make up around 20% of that total number. They hire your family, your friends, your neighbors. They fix your flat tires and give friendly tips on the best place to see peak foliage. They pay local taxes that support local things, and they regularly donate far beyond what’s owed to their communities. 
According to Grassroots Outdoor Alliance, a national organization of independent specialty retailers, 95% of stores give back at least 1% in gross sales to their community, and more than half give back at least 2%.
“People say there are only two expenses you can realistically control in a retail business: inventory and payroll,” Roberts said. “I guess I’m seeing that in action now. With inventory prices going up dramatically due to the tariffs, we have no choice but to cut our payroll expenses. I can’t stomach lowering anyone’s already meager wages or even freezing them at their current level, so we are going to get by with fewer staff.”
Retailers are a resilient bunch, as they’ve endured plenty of uncertainty in the past from rainy summers to Covid-19 shutdowns. But those previous challenges were always external, not eating away at profitability from the inside. They also have not happened during a time of rising inflation and historic drop-off in Canadian visitors. 
The hard truth is that Vermont is not going to be able to bake sale its way out of this. It’s time to do more than make an occasional, feel-good purchase at a local store, and it’s time for a permanent mind shift in how we think about local businesses and how we value their role as economic cornerstones. Who owns a business matters just as much as what that business sells, that money capable of building a future for the local community. 
“People appreciate having local businesses, and for many, I suspect this makes up part of why they live in Vermont,” said Hal Ellms of Pinnacle Outdoor Group, an outdoor industry sales representative who works directly with outdoor retailers throughout Vermont and the region. “But they buy their bikes, shoes, clothing, skis and more from online businesses based thousands of miles away. It’s as if they don’t make the connection between their definition of local Vermont and what their actual actions are.”
This month, Vermont retailers are once again stocking cozy sweaters, hiking boots and wool socks for the fall season; for locals and visitors, it’s a scene as predictable as the changing of the leaves. But as predictability went out the window months ago for those behind the cash register, it is on us to provide some stability of our own. 
We need to think about our dollars in the same way independent retailers do — as money from today that goes toward building the realities of tomorrow. 
These are not just purchases, but investments — investments that fill the shelves for next winter and spring, that build our roads and trails and schools and that support the people and places we need. Because without those investments, that future is in doubt.

Now he sets out just a couple dozen traps, out of curiosity — or force of habit — and he’s lucky to catch 10 lobsters.
“I’ve been doing it all my life. I gotta see for myself,” he said. “But as far as trying to make a living, you can’t do it, not any more.”
Mansi converted his lobster wholesale facility on the dock in Guilford into a restaurant in the early 2000s. In the upstairs office on a sunny September morning, there are a few reminders of the life he used to lead: a “Captain’s Quarters” sign, framed photos from his lobstering heyday, the mast of his son’s fishing boat swaying gently out the window. 
His eyes lit up as he recalled the good days. “We saw a lot of lobsters, a real lot of lobsters,” Mansi said.

In the 1980s and ’90s, Mansi was making a killing, along with the roughly 1,200 commercial lobstermen on Long Island Sound. The Sound was the third most-productive lobster fishery in the country, with 10 million pounds of lobster landings at its peak in 1998, including 3.8 million pounds in Connecticut.
But in the fall of 1999, lobstermen pulled up traps filled with limp, sickly lobsters, and soon after, hardly any lobsters at all. It was an unprecedented mortality event, and the lobster population never recovered. Connecticut saw only 181,000 pounds of lobster landings in 2024, less than 5% of the 1998 peak. Now most seafood restaurants in the state — including Mansi’s — import lobster from Maine or Canada.
The catastrophic die-off is still an emotional subject for Mansi and so many former lobstermen. In addition to the painful memory of losing their livelihoods practically overnight, resentment lingers about how it happened. The scientific consensus is that warming waters, and an epidemic of a crustacean disease called paramoebiasis, were the primary culprits — and that pesticides used to combat West Nile virus may have had an additional effect.

An occasional look at Connecticut’s remarkable people, places and things
But the catastrophe was complex and unprecedented, and not all scientists agree on which factors were the most significant. The lobstermen almost unanimously blame the pesticides, and they feel betrayed by the chemical manufacturers, the marine scientists, and the government — whose tightening regulations they resented and whose financial assistance they found inadequate. 
In the early 2000s, as they fought for accountability and answers, the lobstermen had no choice but to adapt to the new reality. Some switched to fishing, clamming or catching conch, but most sold their boats and left the fishing docks behind entirely. 
Now there are no full-time commercial lobstermen left in Connecticut.
But there are still a few part-timers. In the southeasternmost corner of the state, the Stonington port is home to seven active lobster boats. Other than one boat in New London, Stonington is the last bastion of commercial lobstering in Connecticut. Roddy Grimshaw is one of the few in Stonington still at it, a man of 29 who goes lobstering with his dad and a small crew a few days a week.
It’s not just lobstering that’s in decline — all forms of commercial fishing are under threat as luxury development supplants the docks once home to a vibrant blue-collar fishing culture. 
Grimshaw put it this way: “The way I see it, if we don’t stay active … this will become just another yacht club.”

The heyday
Mansi has fond memories of fishing with his family as a kid growing up in East Haven in the late 1960s.
“I just loved being out on the water, the freedom,” he said. At that time, the Connecticut lobster industry was picking up steam after a decades-long lull around the turn of the century. His dad wasn’t a lobsterman, more of a recreational fisherman, but, eyeing the hauls of lobstermen down at the docks, he decided to give it a shot. He started working on a friend’s father’s lobster boat while he was in high school in the 1970s. Then, in 1983, he bought his own boat, the Jani M.— named after his wife — and went into business for himself. And business was good.
“When you left the dock, you knew you were gonna catch lobsters. It was exciting. You’re dying to pull that first trap to see what was in it. And, you know, they were almost always full,” he said.
In the ’80s and ’90s, Mansi was landing up to 100,000 pounds per year on just his boat, over 50% of the state’s entire 2024 haul. At a market price of $3 per pound, he was making a killing. He also started the Guilford Lobster Pound, a wholesaler that bought lobster from other fishermen and sold it to Connecticut retailers and restaurants.

Mansi described a vibrant waterfront community at the Guilford Marina and at fishing docks across the state. He pointed to a newspaper article framed on his wall, which told the story of a fellow Guilford lobsterman who suffered a heart attack. 
“We got six lobstermen all together, and we ended up going out and pulling all his gear. We brought all his lobsters to the pound here, we sold his lobsters, and we gave him a check. We all stuck together,” he said. 
Mansi wasn’t the only one to turn a high school lobstering job into a lucrative career in those years. Some 30 miles down the Sound in Norwalk, Gary Whetmore grew up lobstering with his dad. 
“My father lobstered on a very small scale, and then I got into it on a much bigger scale,” Whetmore said. “I remember swapping lobsters with a gym teacher to get out of classes.”

“It was fun. It wasn’t work. The money was great, but it was the freedom of it. You could make as much or as little as you wanted to make. And if you worked hard enough, you could have anything you want in the world,” he said.
One might think that the accelerating lobster hauls in those days — a roughly six-fold increase in Connecticut from the 1970s to the 1990s — risked depleting the lobster population. Counterintuitively, the reverse was true.
“There were a lot of lobsters,” Whetmore continued, “but it wasn’t natural.” 
Connecticut lobstermen from that era describe their work not as catching lobsters but, rather, “farming”  them. 
“We were feeding them and letting them go,” Whetmore said. Indeed, in the ’80s and ’90s, lobstermen were stuffing millions of pounds of bait fish — pogy, mackerel, and others — into tens of thousands of traps in Long Island Sound. 
The influx of bait represented a huge supplement to the lobsters’ natural food sources, artificially increasing the population to levels never before seen in the Sound. It was great for business, but scientists say the crowded crustacean conditions on the seafloor, combined with the unnaturally young population — lobstermen harvested them as soon as they reached the minimum size required by regulation — likely left them more vulnerable to the disease that decimated the population in the late ’90s. It was the boom before the bust.
“It was not sustainable. Something was going to give,” Whetmore said. “There were no big lobsters here. As soon as they were legal, we harvested them. We’re feeding them, we’re growing them, and we’re harvesting, and whoever worked the hardest harvested the most. And that’s as simple as it was.” 
“It was really, really good, and when it ended, it ended,” Whetmore said.
Mansi spoke of the sudden die-off with a similar sense of finality. “You go out there one day, and that’s it. Overnight, it was done. It was ended,” he said.

The die-off
In the years leading up to the widespread die-off in the fall of 1999, there were early signs of trouble. Two localized lobster mortality events occurred in the western Sound, from Norwalk to Greenwich, in 1997 and 1998.
Whetmore, just a few miles further east, took heed of those early warnings. “I heard about the die-off getting as far up as Greenwich in ’98. And I told my guys that were working for me: If it happens next year, and it comes this way, we’re done. And sure enough, it got here,” he said.
In August 1999, dead lobsters started washing up on beaches along the Sound. On Sept. 16, Tropical Storm Floyd hit the region, dumping up to 12 inches of rain into the Sound in just two days.
By the following week, Long Island Sound’s lobster industry practically collapsed. 
“A week after the storm, when I went out, the lobsters in the pots were nothing but goo. It smelled. It was nothing but lobster parts,” said Tony Carlo, a Darien lobsterman.
The Western Sound was hit the hardest, that fall experiencing a 99% reduction in lobster landings compared to the previous year. Ports in the east of the Sound saw reductions of 64% to 91%.
At first, neither the lobstermen nor marine scientists had a clear understanding of the cause. A New York Times headline on Oct. 18, 1999, read, “Scientists Are Mystified by Deaths Of Lobsters in Long Island.” 
But there was a suspicious coincidence. In August, just a month before the storm, the government began applying pesticides, including resmethrin and methoprene, across Connecticut and New York to curb the spread of West Nile Virus. Because lobsters are related to insects, which the pesticides were designed to kill, many suspected that the runoff from the storm poisoned the lobsters. 
In January 2000, a “commercial fishery failure” was declared in the Sound, and the federal government authorized $13.9 million to provide economic relief for the lobstermen and to fund research into the causes of the disaster. Over 20 research projects across a slew of institutions and agencies were approved. 
When the studies concluded by 2004, a clearer picture emerged. A parasitic amoeba, Neoparamoeba pemaquidensis, had infected and killed the lobsters. But it wasn’t just the disease. Researchers referred to a “perfect storm” of contributing factors. Years of above-average water temperatures weakened the immune systems of the lobsters, which are extremely sensitive to temperature increases. The storm may have accelerated the die-off by churning up the waters, bringing warmer temperatures to the already sick lobsters. Furthermore, the unnaturally high and primarily juvenile population was particularly vulnerable to infection.
“When you have a bunch of young animals all together, just like a cold in a classroom at school, the disease spreads through them pretty quickly,” said biologist Nancy Balcom, associate director of Connecticut Sea Grant, who was involved in research after the die-off and published several articles summarizing the findings.
In the decades since 1999, the lobster population would appear to rebound in some years with a new crop of juvenile lobsters. 
“But then a few years later, you didn’t see the adults,” Balcom said. This is consistent with the finding that the water is just getting too warm for the lobsters to tolerate, even though the paramoebiosis epidemic has passed. Long Island Sound has historically been the southernmost tip of the inshore range of the American lobster. With global warming, that map is being redrawn, and their range may soon terminate in Massachusetts.

The pesticides
The role of the pesticides loomed large immediately after the die-off. Toxicology testing and several modeling exercises were conducted, but even the “worst case scenario” model indicated that the concentration of the chemicals never reached lethal levels for the lobsters. The scientific consensus is that the pesticides were not the primary cause of the die-off.
That consensus, however, is not ironclad, and most of the lobstermen don’t buy it.
“The pesticides are what killed them,” Mansi said. “We actually see what’s going on. We were there, and we’re telling you what we saw. They [the scientists] have never been on the water, they just sit in a lab and they make up these models that we have to adhere to.”
The timing of the pesticide application and the storm runoff was uncanny, and the lobstermen observed strange, hyperactive behavior in some living lobsters they caught after the die-off, as well as in certain species of crabs. Mansi helped recruit a biologist the lobstermen considered one of their own, Dr. Robert Bayer of Maine’s Lobster Institute. Bayer came down to Connecticut, performed his own tests, and concluded that the lobsters hauled alive during the 1999 event “showed the behaviors, classic behaviors, of pesticide poisoning — which is hyperactivity.” 
In the months and years that followed, while the government-funded studies were still underway, the lobstermen initiated a class action lawsuit against Cheminova and other pesticide makers, eventually receiving two settlements, for $12.5 million and $3.75 million. The lobstermen see the settlement as a vindication of their hypothesis, while Balcom says the pesticide makers never admitted to causing the die-off and merely settled to make the lawsuit go away. 
“If the pesticides were the primary cause of death, they would have received probably lots more money,” she said.  
Tarsila Seara, a social scientist who studies fishing communities, views the science as less settled, and she understands the animosity Mansi and many other lobstermen still feel towards the biologists, the pesticide companies and the government. In 2019, while a professor at the University of New Haven, she interviewed 20 former lobstermen and published two papers about the social impacts of the die-off.
“There was a dismissal of their experience and the knowledge that the fishermen were trying to bring to the table,” Seara said. “It should have been dealt with differently.”

“The reality is that it was a very complex combination of factors, and the lobstermen really wanted to find the one thing that they could blame, and they were naturally upset because there was no backing of that one culprit,” she said. 
Tony Carlo and Roger Frate, cousins who started lobstering in the 1970s in central Connecticut, were active in the fight against the pesticide companies in the early 2000s. Frate now runs the Darien Seafood Market with Carlo’s help. Alongside tanks with live lobsters (now imported from Maine or Canada), the store has multiple display cases with newspaper articles documenting the die-off and ensuing legal battles. On a warm August afternoon, Carlo wore a red baseball cap with an image of a lobster, and Roger wore a T-shirt with the Darien Seafood Market’s lobster insignia. 
The two cousins are still angry at the chemical makers, politicians and marine scientists they see as responsible for causing — or failing to address — the destruction of their livelihood. 
“We lost everything within a three-week period,” Carlo said.
“We fought in Washington, Hartford, Boston … we fought against some big people at the chemical companies. We kept going for years and years,” Frate said.
Frate and Carlo see the government’s regulatory response in the 2000s — mandating an increase in “gauge” size (a device used to measure the minimum-sized lobsters legal to catch), as well as a 90-day moratorium imposed on lobstering from early September to early December — as harmful and misguided. 
“From beginning to end, it seemed like they were always against us, to slow us down one way or another,” Carlo said.

They argued for years that the real culprit was toxicity from the pesticides, as well as an accumulation of other pollutants from decades of runoff into the Sound. They asked for money to “clean up” the Sound and more financial support for the struggling lobstermen. But their pleas fell on deaf ears. 
Frate and Carlo hold a litany of grudges against the Connecticut and New York politicians of that era. 
“Schumer would never call us back … Blumenthal’s telling lies … Chris Shays, that piece of shit. You got your money. The state got their money. Now the fisheries’ money’s not there,” Frate said. 
Frate and Carlo did eventually collect checks from the pesticide maker settlements. “But it wasn’t about the money,” Carlo said. “We’d give it all back to them if they could give us back Long Island Sound. We want our lobster back.”

A difficult adjustment
Seara, the social scientist, understands the animosity towards the government in the years following the die-off. 
“They were not being supported when they were going through something that was very impactful, very traumatic,” she said. “Some of the programs the government put in place were not well received. They didn’t seem to make sense to a lot of the fishermen.”
Over the years, there were some experiments with lobster trap buyback programs, which paid lobstermen to recover the thousands of abandoned pots littering the seafloor. In September, these programs received a $1.8 million boost of federal funding.
Other programs included various job retraining efforts, which lobstermen like Mansi scoff at to this day.
“They said, ‘We’ll train you.’ Well, there’s no retraining. You don’t take a guy that’s been fishing on the water all his life and retrain him to go work in an office. It’s something that you can’t do,” Mansi said.
What made the prospect of retraining particularly unappealing is that, for so many lobstermen, lobstering is not just a job but a deeply held identity and beloved lifestyle. Seara, along with her mentor, Professor Richard Pollnac, have studied fishing communities across the world, and they’ve found that self-employed fishermen experience some of the highest levels of job satisfaction of any workers. 
“It’s the freedom, being out in the water, being close to nature, and some aspects that are thrilling. It’s a gamble, right? You’re out there, you don’t know what you’re going to get. Every day is different. You have encounters with nature, whales, and beautiful sunsets, and, on top of it, this adventure and this challenge, and this camaraderie,” Seara said. 
“A fisherman once put it to me like this: ‘What other profession in the world do you know that people pay to do over the weekend?’” she said.

Each lobsterman took their own path after the die-off. Some turned to clamming or catching conch, but most couldn’t find a way to support themselves on the water. Many struggled. 
“We had a lot of guys who became alcoholics or drug addicts,” Mansi said. 
“We had to move on,” Mansi said. “I am still bitter about what happened, because not only did they wipe out an industry, they wiped out a way of life,” he said.
Mansi turned his lobster pound on the docks in Guilford into a seasonal restaurant. He considers himself lucky, as he’s still able to work down by the water, and his son runs a fishing boat out of the same port.
Carlo initially got a job doing manual labor down at the docks in Norwalk for $10 an hour, “just to do something and stay near the water,” but it didn’t pay the bills. He was forced to find a new career, so he started a landscaping business, which he still runs. 
“Landscaping, being on land … I hated it. Hated it. I hate it to this day,” Carlo said.
One of the few who seemed to transition smoothly was Whetmore. Immediately after the die-off, he got into marine construction, and he now runs a successful business out of Norwalk, G&C Marine, which primarily builds residential docks. 
Whetmore was included in Seara’s 2019 study; notably, he was the sole lobsterman out of the 20 interviewed who said they believe that warming waters and the disease were to blame for the die-off. Even his own son insists it was the pesticides.
“You can’t argue the numbers. You know, the bottom temperature, it’s there,” Whetmore said. 
He attributes his ability to adapt — and his acceptance of immovable forces like global warming — to a feeling that he is lucky to be alive. In the last two decades, he’s had two kidney transplants, cancer and multiple heart attacks. 
“I’m still here,” he said. “And I think that’s allowed me to bounce back a little bit more than these other guys. Yeah, you lost your lobsters. That’s too bad. Get a life.”

The last lobster fleet
Stonington’s working docks smell like diesel and bait. 
On a sunny September afternoon, a flock of gulls circled the docks as the Lady Lynn cruised into the harbor — 42 feet of scuffed fiberglass, stacked with crusty lobster traps. The Lady Lynn is one of seven lobster boats still operating out of Stonington, the last commercial lobster fleet in Connecticut.
Roddy Grimshaw was on deck with his crew, Ian Crimm and Bubba Dolith, his 10-month-old puppy, Bailey, who ran back and forth excitedly, and his dad, Mike, who bought the Lady Lynn back in the ’70s. They were in a rush to haul out all their traps before Sept. 7, when the season closed for 90 days.
After unloading all the traps into massive stacks on the dock, Grimshaw took a breather. 
“When I’m on the boat, I’m always active, doing something like hauling lobsters, driving the boat, hauling the gear, seeing interesting things. I just, I love it, and I love to tan,” he said, laughing. Grimshaw showed off a new tattoo of a lobster on his very tan forearm.
“It’s been a good year,” he said.

Grimshaw was averaging 160 lobsters (totaling about 200 pounds) each time he pulled traps. Though it’s a far cry from the quadruple digits his dad used to haul back in the ’90s, it’s an improvement from last year. 
“It could last this winter. We could have another great season. But we also could have a really shitty season. Let’s hope,” he said.
It’s not a coincidence that the last remnants of the state’s lobster industry are located in Stonington. Just outside of Long Island Sound, only a few miles from the Rhode Island border, the area has somewhat cooler water, and its fishery wasn’t hit as hard by the die-off in the ’90s. 
These days, Grimshaw lobsters two to three days per week and the rest of the week goes out “dragging” for fish — flounder, whiting, sea bass and others. But lobstering is his true love, and he’d like to dedicate himself to it full-time, though he says the catch is just too variable to rely on. His eyes lit up when he considered the possibility. “It’s a big, big idea, and it would be so great,” he said.
One of his other struggles is fetching a reasonable price for the lobsters he lands. Lobster imported from Maine and Canada for roughly $3 per pound dominate the market, which just isn’t enough to cover his costs. So he sells directly to the public on the docks in addition to selling to wholesalers who are willing to pay about $7 per pound, this year’s going rate for Connecticut lobsters.

His crew members, Crimm, 18 and Dolith, 19, kidded around as they fixed up the engine and organized tools. They’re new to working with Grimshaw, who recently had to replace his entire crew after he discovered that one was drinking on the job, and the other was a registered sex offender.
Crimm and Dolith love the work, even though Grimshaw can give them a hard time. Neither of them has had what they’d consider a “normal” job — they’ve bounced between farming and other forms of manual labor — and they want to keep working on the Lady Lynn as long as there are lobster to be caught. 
“It’s not a normal 9-to-5, which I hate. I can’t do them,” Dolith said while pulling up lobster pots hanging off the side of the Lady Lynn in the harbor.
“I love this. It’s pretty fun shit,” Crimm said while removing and sorting the lobsters. “Who else gets paid to go out on a boat all the time?”
Their boss, Grimshaw, plans to take over his dad’s lobstering license in January. At 29, as the youngest active commercial lobster captain in the state, he’ll represent both the next generation and the last of the line. 
Grimshaw understands the weight of his position.
“There’s not many other people here that does it, that wants to do it,” Grimshaw said. 
He pointed to a seafood restaurant and yacht club visible in the distance. “If this harbor wasn’t here, it wouldn’t make a difference to the tourists and out-of-town people. And I just don’t want to see that,” he said.
“I want to continue,” he said. “I don’t see myself doing something different.”

Whetmore expressed a similar unease with the luxury development and tourism taking over the waterfront that used to be home to so many fishing and working docks. While walking around his construction yard in Norwalk one August afternoon, he pointed to the neighboring lots. 
“There were oil tankers on this river. There were fishermen going down the river. Now it’s condos and rowing clubs. It’s definitely changing. It’s been very gentrified.” 
The Norwalk Planning & Zoning Commission just approved a 59-unit mixed-use complex, with luxury apartments and a boardwalk, on the property adjacent to Whetmore’s construction yard. He said the town government has applied enormous pressure on him to move his business.
In town after town along the Sound, the working waterfront is giving way to luxury housing and recreation. A 2022 mid-Atlantic fisheries briefing flagged “persistent trends toward gentrification of working waterfronts,” noting that the loss of maritime space can upend the cultural identity of fishing communities.
“They don’t want equipment like this. They need us when we build their docks, their yacht clubs, their rowing clubs, and they love us when we’re building them, but they don’t want to see us,” Whetmore said.
“There was a community, a waterfront community, and that’s gone,” he said. “That way of life is gone.”

But now comes Kristi Noem with a 30-second video blaming the current government shutdown on the Democrats, adding an Orwellian overtone to our collective trial by air travel. Many airports — including Eisenhower in Wichita and Kansas City International — have refused to play the video at TSA checkpoints, with most citing policies which forbid the display of political messages.
Other airports, such as Charleston International, are looping the video.
The fact there is any debate over the video is a win for Noem, who directs the nation’s largest law enforcement agency, which includes U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. A former governor of South Dakota, Noem transformed herself with a dental upgrade and hair extensions to resemble other women in Trump’s MAGA orbit, and now stars in many of ICE’s action videos of immigration raids.
There’s nothing wrong with dental work and new hair, and a person’s appearance isn’t generally relevant to their job performance. But in Noem’s case, her appearance seems integral to the job. Same with Secretary of Defense (and no, not war) Pete Hegseth. Both had few qualifications and little experience for their cabinet-level jobs, but they look good on camera, in an uncanny valley kind of way.
In other administrations, the Homeland Security secretary would have been broadly mocked and possibly threatened with the Hatch Act for engaging in political activity. But not now.
In the “public service announcement” video, Noem says it is “TSA’s top priority to make sure that you have the most pleasant and efficient airport experience as possible while we keep you safe.”
Then she launches into it.
“However, Democrats in Congress refused to fund the federal government and because of this, many of our operations are impacted and most of our TSA employees are working without pay.”
This is overtly partisan and dead wrong.
The government shutdown, now almost three weeks long, is the result of Congress failing to fund the government. The House has passed a continuing resolution that would provide funding through Nov. 21, but the Senate has failed to reach the 60-vote threshold to approve a temporary spending bill. The sticking point for Democrats is the end of Affordable Care Act tax credits in the Republican spending bill, which would deny tens of millions of Americans health care.
“We will do all we can to avoid delays that will impact your travel,” Noem says in the video. “Our hope is that Democrats will soon recognize the importance of opening the government.”
While Noem’s video has gotten the most attention recently, other agencies are also plunging into partisanship. The official White House website, for example, has an incomprehensible shutdown clock (you’re left guessing whether the digits are days, hours, or seconds) that blames Democrats. Even more disturbing are partisan auto-generated emails sent from the official accounts of furloughed federal workers.
The top-down erosion of neutrality in the U.S. civil service is an alarm bell of a faltering democracy. Instead of serving the people, such partisanship serves the party — or the man — in power. And the Noem TSA video is uncomfortably close to the tactics employed by strongmen through the ages.
It is propaganda.
“Everything melted into the mist,” Winston Smith reflects in “1984,” the dystopian novel to which all other fictional dystopias are compared. “Sometimes, indeed, you could put your finger on a definite lie. It was not true, for example, as was claimed in the Party history books, that the Party had invented aeroplanes. He remembered aeroplanes since his earliest childhood. But you could prove nothing.”
We are not in 1984 yet, but since Trump’s second inauguration nine months ago we have inched ever closer to it. We now have crossed into burgeoning authoritarianism, where the politics of the leader must necessarily be the politics of a formerly nonpartisan civil service.
You can see it in Noem’s tasteless and disingenuous videos and in a hundred other acts committed weekly, from the landing of helicopters on the roofs of apartment buildings to terrorize residents during an ICE raid to the summary execution by government munitions of boats of “narco-terrorists” at sea.
What the Trump administration is offering, with its “war” on presumed drug traffickers, is the kind of violence that once seemed unthinkable for the United States. Rodrigo Duterte, the former president of the Philippines, was indicted by the International Criminal Court, and condemned by the United States, for the thousands killed on his orders for suspicion of dealing in narcotics. Now Trump’s administration appears to be practicing the kind of extra-judicial killings that put Duterte in the dock at the Hague.
With domestic immigration enforcement, ordinary residents — especially in Chicago and other blue cities — are being subjected to harassment, interrogation, and arrest by federal agents in tactical gear wearing balaclavas and other coverings to hide their faces. Some of those detained are American citizens, based on no other suspicion than the color of their skin.
George Orwell, who was writing during and after the rise of fascism in Europe, was keenly aware of his moment in time.
“Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against totalitarianism and for democratic socialism, as I understand it,” Orwell wrote shortly after the end of the second world war. “It seems to me nonsense, in a period like our own, to think that one can avoid writing of such subjects.”
It is simply a question, Orwell argues, of which side to take and what approach to follow.
“And the more one is conscious of one’s political bias, the more chance one has of acting politically without sacrificing one’s aesthetic and intellectual integrity,” he said.
Any writer of some salt will know what Orwell is talking about.
Put pen to paper or fingers to keys and sooner or later you’ll come to the jarring choice of either to scrub your beliefs from your work or let them inform it. Scrubbing pays better, if the scrub benefits the wealthy and doesn’t anger the powerful, but getting your hands dirty is more satisfying. Well, as long as you don’t write schlock and don’t do violence to fact. This is true for essays and even truer for poetry and fiction, and it helps some of us sleep at night.
What will help me to sleep tonight is describing Noem’s video as propaganda. You may have stumbled a bit the first time I used the word, because of its powerful connotations, but now is the time to use powerful words properly.
The Noem video is party propaganda.
Be troubled that your government has shredded some of the last of the norms that defined American democracy and is now engaged in demonizing the opposition party in official government communication.
And it’s not just the other party that is being labeled as the enemy, it’s anyone who engages in dissent or is part of an imagined left-wing conspiracy. A recent National Security Memorandum, ostensibly to counter political violence, prioritizes investigations of a broad swath of culture, including those who hold beliefs that are “anti-American, anti-capitalism, and anti-Christianity.” Also suspect is “extremism on migration, race, and gender; and hostility towards those who hold traditional American views on family, religion, and morality.”
This executive memorandum, signed shortly after the Charlie Kirk shooting, is a blank check for the Trump administration to criminalize free speech it finds irksome. The overly broad language suggests that any opinion that is inconsistent with Trump-defined patriotism and spirituality is synonymous with domestic terror.
Much of what has been discussed here was anticipated by Timothy Snyder’s 2017 book, “On Tyranny.” In it Snyder gives 20 lessons to resist tyranny, and I find myself returning to those lessons as the second Trump era unfolds.
Of particular interest:
Lesson No. 5, Remember Professional Ethics.
“If lawyers had followed the norm of no execution without trial, if doctors had accepted the rule of no surgery without consent, if businessmen had endorsed the prohibition of slavery, if bureaucrats had refused paperwork involving murder, then the Nazi regime would have been much harder pressed to carry out the atrocities by which we remember it.”
The Trump administration is not the Nazi regime, and we do not yet know what it will be remembered for, but the lesson is apt. By insisting on professional ethics, especially the nonpartisan tradition of civil service, we might slow the collapse of democracy. Will we be able to repair the structural damage to the nation? If we don’t, we’ll soon have another, lesser form of government.
A word is in order here about the origins of the word “propaganda,” which did not have its negative connotation until after the death camps and other horrors of World War II were exposed. The Soviet Cold War-era techniques of falsehood and misdirection cemented the modern concept in our minds. But it was the American Edward Bernays, often called the “father of modern public relations,” who advanced the term in his 1928 book.
Previously, the word had been mostly used to describe the propagation of a particular faith, but Bernays introduced us to lessons learned by World War I’s Creel Commission in promoting the war at home and abroad. Later, Bernays helped American tobacco companies sell cigarettes to women (a previously untapped market) and assisted the CIA in overthrowing the democratically-elected government of Guatemala.
“The intelligent and conscious manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in a democratic society,” Bernays wrote. “Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of this country.”
Despite the bland language, what Bernays suggested in this and other books was a roadmap to manage public opinion on behalf of governments and business. I’ve written about Bernays before, but his theories are inescapable in modern politics. The nephew of Sigmund Freud, he believed it was necessary for public relations to appeal not to the rational mind, but the sometimes dark corners of our unconscious.
Bernays relied on newspapers and radio to spread his messages. Today, the work is increasingly done through videos and social media. The RAND Corp., the public policy thinktank, has given a name to the kind of rapid-fire partial truths and outright deceits pioneered in 2008 by Russia: the “Firehose of Falsehood.” This has now come to dominate American politics as well, and more than ever professional fact checkers — journalists and scholars and dedicated civil servants at our nations’ airport — are needed to counter the damage.
Journalists have long been the target for many of the Trump administration’s attacks, but what happened Oct. 15 is the clearest sign yet that truth is under attack: Reporters for dozens of outlets left the Pentagon after having their accreditation revoked for refusing new rules that would limit their newsgathering. Under Hegseth’s policy, the journalists would have had to agree to only use authorized information provided to them by officials. Even Fox News left. It was the first time since the Pentagon opened in 1943 that no major news sources were accredited.
The Noem TSA videos are playing in just a few airports now.
But what about next time? Perhaps during the next shutdown a few more will give in, just a bit more propaganda wrapped in patriotism. And what about the shutdown after that? The videos will seem just a normal part of life, like the ever-present visage of Big Brother in “1984.”

In downtown Anchorage, protesters filled Town Square Park, and the crowd spilled over to line W 5th and W 6th avenues, where they waved signs and passing cars honked in support. 
“It’s a matter of we are losing our rights,” said Keri Lord of Anchorage, dressed in a long cape and crown for the no kings theme. “And we are headed towards fascism, and it needs to stop now.”

There were speeches, chants, poetry and songs. The crowd also showed support for the evacuees of the devastating storm in western Alaska, and urged donations and continued aid for relief and recovery efforts. Non-profits and advocacy groups hosted tables along the Atwood Concert Hall with educational materials and hot coffee. 
“It’s great to see so many people come out,” said Karan Gier, matching Lord in a cape and crown, holding a sign reading “No troops in our streets.“ And from all ages. That’s what’s especially wonderful. We’ve seen that all summer, because we’ve been to all of (the protests) all summer long. And  it makes your heart feel good to see this. We’re not a silent majority. We are loud.”
At least 25 communities held events throughout the state for No Kings day, including Kotzebue, Nome, Fairbanks, Talkeetna, Healy, Wasilla, Anchorage, Girdwood, Soldotna, Kenai, Homer, Seward, Dillingham, Kodiak, Valdez, Haines, Gustavus, Juneau, Sitka, Ketchikan and others.

More than 2,600 nonviolent demonstrations were planned across the country, and millions turned out Saturday to protest the Trump administration
Alaskan’s protest signs shared on social media and in Anchorage used humor and satire to mock and condemn President Donald Trump, his cabinet, and recent moves to expand executive powers as authoritarian. Speakers denounced cuts to federal funding and social services such as Medicaid, disregard for the rule of law, and the ongoing government shutdown.
Many protest signs denounced the deployment of U.S. military troops in Democratic-led cities across the country, and the actions of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement violently arresting immigrants and U.S. citizens.
“I love this country, and I think we should be better,” said Kathryn Schild, a life-long Anchorage resident. “I’m appalled at what we are doing to our friends and our neighbors and our loved ones.”
“And this is what we can do, right?” she said. “We have a voice, we can call, we can protest, we can stand up, and we can demand that our government work for us.”

The problem is the rules for bringing your “wheels” are much different depending on your carrier.


METRO-NORTH: You can bring your non-electric-powered bike on the train anytime except rush-hour.  Some cars include wall-mounted racks; check TrainTime for bike-friendly trains and car markings.  If you have a folding bike that can stow in the overhead rack, you can bring it anytime.
But if your bike or scooter is powered, the rules are quite different.
First, you can’t ride your e-whatever at the station, on the platform or in the train. You can only bring your wheels on the train if it folds up, weighs less than 100 pounds and is your property, i.e. not a CitiBike, VEO etc.
You cannot charge your e-bike on the train.  It must have UL-certified batteries and be stored in an area so it doesn’t block other passengers.  Whatever the rules may be, the train conductor or railroad staffer always has the final say and can stop you and your bike from being on the train.
Remember… if your final destination is Grand Central Terminal there are any number of Citi Bike stations just outside on the street.  At New Haven there are bike-shares available through Ride New Haven.
SHORE LINE EAST and HARTFORD LINE: The e-bike rules here are quite similar.  Unlike on Metro-North, regular (non-electric) bicycles are welcome anytime.  On the Harford Line, CT Rail trains welcome bikes anytime for free.  But Amtrak Hartford Line trains accept bikes only with a reservation and a charge of $20.  All e-bikes with lithium-ion batteries are banned on all trains on the line.
At Hartford’s Union Station you can rent a scooter (but no bikes) through VEO.  Bikes may be added in the future.
CT TRANSIT BUSES: Connecticut’s buses were pioneers in allowing bikes… not on the bus, but on racks mounted on the front of the bus.  The racks only hold two bikes, and its first-come, first-carried.


Only standard non-motorized bikes are allowed on racks; e-bikes, scooters, and motorized vehicles are not permitted, regardless of weight.
OTHER BUSES IN CONNECTICUT: All GBTA (Greater Bridgeport) buses are equipped to carry your bicycle… two-bike maximum, first-come first-served.  Norwalk Transit rules aren’t crystal clear.  You might want to consult your carrier’s website or ask the driver before trying to transport your device.
PORT JEFFERSON FERRY: The Port Jefferson Ferry allows bicycles and e-bikes onboard, but according to company policy, they are considered luggage and must be kept with the rider at all times.  Cyclists are required to carry their bikes as well as any baggage up and down staircases to the passenger decks.  If there’s room you can use the elevator.
Whatever your destination, always BYO (and wear) a helmet when operating on two wheels.  And remember:  E-bikes and scooters should use UL-certified batteries and never be charged aboard any vehicle or station.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/loading-bike-on-bus.jpg,,,2025-10-19 01:02:05.051734

Protesters, many wearing inflatable animal costumes and carrying signs, gathered in McPike Park in downtown Madison and marched one mile up East Washington Avenue to the Capitol, shutting down intersections and blocking the major thoroughfare for blocks, following the Forward Marching Band.
Marchers chanted “Show me what democracy looks like! This is what democracy looks like!” and “We are unstoppable! A better world is possible!”
The march started a little before the UW-Madison football team was scheduled to kick off against Ohio State. A Bucky the Badger who came to the march said he wasn’t upset about missing the game for the protest. “The People’s Bucky believes in democracy… Without democracy, there would be no games,” he said.

Candy Neumeier, a former teacher who drove down from outside of Oshkosh for the rally, said she was attending to “stand up for our rights,” which are “being trampled on by this wannabe dictator and his crew.” She wore a trash bag with Jeffrey Epstein’s face and President Donald Trump’s hand drawn on it. “I really believe that we need to release the Epstein files.”
From a stage set up on the Capitol steps, Ali Muldrow, a Madison school board member and activist who emceed the rally, said there are about 20,000 people at the protest in Wisconsin’s capital city.
Dane County Circuit Court Judge Everett Mitchell told the crowd,“Yes, judges are out here, too. I might get in trouble on Monday, but I’m here right now.”

“You’re living in the redefinition of our democracy right now. Our legal systems are being retooled, reconfigured, and realigned to incentivize ultimate power… The war for civil rights is being waged all over again,” Mitchell added.
Ben Wikler, former Democratic Party of Wisconsin chair, tied the protests and pushback against Trump to the crucial state level elections that will take place in Wisconsin in 2026, including the spring state Supreme Court election, the race for an open gubernatorial seat and races that will determine control of the state Senate and Assembly in the fall.

“The only way to break democracy in America is to break it in the states,” Wikler said. “If Trump wants to be king, he’s going to need people in offices like the governorship who certified elections in the state of Wisconsin and offices, like our state Supreme Court, who will be in his back pocket. Wisconsin, are we going to be in Trump’s back pocket next year?”
The crowd shouted, “No!”  
“Are we gonna be on the streets instead and talk to people who maybe never voted before, but are ready to vote now because they understand what is at stake?” Wikler asked to the sound of cheers. “Are we gonna get out of the boat, and are we gonna win elections and are we going to defend democracy?” 
“Let’s fight! No kings! Forward!” Wikler shouted.

Milwaukee tops 18,000
More than 18,000 protesters filled downtown Milwaukee as part of the No Kings day events taking place across Wisconsin and the country Saturday to protest the administration of President Donald Trump.

A large number of people at the protest said they were motivated to come Saturday as a direct response to what they see as heavy handed actions by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. In recent weeks, ICE has increased its presence in Wisconsin, conducting raids of migrant workers in communities including Madison and Manitowoc.

The protest attendance topped the 16,000 that attended the No Kings protest in the city in June — despite sister events taking place in the Milwaukee County suburbs of Cudahy, Greenfield and Shorewood, and additional events in nearby Waukesha County.
The crowd gathered at Cathedral Square Park, just blocks from city hall, before marching on a 1.8 mile course through downtown.
Mirroring protesters that have gained attention for wearing inflatable costumes during confrontations with federal agents in cities such as Chicago and Portland, Ore., attendees in Milwaukee were dressed as dinosaurs, aliens and unicorns.
At the park, Jim Baran, a Brown Deer resident, sported a banana costume and flew an upside down U.S. flag — a maritime code for distress. Baran said he wanted to attend the protest to show he’s “not going to stand for shenanigans” from the Trump administration.
“He’s selling America, he doesn’t care about Americans,” Baran said.

Stephanie Jacks, a New Berlin resident, said she came to the Milwaukee protest so residents of the city know people in the surrounding communities support it.
“There’s no due process,” she said. “There’s no checks and balances.”
A Milwaukee resident who only gave their name as J. and said they were a first generation Mexican-American, was dressed in an inflatable alien costume in an effort to make Trump claims of violent protesters seem silly and “take the wind out of their sails.”
“This alien is anti-ICE,” they said.
Kelly, a Milwaukee resident who declined to give a last name, said she’s a former deputy sheriff who is “appalled” by the actions of ICE agents. “I can’t believe what they’re doing,” she said. “The level of incompetence, no training, no supervision, no rules. It’s just insane.”

Green Bay rebuffs ICE
On Green Bay protestors’ march downtown, one of their chants was “No KKK, no fascist USA, no ICE.”

By the Brown County Courthouse in downtown Green Bay, protestors sang advice for interacting with law enforcement, including “Ask if you’re free to go, ask for a lawyer, protect yourself and neighbors and record, record, record.”
A speaker called for the crowd to go to their sheriffs about sheriffs’ partnerships with ICE, report possible ICE activity to the advocacy group Voces de la Frontera “so we can protect the immigrants who are amongst us,” tell legislators to pass a bill allowing drivers’ licenses for immigrants without legal status and support families they know who have been separated. 
Other speeches included concerns related to public education, trans rights, Israel and Palestine and free speech.

Rick Crosson, candidate for northeast Wisconsin’s 8th Congressional District, came to the protest. He told the Examiner that “for us, it’s about getting back what the Constitution had intended. And that is, have the people run the show. No kings, no dictators, no autocrats.”
Green Bay’s Neville Public Museum is looking for donations that reflect people’s experiences with “No Kings.” In a Facebook post, the museum provided a list of items it is specifically looking for, which includes protest or counter-protest signs, photographs, journal entries and digital recordings. 
“It is our responsibility to collect the stories of today to help create understanding in the future,” the museum explained in a statement.

Joan Ackerman of Hayward said the protesters are not “un-American,” as some Republican politicians have claimed, but just want to exercise their freedom of speech about things happening in the country that concern them.
Kay, a woman  from Barnes, Wisconsin, who carried a sign that said “fight truth decay,” said she came to the protest in Hayward “because of the current political environment.” She added, “We have become so divisive because of misleading and alternative facts. We need objective news that is non-partisan.”
Natalie of Hayward, who carried a sign that said, “Health care is a right,” said she was at the protest because she doesn’t  like the direction the country is headed. “We need to make it safe for our kids,” she said.
Steve, another Hayward resident who is an Air Force veteran of the Vietnam War, explained that he feels the country is moving away from the core principles of democracy he fought to defend.

Gary Quaderer, Sr., a Vietnam Army vet and spiritual leader of the Lac Courte Oreilles Tribe said this is the first protest he has ever participated in. “I thought it was very important,” he said. “I don’t like where the country is headed. … I just wanted to come out with all these other good people here just to protest what was going on.”
Paul DeMain, editor of the national News from Indian Country newspaper based in Hayward said the gathering was historic, the largest protest Hayward had ever seen.

‘Love of country’ in Janesville
In a downtown park in Janesville, Wisconsin, organizers estimated 1,000 or more people turned out on a warm, sunny Saturday morning. 
In addition to packing the sidewalks at the intersection of Court and Main streets at the corner of Courthouse Park, rally goers milled through the park space. Many sat in the well surrounding the stage, where a handful of speakers made brief remarks.

“There are 93 rallies in Wisconsin,” said U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Black Earth). Pocan recalled the words of the Republican U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson a few days ago.
“They’re trying to falsely call this a Hate America rally,” Pocan said. “People who are here today are the ones who love their country. This rally is really showing that love of country over everything else.”
Another speaker was state Sen. Mark Spreitzer (D-Beloit), whose district includes Janesville. 
“We are here to peacefully demonstrate — as the First Amendment gives us the right to do — and to call on our government to do better, to respect our rights, to respect the Constitution, and to do right by the American people,” Spreitzer told the crowd. 
“We’re also here to say that we are a welcoming community, that immigrants make our community stronger, that LGBT people make our community stronger, that people of color make our community stronger, that people with disabilities make our community stronger.,” Spreitzer said. “We are here to stand up for everybody’s right to coexist as part of our community and to get ahead in life.”
Spreitzer acknowledged that for opponents of the president, Saturday’s rally was but one step in a much longer struggle.

“This is not going to be the last time we’re going to have to keep getting together and doing this,” he said. “I know it is going to be a long fight, but we’re going to win that fight. We’re going to take our country back.”
Virtually every speaker made a point of emphasizing the peaceful intentions and means of participants in the protest. 
State Rep. Ann Roe (D-Janesville), offered her mother’s advice for people who may be confronted by supporters of the president. 
“You know what my mom used to say? Kill them with kindness,” Roe said. “Nothing makes them madder.”
In a brief interview, Roe said that as she wandered through the crowd, she encountered a variety of people she has known from various aspects of her life, all taking part.
“I have seen neighbors here. I have seen people I’ve worked with and we’ve never discussed politics,” Roe said.
“It sounds corny, but that’s what gives me hope. We’re back to the old ways — one-on-one conversations. By remaining kind and open as a long-term strategy, That’s what keeps us from devolving into chaos.”

In Kenosha, resistance through building community
Across the state in the city of Kenosha, a crowd of about 2,500 people filled the sidewalks on both sides of Sheridan Road, Downtown Kenosha’s primary north-south thoroughfare, along a four-block stretch.
Signs, the vast majority of them home-made, filled the air. So did the steady honking of passing cars as drivers sounded their horns in support of the demonstrators throughout the three-hour gathering. The sign-waving crowd cheered back in response.
Organizers had envisioned a dance party theme for their afternoon No Kings protest. A Michael Jackson impersonator lip-synched to recordings of Jackson’s biggest hits while effortlessly mimicking Jackson’s trademark dance steps on the concrete walkway of Civic Center Park.

“We couldn’t drag people away from their chanting and cheering,” said Sheila Rawn, one of the principal organizers for Hands Off Kenosha, which put together the local version of the No Kings demonstration.
“We chose to not even try to have speakers because people don’t want to come and hear speeches,” she added. “They want to stand on the street.” 
Rawn and a co-organizer, Jennifer Weinstein, were both dressed in lion costumes. People were invited to “dress as your favorite king or queen that would do better than the wannabe king that we have in the White House,” Rawn explained. “Yeah, so, no kings — but if we did have a king, you know, like a lion king would make a better king. King Kong would make a better king. A monarch butterfly would make a better king.”
It’s part of the group’s philosophy of “tactical frivolity,” Weinstein said. 
“For the record, We were planning costumes before all the Portland stuff,” Rawn said, referring to the national attention that a Portland protester in a frog suit got recently.

Hands Off Kenosha launched in the spring, an outgrowth of the April 5 Hands Off rally. Having gone to Chicago and Milwaukee for large protest events during Trump’s first administration, “it was important to me to be like, ‘No, we’re doing it here,’” Rawn said. “Kenosha is the fourth largest city in Wisconsin. We are big enough to have our own protests.”
Memories of the unrest Kenosha experienced in 2020, when self-styled militia members clashed with protesters and teenager Kyle Rittenhouse shot three men, two of them fatally, an act for which he was later acquitted, have lingered, she acknowledged. 
“I have definitely had conversations with lots of people who have said they’re nervous about coming because the community is still grappling with what happened in 2020,” Rawn said. “And so there are some people who are afraid that violence could happen, but we’ve got over a six-month track record of being peaceful and playful and joyful. And we have been really intentional.”
On a table at one end of the park, bags and bags of personal hygiene products overflowed — a collection that the organizers made part of the event. They had a school supply drive at an August protest and have conducted food drives as well. 
“It’s important to us to include mutual aid,” Rawn said. “Building community is its own form of resistance.”

(Photo: April Corbin Girnus/Nevada Current)Thousands of Nevadans took to streets and sidewalks Saturday to peacefully protest President Donald Trump and air myriad grievances against his administration, including but not limited to the ramping up of disappearances by immigration officers, the deployment of troops into U.S. cities, directing the Justice Department to target his political enemies, attempts to strip health care and social service programs, defunding of medical research, and what even federal judges are characterizing as an unprecedented disregard for the rule of law.
An estimated 2,700 “No Kings” protests were scheduled across the country. Nearly a dozen were scheduled around Nevada, including in Reno, Las Vegas, Carson City, Elko, Pahrump, and Mesquite, according to the official “No Kings” website.

Organizers estimated 18,000 people attended a rally in downtown Reno, according to the Reno Gazette Journal. Estimates from Carson City ranged from several hundred to more than a thousand, according to Carson Now.
Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department announced an estimated crowd of 2,000 in downtown Las Vegas. That rally was organized by Invisible Las Vegas, which also held the inaugural “No Kings” rally in June attended by an estimated 8,000 people. The midday downtown event was one of four planned in the metro area Saturday.

A gathering outside the New York, New York casino on Las Vegas Strip was held later in the afternoon.
Saturday morning, an estimated 3,000 people lined a stretch of a busy thoroughfare in Henderson, according to organizers there. Motorists blared their horns as demonstrators waved signs and cheered.
“We’re a peaceful crowd,” No Kings volunteer Sheila Humphries told the Nevada Current. “No one here believes in violence.”
The crowd in downtown Las Vegas was similarly peaceful and included people of all ages, ethnicities and abilities. Metro police announced there had been just one arrest for disorderly conduct.
As they have during previous protests in downtown Las Vegas, Metro officers wearing riot helmets lined the middle of numerous streets, which they closed to both vehicular traffic and rallygoers. Indivisible Las Vegas organizer Kathy Blair called it an overreaction from Metro, saying they “just want to flex their muscle.”

Speakers, including all three of Nevada’s Democratic U.S. House members, made remarks in front of the Lloyd George Federal Courthouse. But because of the geographic dispersal of the crowd as a result of Metro confining them to sidewalks on either side of Las Vegas Boulevard, only those in the immediate vicinity could hear them.

“There are actually fewer snipers” compared to the June event, Blair quipped, pointing up to the roof of a nearby federal building where several law enforcement officers sat. “They’re wasting taxpayer dollars up there.”
“I guarantee a lot of people did not come out” because they were scared of law enforcement’s presence, said Blair. “A lot of people didn’t RSVP because they didn’t want to put their name down.”
Myriad reasons motivated participants to attend the rally.
“There’s so much,” responded Mason Loosle of Summerlin when asked why he felt compelled to attend. “I don’t know where to start.”
Loosle, who attended the rally with his new wife of one week, held a sign stating they should be on their honeymoon.
“We feel like we had to come out,” he said. “I think the biggest thing is free speech, the (Jimmy) Kimmel thing, the Pentagon press thing. I can’t believe it.”

Shelly Houston of Henderson, a Democrat who has voted for Republicans, said she isn’t sure the United States will have another election.
“I think (Trump) just wants to stay in power and declare himself a ruler for lifetime,” she said.
Many participants expressed support for the Congressional Democrats, who are currently locked in a federal funding battle that has shuttered the government for nearly three weeks. Democrats are holding fast on demanding renewed credits for Obamacare subsidies. 
“I support what they’re doing,” said Alan Scott of Henderson.

Thousands of Vermonters joined more than 40 planned events on Saturday during the state’s second round of “No Kings” protests, which oppose the Trump administration. Photographers Glenn Russell, Jeb Wallace-Brodeur and Sophia Keshmiri fanned out across the state to capture the action.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)More than 3,000 people gathered in downtown Sioux Falls on Saturday for the latest No Kings protest – making it the city’s largest protest so far this year, according to organizer crowd estimates.
The protest was the 13th in South Dakota for the day, organizer Craig Brown said. Protesters gathered to listen to speakers, display homemade signs and chant “this is what democracy looks like” and “we love America; that’s why we’re here,” and call for President Donald Trump “to go.”
Brown said the turnout is a testament to the movement’s momentum and people’s anger at the Trump administration.
“There’s a sense of commitment in this crowd that we haven’t felt before,” Brown said.

More than 2,600 No Kings rallies with millions in attendance took place across the country on Saturday. The second No Kings day, following the first in June, is in response to what a broad coalition of liberal advocacy and labor organizations say is “the increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption of the Trump administration, which they have doubled down on since June.”
Lexi Pratt, of Sioux Falls, brought her daughter to the No Kings protest in Sioux Falls, saying that she “could not, in good conscience, be a good parent” without standing up when she sees something wrong. She’s concerned about women’s health care and the Trump administration’s “attack on our public education.”
“The Trump administration is violating all the checks and balances that our country was founded on to ensure that we all have the same rights,” Pratt said.
Jody Fleischhacker, of Sioux Falls, wore a frog hat — a symbol of resistance after a Portland protester wearing an inflatable frog costume was sprayed with chemicals through his costume’s air vent by a federal agent earlier this month.
Fleischhacker, who is an Air Force veteran, said she attended both No Kings protests in Sioux Falls this year because she believes Trump is unsuitable for office and should be removed.
“He’s made changes that are hurting his own people,” Fleischhacker said. “He wants to build a big, beautiful ballroom and yet take away our health care and take away food benefits to people who need them.”
The turnout exceeded organizers’ expectations despite a police investigation into a suspicious vehicle that was viewed as a potential explosives threat at the site of the protest the night before. The area was shut down to the public between 8 p.m. and 3 a.m. before police determined there were no explosives in the area.
No Kings day brings millions into US streets in anti-Trump protests

A counter protest, dubbed the “Real American Rally,” was held during the same time a block away from the No Kings protest. It drew about 30 people.
John Small, an organizer of the counter protest, said the gathering was intended to be positive and show “love for the country we live in.”
“I understand there are people who don’t like our current president. I understand that they want their voices heard. That’s great. But I don’t know how this is going to help,” Small said, referring to the No Kings protest. “Do they think there is going to be something to come from this?”
Brown said he sees the No Kings movement continuing up until the 2026 elections. That could impact midterm elections and turnout to create “real, sustained pushback against this regime.”
But the real impact of Saturday’s protest is a continued effort to build community, Brown added.
“Maybe I look across the crowd and I see my neighbor who I had no idea they feel like I do. Maybe I go and talk to them and we connect. We decide to go to a city council or county commission meeting we’re concerned about together,” Brown said. “Those are touch points that we’re seeing in real time. This is working.”",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/591A2067-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-18 21:01:20.554073

See Colorado Newsline’s live coverage of No Kings protests here.


An overflow crowd spilled into Civic Center Park, and multiple streets surrounding the Capitol grounds were shut down as the event began just after noon. Near the state Capitol steps, attendees heard from a lineup of speakers including former state Rep. Joe Salazar, who told the crowd in a fiery speech that Trump’s agenda “threatens to tear the fabric of this country apart.”
“There is no king in America, and we will not be silenced by authoritarians,” Salazar said to cheers. “We will not be painted as domestic terrorists. We are just Coloradans, just Americans, who are calling a spade a spade and a dictator a dictator — because that is our constitutional right to do so.”
Tiffany Weber, founder of the activist group Solidarity Warriors and one of the Denver protest’s organizers, blasted U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson’s characterization of the nationwide No Kings event this week as a “Hate America” rally.
“He has the gall to say we hate America. We love America,” Weber told the crowd. “We love the loud, beautiful, chaotic streets of Denver. We love the variety of ways that people show up to protests, and we hate the fact that not everyone can safely exercise their American right to free speech.”

Organizers of the Denver protest estimate that more than 25,000 demonstrators were in attendance, Salazar told Newsline. An estimated 12,000 to 15,000 demonstrators gathered in Colorado Springs. The nationwide No Kings Coalition, partners of which include liberal and progressive groups like Indivisible, MoveOn and the ACLU, estimated 7 million people turned out Saturday to demonstrate against what it called Trump’s “authoritarian actions and power grabs.”
The latest round of protests come as Trump has ordered the deployment of National Guard troops to support Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations in the cities of Chicago and Portland, which he has falsely described as “war ravaged” in spite of recent nonviolent anti-ICE protests that have prominently featured inflatable animal costumes and naked bicycle rides.










I’m hoping to save democracy. We need to defeat these people trying to tear us down and destroy our Constitution.


– Jerry Hawthorne of Fruita, at the No Kings demonstration in Grand Junction


Throughout the day, the atmosphere at Saturday’s demonstration in Denver was similarly peaceful and festive, featuring countless satirical anti-Trump protest signs — “The Only Thing Colorado Likes More Than Hiking on a Saturday Is Our Democratic Rights,” read one — and dozens of protesters clad in inflatable costumes of the kind recently popularized by protesters in Portland.
Gerry Lauer, a demonstrator dressed in an inflatable chicken costume, said he had been inspired by footage of the Portland protests and ordered the costume online before Saturday’s event.
“Portland did a great job of finding a way to eliminate the hostility, (and) kind of create that safe place to be,” Lauer said. “It’s a real serious time, but we don’t need to be creating violence and hostility. We need to figure out how to get it around that.”

‘This insanity has to stop’
Coloradans also turned out for a No Kings protest in Grand Junction, where an organizer with Indivisible said thousands had turned out in the Western Slope city to protest the Trump administration.
One of those participants was Jerry Hawthorne of Fruita.
“I’m hoping to save democracy. We need to defeat these people trying to tear us down and destroy our Constitution,” he said.

Kerri Osterguard traveled from the town of Mesa to attend the No Kings rally in Grand Junction.
“This insanity has to stop. It’s out of control,” she said.
Rick Griffith, Bev Griffith, Bill Shelton and Connie Ellenberger displayed protest signs designed by Shelton. Bev Griffith said the Grand Junction event was their first No Kings rally and that they participated because President Donald Trump is “running our country into the ground” and “he should be behind bars.”

Tensions over immigration enforcement
In his second term, Trump has pledged to carry out the “largest domestic deportation operation in American history,” aiming to remove all of the estimated 12 million immigrants in the country without permanent legal status, regardless of how long they have been in the country, the legal status of their family members or whether they have criminal records.
Tensions have risen in cities like Chicago, Portland and Los Angeles as ICE enforcement operations have become more expansive and aggressive, drawing protests that Trump administration officials have in turn harshly criticized and sought to meet with further crackdowns by federal law enforcement, as well as troop deployments. Trump told an audience of top U.S. military leaders last month that American cities should be used as “training grounds for our military,” and he has repeatedly spoken of invoking the Insurrection Act to broaden his authority to deploy the military against U.S. citizens.

Trump’s mass deportation program has been bolstered by $45 billion in new ICE funding in the Republican federal spending and tax cut law approved in July. At least 170 people with U.S. citizenship have been swept up in the agency’s expanded enforcement operations so far this year, ProPublica reported Thursday.
“We can’t treat people like this. We can’t treat anybody like this, let alone immigrants who are minding their own business and doing their work,” said Emily Magner, an Aurora resident who attended Saturday’s protest at the Capitol. “(They say) ‘We’re only after the bad ones.’ Well, then why are you going to meatpacking plants (and) places where you think immigrants would work?”

After hearing from rally speakers, thousands of demonstrators marched away from the Capitol down 15th Street into Denver’s Central Business District. Before the march, Julian Camera of the American Civil Liberties Union spoke to the crowd about their constitutional rights, including the right to free speech and the right to remain silent if detained by law enforcement.
“The reason I share these rights with you today is because it’s rookie hour at the federal government, and if you’re detained by law enforcement, they might try to intimidate you and lie to you about your rights,” Camera said. “We’re not going to let them get away with trying to rewrite the Constitution just because Trump is telling them to.”
Following the march, most demonstrators left the Capitol area by 4 p.m. A much smaller group of protesters later marched to 20th and Chestnut streets, where Denver Police Department officers “dispersed the group to deny access to the highway” and made multiple arrests, according to a DPD social media post.

(Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)Thousands of people gathered at 10 events across Louisiana as part of Saturday’s national No Kings movement to protest President Donald Trump. Beyond their criticisms of the administration, organizers and participants shared messages of unity and countered Republicans who labeled their events as “hate rallies.” 
Helping set that lighter tone were several rally participants in costumes. Some were getting a jump start on Halloween while others said they took their inspiration from protestors in Portland, Oregon, who’ve demonstrated while in disguise against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement actions in their city. 
In New Orleans, where little excuse is needed for costuming, thousands showed up for a concert and rally along the Lafitte Parkway. The city hosted a parade through the Marigny neighborhood during the first No Kings day in June.  
Among the participants was Elaine Ravich, 96, who held a sign identifying her as part of the Greatest Generation and an opponent of tyranny.
“We fought in the 1940s, and there are not too many of my generation alive,” Ravich said. “I am representing every single one of them that was here, and we were fighting again for our children, grandchildren and generations to come, and we will not allow this to happen.”

Hundreds took part in the No Kings event at Zemurray Park in Hammond, which featured equal parts protest, parody and picnic. 
Participant Katie Greer of Slidell was part of the crowd, wearing a cap to honor her Navy veteran husband, Paul, who died in August. He would have been alongside her at the protest had he not succumbed to Alzheimer’s disease, she said.
Greer noticed that a sizable portion of the crowd were, like her, senior citizens. She recounted her involvement in comparable protests against the Vietnam War in the 1970s.
“We did this once. We’re back to do it again,” Greer said.
On the other end of the age spectrum were the two school-aged children of Daisy and Michael Daigle, also from Slidell. The couple said it was important for them to take part in Saturday’s event as a family to show their son and daughter they don’t agree with the direction of the nation under Trump’s leadership.

Speakers at the Hammond event urged those in attendance to stay active and connected, even though they are greatly outnumbered by Republicans in the Northshore region. The parishes in the area are split between the congressional districts of U.S. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise and Julia Letlow, R-Start.      
Daisy Daigle said the rally provided some encouragement to those who might feel their voices aren’t heard.   
“To be able to come here to see this and have a community and see it is really good, right? Because not everybody can make it to meetings,” she said. “We’re all struggling day to day just to get by. So to have this one day to be able to come out is really important. 
More than 150 people assembled at the edge of Lock Park in downtown Lake Charles for its No Kings event, while a small group of counter-protestors stood across a quiet side street.
Matthew Desormeaux was among the rally participants, holding a sign that read: “Abolish ICE is now the moderate position.” He said he considers immigration an important issue on both a national and state level. 
“This is home. I was born and raised here,” Desormeaux said. “Lake Charles is a conservative area, but we’ve got to let [undocumented] people know that they’re not alone.”

Louisiana has nine ICE detention and staging facilities and is second only to Texas, with 23 ICE detention centers, with nearly 7,500 people in custody according to immigrant rights advocacy groups. Gov. Jeff Landry declared an emergency to expedite the refurbishment of a maximum security section of Louisiana State Penitentiary so it could also house ICE detainees.
“Immigrants are members of our community and should have the right to live and work where they want because they contribute,” Desormeaux added.
Sam McNabb stood with seven other men across the street from the No Kings assembly, flanked by two flags – one U.S. flag in black and another that read “MAGA Trump 45 47.”
“Trump’s not a king. If he were, they’d be in jail, all these cuckoos,” McNabb said, gesturing toward the No Kings rally across the street. 
McNabb said the other men with him were on their lunch break, and that the No Kings rally participants must not have jobs. 
One of the counter-protesters crossed the street to wave a flag in front of the crowd that read “Don’t tread on Trump.” A small rope barricade separated him from No Kings protestors. On his second pass down the block, local No Kings organizer Carolyn Woosley escorted the man..
“He just took my arm and said let’s go,” Woosley told the Illuminator.

Other No Kings events in Louisiana took place in Baton Rouge, Shreveport, Monroe, Ruston, Alexandria and Lafayette. 
In addition, Bradley Hesson, a 15-year-old Leesville High School student, organized what he described as a peaceful protest outside City Hall against Trump, U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson “and more of our leaders who don’t want to take accountability,” he said.

Organizers of the “No Kings” rally called it a “movement for our collective liberation.” 
Republicans have referred to the series of rallies as “Hate America Day,” although presence from opposition leaders at the event itself was minimal. 
“We are living almost in a police state now where people are being disappeared, taken away with men and women in military gear wearing masks,” said Lisa Mahoney of Beverley, Mass. “I was a human rights activist with Amnesty International for 15 years. I worked for people in many other countries that were in this sort of situation. I never thought I’d see it happen here.” 
The “No Kings” rally in Boston was one of dozens taking place across the state and one of more than 2,000 taking place across the country. The demonstrations were organized by a consortium including several unions, faith leaders, activists, and the American Civil Liberties Union to push back against the Trump administration as it uses federal power to indict critics, deploy troops to Democratic-run cities, and strip funding from universities with policies aimed at fostering diversity. 
Several Massachusetts politicians, including Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, Rep. Ayanna Pressley, and Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey, made appearances. Protestors brought thousands of signs, deriding the president and his cabinet for policies related to their use of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the cutting of scientific research at the federal level, and attacks on freedom of speech. 
Unlike similar protests that have occurred across the country in recent months, there was minimal conflict during the event. There was no major effort to organize counter-protestors, and Boston Police officers remained largely disengaged with the crowd, mostly sticking to their posts near the entrances to the Common. According to the department, no arrests were made in association with the event. 
The mass deportations by ICE and the deployment of the national guard into US cities under the second Trump administration was a major theme of many of the speeches at the event.  
“It’s no surprise that the White House wants to attack us. To seize more power, they need people to believe that this country and our cities are in a state of disaster,” said Wu. “Day after day, this president and his corrupt cabinet mistake cruelty for greatness, and payoffs for power.” 
She also invoked Boston’s historical role in overthrowing autocrats.  
“For the last 250 years and counting in Boston, every day is ‘No Kings day,’” she added 
Wu powered through her speech despite some chants from protestors, calling her a “liar” and “for hire.” Rahsaan Hall, president of the Urban League of Eastern Massachusetts and emcee for the day’s main stage events, addressed the jeers following her remarks. 
“This is what democracy looks like. It’s not nice and neat, it’s not clean and squeaky. It’s messy. It’s disruptive. It’s uncomfortable,” Hall said. “If we can’t tolerate disruption within the midst of our own disruptive protest, we’re doing it wrong.” 
The response from Republicans across the state was somewhat muted. Mike Kennealy, who is running in the GOP primary for next year’s governor’s race, criticized Gov. Maura Healey’s job performance thus far. “As citizens around Massachusetts are protesting on ‘No Kings Day’, consider this,” he posted to X, “There’s a politician who stood by while migrant children were raped and abused in government-run facilities. A politician who stood by while unemployment rose by 23%, and did nothing.” 
In an interview set to air on Fox News on Sunday, Trump downplayed the rallies. “They’re referring to me as a king,” Trump said. “I’m not a king.” 
Many protestors disagreed, likening the President to an autocrat. 
“I came out here because of the way the Trump administration is oppressing our free speech,” said Boston resident Mary Buonanno. “I felt it was important that they knew, and that we stood strong against having a dictator in the White House.”  
Protestors also called for unity against what they viewed as a growing threat. 
“I’m independent, neither Republican or Democrat,” said Boston resident Paul Finnegan. He said he attended the rally because the lies told by Trump had “just gone too far.” 
“The joke was that he could go to Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and still get elected, but now he’s got a whole chorus of people who are just tearing up the Constitution. That’s enough.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-18-at-7.53.35-PM.png?fit=1024%2C770&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-18 21:01:20.554073

The event came four months after an innocent bystander, Afa Ah Loo, was shot and killed in Salt Lake City at a No Kings protest planned by a different group.
This time, organizers worried that memories of the tragedy and violence in June were still too fresh and many would still feel too afraid to attend, said Jamie Carter, a volunteer with Salt Lake Indivisible who planned Saturday’s rally.
But afterward, Carter said she hoped the event – fairly relaxed and punctuated by boisterous moments – restored a sense of safety and solidarity for anyone who felt uneasy. 
“It felt like our goals were met, both helping to heal the community, and providing a place for people to express their anger, but to leave with joy,” Carter said. 
Haylee Bowcut, 25, said she had some anxiety about the protest because of the June shooting, but decided Saturday morning to attend and bring a sign saying, “Hate never made a country great.” 
“It just felt like the right thing, to go today,” said Bowcut, of Pleasant View.
Many outside the Capitol chanted, “We are the patriots!,” wore costumes and came with friends or family, listening intently to speakers, a comedian and musical performances during the roughly two-hour event. 
“We’re going to hold every government official accountable, from the highest levels of power, including every ICE agent,” Carter said from a podium on the Capitol steps, to thunderous applause. 
She and other speakers said they want to see compassion inform new immigration laws, along with an end to the nation’s health care “crisis” and stricter gun laws to help protect children. 
Jeanetta Williams, president of the NAACP’s Salt Lake branch, condemned Trump’s appointment of “anti-civil rights extremists” in roles enforcing the nation’s civil rights laws.






























Many seemed to take inspiration from protesters in Portland, dressing in towering inflatable costumes depicting dinosaurs, axolotls, chickens, and a bumble bee, in a nod to Utah’s moniker, the Beehive State. 
U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson last week described No Kings as “pro-Hamas,” and a “Hate American rally.” 
Speaking through a small window in her inflatable unicorn costume, Barbara Scott of Bluffdale rejected that. 
“I’m not paid to be here, I’m not AI, and I’m not a terrorist,” Scott said, showing off signs she made featuring the same messages. 
Scott also reflected on the violence that’s happened at demonstrations and political events like June’s protest and Charlie Kirk’s killing at the campus of Utah Valley University. 
As for her concern about her own safety while protesting, she said, “I have more concern about what’s going to happen to our country if we don’t get it back. At least if we die here, we die trying.” 
Organizers originally planned to follow the Capitol rally with a march to the Salt Lake City and County building, but canceled the march Tuesday when online RSVPs flooded in faster than they’d expected. They worried the crowd size for a march was too big for the few dozen unarmed safety volunteers they trained, Carter said. 
On Saturday, Utah’s Department of Public Safety estimated attendance at 3,500, while Carter said she believed it was much higher, near 10,000. 
Former state Sen. Steve Urquhart, who served in the Utah Legislature as a Republican from 2001-2016, was also in the crowd. He recalled believing years ago that any forces seeking to undercut democracy would come from the political left, but said he now feels differently. 
“Guess I was wrong about that one,” Urquhart said. He added that concerns about safety were on his mind before the rally. 
“Should we go, should we mask up? What should we do?” Urquhart recalled thinking. “When the administration is actively saying it’s targeting its opponents, that’s frightening.” 
Few counterprotesters came to the event. When a group of about three men, one wearing a ‘Trump 2024’ hat arrived at the Capitol lawn and started speaking through a megaphone, dozens in the No Kings group surrounded them, chanting, “No Nazis, no KKK, no fascist USA.”

Maya Homan/Georgia RecorderThousands of people gathered Saturday in Atlanta as part of the No Kings rallies taking place nationwide, where speakers sounded the alarm against the potential for authoritarian rule under the Trump administration.
Speakers, which included prominent Georgia political figures and leaders of civil rights and advocacy organizations, described the current climate as a move away from democracy. It was a noticeable shift in tone from the No Kings events in June, when organizers warned of some of the administration’s undemocratic behaviors, such as hosting a military parade coinciding with President Donald Trump’s birthday. 
Former Georgia House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams framed the political battle as a fight over the nation’s direction.
“It used to be that we were all headed to the same destination. We just had different routes,” Abrams said to the crowd. “We may have a different way to get there, but the route we were going to take was democracy … but on the other side, they decided that the route they wanted to take was not democracy, but authoritarianism.”

Organizers say more than 10,000 people turned out Saturday at the Atlanta Civic Center, one of over 40 events held across Georgia, before marching to the state Capitol, but the actual number could be closer to 12,000, said Laura Judge with Indivisible North Metro, which is one of the event’s organizers. Martha Shockey, a convener of the Indivisible Georgia Coalition, said more than 5,000 people registered ahead of the protest. 
Andrea Young, executive director of the ACLU of Georgia, told the crowd that the Trump administration has created a two-tiered system of justice where some are “above the law” and others are below.
“We love America too much to give it over to a wannabe king,” Young said. “The Trump regime puts billionaires above the law … at the same time, the Trump regime acts like some of us are below the law.”
In an interview Friday ahead of the rally, Young cited several examples of the current administration’s alleged abuses. She pointed to the administration’s actions on immigrant rights, including the denial of due process for people suspected of living in the country unlawfully and the attempt to abolish the 14th Amendment’s citizenship provision by executive order — a move the ACLU is challenging. She also raised concerns over the deployment of military personnel in American cities like Chicago and Los Angeles, as well as the “dismantling” of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and what she called the undermining of “facts and science.”

Abby Tighe, a founding member of Fired but Fighting, a coalition of terminated CDC employees and public health allies, described the latest mass terminations at the agency as “another deliberate attempt to traumatize federal workers and attack the American public.” The CDC workforce has shrunk by about 3,000 this year, with the latest round of layoffs in October affecting about 600 workers.
“Donald Trump continued to spread lies about vaccines, medications, and research. Their lies about vaccines have led to mistrust and violence. Their dehumanization and vitriol is directly responsible for the August attack on CDC that claimed the life of DeKalb County’s officer (David) Rose, while my friends and own child cowered in fear,” Tighe said.
Sen. Raphael Warnock speaks at the No Kings demonstrations in Atlanta on Oct. 18, 2025. Maya Homan/Georgia Recorder
Georgia U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock urged the audience to stand up for democracy and fight for their rights. Warnock pointed to the importance of unity and cooperation, regardless of political affiliation, and called for the end of the government shutdown and the extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies.
“We don’t have to do one or the other. We can do both at the same time,” he said.
He also warned against the dangers of fascism and the need to fight for the rights of all people, including Palestinians, Israelis, Ukrainian children and American citizens.
“You cannot outsource democracy to anybody. You cannot outsource citizenship. It is all of us. That’s why they’re trying to divide us, because when all of us stand together and raise our voices, we win,” he said.
James Salter said he showed up at the No Kings demonstrations in Atlanta on Oct. 18, 2025 to fight fascism because he worries that ignoring the Constitution will lead to a dictatorship run by the rich. Alander Rocha/Georgia Recorder
James Salter said he participated in the rally because he’s “trying to rebuff fascism while we still care,” saying he’s concerned about law and order under Trump.
“If the Constitution is no longer understood and taken seriously, then we slip into a fascist dictatorship that is ruled by the ultra rich. And we lose,” he said.
James Threatt, who also attended the rally in Atlanta, said that the name of the No Kings march spoke for itself.
“This man is setting himself up as the king, and he’s not,” he said. “This is America.”

Threatt also said he was concerned about how the Trump administration was treating immigrants, saying the mass arrests were violating people’s civil rights, which he compared to the struggle for Black civil rights.
“They’re taking civil rights away from people, period,” he said. “Not only Black people but everybody else.”
Lloyd Norman said he hoped to be a “small voice” to help hold power to account.
“Hitler had something called the Big Lie theory, that if I say it long enough and loud enough, people will say it for me,” Norman said. “That’s why I’m here, because we have to say ‘you’re lying.'”
Speakers also called for ongoing, non-violent action and engagement in local elections. U.S. Rep. Hank Johnson of Lithonia urged the crowd to embody Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s vision of the “beloved community,” which King used to describe a society that is free from discrimination and poverty and is based on peace, justice and equality.
“We, the people, are the ones to create the beloved community, and we do it through love, passion, non-violence,” Johnson said before the crowd marched to the Capitol.

Amanda Solberg-Bowen, who lives near Watkinsville, showed up Saturday in a newly acquired inflatable frog costume. She was one of many people who showed up at a No Kings rally Saturday dressed up in inflatable costumes as a nod to the so-called “Portland Freedom Frog.” Earlier this month, a federal agent in Portland shot pepper spray inside of a protester’s inflatable frog costume while demonstrating outside of an U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility.
“Somebody said a minute ago that it’s a great way to be present but also be obviously nonviolent – a disarming sort of presence,” Solberg-Bowen said of her costume, adding that being there Saturday felt like “the least that we can do.”
Taffy Jo Mayers said her sense of patriotism is what brought her to the rally. She also expressed concerns about how the government is treating immigrants.
“I’ve been an immigrant,” she said. “I’ve lived and worked in foreign countries, and the way that America is treating the people that are coming here is abhorrent. It’s inhumane.”
This was Julie Runk’s second No Kings rally. As she waited for marchers to reach the state Capitol, the Atlanta resident waved to passing cars and held a sign that said “Stop pretending your racism is patriotism. Oh, and release the Epstein files.”

“People ask me, ‘Why are you doing it? It’s not going to change anything,'” Runk said. “I’m just unhappy with what’s happening and I want to do whatever I can. This is a small bit.”
Runk said she relishes the sense of community she finds at the No Kings events, but she also said she believes that speaking out helps to empower others to do the same.
“I also know that this administration doesn’t like to look bad and this makes them look bad,” Runk said of the No Kings rallies. “And when ICE is fighting with people in inflatable frog suits, it makes them look like idiots, and they don’t like to be embarrassed. So, this to me is a good way to get under their skin if nothing else,” she said.

(Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)In Queen Anne’s County, where 62% of voters went for President Donald Trump in last year’s election, some of the people who showed up for the No Kings rally said they were pleasantly surprised by Saturday’s turnout.
Several hundred people turned up, many waving hand-drawn signs by the roadside in Centreville’s small historic downtown, while others gathered in the courtyard, where a musician performed at a piano, and organizers opened the mic for testimonials.
“The honks and waves way outnumber the middle fingers,” said Tom Gallagher, 74, of the public response to No Kings in Centreville. The Anne Arundel County resident crossed the Bay Bridge to attend the rally here.
Back across the Bay in Baltimore — where 12.8% of voters backed Trump in 2024 — the challenge was not getting people to turn out, but managing No Kings on the same day as the 25th annual Baltimore Running Festival, when an estimated 10,000 runners were expected to take over downtown to compete in everytingn from a 5K to a full marathon.
Most coped by combining the two events, with runners wearing No Kings gear and No Kings attendees lining the race route with signs playing off the combination of the two events, like the one that said, “You’re running better than the government.”
Jackie Bustos took advantage of the scheduling of the events to accomplish personal goal of completing a half marathon while also protesting Trump policies on immigration and other issues.
“I felt supported,” said Bustos, who ran with a No Kings sign on her back. “Throughout the city, there were tons of signs that were supporting the cause. So I was running, but there were also people saying ‘no fascism, no kings.’”

The Baltimore and Centreville rallies were just two of more than 60 events scheduled in Maryland Saturday, from Ocean City to LaVale and from Northeast to Lexington Park and scores of points in between.
They were in big cities like Baltimore and small towns like Centreville. They were in deep blue counties like Montgomery, which had more than a dozen events scheduled, to deep red counties like Carroll, where one event was scheduled for the County Government Building in Westminster for those willing to brave it.
Nationwide, more than 2,700 events were planned, in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, Guam and the District of Columbia, where as many as 100,000 were expected to turn out. Events were being held overseas as well, in Australia and across Europe – although events in the United Kingdom were tactfully labeled “No Tyrants” events.
Some estimates said turnout for the weekend’s events could be in the millions.
The latest rallies are a followup to No Kings events in June that were held to counter President Donald Trump’s massive military parade in Washington to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the Army – and, some say not coincidentally, Trump’s 79th birthday.
There were about 2,000 events in June. Organizers said they scheduled this weekend’s events because Trump “has doubled down” since the first rallies, ramping up immigration raids and deploying troops to Democratic cities and urging the Justice Department to prosecute his enemies.
A main theme of the events, besides no kings, is peaceful protest. Rallygoers are told to leave weapons at home and are trained in de-escalation techniques. And in Maryland, at least, it seemed to be working, only minimal conflicts reported.
‘What was your tipping point?’
Standing in the courtyard in front of the Queen Anne’s County historic courthouse in Centreville, a bulletin board asked locals: “What was your tipping point?”
No more context was needed.
“The day he was elected — the first time,” read one sticky note. “Musk + DOGE,” read another. “The Apprentice,” one attendee wrote.

“We wanted to know, what was that moment that you felt like you needed to come?” said Elaine McNeil, chair of the Queen Anne’s Democratic Central Committee, which organized Saturday’s event. “Because that’s the feedback that we need to get other people to that tipping point to start standing up.”
Gallagher, the Anne Arundel County resident who traveled to Centreville for the rally, said he has been disturbed by the administration’s decision to attack ships off the coast of Venezuela, killing several people.
“Even if he’s correct that they’re drug dealers, that’s still a legal matter, not a military matter,” said Gallagher, a retired Navy veteran. “You’re being judge, jury and executioner for people out on boats in the water. It’s beyond the pale.”
No Kings protests dotted Maryland’s rural and conservative Eastern Shore, running up U.S. Route 50 from Ocean City and Salisbury to Cambridge and Easton, where protesters lined the busy highway beside a Wawa convenience store, attracting a smattering of honks as cars drove past. A single counter-protester stood in the grass behind them, yelling “We love President Trump.” But he was handily outnumbered, as the assembled group chanted: ““Love, not hate, makes America great.”
Beverly Fox, 75, an Easton resident who is disabled, uses a motorized wheelchair to get around. On Saturday, the back of her wheelchairt sported an image of Trump wearing a crown with the message “No Kings.”
“That man has got to go,” said Fox, who worries about Trump’s attacks on health insurance for vulnerable Americans. “Every day I think I can’t get shocked any more.”
In Easton’s Talbot County, Trump’s victory was far narrower than elsewhere on the Eastern Shore, winning 11,125 votes to 11,119 for Vice President Kamala Harris.
For many attendees on Saturday, it felt difficult to choose just one reason they were drawn to decorate handmade signs and wave them by the roadside.

“I don’t even know where to start,” said Ashley Cromwell, a Queenstown resident who came to Centreville with a “We the People” sign.
“Since Trump first — in 2015 — came on the scene this way, I’ve been against what he stands for, and the hatred and the anger and the division and the way that he wants to take power for himself,” Cromwell said.
Even if it was sometimes hard to articulate, attendees on Saturday were united by a passion to speak up against Trump.
Diana Leonard, a Queen Anne’s resident, said she began attending anti-Trump protests for the first time in March.
“I’m out here for the people that can’t be out here,” said Diana Leonard, a Queen Anne’s resident. “Because there are people that are either disabled or they’re afraid, or they’ve been fighting forever.”
But, like many at the rallies, she was keeping it light. Leonard wore an inflatable otter costume Saturday and carried a sign that said, “You otter join us!” adding that she was gunning for a “positive, unifying” message.
‘Run like Trump’s behind you’
Positive energy was very much the mood in Baltimore, where the marathon route was lined with people who alternated between those holding anti-Trump protest signs or posterboards offering encouragement from enthusiastic friends and families. Or both.
“That’s one of the things I love about Baltimore,” Bustos said. “It’s really nice to be in Baltimore and see that there’s this energy for the runners and also supporting a very big political cause.”
Brenden Caffey, 30, said that he and his wife had been in other running festivals before, but having a message this time brought a new energy to the challenge. He painted his shirt Friday night with “NO KINGS” in preparation for the run.

“It was nice … I think it was kind of cool that it was able to be combined a little bit,” Caffey said.
Protesters on the sides of the tracks shouted words of encouragement while their signs disparaged the Trump administration.  People like Lior Levy, 28, who stood on the sidelines with a sign declaring “Baltimore says ‘No Kings.’” She said that merging the rally with the marathon provided “a lot of visibility” for the political demonstration.
“Us being here for the runners, it drives them. And them having the signs rallies us — and it’s a good back and forth,” Levy said.
Chris Ryder, 65, a former U.S. Agency for International Development employee who retired during the first Trump administration, said  the recent federal layoffs are just one of the many reasons to come out to the marathon and protest along the track.
“We came out because we think we all need to raise our voices against so much of what’s going on with this administration,” he said.
Laurie Rome, 63, said that while the Baltimore No Kings rally was a little more spread out than other protests, it was still important to show up, “no matter the format.”
“It’s kind of nice to have it sort of pervasive along the route. Not just people clustered in one place,” she said. “There are people everywhere who think that the current level of unkindness, instability and hatred is not okay.”
Protesters lining the roads — and the marathon routes — seemed to be popular venues. In Prince George’s County, sporadic clumps of protesters lined U.S. Route 1 from the Washington, D.C., line to the University of Maryland, College Park, and beyond.
On the Eastern Shore, Denise Perdue of Graysonville stood on the side of the road and talked about her “tipping point” while waving a sign. For Perdue, it was Nov. 5, 2024, when Trump was elected a second time.

“I didn’t think that there was so much hate in the United States as there is, and so much bigotry,” she said, adding that she felt that the electorate scorned Harris, the Democratic nominee, because she is a woman of color.
As Perdue held a sign inviting passersby to “Honk for Humanity,” one driver in a pickup truck flew past: “Sore losers!” he yelled.
Perdue was quick to respond: “Jesus loves you!” she shouted back. It was the same response she’d used all day for the occasional heckler passing through.
“Because, what are you going to say to that?” she joked.

In Lexington, Gracia O’Brien, 71, said “when folks in Congress said this was going to be a ‘hate America’ rally, I said ‘no, I love America.’ I want my grandchildren to know I stood up. I’m old, and I’ve never been scared for our democracy. I am now.” 
Marsha Bezold of Midway hoisted a sign showing a U.S. flag and the words “Pro-America. Anti-Trump.” She cited multiple reasons for protesting, from “the dismantling of our Constitution” to coming cuts in health care that she said will hurt her family.  She said she thinks Trump’s goal is to intimidate Americans into keeping silent about his unprecedented power grabs. This is not the country I grew up in. I think Ronald Reagan would be rolling over in his grave to see this.”
In Louisville, former Democratic U.S. Rep. John Yarmuth greeted a large crowd gathered on the Belvedere:  “Hello all my fellow terrorists. Apparently that’s who the Republicans and the administration think we are: terrorists, antifa, violent criminals.” 
Republican U.S. Rep. Tom Emmer recently said Democrats would “rather cater to the pro-terrorist wing of their party than to reopen the government.” House Speaker Mike Johnson described “No Kings” as a “hate America” rally
Yarmuth added that he thought the gathered crowd should show their “antifa membership cards” to Trump.
Protesters also rallied in smaller Kentucky towns. In Pikeville, a small crowd gathered, holding signs that said, among other things, “Hillbillies against Facism,” Mountain Top News reported. The Owensboro Times reported more than 500 people attended a downtown rally in the Daviess County seat. “The scene remained peaceful throughout the event.”

In Morehead, organizers reported “over 300 people and two dinosaurs” gathered for the “No Kings” rally. Speakers in the Rowan County seat included two Democrats running for U.S. Congress: attorney Ned Pillersdorf, who is hoping to unseat longtime Republican incumbent Rep. Hal Rogers, and Logan Forsythe, who is running for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell.

In Lexington, police blocked streets as thousands of protesters marched through downtown; observers said it was one of the largest demonstrations they had ever seen in Kentucky’s second-largest city.



































Capitol rally in Frankfort
While the state Capitol is closed amid a renovation project, protesters were able to peacefully gather on its steps. Similar demonstrations have been held at the site since Trump took office earlier this year for the second time. 
Dennis Van Horn, a Frankfort resident and veteran, listened to speakers on the Capitol lawn while holding a sign that said a chant the crowd used throughout the day: “No thrones, no crowns, no kings” — a chant that was heard throughout the day. He said Saturday’s crowd was twice the size of the first“No Kings” rally in June.
Van Horn said he wanted to attend Saturday’s protest “because (of) the anxiety from watching our president trash the Constitution, rule of law and take retribution on his enemies.” 
“And that’s not the way it’s supposed to be,” he added.

Woodford County resident Alyssa Cumming and her dog, Cody, came to the Capitol to stand for her friends and family who are immigrants but are afraid to make their voices heard at this time. Cumming and Cody attended protests earlier this year. 
She raised concerns about the direction of the country, adding that “we’re not moving any closer to greatness right now.” 
“I just feel like everybody can do something,” Cumming said. “I don’t have any political power other than my feet.”
Some politicians also joined the crowd. Speaking through a microphone, Democratic state Rep. Erika Hancock, of Frankfort, addressed the rally and was supportive of the group’s message. 
“This No Kings rally is about reminding everyone in power that they serve the people, not the other way around,” she says to cheers.
John “Drew” Williams, a Democratic candidate challenging Republican U.S. Rep. James Comer in Kentucky’s 1st Congressional District, said the Frankfort rally was his second of the day after another event in Danville. Williams, who is from far West Kentucky, said it was important for him to be in Frankfort because of the town’s importance to the state and because Franklin County was added to the 1st Congressional District during redistricting. In Comer’s district, a thin line of counties along Kentucky’s southern border connects the state’s far western tip and the Mississippi River with Franklin and Boyle counties in Central Kentucky.
“This is what democracy looks like,” Williams said. “This is what the conversation wants to be, not just right now when we feel like there is a set of government overreach, but every year and every day.”

In Louisville, thousands gathered at the Belvedere, a grassy event space next to the Muhammed Ali Center in downtown Louisville, hearing from a range of elected officials and advocates after marching and chanting through the city streets. 
Rebecca Elliott of Louisville watched marchers holding signs, including one that read: “Immigrant Rights Are Citizen’s Rights” — one of many signs that referenced the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement tactics. 
“The right of due process applies to all of us. So, if we allow people to start taking that right away from our immigrant neighbors, then we’re also going to end up not having it in the long run, too,” Elliott said. “I think we have to defend the more vulnerable people so that we can maintain our own rights.” 
Other signs by protesters in Louisville referenced Trump’s executive orders, including one that designated antifa, a left-wing anti-facist political movement, as a domestic terrorist organization. Jamie and Brian Reichenbach came to the Louisville protest from Spencer County, holding a sign with the word antifa and an arrow pointing at themselves. 
Jamie Reichenbach said given that the country ought fascism in the past, she wanted to show that “we’re antifa.” 
“We stand for anti-fascism, which is what America was supposed to be,” Reichenbach said.
Brad Ector of Louisville, who sported an inflatable dragon costume that was buffeted by the wind as he marched, said he didn’t “want Portland to have all the fun.” 
“Just all the people in Portland that are there, pointing out the fact that they are not the terrorists that Trump wants us to believe,” Ector said. 
“As far as the dragon goes, someone needs to melt ice,” Ector said, apparently referring to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Oct. 18, 2025. | Photo By Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceAs the administration of President Donald Trump continues to usher in anti-democratic policies, turns federal agents against migrants and begins a crackdown on any resistance against his administration and its policies, thousands of demonstrators took to the streets on Saturday across Michigan to join in the nationwide No Kings rallies.
More than 100 communities from southeast Michigan to the westernmost part of the U.P. joined in the show of might to advocate for civil rights, democracy and the rule of law. The protests were expected to attract millions of people nationwide to speak out against the Trump administration since he took office this year for a second term.
At Michigan’s Capitol building in Lansing, the show of resistance was palpable.
For over an hour before the official start to the event, people gathered on the Capitol lawn. Several demonstrators greeted their friends and family with hugs while taking pictures with rally signs. Over that hour, the size of the protest grew from a small crowd to a group that nearly reached the edges of the front lawn.

Like other protests against the administration documented earlier this month, many wore costumes, which ranged from various inflatable animal suits to robes from The Handmaid’s Tale. Security for the protest was pronounced, with several Michigan Department of State Police troopers in tactical gear and road patrol uniforms on the lookout for threats.
As the crowd grew, cars and trucks driving by honked in support throughout the event. Some waved flags, held up signs or played loud music, and most were met with cheers and applause from demonstrators along North Capitol Avenue.
Just before a series of speakers began, various songs of resistance played over the loud speakers, including “Holiday” by Green Day, which was met with cheers from the crowd. 
Several signs identified demonstrators as veterans, teachers and union members. Some protestors spoke of their concerns about Trump’s narratives on free speech, including his claim that he has ended free speech over flag burning, and some expressed worries about detentions and deportations by ICE. 
Others, especially older protestors, spoke about their fears for the future for younger generations – wanting their children and grandchildren to live in a country where they were free to protest. 
“We must commit ourselves, each and every one of you, all the way back to the streets to never, ever [give up],” Lansing-based community activist Lorenzo Lopez said in one of several addresses at the event. “We have to continue to resist, and we must never, ever let this country become a dictatorship.”
Speaking directly to the administration’s use of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency to terrorize the immigrant community and enact its sweeping mass deportation policies, Lopez said it amounted to human trafficking.
“My fellow Americans, the mass deportations are not deportations at all,” he said. “When people are [detained] without due process, that’s called kidnapping. When they are sent to another country against their will, that’s human trafficking.”

Throughout the speeches, chants of “Release the files” and “Lock him up” permeated the crowd, especially in reference to Trump’s felony convictions in early 2024.
The rally started at 3 p.m. and was scheduled to run until 6 p.m. However, impending poor weather and gloomy skies ended the event early. As one organizer put it in a final speech, those who have been paying attention to the excesses of the Trump administration and its authoritarian tendencies have heard all the complaints before.
Now, however, was a time for action. As the crowd moved away from the Capitol lawn, thousands marched east down Michigan Avenue. They continued to chant, saying: “Donald Trump has got to go.” 
Cars and trucks driving through downtown Lansing continued to honk in support of the demonstrators who took to marching, a line of people that stretched across the bridge into the city’s Stadium District and beyond.
State Rep. Emily Dievendorf (D-Lansing) attended the rally in their district. They said it was a clear sign of solidarity and community building, and was bigger than the first No Kings rally held in June. With the Trump administration’s actions veering further into autocratic territory, the representative was also reflective on the moment, and the fight to retain the core tenets of the nation’s democratic values.

“If this isn’t a statement as to what we should do next, it is a statement that we have a community and we have resistance that is ready to push back,” Dievendorf said. “This rally was remarkable, in part, because the average person has reason to be afraid and to feel there might be consequences for dissenting right now. And yet we showed up anyway. I think that we’re starting to understand that silence is not going to get us out of this. The only way to fight fascism and to get our democracy back to a stable place is for us to have a united front in favor of rule of law and the Constitution.”
There were very few agitators or those launching counterprotests at the Lansing event, which ran counter to a warning from a GOP official who on Thursday claimed there would be problems from left-wing trouble makers at the event. At least one report of a counterprotester showed a peace keeping unit ushering him out of the crowd with little resistance otherwise.
On Thursday, Oakland County GOP Chair Vance Patrick warned in a bizarre statement issued in a vague email that left-wing agitators were planning to infiltrate and derail Saturday’s protests in Michigan. He specifically called out the Democratic Socialists of America.
The political party was indeed there at the Lansing rally, one of several political party vendors at the event, simply talking to voters about the issues of the day.
A number of political groups and campaigns, including the Democratic Socialists of America, set up tents and tables around the outskirts of the protest at the Michigan State Capitol. | Oct. 18. Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance.
Among them was Sam Nelson, co-chair of the Greater Lansing DSA. Nelson said the event was certainly about mobilization, but it wasn’t a strike or a show of civil disobedience.
“It’s about putting out the calls. Everyone can come out and stand with hundreds of thousands, even millions, across the country,” Nelson said. “Yes, this is a rally, and rallies are about as peaceful as you can get when it comes to political demonstration.”
Instead of drumming chaos that didn’t exist, Nelson posited that the GOP in Michigan should look inward and denounce the young Republican group chats that were recently unveiled in news reports, which showed young party organizers shared slurs and violent political rhetoric.
“Then they can talk about peaceful discourse,” Nelson said.
Detroit, Flint, Ann Arbor and beyond
Rallies in other parts of the state also saw large crowds with thousands willing to exercise their rights to free speech while those rights still remain intact.
Among the larger No Kings rallies was at Roosevelt Park in southwest Detroit, where thousands of people of all ages and backgrounds began arriving just before 3 p.m., holding up signs in Spanish and English as they stepped out of their cars or buses, including “America has no kings,” or “No National Guard in Detroit.”
“The people united will never be defeated,” were one of the main chants heard around the crowd.

State Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak), who is running for the U.S. Senate next year, applauded the courage of the protesters and told the Advance she hoped that more protests like this one will continue
“It is encouraging, I know protesting might be intimidating, but it is a good way to stand up and fight back. We have an opportunity to stay together and raise our voices against Donald Trump and his administration.”
After rallying at the park, demonstrators then peacefully marched down Michigan Avenue, although there was at least one arrest when a counter-protestor and supporter of President Trump, Andre Williams, 24, was taken into custody by Detroit Police after he followed No Kings marchers and reportedly began to scuffle with demonstrators and force his way into the crowd before being handcuffed and placed in a squad car.

At the Ann Arbor demonstration earlier Saturday, resident Angela Williams, 91, sat among the several hundred demonstrators at Veterans Park and told the Advance that while she had lived through many turbulent times, this felt different.
“I have feared for our democracy before, but I’ve always felt that the three branches of government were independent. And now I’m very disturbed by the lack of independence,” Williams said.

In Flint, among the several thousand demonstrators who turned out to the city’s No Kings rally was former U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee (D-Flint), who told the Advance the crowd itself stood as a rejection of the characterization from Trump and his administration that participants were violent extremists.
“This is dissent. This is a group of people who are just everyday citizens. I’ve run into people that I went to elementary school with, not people that I’ve met along the path of political activism that has defined my work until now, but people that I haven’t seen for years, neighbors, old friends. These are citizens.”

And scattered among the crowds were volunteers with clipboards, collecting signatures for initiative petition campaigns hoping to make the 2026 ballot. 
“We are just out here trying to make sure that the people hold the power and not politicians,” said Drew Amidei, a staff organizer for Missouri Jobs with Justice Voter Action, at the Jefferson City rally. 
This was the second nationwide No Kings mass gathering, with the first organized in June to coincide with a military parade in Washington, D.C., that commemorated the 250th birthday of the U.S. Army and President Donald Trump’s 79th birthday.
Since then, Missourians have found more reasons to organize at the state level, said Sue Rodgers, spokesperson for We Stand United Missouri. The organization led the Jefferson City rally at the State Capitol, where hundreds of protesters turned out despite a rainy afternoon.
Sue Gibson, a volunteer with Respect Missouri Voters, collects signatures during the No Kings demonstration at the Missouri State Capitol in Jefferson City on Saturday. Respect Missouri Voters is the intiative petition campaign for a constitutional amendment that would make it harder for the General Assembly to overturn citizen-led ballot measures (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
Rogers pointed to last month’s move by Missouri lawmakers to push forward a gerrymandered congressional map requested by Trump and a ballot measure to make it harder for citizens to amend the state’s constitution.
“There’s more specific issues at this point,” Rodgers told The Independent. “We see more evidence of the authoritarian power grabs and executive overreach.”
Even a thunderstorm in St. Louis wasn’t enough to dampen the spirits of protesters. 
“I know it’s raining. I know it’s a little cool,” former Democratic U.S. Rep. Cori Bush told a crowd of more than a thousand people gathered in downtown St. Louis amid the thunderstorm. “But you all, this is nothing in comparison to the reign that we’ll have to live through if we don’t resist the Donald Trump administration.”
 Jefferson City

Rodgers pointed to organizations with tents surrounding the Missouri State Capitol lawn with volunteers collecting signatures for three petition campaigns.
“We definitely have more of a focus this time on the initiative petitions and redistricting,” she said.
A petition seeking a statewide vote on the gerrymandered Missouri redistricting plan circulated during the demonstration, with groups like Missouri Jobs with Justice Voter Action and Respect Missouri Voters collecting signatures.
To them, the citizen-led petitions embody the spirit of No Kings — with voters asserting power and calling out leadership they believe is acting autocratic.

“No Kings is a good time to get this message out because both this referendum and this rally are really about empowering the people of Missouri,” Amidei said. “It’s really about asserting our democratic values.”
He told The Independent there was a “good amount of foot traffic” as he collected signatures for a petition seeking a statewide vote on the gerrymandered Missouri redistricting plan.
Organizers wanted voters’ rights to be emphasized while creating an uplifting environment.
“We encouraged them to come in costumes, have fun,” Rodgers said. “Everyone needs a little space to let off anxious energy and find out they are not alone.”
Rodgers was one of a handful of women dressed as suffragettes who spoke during the Jefferson City rally about women’s contributions to democracy.
Another speaker, assistant attorney general Greg Barnes, dressed as James Madison to warn demonstrators of threats to the U.S. Constitution. He spoke about Trump’s mentions of a third term.
But not every costume had an obvious nod to democracy. Others dressed as dinosaurs in inflatable costumes, and one organizer wore a Cheeto costume.
Respect Missouri Voters organizer Lindsay Browning, dressed in a cow onesie, told the crowd that the costumes are intentional.
“When we’re silly, we expose them as frauds,” she said. “Fascists can’t promote lies about dangerous, left-wing terrorists when we keep showing up unarmed wearing costumes.”
Respect Missouri Voters organizer Lindsay Browning leads chants during the No Kings rally in Jefferson City on Saturday. Browning said the organizers encouraged participants to wear costumes to show their intentions for a peaceful, uplifting event (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
Unlike in June, Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe did not declare a state of emergency ahead of Saturday’s rallies. At the time, Kehoe said his decision to activate the Missouri National Guard was a “precautionary measure” in the case of “events that are occurring or could occur.”
“We respect, and will defend, the right to peacefully protest,” Kehoe said in a statement at the time, “but we will not tolerate violence or lawlessness in our state.”
Kehoe is currently being sued by Lucas Cierpiot, a disability-rights activist from Blue Springs, and the son of a Republican state senator, over his decision to activate troops over the summer.
Local news outlets reported that the June protests remained uneventful between demonstrators and police.
 St. Louis 

The crowd at Keiner Plaza in downtown St. Louis brought with it ample American flags, ponchos and an occasional inflatable costume. 
“Fight looks like marching in the streets. Fight looks like collecting signatures,” state Rep. Ray Reed, a Democrat from St. Louis, told the crowd. “ … Fight looks like putting your name on a ballot.”
More than a thousand people gather in a thunderstorm on Saturday as part of a No Kings protest in downtown St. Louis (Anna Spoerre/Missouri Independent).
Brice Bloom-Ellis, 69, of St. Louis, stood several yards away holding a sign demanding the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files. But ICE was front of mind. 
“I’m totally opposed to masked federal police snatching people off the street,” said Bloom-Ellis, who works in child welfare. “It’s just unbelievable that that’s happening in this country.” 
He was also appalled by Missouri’s new congressional map, which he called nothing but a “power grab.” 
Bloom-Ellis was far from the only one upset that the governor took the president’s request to redraw the congressional map in favor of Republicans to heart. 
Tullia Hamilton, 77, of St. Louis, said she’s never met Kehoe, but if she did, she knows what she would tell him: 
“I don’t know you, but chances are you’re three times the man Donald Trump is,” said Hamilton, a retired history professor. “Why are you bowing to him? He’s a small person.” 
More than a thousand people took to the streets on Saturday as part of a No Kings protest in downtown St. Louis (Anna Spoerre/Missouri Independent).
Beside Hamilton stood by her good friend, Dr. Seth Eisen, 84, the director of Washington University’s Clinical Rheumatology Research Program, who brought a sign that read: “hands off science.” 
“It’s really a throw-back for science and also for health care in St. Louis specifically, but in the state and in the nation as well,” said Hamilton, who in recent months has seen NIH funding decreased, studies halted, and colleagues leave academia for the pharmaceutical industry. 
“What’s happening now is going to impact research for 10 years,” he said. “Even if it were to change today.” 
Ryan Maliff, 35, of Webster Groves, who works in health care, is already seeing the impact on Missourians, including his patients who can no longer afford insulin. 
“A lot of what’s been done to gut the protections for Medicare and Medicaid, it’s affecting my work, it’s affecting my patients,” he said.

As the group rounded out its march through downtown, which lasted nearly two hours, Ari Jones-Bradley, 49, said she’s spent the past several months feeling hopeless, alone and terrified for the world her four sons are growing up in.
“We’re headed into extremely dark times, and this is not the country my grandfather fought for,” Jones-Bradley said of her grandfather who served in World War II at the Battle of Iwo Jima. 
But she said Saturday’s demonstration, which she called “electrifying,” shifted something in her. 
“I’m mad,” Jones-Bradley said. “I’m fully energized again and I’m ready to fight.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/101825_NoKings7-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-10-18 19:58:27.450897

“I love America, I love the Constitution, and I love what this country represents,” said Patrick McNally, 36, a dual citizen of Canada and the U.S. who joined a rally outside the North Dakota Capitol. 
Thousands protested Trump administration policies at rallies in Fargo and Bismarck with smaller events held in Grand Forks, Jamestown, Bottineau, Devils Lake, Dickinson, Williston, Minot and Medora. Some communities reported larger crowds than similar events in June, while others said windy weather deterred some participants.
U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson characterized the No Kings movement held in 2,600 cities as the “hate America rally.” Closer to home, North Dakota Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer called rally participants “left-wing nut jobs” in a statement last week.

Many North Dakotans who participated raised concerns about health care, including cuts to Medicaid and expiring subsidies for the Affordable Care Act, while others protested tariffs that are hurting farmers or advocated for protecting due process for immigrants.
“I’m very passionate about what’s happening in our country, so that is why I am protesting,” said Jessie Smette of Fargo, who joined a rally outside of City Hall. “Not because I have nothing better to do, and not because I’m getting paid to do it, but because I think it’s important work.” 
Trygve Hammer, a former Democratic-NPL Party U.S. House candidate, highlighted during a speech in Williston comments made by Republican lawmakers criticizing No Kings participants as far-left extremists who don’t value the foundational principles of the country.
“That is exactly wrong,” Hammer said in an interview after the event, which drew about 100 to Williston’s Harmon Park. “That’s exactly what we’re doing is standing up for those foundational truths.”

Bismarck rally participant Ann Mitchell, 57, is worried about the impacts of Trump administration tariffs and trade policies on her family’s farm near Pettibone, North Dakota. Mitchell said her husband’s family has farmed the land for generations, but now fears they could lose everything.
“We can’t sell our soybeans. We can’t sell our corn. Next year we don’t know what we’re gonna do,” Mitchell said. 
Beth Larson-Steckler, a 55-year-old Bismarck resident, said she has two chronically ill children who depend on Medicare for medication that can cost $1,000 a month. She wants the federal government to do more to protect health care and improve the existing system. 
“Congress needs to work together,” Larson-Steckler said. “They’re not working together. They’re pointing fingers. They’re wasting time. They’re not working for us.”
Across the street from the Bismarck protest, a handful of counter-protesters gathered at the North Dakota Republican Party headquarters with a sign stating “Jesus is Our King” and waving an American flag with Trump’s face on it.
Thousands joined the Fargo demonstration, including Clyde Hughes, a veteran who drove about 45 minutes from Wahpeton. He said the Republican Party is taking the country in the wrong direction. 
“We’re cutting social programs just to give billionaires tax cuts,” Hughes said.

He said he is grateful for the health care he gets through Veterans Affairs, though added, “You shouldn’t have to join the service to get decent health care,” he said.
Julie Brummund, an Air Force veteran from Fargo, said she is concerned about Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth eroding the freedom of the press. 
“I see American citizens justifying that and it just baffles my mind,” said Brummund, whose military service included an assignment in public affairs. 
Rick Loftus of Indivisible Fargo, who was volunteering to help with crowd control, said Fargo had a larger turnout than the No Kings rally in June. But he was also pleased to hear about strong turnouts around the state.
“It’s really these smaller places having events that’s inspiring to me,” Loftus said. 
A Grand Forks event attracted about 600 people, the largest protest since Trump was reelected, said organizer Julie Olson. She described the event as a “pro-America” rally, but said participants objected to Trump “acting with impunity.”
Nikki Tickerhoof, an organizer for the No Kings protest in Minot, said about 400 people attended the event that she said seemed like a block party with people handing out treats and wearing Halloween costumes.

About 150 people joined an event on Main Street in Valley City, with almost all of them emphasizing their love for America, said Vicki Voldal Rosenau, one of the organizers. Gail Pederson, a participant, said attendees also raised concerns about expiring subsidies for the Affordable Care Act and a lack of due process through immigration detentions.
“While that may not be a big thing in our neck of the woods, it certainly can affect us all,” Pederson said.
In Jamestown, organizers estimated about 250 people gathered near Mill Hill. Some who marched with signs had concerns about tariffs and the trade war, said Mike Weatherly, one of the organizers.
“Those things are hurting our farmers and they are finally starting to see it, which is terrible,” Weatherly said.
The demonstration remained peaceful, but one woman told participants to go back where they came from. 
“I’m right here. I’m right where I came from,” Weatherly said.
Approximately 100 people joined a No Kings protest in Devils Lake, organizers said, representing a broad cross section of the community. Veterans, farmers, teachers, clergy and others participated in the event that remained peaceful except for vociferous chants of “USA” that Nancy Lundon said rang out. 
“It wasn’t just Democrats,” Lundon said. “It was just people who are concerned about things as they are and what’s to come.”
About 25 people waved American flags during a rally in Bottineau, including some who traveled from Rolette and Westhope, said organizer Carol Wendel. 
“We’re here because we love America,” Wendel said. “And this is not the America we love.”

Eight residents of Medora decided to hold their own No Kings rally outside Theodore Roosevelt National Park rather than drive to an event in Dickinson. 
“We’re all so sad that our national parks are closed,” said Sandy Baertsch of Medora.
While the park remains open during the federal government shutdown, the visitor center is closed.
“We’ve seen lots of people come and are disappointed by the locked doors,” she said.
Baertsch said the group is calling on North Dakota’s congressional delegation to represent the state’s residents and farmers “instead of just doing whatever Trump asks, no matter what it is.”
Lucas Roy, 24, and Margaret Windingstad, 23, emphasized the need to protect public lands during the Bismarck event. 
“They’re not for sale. They shouldn’t be auctioned off for private uses,” Roy said.

Bob Ferguson addresses a No Kings rally in Everett on Oct. 18, 2025. (Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero for Washington State Standard)Gov. Bob Ferguson struck a defiant tone at the No Kings day rally in Everett, Washington, where thousands of people attended on Saturday.
“As governor, I promise you one thing above all else, we will never, ever under any circumstances, bend the knee to this autocrat,” he said of President Donald Trump.
In Everett, roughly 4,000 people attended the demonstration, according to Snohomish County Indivisible, the event organizers. The gathering remained peaceful, with attendees holding signs saying “defend democracy” and “no kings.”
Ferguson’s speech focused on defending democracy against authoritarian threats and protecting public health.
In his remarks he cited a letter U.S Attorney General Pam Bondi sent to him in August which threatened to withhold federal funding and prosecute elected leaders if they failed to cooperate with immigration enforcement.
“I can sum up the response letter with two words, hell no,” Ferguson said.
Ferguson said democracies die by a slow, steady erosion of civil liberties and free speech, a gradual consolidation of power in one individual, and prosecuting political enemies with criminal charges.
“Despite the challenges we’re facing as a country, no state in the country, no state in the country, is doing more to stand up to this administration and this autocrat than Washington state,” Ferguson said.
He brought up the West Coast Health Alliance, a public health alliance formed by 15 Democratic governors that Washington state joined. This alliance is aimed to protect public health by breaking away from the guidance of the Trump administration and U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
“Robert, that guy’s a crank, right?” Ferguson said. “Unfortunately, he’s in charge of public health for our country.”

Anita Dietrich, founder of Snohomish County Indivisible, described the actions of Trump as reckless, corrupt and more dangerous than ever.
“They want us silent while they target immigrant families, while they strip our rights, shred our schools, hand our future to billionaire cronies and act like kings above the law,” Dietrich said. “But America has no kings, not now, not ever.”
The first No Kings day was held in June and drew hundreds of thousands of people to the streets. It was one of the largest protests in Seattle’s history and in Olympia, over 5,000 people attended.
In the demonstration on Saturday, people began to gather around 12 p.m. near the Snohomish county courthouse in Everett. The official event with speakers began around 1 p.m.. and finished shortly after 2 p.m. once it started raining.
In Olympia, meanwhile, an estimated 4,000 people, some in costume and most toting signs emblazoned with personal political messages, attended the rally at the state Capitol.
Seated on the steps of the Capitol and Temple of Justice, they cheered loudly as David Reaves, senior pastor of New Life Baptist Church in Lacey, proclaimed to the “architects of mischief, your time is up.”
“This is a call to the real America. Hold onto hope and protect it fiercely,” he said, imploring attendees to commit to be actively engaged. “Whatever you do, damn it, do something,” he said.
The hour-long event ended with the crowd singing the National Anthem
Throngs of people headed to the grassy area around Tivoli Fountain, visiting information tents of event organizers, churches and political groups. Dozens stood alongside Capitol Way, waving signs as a brigade of cars carrying supporters passed by.

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — More than 1,000 protesters gathered around the Nebraska Capitol this weekend to protest against the Trump administration.
Saturday wasn’t the first crop of No Kings protests in the state; there were a dozen similar protests in June. This time around, there are 15. The protesters held anti-Trump signs criticizing the callousness of the administration’s immigration enforcement efforts and cuts to federal services. Some chanted for President Donald Trump “to go.” 
Some protesters, who did not give their names, said they were happy with the turnout, citing frustrations over the president’s deployment of the National Guard to Democratic-led cities and attacks on transgender rights as frustrations. 
The Nebraska protests were part of an estimated 1,900 protests nationally on Saturday, No Kings officials estimated. Organizers said people wanted to speak out against “authoritarian policies” and “reaffirm that America has No Kings, and the power belongs to the people.” 
State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln told the Examiner that the protests are “what Democracy looks like.” 
“[Democracy] was on my mind as I joined my mom, my son and my neighbors at a peaceful protest … to show love and support for our country and dissent for the current attacks on working families, civil rights, and basic democracy,” she said.

Gov. Jim Pillen shared no details this time around about security preparations, unlike June, when he publicized having activated the National Guard ahead of the first No Kings protests.
“Demonstrations will be actively monitored as they are held across the state and responded to appropriately to ensure the safety and security of the public,” said Laura Strimple, a spokesperson for Pillen.
Much like the midsummer protests, the one outside the Capitol was peaceful, with protesters holding signs by the side of the road as cars passed. Some cars honked in support, while one drove by with “Trump” flags. 
One counter-protester carried a sign that read “no queens” with a picture of former Vice President Kamala Harris. The Nebraska Republican Party called the protests across the state “an imagined, astro-turfed performance by Democrats trying to resuscitate a party in chaos through fear and theatrics.”

“Republicans will keep rallying behind a President who actually puts America first and negotiates peace deals in his spare time,” Nebraska GOP chair Mary Jane Truemper said in a statement.
Democratic and Democratic-aligned groups used the protests to reach potential voters. The Lancaster County Democrats, Stand Up Nebraska and the Democratic Socialists of America held booths. 
Local organizers booked musical performances and speakers. Speakers emphasized the importance of next year’s midterm elections. One of them was State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln, a Democrat in the officially nonpartisan Legislature. A musician sang “This Land Is Your Land.”
 “I know it’s a dark time in our country right now, and in a state like Nebraska it can sometimes feel impossible to beat billionaires, but I want to offer you some hope,” Dungan told the crowd. “I’m talking with people in their communities … and let me tell you. They’re pissed off, too.”

Most of the rallygoers also marched from the Statehouse to the Governor’s Mansion and back — 1 mile each way — to oppose the Republican governor who was one of Trump’s earliest backers.
The rally drew even more people than the one in June, which coincided with Trump’s birthday and Flag Day, said organizer Sam Gibbons of West Columbia. Similar demonstrations took place in cities across the state, including Greenville, which were among more than 2,600 planned nationwide.
Protesters remained peaceful as they chanted and carried signs down Columbia’s Main Street.
Police blocked off intersections and streets to keep incoming traffic away, but few uniformed officers patrolled the demonstration itself, and no confrontations arose, either at the protest in Columbia or at Falls Park in Greenville.

At issue for protesters was a wide variety of the Trump administration’s policies, including recent waves of deportations, federal cuts to health care research and what they considered moves away from democracy.
Attention turned to statewide issues as well.
Gibbons, a state liaison for national group 50501, urged attendees to vote in every election, including local ones, and show up to meetings at the Statehouse on contentious bills, such as the nearly total abortion ban scheduled for a second hearing next month.
Local demonstrations are also important in continuing to press for change, Gibbons said.
“Protests do matter,” the 34-year-old told the thousands gathered. “They may not immediately change policy or culture, but they can stir something within your soul.”
The crowd stood outside the gate of the Governor’s Mansion for about 15 minutes and chanted, “Henry Mac has got to go,” a shortening of Gov. Henry McMaster’s name.
McMaster was the first statewide official to back Trump ahead of South Carolina’s 2016 first-in-the-South GOP presidential primary. Then the lieutenant governor, McMaster ascended to governor in January 2017 when Trump picked Nikki Haley to be his first United Nations ambassador. McMaster, who went on to win two full terms and can’t run again, has been a staunch Trump supporter ever since.
Gibbons then swapped in names of other Republican politicians, including Attorney General Alan Wilson and U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace. Both are among five Republicans who have announced bids to replace McMaster in 2026.
No one came out from the Governor’s Mansion to address the crowd.
Change can come from persistent protests, said the Rev. Susie Smith of Clemson, a former pastor at Peace Congregational Church and a longtime activist.
She pointed to the removal of the Confederate battle flag from the Statehouse grounds as one example. For years, Smith was among those who sat around the flag on Saturdays and called for its removal. Legislators voted to take it down in 2015 after the hate-fueled massacre of nine people at a historic Black church in Charleston, known at Mother Emanuel, including its pastor, Sen. Clementa Pinckney. But Smith attributed its removal at least in part to calls from activists.
“Sometimes, it takes a crowd like you showing up week after week after week,” Smith said, to the cheering of the crowd.
In a red state like South Carolina, showing politicians that many people disagree with them and their policies is especially important, said Libby Davis. The 21-year-old from Columbia, dressed as the Statue of Liberty, said she hoped the turnout Saturday showed a widespread discontent with Trump. The name of the protest and many of the signs opposed what attendees view as a lack of checks and balances in the federal government, making it akin to a monarchy.

“This crown should be the only crown in America,” Davis said, pointing to the crown on her own head, which mirrored the one atop the statue in New York City.
Dietician Deb Waldron joined thousands at Falls Park in Greenville because she was concerned about Trump’s cuts to the National Institutes of Health, she said.
“(Health Secretary) Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is anti-vax, which is dangerous to Americans,” Waldron said. “He’s cutting science and medical research.”
Kennedy’s slogan is Make America Healthy Again, but Waldron contends the opposite is happening.
Thy Nguyen, a 19-year-old whose family moved to Columbia from Vietnam five years ago, said she loved America and hates seeing some of Trump’s changes. In particular, she worries about tariffs causing prices to rise and people getting deported, she said.
Nguyen added she’s not worried about her own presence in the country, but she worries about the country’s future.
“I got my citizenship for a reason,” Nguyen said. “Ain’t no way that (Trump) ruins this.”

Sitting apart from the main body of the Greenville rally in the shade, Connor Roper, 22, a transgender man, and his two friends said they came to the protest to support transgender rights. The three expressed concern about anti-transgender legislation and the Trump administration’s harsh rhetoric.
Roper said he had considered leaving the country.
“I grew up here and it’s been scary,” Roper said. “I’m not blind to how transgender people are treated here, but I still love the area. The writing on the wall is pretty plain, but I don’t want to have to emigrate. I don’t want to leave my grandma. I don’t know how much time she has left.”
Several protesters dressed in a variety of costumes, including a unicorn and a hippo. Greenville resident Kelly Foster attended the rally dressed as a nun.
“I don’t think things are going well with this administration and I’m fearful that things will get worse,” she said.
Foster said she chose a nun’s costume to promote peace.

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)COTTONWOOD FALLS — Kay Krause was searching for a way to make a difference with so much “craziness happening around us.”
So she meditated.
That’s how she came up with the idea to try to make life better for immigrants who are housed at the Chase County Detention Center a half-mile from her house.
“You don’t have to take a political stand to support people that are imprisoned,” she said. “That’s a love stand.”
Krause has collected more than $5,000 to support the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees, providing them with postcards and stamps. The jail can hold about 150 detainees who are in transition to larger facilities elsewhere in the country, with some only there for 48 hours and most gone in two weeks. That’s not enough time for them to be assigned a federal ID number. Without the postcards and stamps, their families wouldn’t know where they are or where they are going, Krause said.
Krause also has organized jail-sanctioned donations of soccer balls, games and other items through an Amazon gift registry, and she is planning a pizza party for detainees during Thanksgiving week.
On Saturday, she expanded her efforts by hosting a “love in action” rally at her house. The gathering of 13 in the rural town of about 800 people was among the smallest of the 42 No Kings events that were planned across the state as part of a nationwide uprising.
Krause’s event was different because it focused on kindness rather than the anger toward the Trump administration that brought the attendees together around a campfire in her backyard. Trump won about 75% of the Chase County votes in last year’s election.
“At some point, this whole mess is going to be over, and then what are we going to do?” she said in an interview earlier in the week. “We’ve got to start building bridges. We’ve got to start seeing our neighbors as neighbors and not enemies. We’ve just got to start reaching out and looking for the good in each other, because it’s there. It’s just covered up with all this craziness.”
The attendees included a couple from Wichita, a local folksinger, a professional musician from Colorado, and a Topeka man who was protesting Trump for a 164th consecutive day.

A tortoiseshell cat and two large dogs listened in as Randall McKinnon, of Fairplay, Colorado, and Rodney Bates, who lives just east of nearby Strong City, played Kris Kristofferson’s “Here Comes This Rainbow Again,” which was inspired by a chapter from “The Grapes of Wrath,” and John Denver’s “Take Me Home, Country Roads.”
McKinnon was in between gigs in Kansas City and Wichita. He said he appreciated the rally’s focus on “acts of love.”
“There’s enough hatred going on out there,” McKinnon said. “I could have gone to some of the metro area protests, where they have a little different flavor to them, but I left my inflatable frog suit at home.”
His comment was a reference to viral images of protesters dancing in costume outside an ICE office in Portland, Oregon.
Bates, an 80-year-old who arrived with a dobro, said he has been “negative about monarchy” since he was in grade school. He lamented the way politics have “degenerated into gang warfare,” where people wear either a red or blue bandana.
“I think this is more extreme than even the ’60s,” he said. “For a long time, I thought it was kind of like the ’60s all over again, but I think it’s gone farther, more extreme.”
Marcia Freund, of Wichita, said she believes the Trump presidency is different from others because “the power grab is so much worse.”
She said Trump isn’t taking care of America, and she worried about people who are at risk of losing food assistance because of the government shutdown.
“Here we’re having these little protests, and he has an insurrection, but he acts like we’re the hateful ones,” Freund said.

Thomas Muther, of Topeka, said he has protested in towns from northwest to southeast Kansas, as well as in Missouri and Arkansas. He plans to continue his streak of 164 consecutive days of protests until Trump leaves office.
Why?
“I’m a fan of democracy,” he said. “I’m not a fan of autocracy.”
“But there are lots and lots of reasons,” Muther added. “I think immigrants should be treated fairly. I think the law should be followed by everybody, especially including the president.”
Krause led the group in meditation. She asked them to take deep breaths, to be aware of the smell of the campfire and the sounds around them, and to try to lift their problems off their shoulders for a moment.
“It’s so easy to fall into the muck pond, where things are hard,” Krause told them. “We get overwhelmed with fear, anger, at things happening around us. We miss those opportunities to be fully present to what is. And in this moment, right here, right now, all is well.”
After the meditation, she walked down the street handing out roses on her way to the Dollar General store, where she paid for a man’s order.
“Just for a moment, people smiled,” she said. “And these days, I’ll take it.”

Debo Powers, on Oct. 18, 2025. (Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)HAMILTON — DILLON — POLEBRIDGE — Kent Kernahan, of Corvallis, said he’s a Methodist minister’s child, and he demonstrated Saturday at the No Kings Indivisible Bitterroot rally after asking himself what his father would have done.
Kernahan carried a sign that said, “Lord, Please Forgive Trump,” along with an image of the Gadsden “Don’t Tread On Me” image.
Among more than 700 people who lined several blocks of U.S. Highway 93 in downtown Hamilton, Kernahan said the symbol represents opposition to the king of England stepping on the colonies, but it’s misunderstood by some who claim it.
“I don’t think it means what they think it means,” Kernahan said. 
No Kings Indivisible Bitterroot, part of a national No Kings rally and among a couple of dozen planned demonstrations in Montana, took place in Hamilton, a smaller community of roughly 5,000 in the Bitterroot Valley.
Montana supported GOP President Donald Trump with 58% of the vote in 2024, but Ravalli County, a Republican stronghold in the red Bitterroot, backed him with 69%.
Nonetheless, Montanans turned out in traditionally red communities, such as Dillon, with a population of roughly 4,000, and they gathered in tiny outposts such as Polebridge, on the edge of Glacier National Park, which almost saw more demonstrators than full-time residents.
Most of the people who turned out to demonstrate appeared to be those who had already opposed Trump, the brash leader pushing the boundaries of presidential authority in his second term, and before the government shutdown, which has seen 700,000 federal workers furloughed.
But demonstrators said they rallied to show support for democracy, for the U.S. Constitution, for civil liberties, for federal workers, for immigrants, for their own grandchildren, for health care, for the proper use of military troops, and for science and research.
Cherie Garofalo, a local organizer of Indivisible, said the aim of the gathering was to protect liberties in the country for all, for her children, friends and neighbors.
“I really believe this is about freedom,” Garofalo said.
Debo Powers, a Democratic state Representative who organized a rally near the northern entrance of Glacier National Park, said it was the duty of Americans to take to their local streets and make their voices heard.   
“We have got to resist. It’s the patriotic thing to do,” Powers said.

 Bitterrooters rally for freedom, democracy 

Stephen Goheen, of Corvallis, held up a sign that read, “Scientists Save Lives,” not far from a National Institutes of Health biomedical research facility in Hamilton, the Rocky Mountain Laboratories.
“If we don’t fund our scientists, we won’t be ready for the next diseases,” Goheen said.
For example, he said, the mRNA vaccine was based on research that had taken place over many years, and it proved valuable during the COVID-19 pandemic.
“The work that scientists do sometimes doesn’t show its value until years down the line,” Goheen said.
The Rocky Mountain Laboratories has employed roughly 500 people in recent years, according to KFF.
The lab, controversial in the Bitterroot, will run on a skeleton crew during the shutdown after roughly a dozen workers lost their jobs in February and other employees opted for early retirements, according to Lee Enterprises.
Not everyone at Saturday’s events was opposed to Trump, though, and Betty Belshe, of Hamilton, said she’s actually opposed to the lab, which studies infectious diseases and is designated a BSL-4 facility, a maximum containment laboratory.
She said she fears people in the Bitterroot might be exposed to biochemical hazards from the lab.
“If it gets out in our air, it’s going to harm us,” Belshe said.
Saturday, Belshe demonstrated to show support for Trump and his bold actions, including cutting government.
“We’ve got way too many government employees,” Belshe said. 
Belshe and her husband, Casey Leedy, both of Hamilton, stood next to a flag that read, “Vote Republican,” but they appeared to be in the minority along the highway.
Brooke Hillyer, wearing a Smokey Bear top, said she dressed to show her support for national parks and the U.S. Forest Service, and the bear is the best representative for that message.
National parks have remained open during the shutdown, and some conservation advocates worry the public resources will be damaged without proper staffing.
“I believe that Trump is ruining our country, what we stand for,” Hillyer said.
Susan Crawford, of Corvallis, said she doesn’t believe she’s being represented by Montana’s federal delegation, politicians who have ceded their power to the president.
“They’re giving up duties that we voted them in to do,” Crawford said.
Nancy Neal of Corvallis, Montana, counted more than 700 participants at the No Kings Indivisible Bitterroot rally in Hamilton on Saturday, Oct. 18, 2025. Neal said she’s not using the term “antifa” anymore. She said it’s “anti-fascist.” (Keila Szpaller/The Daily Montanan)
She held a sign that read, “The Only White House Thrones ‘R’ Porcelain.”
“We are experiencing someone in the White House who is acting omnipotent, and we’re letting him,” Crawford said. “He does not deserve a throne, and we don’t want him on a throne, except this one.”
Although the theme of the rally was No Kings, Dean Knudsen, of Hamilton, said he had a different idea about a king.
In Montana, 55% of people are Christian, and Knudsen stood on one corner of the highway with a compilation of signs that read, “Jesus is King,” and “Jesus, Our Only Hope.”
“There is a king, and his name is Jesus,” Knudsen said.
On the opposite corner, Megan Kelly, in a puffy chicken costume just for “sh**s and giggles,” held a sign that read, “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses …”
She said closing down the government meant shutting people out of the things they need, such as education and health care, the opposite of helping those who are tired and poor. 
“I am letting the government know that the American people are not to be messed with,” Kelly said. 
Ron Osborn, a veteran of the Korean War, held up a sign that said, “The Military Defends Freedom. Don’t Use It To Crush It.”
Osborn, almost 93, said he believes the Trump administration’s approach to the military is “a disgrace.” Montana has a high number of military veterans, roughly 9% of the population. 
He said Pete Hegseth, head of the Department of Defense, or Department of War as the Trump administration has attempted to rebrand it, is “fully unqualified,” and the former Fox News television personality has no business leading the military or lecturing admirals.
Osborn and his wife, Nancy Osburn, took to the streets to show their patriotism.
“We’re proud American citizens, loyal to the flag and the Constitution,” Ron Osborn said.
Alla Brooks said she’s a child of immigrants, “an anchor baby,” and she held a sign with a picture of the Statue of Liberty that read, “I’m with her.”
“She was at the head of our harbor,” Brooks said.
She said her parents grew up in repressive Poland, and they drummed into their children the freedoms of America and the First Amendment.
Doug Hatchimonji’s parents, both Japanese, were interned in camps in the U.S. during World War II, and he said it’s important to protect people’s rights to speak, protest and assemble.
“It’s sad and disappointing that an old story continues to be repeated again and again,” said Hatchimonji, of Hamilton, and spouse of Garofalo. “It’s the same story, blaming people of color for problems that they didn’t create.”
One Trump priority is deporting people who are in the country illegally, but law enforcement authorities under his administration have detained many people who have the right to be in the United States, including Americans and elected officials.
Kandice Gren, in a red gnome dress and pointy hat, said she was concerned about the new reduction in the distribution of power among the three branches of government.
Her sign read, “Gnomes say NO KINGS!”
Montanans are practical people, and Gren explained her getup.
“It’s the only costume I own,” Gren said.

 Frustrated participants convene for Dillon’s largest demonstration

About 200 people showed up to line North Montana Street through Dillon, and they held signs, played guitars and talked with one another. At least one participant told the Daily Montanan it appeared to be the biggest the town has seen.
For Emilee Gates, 26, who helps people navigate the social safety net as part of her job, coming to the event in Dillon was in part born out of frustration. One action the Trump administration has taken is to severely cut the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, calling it “unnecessary.”
What that means for one person Gates has worked with is that instead of $1,500 to pay for energy, they now have $150.
“That’s one propane fill up,” Gates said, saying that the man was living in a camper — which is legal in Montana she added.
Some people attended the rally from Ennis and Twin Bridges, organizers said, even carpooling to get there.

 Polebridge protest exceeds local population 

More than 60 people gathered to take part in a No Kings Indivisible rally in the hamlet of Polebridge, in the borderlands of Glacier National Park, locally organized by Rep. Powers.
The area surrounding Polebridge is colloquially known as the North Fork, and boasts around 100 year-round residents, including Powers. 
“Almost all of the people here are North Forkers, so they’re my constituents,” Powers told the Daily Montanan. “There were a few tourists who were coming to Glacier Park, saw us, and they joined us. That was fun, but mostly it’s people who are my neighbors.”
An intersection of dirt roads is home to the iconic red Polebridge Mercantile — and its equally iconic huckleberry bear claws — standing sentinel near the northernmost entrance to Glacier.
Armed with signs, flags, and costumes, the ralliers circled up in the dirt intersection, occasionally parting ways to let cars headed into the national park squeeze through, along with one disgruntled carload of tourists who grumbled about not needing to be confronted with politics as they walked into the Mercantile to get coffee and pastries. 
Powers, who served in her first Legislative session as an elected official this year, greeted most people by name and at noon pulled out her megaphone. 
“I swore a sacred oath to protect the Constitution of the United States and the constitution of Montana,” she said. “The problem we have today is we have some people who are ignoring their own sacred oaths of office.”
Focusing on the theme of the nationwide rallies — expected to be among the highest participation protest events in history — Powers reminded those gathered that 250 years ago, residents of what would become the United States made a decision to not have a king. 
“We made that decision already, and we did not unmake it,” she said, to responding cheers of “no kings!” 
Not standing up and making their voices heard could be detrimental to residents of Montana, she continued. 
“If we are silent, we could lose it all. We could lose our public lands. We could lose our public education. We could lose our social security and medicare. We could lose our sacred right to vote in free and fair elections,” Powers said. 
Powers represents House District 3, which encompasses the North Fork border of Glacier Park, as well as half of Whitefish. She told the Daily Montanan she felt it was her duty to host a No Kings rally for her community, especially since the next closest one, in Kalispell, is a nearly two-hour drive away. 
“I just asked for seven people to show up so we would have enough to spell out “N-O K-I-N-G-S,” she said. “It’s important to gather close to home, and it’s important to see people in small villages, in red states, not just in big blue cities. This group would get swallowed up there, but here, we stand out.”

				Republican officials nationwide have branded the No Kings demonstrations as “Hate America” rallies.
Montana’s senior U.S. Sen. Steve Daines echoed those statements in an appearance on Fox Business this week. “As Speaker Johnson correctly said, this is a “We hate America rally” and the bottom line is the Democrats and the far left are very upset at the fact they lost the election last November. President Trump won in a landslide, we reclaimed the United States Senate, and we have the House. They are frustrated. They are angry. But sadly they are expressing their anger and frustration by shutting down the government and hurting the American people.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/No_Kings_polebridge_06-1024x707.jpg,,,2025-10-18 18:57:57.339874

For much of the past year, I’ve been writing a series of issue briefs for CommonWealth Beacon on a variety of controversial policy topics (see below), providing evidence-based arguments pro and con, in contrast to the bumper stickers from the left and right that too often pass for civic discourse. 
There are two main points to the series. 
First, even though almost every policy issue has ethical and philosophical dimensions, there are also complicated practical and technical aspects that make many if not most decisions closer calls, involving real-world trade-offs and unintended consequences. 
Second, when you don’t view the opposing side as morally bankrupt or just plain ignorant, there may actually be opportunities for finding common or higher ground, maybe not to reach a final consensus, but at least to take a step forward together. 
The tendency towards reductionism in most policy debates these days often makes a meeting of the minds next to impossible and compromise equivalent to surrender. 
Should Boston enact rent control? Activists in favor say affordable housing is a fundamental human right, while advocates on the other side say free markets and private property stand between us and big-government tyranny. 
Should the state stop prison construction? The left says prisons are inhumane centers of mass incarceration, while the right says “lock ‘em up.” 
Should Massachusetts adopt voter ID requirements? The right says, “stop the steal,” while the left cries “voter suppression.” 
Should the Commonwealth pay reparations to descendants of slaves? Advocates in favor say it’s a matter of overdue social justice, while opponents claim it’s just a performative “woke” hand out. 
Should school librarians make final decisions about which books to stock on the shelves? The left warns against book bans, while the right defends parents’ rights. 
It turns out in all these controversies the facts aren’t always so clear or one-sided, and reasonable people can disagree.  Even when it seems like there is no common ground at all, we need to have enough self-awareness of our own fallibility and respect for the honestly held beliefs of others, no matter how misguided we may think they are, to hold on loosely to our own positions so we can view the other side as temporary opponents, rather than permanent enemies. 
Deciding which side you’re on should at least require an open-minded consideration of the opposing arguments. 
Think the cost of housing in Boston is outrageously high?  Consider whether price controls would suppress the supply of new rental apartments. 
Think prisons keep our communities safe?  Consider the extent to which former prisoners continue to commit crimes after finishing their sentences. 
Think voter ID laws are inherently discriminatory? Consider the high rates of minority voter turnout in states that already have such requirements. 
Think reparations are unjustified? Consider the enormity of the Black-White wealth gap, 160 years after the end of slavery and 60 years after passage of the Civil Rights Act. 
Think school library book bans are threatening free speech and inclusivity?  Consider how few communities in Massachusetts have actually removed books from the shelves. 
There’s no doubt that these debates are fraught with serious differences in values and world views, and righteous rage (as Billy Joel might say) can indeed prick the conscience and spur action. But that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t dial down the rhetoric and personal attacks in order to get on with the more prosaic and pragmatic business of policymaking. 
The goal is not to confuse or paralyze, but to acknowledge and clarify the inescapable choices in public policy, while encouraging humility, civility, and even empathy in our public discourse. 
As a matter of long-term self-interest, if nothing else, we need to keep in mind that even if “our side” wins this round, the wheel will inevitably turn, and the balance of forces will no longer be in your favor. Total victory today leads to hard feelings and long memories that can become total defeat tomorrow. As fellow citizens, this is an unsustainable pattern that can only end in calamity, not just for some, but for all. 
As we enter the final days of another polarized election season, let’s look forward to the coming year as a time to get off our high horses and embrace the complexity of the real world in hopes of restoring some semblance of common cause, as well as commonsense.

It wasn’t a traffic jam — from noon to 3 p.m. Saturday, a steady stream of cars and trucks were honking their support for a No Kings protest that lined both sides of the divided highway, drawing thousands of demonstrators frustrated with the Trump administration.
The rally was awash with colorful characters — among them the Cookie Monster from the children’s show “Sesame Street,” a pink axolotl, dinosaurs and dragons of many different hues and giant yellow chickens.
Erin Grabau, who came wearing a skeletal unicorn ensemble, said she was inspired by demonstrators in Portland who dressed in inflatable frog costumes — but decided on a less elaborate outfit because, “in this economy, no, I’m sorry.”

“It was making a point of showing we’re not violent,” Grabau said. “We’re not causing violence. You can’t turn the narrative.”
Matt Mercer, spokesperson for the North Carolina Republican Party, condemned the protesters as radicals damaging the country.
“Far-left radical Democrats shut down the federal government to brag at these events they shut down the government to stop President Trump,” Mercer said in a statement. “These manufactured events do nothing but highlight how out of touch the radical left is with the American people and here in North Carolina, thousands of voters every month reject being labeled a Democrat.”
Gary Lucido, a Texas transplant in North Carolina, said he had voted Republican all his life before President Donald Trump came along. He said GOP descriptions of No Kings as “Hate America” protests — as Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) called them — are a “bunch of crap.”
“We love America. We’re here because we want to preserve America,” Lucido said at the Raleigh No Kings protest. “The ones that hate it are the ones that don’t believe in the Constitution.”
For many protesters, the No Kings rally was a family outing. All along Capital Boulevard, children and toddlers could be seen with their parents, some wearing costumes or face coverings of their own and others resting in strollers.
“They need to know when it’s appropriate to stand and fight, and sometimes standing and fighting is standing in a silly costume on the side of the road with a sign and screaming at the top of your lungs,” Grabau said.
Some also brought their four-legged friends. Jeffrey Cohn, a medical writer from Clayton, brought his dogs Bindi and Obi to the No Kings protest in Raleigh, and despite the honking and cheers, they stayed calm as can be.
Cohn came dressed as President Donald Trump’s error-filled “Liberation Day” tariff information sheet. He said it was a relief to be in the company of so many people just as distressed as he is at the direction America has taken.
“We are a majority, and the folks who are trying to destroy and burn, whether it’s for political reasons, whether it’s for Christian Nationalism, white supremacy reasons — there’s more of us who don’t feel that way than do feel that way,” he said.








The soundtrack at the protest was an eclectic combination, with David Bowie and Bob Dylan bleeding into No Doubt’s “Just a Girl” and Rockwell’s “Somebody’s Watching Me.” Protesters’ costumes and flags called to mind various pop culture icons, with one protester flying the flag of the rebellion from “Star Wars” and others dressed as characters like No Face from the anime film “Spirited Away.”

Top of mind for many of the rally-goers was fair voting maps, with North Carolina set to become the latest state to draw new districts at Trump’s direction to shore up the Republican majority in the House of Representatives ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.
“Gerrymandering is cheating!” read one protester’s sign. Another featured QR codes linking to the proposed new congressional map and a submission form for public comment. “Tell the NC General Assembly: Stop gerrymandering,” that sign urged.
Recent polling shows that a vast majority of North Carolinians oppose partisan gerrymandering, including 87% of Democrats and 78% of Republicans.
Donna and Larry Shipman, activists who recently relocated from Pennsylvania, also came to No Kings to fight for their right to vote, pointing to key Voting Rights Act protections under threat at the U.S. Supreme Court.
“We need to stand up and say, ‘No, you’re not going to take this away from us,’” said Donna Shipman. “The Supreme Court, they say racism is over. No, it’s not.”
The Raleigh event was just one of several in the Triangle area. No Kings protests in Cary, Apex, Durham and Carrboro also saw large turnouts. More than 50 events were planned in North Carolina, organizers said, among some 2,600 nationwide.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PA184532-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-18 18:57:57.339874

People told the Reformer they were there to fight for democracy against the threat of what they say is President Donald Trump’s overreach, including deploying the National Guard to cities, deporting immigrants without due process and cutting off federal funds to Democratic states.
Protestors carried signs decrying authoritarianism — “No Kings, No Fascists” — and condemning U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement — “I like my democracy neat. Hold the ICE.”

The last No Kings rally was June 14, the day of the assassination of Mark and Rep. Melissa Hortman. Thousands of people showed up to the Minnesota State Capitol that day, despite advice from local law enforcement to stay home, to protest against the Trump administration’s slide into tyranny.
Republicans previewed Saturday’s event in recent days by calling it a “hate America” rally associated with a “pro-terrorist” wing of the Democratic Party, claims belied by the peaceful crowd, which was marked by playfulness as much as anger.
Some wore inflatable costumes, inspired by the dinosaurs, frogs and ostriches at Portland, Oregon protests against federal immigration enforcement there.

Alex Kaiser, 29, said that wearing his frog costume helps “deflate the message that we’re terrorists or these awful people. Obviously that’s not the case. We all love our country and are trying to make it a better place.”
Dinosaur-clad Pat Bear, 57, said, “It’s really important that we show that we’re not happy with what’s going on, and we’ll do it peacefully.” Bear decried Trump’s immigration policy and the “graft he has going on with crypto,” referring to Trump and his family making millions from opaque crypto deals even since he’s become president.

Sarah Harding, 35, dressed as a penguin, was at the rally to protest ICE and said she wore the costume to show that “we’re peaceful people” and to “bring ridiculousness to what’s happening.”
Jack Harding, 35, Sarah’s spouse, also in a penguin suit “to show the absurdity of it. America has $40 billion to give to ICE but not enough to make health care affordable.”
Another dinosaur, Nick Robinson, 42, said he was there to “stand up for democracy.”
“Bypassing checks and balances in government is definitely something that upsets me,” Robinson said.
Robinson’s sister, Michelle Wheeler, 33, added, “Donald Trump is playing directly out of the fascist, authoritarian playbook. I’m here to stand up for my family and show my kids what it means to fight for democracy.”

Wheeler said she wants Democrats to feel emboldened by the nationwide rallies. “The shutdown is the bare minimum Democrats should be doing to protect our health care, but it’s by no means going far enough,” Wheeler said. “Minnesota Democrats are playing by the old rules when the game has changed. We need to see them thinking outside the box.”
Among the Minnesota officials present at the rally were U.S. Senator Tina Smith and Attorney General Keith Ellison, who addressed the Commons crowd.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MG_4679-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-18 18:57:57.339874

(Photo by Mary Iuvone for New Jersey Monitor)Thousands of New Jersey residents took their rage — and ridicule — to the streets Saturday during the latest national No Kings protests, with some wearing silly costumes to push back on critics’ claims that protesters are violent, anti-American extremists.
Critics of President Donald Trump mobbed more than two dozen towns in the Garden State, from Newton down to Cape May Court House, to accuse his administration of “authoritarianism.”
Critics, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, have derided the mass day of action as a “Hate America rally” bound to draw “Antifa types.” The No Kings protesters were happy to nix that notion.
Daniel Buchanan of Union County showed up to a rally outside the Statehouse in Trenton in an inflatable traffic cone costume, while Amy Bruno of Ewing wore an inflatable unicorn outfit and called herself “Aunt Tifa.” In Princeton, a bean bag frog balanced on Susan Steen’s baseball cap carried its own tiny sign declaring: “I AM AMPHIFA.” Nearby, Sarah Schwimmer wore colorful fringe from head to toe in her piñata costume. “Because I  our Democracy (even more than I love candy!),” her sign said.
“We’re just trying to exercise our First Amendment rights and protest, and yet we’re being painted as terrorists and as violent. We’ve been trying different ways to show that that’s silly, and we mean no harm, and we’re not violent, and the whole point is to get a message out,” Buchanan said.
His message: “Those in power only care about themselves and their own agenda. We’re not going to just sit and be quiet and be OK with it. There’s a lot more people than they think that are against this.”

The protests came amid a government shutdown now in its third week, federal deployments of National Guard troops to police several U.S. cities, and immigration agents carrying out Trump’s mass deportation mission. Protesters denounced such actions as an unacceptable, escalating assault on the American people.
“How many sins have they committed against us? How many wounds have they inflicted on us? Too many!” Andrei Camurungan, an organizer with 50501, shouted at the crowd in Trenton.
Laura Hunt of Burlington Township said she was protesting because she feels the U.S. is “in a crisis situation.” She listed several concerns, ranging from Trump’s immigration crackdowns to “his words towards women.”
“He was talking about the leader of Italy, talking about how beautiful she is. What planet is he from? What century is he in?” Hunt said. “He is a horrible, horrible excuse for a human being. I’m disgusted.”
Millions were expected to attend about 2,600 rallies around the nation, making Saturday the largest mass day of action since the start of Trump’s first term, when the largest single-day mobilization included about 750 rallies, national organizers said.
“This is a genuinely nationwide phenomenon. It is occurring in rural places. It is occurring in urban areas. It is occurring in red places and blue places. The public backlash to Donald Trump and his regime of cronies and corruption and attacks on our rights is incredibly widespread,” said Leah Greenberg, a co-founder and co-executive director of the Indivisible Project.



































































































































































































In Princeton, hundreds of people packed the sprawling block-long park in front of the municipal building.
Sandy Landman of East Brunswick was there with a posterboard listing just some of her concerns about Trump — and they filled both sides.
“Terrible things are going on in this country. Your free speech is being limited. He’s taking money from taxpayers, enriching himself. He’s giving it to Argentina, of all places. He’s taking that tunnel project out of New York because he’s punishing Democratic states and cities — it’s ridiculous. ICE, to me, mirrors the Gestapo. He just freed George Santos, who was an admitted criminal. Health care — it should be a right, not something that you have to fight for constantly,” she said. “We have a lot of things that we need to protest this administration about, because they’re not taking care of the people.”
The protests also became a place to politick, with Dale Caldwell, a Democrat who’s running to become New Jersey’s next lieutenant governor on a slate with gubernatorial hopeful Mikie Sherrill, stopping by the Trenton rally. He urged protesters to vote in the Nov. 4 election, saying Trump — who endorsed Sherrill’s Republican rival, Jack Ciattarelli — wants them to stay home from the polls.

“Trump has a Supreme Court abdicating their responsibility, has a Republican Congress abdicating responsibility. If Jack Ciattarelli is governor, New Jersey is going to abdicate our responsibility, ICE is going to be roaming the streets, the National Guard is going to be roaming the streets,” Caldwell said.
He added: “All of you here know how important it is to vote, but you’ve got to tell your family, you’ve got to tell your friends, we’re fighting against apathy. We’re fighting against people staying home, not voting. Trump is discouraging people, and he’s winning when he does that.”
Sherrill appeared at the No Kings protest in Montclair after headlining a campaign rally in Paramus with Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D). State Sen. Holly Schepisi, a Bergen County Republican, told reporters outside the Paramus rally that she finds Sherrill’s appearance at a No Kings rally “ironic” because Gov. Phil Murphy (D) and Whitmer issued myriad directives in 2020 without legislative approval that ordered business closures, lockdowns, and other actions related to the COVID-19 spread.
“To be doing No Kings protests in New Jersey, when her party, her governor, the governor she invited, were directly responsible for taking away all of the civil liberties, doing everything pursuant to executive order, and causing the deaths of our most vulnerable in the state, I find it to be unconscionable,” she said.

About 15 protests were scheduled around Alabama, part of over 2,600 demonstrations scheduled on Saturday that were expected to draw millions of people. Speakers and participants criticized the administration’s seizure of power; its arrest and detention of immigrants and its policies toward health care. Others said Trump administration policies were hurting members of their families.
The protests were largely peaceful, with no major incidents reported.
A similar round of protests were held in June and drew millions of people to 1,500 sites nationwide. About 14 of those protests were held in Alabama that day with thousands of people in attendance.
Crowd sizes varied, from about 40 people in Selma to up to 2,000 in Birmingham. Here are reports from four of the protests on Saturday.
Birmingham: Calls for community and activism

(Photo by Andi Rice for Alabama Reflector)
A crowd of approximately 2,000 people gathered in Railroad Park Saturday for Birmingham’s “No Kings” protest, hearing from speakers including former U.S. Sen. Doug Jones before peacefully marching along a seven-block parade route, carrying signs and engaging in call-and-response chants while drivers honked their horns in support.
“We’re here today, like so many more that have come to Birmingham before us, not just for a No Kings rally but for civil rights, for anti-war protests, you name it, to speak out about injustices when they see it,” Jones told the cheering audience that filled the park’s pavilion and spilled onto a hillside beyond it.
“We’re here because, ‘Freedom is a fragile thing, and it’s never more than a generation away from extinction,’” he continued, quoting Ronald Reagan’s 1967 inaugural address as California’s governor. “Two hundred and fifty years ago, this country was born of one thing that every American generation has reaffirmed: no kings.”
Attendees hailing from Birmingham and surrounding suburbs and towns cited concerns about human rights and vulnerable people, including the poor and immigrants, threats to democracy and freedom of speech, and opposition to President Donald Trump’s policies as reasons they came to the rally.
“I thought it was very important that we come out and that we show, really, as a country, how we feel about what’s going on in our government, how oppressive it is, and that we’re saying, ‘No,’” said DeValerie Williams of Birmingham. “We’re saying, ‘No, we love our country. We want our country to stay a democracy, where we care about each other. And I think the only way to do this is for us to be a show of force.”

We want our country to stay a democracy, where we care about each other. And I think the only way to do this is for us to be a show of force.” (Olivia McMurrey for Alabama Reflector)
In her remarks to the crowd, Rev. Julie Conrady of the Unitarian Universalist Church of Birmingham said the city redefined freedom and equality in 1965.
“Over and over in the history of our country, we, the people, have been the necessary checks and balances to ensure that our country continues to progress, improve and prosper,” Conrady said.
She encouraged people to get involved in local causes.
“There is not a lot we can do at the federal government right now,” Conrady said. “One party controls all three branches of government, and one despot’s marching orders control them all. Our resistance must focus locally and statewide, where together, we can make meaningful change.”
Quoting the words of U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, who called the No Kings protests a “hate-America rally,” attendees and speakers at the Birmingham event said they wanted to correct such misunderstandings.
“There’s a lot of people in this country who care passionately about what’s going on with the current administration and all the corruption and all the lies, taking people’s health care away and giving tax breaks to the rich,” said Greg Fuller of Birmingham. “I think it’s un-American. I think it’s not patriotic. And I think this group is full of people who love America, not hate America, as the speaker said.”
Idania Gonzalez with the Alabama Coalition for Immigrant Justice, told the crowd to look around them because the rally is what community looks like.
“This is what power looks like when people stand together for the same cause, when people stand together for our neighbors who are scared to come out, for our neighbors who are living in the shadows due to political fighting,” she said.

Comedian Rebecca Rothman gave rally goers a primer on how to contact their U.S. representatives and then demonstrated it by calling Sen. Tommy Tuberville’s office and leaving a message. She gave the crowd time to make their own calls and encouraged them to place five calls a day.
Candra Bethune of Birmingham said she’s going to do that. Attending the rally made her feel better, even though things are bad, she said, because before she didn’t know what she could do as one person to make a difference.
“We’ve got to do something to let them know that we don’t want this,” Bethune said.

Montgomery: Warnings about federal policy changes

More than 600 people gathered in downtown Montgomery for the city’s “No Kings” rally.
“The kind of change that we are trying to achieve is not the kind of change that happens fast,” said Tabitha Isner, vice chair of the Alabama Democratic Party, who spoke at the rally. “This is the kind of change that requires we keep showing up. The last time we showed up, we were a good, decent crowd, but this time we are bigger. The next time we show up, we will be even bigger.”
The protest, which began at Riverfront Park, featured people dressed in makeshift costumes displaying dinosaurs and squirrels and others who adorned themselves with colors of the rainbow. Many carried cardboard placards replete with crowns that were crossed out with the words “No Kings” on them.
At 9 a.m. the crowd then marched a quarter mile to the Court Square Fountain, a site where enslaved people were bought and sold prior to the Civil War, to hear from speakers who urged them to continue the public outcry, and who criticized nearly every aspect of Trump’s policies, from mass arrest and deportations of immigrants to tariffs on trade, as well as the budget bill that Congress passed at Trump’s urging that cut funding for social service programs.

Valtoria Jackson of the Poor People’s Campaign addresses a “No Kings” rally in Montgomery, Alabama on Oct. 18, 2025. “Violence is when people cannot afford a house, violence is when a voter cannot afford medicine, violence is when mothers continue to lose sons and daughters to greed and guns. Violence is when the rich get tax breaks and the poor get evicted,” she told about 600 people at the demonstration. (Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)
“No king, no crowns, no thrones, only love, because violence is not just bullets and bombs,” said Rev. Valtoria Jackson, Montgomery lead organizer for the Alabama Poor People’s Campaign, said in a speech. “Violence is when people cannot afford a house, violence is when a voter cannot afford medicine, violence is when mothers continue to lose sons and daughters to greed and guns. Violence is when the rich get tax breaks and the poor get evicted.”
Jackson has spoken at numerous gatherings before to raise awareness of the budget bill recently passed by Congress and the potential expiration of expanded tax credits for Affordable Care Act plans that could drive up insurance costs around the nation. The loss of those credits has been a major reason for the ongoing federal government shutdown. The budget bill also reduced funding for Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program that provides food subsidies to lower-income families and individuals. The bill passes more of the cost of maintaining the programs to the states, and advocates had been warning that the bill could reduce the state’s economy by more than $1 billion and eliminate health insurance coverage for almost 200,000 people.
“Our food pantry participation has gone up 200% since he passed this bill,” said Rev. Manuel Williams in an interview following the event, pastor at Resurrection Catholic Church in Montgomery. “These are people who never had to come and get food assistance, but now they are food insecure.”

Others voiced strong opposition to the administration’s efforts to deport large numbers of immigrants living in the U.S.
“One of my biggest things is the ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) raids, the deportation of people who are just trying to live,” said Haley Morgan, who attended the protest. “They are getting deported for a taillight being out, or for speeding. If that is the case, deport me because I have sped and my taillight has been out.”
Many of those who gathered also expressed reservations about Trump’s efforts to reshape the federal government.
“I wanted to help protest against all that Trump is doing,” said Judy May, 87, who attended the rally. “He is destroying the constitution. He is trying to take away our right to vote, our rights of free speech. He is firing so many people, taking so many important departments to pieces. He is destroying the Department of Education, he has destroyed the public health department, I just hate everything he is doing.”

Oxford: ‘We are American people who love our country’

Over 200 people gathered along the roads of the Oxford Exchange to protest the Trump administration Saturday under the “No Kings” name.
Protesters of all ages stood along the highway holding signs condemning President Trump for being what they describe as a dictator, demanding the release of the Epstein files and condemning Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
“I’m here today to express my displeasure with the current administration. There are many things being done wrong. I couldn’t even name them, it wouldn’t fit on a sign,” Jim Baker, organizer of the demonstration, said. “I hope somebody hears our cries and our anger and does something about it.”
One protestor said she came to stop the government from continuing the way it is now.
“Things are really scary right now, and if somebody doesn’t say something, and if we don’t keep pushing back, then everything is just going to keep moving in the direction it’s moving. And even if it’s stopping things an inch then it’s worth it,” protestor Cami McKenzie said.
Others just want the government to hear them and their opinions.

“Our government isn’t listening to us. The government is meant to serve us, not control us. So I think it’s important that we stand up before we lose our rights,” protestor Pam Howard said.
Baker said he felt like he was alone when it came to standing up for issues such as healthcare, LGBTQ+ rights and ICE raids.
“It makes me extremely happy that there are this many people in the state of Alabama with the same mindset that I have,” Baker said. “I’ve lived here for 21 years, and for 21 years I thought I was on an island.”
And some of these issues are personal to the ones protesting.
“I have four biologically born female daughters, and two are gender non-conforming, so I’m really bothered by a lot of the talk about trans individuals and stuff,” said Glenda Reeseg.
Alanna Gregg, another protestor, said these issues affect everyone.
“You should be ashamed of yourself if you don’t care,” she said “It shouldn’t have to happen to you for it to matter to you.”
And Baker made it clear that protestors are just regular people who want better for everyone in the country.
“We are not Antifa, we are not insurrectionists. We are American people who love our country and don’t like the direction that it’s going and that’s why we’re here today.
While the overall response from non-protesters was mostly positive with many honking their horns in support of the cause, there were a few that began to heckle the demonstrators.
Halfway through the protest, a small group of Trump supporters stood across the street to heckle the “No Kings” demonstrators. A heated verbal exchange ensued but was quickly settled.
But protesters didn’t let the rude comments from the group dampen their spirits.
“They have every right to be there and we’re fighting for their rights too,” Howard said.
Howard also commended younger people for being at the protest, and not to let anyone deter them from using their voice.
“One thing I want to say to young people is don’t let anybody tell you that your vote doesn’t count. Voter turnout is one of the biggest issues we have in Alabama,” she said. “If you want to see things change, that’s how we change it.”

Selma: ‘We can see each other’

Laurie Kelly and her husband, who live in Chicago, were traveling to the Gulf of Mexico for a beach vacation. Kelly said she asked her husband to find somewhere to stop to protest.
“If we don’t show up, it’s over. This is very important. It’s small, but it’s still here and that does matter,” Kelly said in an interview. “People need to stand up. That’s what I’m trying to do. It’s all I can do.”
The couple joined about 40 people gathered at the foot of the Edmund Pettus Bridge Saturday afternoon for a local No Kings protest.
The Selma protest was the second for some. Jasie Shepard and Dr. Justin Cavanaugh traveled to Selma after the Tuscaloosa No Kings protest ended Saturday morning, about a 90-minute drive.
Nate Bradley and his friends came to Selma after the Montgomery protest ended this morning. He said he is protesting because of President Donald Trump’s disregard of Congress’ power of the purse.

“Now we have a president who says, ‘I’m not going to fund Democrat programs.’ What does that mean?” Bradley said. “He wouldn’t be able to articulate a thought about that. It’s insulting.”
Bradley said the protests in Montgomery and Selma gave him hope.
“I call my representatives, I go to my townhalls,” Bradley said of what he does outside of the No Kings protests. “I just try to stay sane and find a balance between staying sane and keeping up to date with the nonstop deluge of things that this administration is doing or not doing.”
Annie Pearl Avery, a long-time civil rights activist, urged people to protest every day.
“It’s not going to be a lot of show and a lot of talk. There’s going to have to be some action,” Avery said. “You’ve got a purpose. Everyone has a purpose.”
Rev. Leodis Strong, lead pastor at Brown Chapel in Selma, criticized Republicans who claim to be Christian, but do not show it in policies.
“How can you call yourself pro-life when you did not give access to insurance to soon-to-be mothers and soon-to-be children outside the womb? How can you call yourself pro-life when you take away WIC and SNAP?” Strong asked. “That is a polluted religion.”
Jennifer Wright, who recently moved to Selma from Huntsville, criticized Congress for not releasing investigative files related to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. She urged people to write letters and call their representatives. She also wrote a thank you letter to U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Kentucky, for his petition to release the files.

“Every member of Congress should have happily signed your petition because child sex trafficking should not be considered a partisan issue and should be considered a crime by everyone,” Massie read.
The petition was one vote short of the 218 it needed to pass in September.
Azali Fortier, 18, said the protest gave her a glimpse of hope.
“I know that they can see us because we can see each other,” Fortier said of the Trump administration and Congress. “We’re about to undergo a big change, either for better or for worse.”
The protest wrapped up with Yomi Goodall leading the group singing “America the Beautiful” and “We Shall Overcome,” a Civil Rights Movement anthem.

Dozens of No Kings protests took place across Ohio as part of more than 2,500 nationally. Organizers reported Saturday afternoon that nearly 7 million Americans attended the protests across the country.
“Today, millions of people showed that we, the people, will not be silenced,” said Deirdre Schifeling, chief political and advocacy officer for the American Civil Liberties Union.
The events were sponsored by more than 100 organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union, the League of Women Voters, Physicians for Social Responsibility, Common Cause, and Indivisible.
In Central Ohio, rallies will took place in communities such as Newark, Reynoldsburg, Marysville, and Grove City earlier Saturday afternoon.

(Photo by David Hansen/Rhode Island Current)The parking lot next to the Rhode Island State House is normally filled with lawmakers’ cars, but it was empty Saturday afternoon. 
What was full instead was the south side of the State House, where the lawn and marble steps — often places absent of pageantry, except for the occasional photo shoot during prom season — entertained a crowd of more than 30,000 people, according to the organizers of the No Kings protest.
No Kings day brings millions into US streets in anti-Trump protests

The Providence protest is one of just under a dozen such rallies that took place in Rhode Island Saturday meant to protest President Donald Trump’s administration and its policies. 
“Even if some of these signs are not very Christian, all I see is love,” activist and event emcee Alisha Pina said as she looked out toward the crowd from the State House steps. “Sometimes you gotta tell it like it is.” 
Since the last round of No Kings protests on June 14, the number of local demonstrations has increased, and a new idiom has joined the visual grammar of anti-Trumpism: The inflatable animal suit. The trend originated earlier this month in Portland, Oregon, where a viral video of a man in a frog suit getting pepper sprayed by ICE agents only served to inflame, rather than cauterize, the goofy, fan-powered suits as a symbol of farcical resistance. 
There was a menagerie among the crowd in Providence on Saturday. One could find a bumblebee, a lobster, a monkey, two tyrannosauruses (one green, one blue), a shark, an eagle, a pink unicorn, a polar bear, a brown bear, a white unicorn, and two Rhode Island reds holding up a sign that read “RESIST.” A cow and chicken danced to Beyonce’s 2016 song “Freedom” as it played from a loudspeaker. Across the street, a group of friends assisted Snoopy in getting inflated. Even Squidward, SpongeBob’s irascible neighbor, found it in him to attend.

Beyond the diversity of species represented was a variety of people from all ages and backgrounds on the lawn Saturday. Three teenagers perched at the feet of Nathanael Greene, that most trusted general in George Washington’s army who, in statue form, continues to look over the capital from the base of the State House steps. The Democratic Socialists of America had set up an information booth underneath a tree’s shade. A woman who declined to be interviewed sported an outfit with Beanie Baby cats attached, and a sign that read “Cat ladies against Trump.”
Abigail Pimental, originally from Bristol, wore a “Beetlejuice”-inspired costume and held up a sign that said, “Say it three times: Epstein Files, Epstein Files, Epstein Files.”
“I just think that it’s important we hold all people accountable, no matter what side of the aisle they’re on,” Pimental said, and added about the protests in general, “It’s so meaningful that this is happening in New England, the birthplace of our whole democratic freedom.”
There were also a handful of State Police scattered across the lawn and steps, mostly young men who did not show any visible signs of discomfort despite being dressed in weighty, dark-colored uniforms and standing directly in the sun. The 60-degree heat made the day unseasonably warm for mid-October.

A portion of this crowd formed into a caravan that marched past the mall and into downtown Providence starting a little after 1 p.m. With State Police directing the stalled traffic as the marchers began to move, motorists sounded horns — mostly those waving signs from their vehicle windows as they headed for the demonstration themselves. They began to return around 2 p.m., after which the protest’s speaking portion began.
“Thank you for standing with our immigrant community,” Rep. David Morales, a Providence Democrat and contender for the capital city’s mayorship, said in his remarks to the crowd. “Thank you for standing with our immigrant neighbors. Together we’re going to demonstrate that Rhode Island is a home for everyone, especially our immigrant brothers, sisters, and non-binary friends.”
Morales was not the only state legislator or local elected official who could be seen in attendance. Rep. Teresa Tanzi, a South Kingstown Democrat, took a moment to chat after weaving her way through the crowd.  
“It’s so heartwarming to know that there are enough people around to care enough about their democracy, about our democracy, to come out and participate,” Tanzi said.
She was handing out stickers and American flags to protestors, and said it was “because we’ve got to take the flag back.”
“The symbolism is for all Americans, and not just for some,” Tanzi said.

“We can no longer view fellow Americans as the enemy,” said 19-year-old college student Django Grace at a rally in Brattleboro. “We need common ground.”

On Saturday morning, a small group of protestors mounted bikes in Barre for “The Rolling Resistance” — a march on wheels to join the main body of “No Kings” demonstrators at the Montpelier Statehouse. 
Barb Schwendtner of Barre Town, the event’s organizer, said her goal was to “combine (her) love of bikes with (her) love of democracy.”
The cyclists rolled into a second round of “No Kings” protests on Saturday, organized in part by the movement 50501, in opposition to the Trump administration’s targeting of immigrants, LGBTQ+ rights, public education, the government shutdown and more, according to the organization’s website. Thousands of Vermonters showed up to more than 40 such events that took place across the state on Saturday, in addition to at least one event organized by Republicans in Chester.
50501, a national movement that opposes “executive overreach” in the federal government, helped organize No Kings rallies nationwide. Indivisible, a national organization with Vermont chapters, was also involved in organizing events across the state.
The event was a reoccurrence of similarly-framed demonstrations against authoritarianism in June, which saw about 42,000 Vermonters take to the streets in protest of the Trump administration’s actions. Millions more attended across the nation.
As the crowd in Barre readied itself for departure, bicycles arrived with a wide, colorful variety of signage draped, taped and attached to their frames. Bruce Seel, a Barre City resident, arrived in an Elvis costume. (“A lot of people call him a king, right?” he said.) 
Seel said he was attending Saturday’s protests in response to “Trump, this administration, and his authoritarian regime.” In Montpelier, he joined one large chapter of a nationwide day of “No Kings” protests. 
At noon, stretching down the Statehouse steps and across the lawn, a crowd of Vermonters gathered with signs, drums and costumes demonstrating displeasure with President Donald Trump’s administration.
Geri Peterson, an event organizer and leader of 50501 Vermont, estimated the crowd on Saturday could have been in excess of 10,000 people.
She said the event was about “defending our democracy” in general, but that at this particular rally, “we were choosing to center trans rights, which in particular have come under attack.”

Several speakers Saturday afternoon addressed the issue of trans rights, as well as health care  and the broader role of government, among other issues. U.S. Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt. and U.S. Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt. were among the event’s speakers.
“This is about to be the largest political gathering in America’s history,” said Balint in her remarks. “You’re out here because you wanna change the direction of the country.” It was not clear by Saturday afternoon whether the nationwide event had broken records.
Welch’s speech focused in part on the federal government’s shutdown.
“We do not want folks who are working hard to lose health care for themselves and their families,” he said. “We need less Trump and more Vermont values in Washington.”
Protest songs, including Ana Hernández’s “Set It Right Again,” punctuated Saturday’s event.

Howard Russell, 71, said he came to Montpelier from Hinesburg for more reasons than even a large sign could contain. Trump, he said, is “out of control.”
“Congress isn’t doing their job,” he added, and pleaded for democratic leaders to “hold the line” on health care premiums during the government’s shutdown.
Dan Thorington, of Williamstown, held a sign bearing the words “Veterans against Trump.” Having served in the U.S. military himself, he said the president’s rhetoric around veterans, as well as a number of his administration’s policies, were deeply troubling.
“We’re at a crisis,” Thorington said. “This is all I can think of at the moment, is to protest.”
Larz Allen, of Jeffersonville, said he attended Saturday’s rally with the role of money and big business in politics at the forefront of his mind.
“Citizens United is the problem,” Allen said, referring to the 2010 U.S. Supreme Court decision that overturned previous regulations on the role of corporations in political campaign finance. “I believe that a common person should be able to run for office.”
Allen also expressed concern with the federal government’s recent plans to expand public surveillance for immigration enforcement, saying that the country was veering closer to a “police state.”
At the foot of the lawn, a tent bearing the words “Pancakes for the People” was dispensing freshly griddled pancakes for protestors. Poa Mutino, of Barre City, said the organization had begun giving out free pancakes in front of Montpelier’s city hall six years ago.
The project, Mutino said, is “about bringing people together who wouldn’t normally eat together.” The event’s focus on trans rights had been important for the organization’s involvement, he added.
In an interview after her remarks, Balint said that the climate of fear infusing politics in Washington and beyond is “why we have to be out here today.”
“It gives me incredible hope to see not just the sheer number of people, but the different age groups…and that people understand that all hope is not lost,” Balint said.
Burlington
Hundreds of residents across the Queen City showed up with placards, costumes and crowns in a show of solidarity and whimsy. Events in Burlington included a bike ride, a honk and wave and three separate marches to City Hall by 11:30 a.m. Protests also took place in neighboring South Burlington, Winooski and Williston.
Jasmine Lamb, an organizer with Queen City Indivisible, estimated about 10,000 people attended. She led them in songs and chants, while a brass band inserted beats and tunes at the foot of the City Hall steps in the park downtown.

Unlike the June events, there were no speeches planned “to recognize that all of us are leaders in this moment,” Lamb said. 
The crowd sang songs like “We Shall Overcome” and “This Land is Your Land.” They chanted “this is what democracy looks like” and “hey hey, ho ho, Donald Trump has got to go.”
Many residents held up signs protesting the Trump administration’s crackdown on marginalized communities, calling for the restoration of civil rights and to uphold civility and democracy.
Heidi Smith from South Burlington sported a unicorn headgear and a pink T-shirt with the words “Goodness Exists.”
“I’m here to stand up against Donald Trump  with others who feel the same way – and to do it with joy and love,” she said. “I’m trying to make a difference. It’s time to stand up and speak out.”
Jean Bluto from Winooski said she had to join the protest because she is upset about the cutbacks in federal funding affecting everything from food stamps to hospitals.
“If we were all silent we would still be flying the British flag,” she said, in a reference to colonialism.
University of Vermont student Quyn McCafferty, 22, said she saw first-hand the erosion of rights under the first Trump presidency — from the reversal of Roe v. Wade in 2022 to the policing of protests in cities across the country. All of it makes “an unsafe environment for everyone,” she said.
“We just think a lot of things that Donald Trump stands for are things people are in opposition of,” said her friend Josh Hunt, 22, a recent graduate of UVM, who is particularly upset about cuts to education and scientific research.
They two sat on a wall at the edge of the park as the people dispersed from the protest, which lasted about two hours. They held two small white placards marked with black and red lettering: “Make fascists afraid again” and “Trump is dumb & stupid.”
Attendee Chelsea Alsofrom grew up in the Queen City, but her family emigrated from Eastern Europe.

She said her ancestors echoed what the person in front of them in line at Ellis Island said. That’s how she wound up with the last name Alsofrom. 
“We’re all immigrants,” she said Saturday in City Hall Park. Her two children, also in attendance, wore Spiderman costumes. She held a handmade sign that read ‘Trump, Spiderman is coming for you!’
Susan Caloggero joined the South End march that made its way down Charlotte Street at 11:20 a.m. She walked with her friends holding a sign that read ‘Without due process, it’s kidnapping.’
She was marching “for America, to stand up for people’s basic rights, no matter what background, what race,” she said. 
“We have long been a country that welcomed everybody,” said Caloggero, who recently visited Ellis Island for the first time and felt sad about the attitude and crackdown on immigration by the Trump administration. 
In the North End, Scott Patrick donned a large brown inflatable squirrel costume and waved to people gathering at Roosevelt Park at 10:30 a.m., in a nod to the recent protests in Portland, Oregon where residents wore animal costumes to defy Trump’s description of the city as a “war zone.”
“I love people protesting this way,” he said, adding that he is fed up with the Trump administration vilifying protestors and calling them names when they are all “just regular people.”
A self-described introvert, Patrick said he hasn’t participated in a protest since the United States invaded Iraq in 2003. He hoped to counteract a national climate of negativity and discord with tolerance and understanding by showing up to the march in a squirrel suit.
Later, in City Hall Park, he approached a pair dressed as yellow bananas, asking if they could point him to some acorns.
Brattleboro
In Brattleboro, several thousand people gathered at the Common to hear speeches by state officeholders who included local Rep. Emilie Kornheiser, chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, and Vermont Treasurer Mike Pieciak, who encouraged his hometown to contribute to a new $1 million Vermont Immigration Legal Defense Fund to help asylum seekers and people facing deportation or detention.
“In this moment,” Pieciak said, “we need all of our elected leaders to stand up and clearly say what is right and what is wrong.”

The Brattleboro crowd saved its loudest applause for 19-year-old college student Django Grace, who called for everyone to unite regardless of political differences.
“So many of us have horrible disagreements with the ways that so many people think in this country and in this state and in this community,” Grace said. “We must end this internal war. We can no longer view fellow Americans as the enemy. We need common ground.”

During a speech delivered on the Idaho State Capitol steps, American Civil Liberties Union of Idaho board member Sam Linnet spoke out against what he said is a government that is using fear to divide the American people. 
Linnet called for transforming the political and economic systems of America and rejecting a system where he said billionaires buy elections and corporations write laws. Instead, Linnet called on the crowd to unite, hold the government accountable and support immigrants, women and trans people. 
“Everyone here proves democracy still has a pulse,” Linnet said. 
 Idahoans share why they participated in the No Kings rally in Boise

For Boisean Cyndee Pierce, Saturday’s No Kings rally was her first protest. She carried a homemade sign that read, “I’m not a paid protestor I hate facism for free.” 
No Kings day brings millions into US streets in anti-Trump protests

In an interview at the protest, Pierce said she chose to attend because she wanted to channel the anxiousness she is feeling about the government into something positive.
“I am extremely disappointed in our leaders,” Pierce said. “I am hoping against hope our leaders will try to represent all of us.”
Pierce said she was impressed by the large crowd, which covered the steps of the Idaho State Capitol, filled much of Jefferson Street  between Sixth and Eighth streets and took over much of nearby Cecil D. Andrus Park.
“In very red Idaho, having a crowd of any more than two people is encouraging,” Pierce said with a smile as she gestured toward the large crowd. 
Millie Watkins of Boise said Saturday’s No Kings protest at the Idaho State Capitol marked her fifth such recent protest. She said Saturday’s crowd was the largest she has ever seen. 
Watkins carried a handmade sign calling on the U.S. Congress to do its job.  
“I think (the size of the crowd) says that there are a lot of people in this country who disagree with what is going on,” Watkins said.

Saturday’s Boise No Kings protest coincided with hundreds of other No Kings protests held in cities across the country, States Newsroom reported.  
The Boise No Kings protest was organized by several groups including Idaho 50501, Indivisible and the American Civil Liberties Union of Idaho. Idaho 50501 is part of the wider 50501 movement, which originally got its name from 50 states, 50 protests, one movement. 
Saturday’s No Kings protests was the second large-scale No Kings protest in recent months in Boise. In June, thousands of people protested in front of the Idaho State Capitol during an earlier No Kings protest. 
“Our Founding Fathers rejected the idea of a monarchy for a reason,” Idaho 50501 spokesperson Sonya Christensen said in a written statement before the protest. “We say ‘No Kings’ because we believe in America’s founding principles. We are appalled at how our current Idaho representatives are abandoning those principles, and we are here to stand up for the Constitution of the United States of America.”

Demonstrators gathered Tuesday on what would have been Charlie Kirk’s birthday
Saturday’s No Kings protest wasn’t the only rally at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise this week.
On Tuesday, another group of demonstrators gathered at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise to honor conservative activist and Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk on what would have been his 32nd birthday.
Organizers of the event, dubbed the God’s Country March, said the gathering would be the inaugural march and that they hope to hold an event in Kirk’s honor each year. 
Kirk was shot and killed while speaking Sept. 10 at an outdoor event at Utah Valley University in Orem.
“We are here for multiple reasons, God glorifying reasons, to be united as a singular people under one confession of Christ and Him crucified,” said Pastor Mike Lewis. “But also to remember the life of Charlie Kirk whose birthday it would be. We must remember where we are and remember who we are.”
Just hours before the Tuesday gathering, U.S. President Donald Trump posthumously awarded Kirk the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest honor for a civilian, at a ceremony at the White House.
Organizers and supporters of the march included the Old State Saloon, Idaho Liberty Dogs, Soldiers of the Cross, Turning Point USA and the Idaho Freedom Foundation.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Organizers and politicians urged the crowd of more than 1,000, gathered Saturday at the Iowa State Capitol as part of the national No Kings protest, to stay engaged and help flip Iowa seats in the 2026 election.
The Des Moines event was one of more than 2,600 nonviolent demonstrations planned nationwide, with millions of participants protesting Trump administration actions on issues from cutting funding for public health programs, deploying National Guard troops to cities and mass deportations. It was the second No Kings national protest – the first was held in June in response to Donald Trump’s birthday military parade.
At the event, state lawmakers, union organizers, immigrant advocates and teachers decried Trump’s and Republicans’ policies. Speakers also emphasized Iowa will play a vital role in putting a check on Trump’s power in the 2026 election, and encouraged Iowans to vote and stay politically engaged.

Mike Draper, founder and owner of Raygun, a liberal-leaning shirt and souvenir business headquartered in Des Moines, told the crowd he invited U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn to a town hall Friday, but held up an empty chair with the sign with the sign “Representative Nunn” to show the Iowa 3rd District representative’s response. He criticized Nunn for not holding public town halls and said the Republican “doesn’t work for us,” but for Trump’s agenda.
He told the crowd that if Democrats win three seats in the U.S. House, there will be an effective “check on Trump’s power.”
“And as fate would have it, there are three competitive races in Iowa right now,” Draper said. “If we flip those three seats — all of which have been Democratic at some point in the last decade — Iowa alone will win the House of Representatives.”
In addition to the 3rd District, which is expected to be competitive, the congressional races for Iowa’s 1st and 2nd Districts are also expected to be more competitive than in previous election cycles. All four of Iowa’s congressional seats are currently held by Republicans.
While larger political topics like the federal government shutdown and release of files related to Jeffrey Epstein came up, some speakers said Trump’s trade policies have hurt Iowa in a unique way. Aaron Lehman, president of the Iowa Farmers Union and a farmer from Polk County, said Trump’s tariffs and recent federal trade policies have hurt Iowa farmers, pointing to China’s move to buy soybeans from South American producers instead of American farmers.

“I’m telling you, thousands and thousands of Iowa farmers are on the brink of a crisis,” he said. “Chaotic tariffs have devastated the markets for what we grow, and they have raised the cost of our inputs, and they have gotten us no closer to fair trade for farmers and workers.”
Elena Casillas-Hoffman, a communications specialist with Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice, said Trump’s immigration policies are also negatively impacting Iowa. She said the only population growth Iowa has seen in recent years is because of immigrants and refugees, who are “revitalizing our communities.”
Members of these Iowa communities are now being detained by federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials, Casillas-Hoffman said. ICE has had a presence in Iowa for years, she said, but since Trump took office, immigration authorities’ tactics have changed, with more individuals being detained and arrested.
“We know that ICE is in six county jails.” Casillas-Hoffman said. “… We know that children are scared to go to school, to leave their homes. People are afraid to be a part of our community if they do not have their paperwork on them at all times. Our communities are beyond terrified, and we should not accept these conditions.”

Some speakers also hit on more local issues, like the campaign to form a nurses’ union at UnityPoint hospitals in Des Moines. One of the nurses involved in the organizing effort, Gail Grimes, spoke about the effort to form a union through Teamsters Local 90 – and how the scheduled unionization vote in early October was delayed indefinitely due to the federal shutdown.
“We will stay strong, and we will stay resolute that the nurses of Des Moines will respond with a resounding ‘yes’ when asked the most important of questions when the federal government reopens and a new election date set,” she said.
Grimes asked for protesters to support the unionization effort, linking it with the larger movement to support health care access and working Iowans.
“The only way the working class can win against the tyrannical shift happening in our beloved nation is through numbers and through our solidarity,” Grimes said.
Protesters came to the event dressed in costumes parodying Trump and other historical figures, carrying American and Palestinian flags, and holding up signs calling for political action.
Toby Kalage, a 19-year-old, carried a sign stating, “I am not the enemy, they are.” Kalage said that as a queer person of color, who recently exited the foster care system, they have been targeted by GOP policies.

Kalage said the protest made them feeling hopeful for Democrats chances in Iowa and nationwide in 2026 and future years.
“I came down because I wanted to be another person who was here, and having that effort made,” Kalage said. “And that adds up, for everyone who showed up here … It’s the same for voting.”
Georgia Rains Traviss, an Urbandale resident, said she was happy to have celebrated her 66th birthday at the No Kings event. She said it was important to have spaces where people can voice their disagreements and opinions without attacking others or engaging in violence.
Rains Traviss also said the event went smoothly as there were not altercations with police, military members or ICE agents, who have been present at some earlier protests in cities like Los Angeles and Chicago.
“I had some friends that were like, ‘Oh, aren’t you worried about (your safety) going down there? Aren’t you scared?'” she said. “But that’s what they want. They’ve been building up fear, they don’t want us to feel like we can come out here. I said, ‘You know, if you’re afraid, that’s what they want.’ … The worst thing you could ever do, is not go, because that’s what they want.”

Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-CT, told a crowd in Hartford that he would continue to “stand up for health care” and that Democrats would not “back down” and be “intimidated” or “bullied” by Republicans. 
U.S. Rep. John Larson, D-1st District, condemned the actions of Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Connecticut towns. 
“We do not consent to pulling mothers from their children in Newington and in Southington. We stood up and fight against them, because we’re Americans. Because this is the nation that we love,” Larson told the crowd in Hartford.

Immigration detentions and deportations have spiked since Trump took office in January. The administration has paused funding for refugee resettlement programs, and Trump has also expanded the number of immigrant detention centers across the U.S. 
The number of immigrants in the U.S. declined by 1.2 million between January and September of this year. In Connecticut, where ICE arrests have more than doubled from January through July of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, there have been reports of immigrants being detained at courthouses and car washes.
The “No Kings” protests, organized by a coalition of primarily liberal groups including the 50501 Movement, Indivisible and the ACLU, were set to take place in about 40 towns across Connecticut. These demonstrations follow similar “No Kings” protests in June, which drew thousands of protestors in response to a military parade organized in Washington D.C. 
According to the No Kings website, the protests are motivated by the increased actions from Immigrations and Customs Enforcement to detain and deport immigrants with irregular status, cuts to healthcare and education spending, the rolling back of environmental regulations and voting redistricting in states like Texas that are meant to favor Republican lawmakers and candidates.  
“The president thinks his rule is absolute. But in America, we don’t have kings and we won’t back down against chaos, corruption, and cruelty,” the website reads.  
In New Haven, protestors filled the New Haven Green, carrying signs, wearing costumes and waving American flags.
Gayathri Vijayakumar, 46, said she works for a sustainability company, and says climate change is the biggest issue that drew her to protest.
“For me, it’s all about the sustainability of our environment. He set us so far back by slashing the budget that Biden had put in place,” she said. “It was going to be phenomenal, phenomenal for the efficiency of buildings. We’re so far behind as it is, this is undoing decades of progress.”
But it’s not her only concern.
“I ride the train with my passport now,” she said.
On the outskirts of the green, a group of women with umbrellas painted with words like “No Kings” and “Persist, Resist, Insist” stood in a line. Tina Santoni, 67, said she started workshops for women, teaching them to paint the umbrellas. They’ve grown to about 40 people in total.
“ I had one at the last No Kings March. But after that I started getting, making, creating workshops for people to come and make them. We’re all women,” she said, adding that a few weeks ago, she’d led a group of the women on a walk in downtown New Haven.
“We walk in silence. We let our umbrellas speak for us. We try to put messages on our umbrellas that we really feel strongly about,” she said.
26-year-old Maisy Crews said that as a healthcare provider, she was concerned about the inability to provide healthcare for her patients, particularly as someone who works in addiction medicine.
Several people also talked about the division within the country,
“ Most people are using really controversial issues as a place to divide us, like trans issues and abortion and things like that,” said Victoria Atkin-Dahm, a Guilford resident and student at Southern Connecticut State University. “Their main goal is to divide us so that they can control us, in my opinion. And I think this is the time that we all need to gather and be together like this.
31-year-old Sam Meskill said his biggest concern was ICE detaining immigrants.
“Watching the videos on that is really disturbing,” he said.
77-year-old Carmen Mahone of Branford said she disliked the anger and hatred that she saw, and the way that Trump treated those around him, referring to him as a “lunatic.” She also talked about the need for affordable health care.
“I’m retired and I got a pension plus Medicare. So I’m gifted, but the people that don’t — it’s unconscionable to see people just lose their lives because they can’t get a certain drug anymore,” she said.
75-year-old Susan White of Southbury said she was concerned about benefits for retired people.
“We worked our whole lives so that we’d be safe at this point through Medicare and social security. And if he screws with that, there’s going to be a revolt of old people. And really, what do we have to lose at this point for standing up? Nothing.
State lawmakers Martin Looney and Gary Winfield, both New Haven Democrats, told the crowd that the state legislature needed to step up in light of the federal government’s actions. Looney said he wanted the state legislature to do more to address federal actions.
He said he wanted to see a law passed that would prohibit ICE agents in Connecticut from wearing masks and require them to have body cameras. He said the General assembly planned to return to the Capitol in November to try and use state dollars to fill in places that the federal government had made cuts.
“I’m committed that we will maximize that to the extent we can,” said Looney.

Similar scenes played out across Connecticut. 
In Westport, crowds gathered around Jesup Green and the Westport Library.
“We’re here for humanity, for our decency, and for Mother Earth,” said Maureen Maloney of Fairfield. “We’ve got to take care of her.”
“My passion started back during the Vietnam protests, and I’ve just kept going,” said Donna Kraisman. “It comes from loving our country. That’s where my passion comes from.”
Maloney, an immigrant from Ireland, said her motivation comes from seeing the country change over the years.
“I immigrated here 32 years ago,” she said. “I chose to come to America because of opportunity. I’ve worked hard all my life, but those chances are disappearing. That’s why I’m here.”

“I’m here because I believe in the principle. This is democracy,” said Bernard Perry, a 95-year-old Westport resident. “That’s what I was brought into when I was born.”
He said the health of democracy depends on those in power.
“It’s all about leadership and how that leadership views the Constitution,” Perry said. “Right now, the leadership has really thrown out the Constitution. That’s why we’re in this mess.”
David Brigg Jr. of Bridgeport said he has deep concerns about the state of the country and is particularly critical of the Supreme Court.
“With the Supreme Court backing Trump and giving him full immunity, he could do anything he wants,” he said.
But Brigg said he still encourages civic engagement, emphasizing the importance of voting and political participation.

Michael Greenberg, a 78-year-old Westport resident who said he once met Martin Luther King Jr., emphasized the importance of speaking up against threats to democracy. 
But, he said, the younger generations can drive meaningful change and continue the fight for justice.
“It’s the young ones,” he said. “They’re holding the torch, and they’re the future, and that’s what we’re fighting for.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025_1018_SR_NoKings_066-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-18 17:02:53.464059

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Floridians massed throughout the state Saturday for the second national No Kings day demonstrations against the increasingly authoritarian second Trump administration, marked as it is by aggressive immigration enforcement and prosecutions of the president’s enemies.
Events has been planned in nearly 100 Florida cities and towns, according to organizers.
In Miami, an estimated 5,000 people clad in American flags, golden crowns, and frog and Sasquatch costumes flooded Bayfront Park to chant against Trump.
The event, which saw thousands of global demonstrations, drew Miamians of every age. It was held in front of the Torch of Friendship, a 1960 monument built as a beacon to welcome immigrants.
One disruption hit the Miami gathering when Barry Ramey and another member of the white nationalist group the Proud Boys briefly showed up to counter-protest. Ramey was one of the men sentenced for rioting at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. City police quickly formed an escort to safely lead them out, as angry anti-Trump protesters screamed Spanish expletives at them. 
In Tallahassee, a lively crowd packed the lawn in front of the Old Capitol and both sides of Monroe Street, waving signs at passing cars; many of their drivers honked their horns in solidarity. 
A crowd estimated to be several thousand strong gathered along the four street corners in the Tyrone Square area of St. Petersburg. A Pinellas County teacher who wanted to be identified only by her first name of Marissa wore a cape of the American flag.
“I’m pretty worried that we’re losing our democracy, and I think we’re losing our way as Americans,” she said. 










I know the Republicans have talked about how we hate America. No, I love my country, and I hate what you are doing to it, Donald Trump.


“I feel like the actions that the Trump administration is taking doesn’t represent our country or what our founders had as a vision for our country. And so I’m here today because of that. I love my country. I’m wearing a flag today because I want us to take back flags. I know the Republicans have talked about how we hate America. No, I love my country, and I hate what you are doing to it, Donald Trump.”
Approximately 2,000 gathered in Gainesville on the same day as University of Florida’s homecoming football game. They listened to poems, songs, and calls to action. A Phoenix reporter noticed no counter-protesters or any police.
In Sopchoppy, a small Wakulla County town 35 miles south of Tallahassee, a rally attracted around 30 people.The county is solidly Republican, with Trump winning nearly 72% of the vote in 2024. Gov. Ron DeSantis took 73% of the vote during his 2022 re-election bid.
Despite a small crowd, there was a heavy county sheriff’s presence — at least seven deputies to oversee the demonstrators and no more than 10 counterprotestors.
The protests took place as the federal government shutdown is now in its third week. The dispute revolves around Democrats pushing Republicans to reinstate the enhanced premium tax subsidies for those on the Affordable Care Act scheduled to expire at the end of this year. 
“When Marjorie Taylor Greene starts becoming progressive, we know the GOP has screwed up,” said St. Petersburg resident Gregory Mann, referring to the Georgia Republican’s comments last week that she would go “against everyone on this issue” because the premium hikes would harm “my own adult children” and her constituents in northwest Georgia.

Hitler, Castro
Back in Miami, complaints ranged from mild criticisms of Trump to outright comparisons to Adolf Hitler and Fidel Castro, the long-reigning Cuban dictator whose revolution forced an exodus of millions of Cubans over decades to leave the island nation.
Many ended up in Miami. One is Jorge Cardelle, a 67-year-old Cuban-born U.S. veteran who served four years in the Navy and 16 in the Army.
“I’m here to protest how our government is being run. The abuses, the corruption — I was born in Cuba, and my parents left because of the corruption. What happened there is what’s happening here,” said Cardelle, wrapped in an American flag in front of a towering Ponce De Leon statue.
Other protesters who spoke to the Phoenix included a University of Miami law professor dressed as a frog, a grocer adorned in that Sasquatch costume, a 25-year-old artist, two retired nurses, the president of the University of Miami’s UDems, and a mayoral candidate running as a socialist. 
Their beliefs ran along the same lines. 
“He’s breaking my heart,” said Caroline Mala Corbin, the 57-year-old constitutional law professor at the nearby University of Miami.

“This is Hitler!” said Karen, a 72-year-old retired nurse. A Cuban-born Gen Z artist named Gamal echoed this in a portrait he hastily made the night before. Titled “Ice King,” it depicts a frozen Trump wearing a golden crown, with the Nazi SS symbol to his left.
“I wanted to make sure that the ice kind of resembles the SS symbol from the Nazis because we think he has kind of the same movement, going with the way that it’s going too far to the right,” the 25-year-old said. 
Music played throughout from a booming speaker at the feet of the ever-burning Torch of Friendship, where many danced, sang, chanted, and even played guitar.

‘It feels like you’re not alone’
One attendee in St. Pete was Pinellas Park resident Rachel Parker, a U.S. Army Veteran who says she’s working without pay as a veterans services representative at the VA because of the shutdown. She was dismissive of Republican contentions that protesters are anti-American.
“All of these Republican leaders like [Senate Majority Leader] John Thune coming out and saying ‘This is a protest of hate,’” she said. “It’s not a protest of hate. We are just utilizing our First Amendment rights to talk about the things that we have no control over. If Congress wants to abdicate all of its responsibilities right now, then we’re going to have to do it for them.”
A Pinellas County teacher who wanted to be identified only by her first name, Marissa, wore a cape of the American flag.
“I’m pretty worried that we’re losing our democracy, and I think we’re losing our way as Americans,” she said. “I feel like the actions that the Trump administration is taking doesn’t represent our country or what our founders had as a vision for our country. And so I’m here today because of that. I love my country. I’m wearing a flag today because I want us to take back flags. I know the Republicans have talked about how we hate America. No, I love my country, and I hate what you are doing to it, Donald Trump.”
Kay, a Jacksonville teacher who didn’t want to disclose her last name, was delighted to be among so many fellow Floridians speaking out against the Trump agenda.
“It feels like you’re not alone,” she said. “Because in the neighborhood that I live in, I feel like I’m a minority. And I feel like I can’t be openly against Trump and the administration. But being here makes me feel a lot more comfortable. And I feel like I have a community where there is still hope.”

‘Very excited, peaceful crowd’
In Gainesville, William Marquardt, a retired archaeologist, said he was reusing his sign from the first No Kings day protests. “I hope it will be obsolete one day.” But, he added, “probably not in my lifetime.”
“This turnout is going to be bigger today across the country. Not just Washington or Chicago, but every place, small towns. I think people are finally realizing, if you don’t stand up and say something, you’ve lost your chance,” Marquardt told the Phoenix. 
Signs at the event at Gainesville’s Cora Roberson Park pointed out Trump’s association with Jeffrey Epstein, condemned fascism, advocated for protecting democracy, and of course, displeasure with Trump and his administration.
Various organizations used the event to provide outreach, such as the Alachua Democrats, the Sierra Club, Badass Feminists of Gainesville, and Gainesville Women for Democracy.
No Kings in north Florida
In Tallahassee, compared to the last No Kings rally in June, this one was “twice the size, said Ellen Davis, attending with a friend who identified herself as Sharon Z. (Police estimated the earlier turnout at 2,000 people – organizers claimed 5,000.)

They sat in lawn chairs with an American flag, flying upside down to signal distress, upon which was written, “The Power of the People is > Than the People in Power.”
Susan Amore, wearing a vest identifying herself as an ACLU legal monitor, described the vibe as “a very excited, peaceful crowd.”
“Make Orwell and Atwell fiction again,” one sign read. Overheard in passing: “My dog’s an idiot. She’s also smarter than Trump.”
No obvious police presence was apparent.
On the other hand, No Kings Sopchoppy event organizer Robert Seidler had reached out to the sheriff’s office after some inflammatory comments were posted about it on a Facebook page. But there were no altercations throughout the three-hour event, which featured protest songs on the banjo, including “This Land is Your Land.” 
 Lt. Will Hudson of the Wakulla County Sheriff’s Office confirmed Seidler’s comments. “And we actually took a proactive approach to it, as well. And just anything that’s going to happen in Wakulla, the sheriff’s office is going to make sure that the safety and security of the people at the event, that it’s taken care of.”
Sue Wallrich told the Florida Phoenix, “I know my neighbors. I’ve lived here for a long time. We all agree behind closed doors. But then, the second, you know, you gotta flash something on Facebook and our algorithms blow up. I think it’s really screwing us all over; like, we are more alike than we think.”
Counter-protester “Wolf” wasn’t aware of the flare-up on social media; he said he heard about the gathering at church and decided to attend. He grabbed his Make America Great Again hat before he left the house, he acknowledged, to “attract some attention.”
“To me it’s dumb because we don’t have kings. They are misguided people. They probably mean well. Most of them mean well, but they are misguided. I came here to say a couple of prayers.”

Marchers chanted a variety of messages as they made their way across the Plaza, including: “No Kings/No ICE” and “This is what democracy looks like.” One man played the David Bowie/Queen song “Under Pressure” repeatedly from a small speaker.

Organizers for Indivisible Santa Fe, one of thousands of chapters formed nationally to oppose President Donald Trump during his first term, estimated that twice as many people showed up Saturday as did in June for the first No Kings protest. They said it shows momentum building against Trump and what they called his authoritarian administration. 
“They work for us, and they need to listen to us,” said Indivisible organizer David Bazell in a brief speech to hundreds gathered. “Our power is much stronger than anybody in this administration.”

The protest featured dozens of people in inflatable costumes—sharks, bees, unicorns, aliens and more—in solidarity to common protest attire Portland protesters have been wearing in demonstrations against the Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Trump has threatened to deploy the National Guard to tamp down on “antifa militants” there. 
“We’re wearing inflatable costumes because we want to support and enhance  what’s happening in Portland and I’m sure everywhere,” Breece Robertson told Source. “We want to just show that we are peaceful, we are loving and we really care about our democracies, so we’re not a threat. We are standing up for our rights in this country.”

In Santa Fe, many protesters embraced the “anti-fascist” label in signs and chants. “My dad was Antifa in WWII. I am Antifa now” one sign read. Sharon Argenbright, a nurse for 40 years, drew laughs when she introduced herself to the crowd with a curtsy and said, “Hi. This is Antifa, also known as Sharon.”
“I’m a nurse and I care about people,” she said. “We just need to keep doing this. The house of cards is coming down.”

Chris and Sallee Wiseman, also of Santa Fe, donned king and queen costumes. They said Trump’s assault on democracy in numerous forms, along with his seeming indifference to the struggles of working people, compelled them to join thousands of their neighbors Saturday in front of the Roundhouse. 
“I absolutely oppose 99.9% of his policies,” Chris told Source New Mexico, listing off Trump’s mass deportation push, the rising cost of food and health insurance, threats to health care for millions of Americans and Trump’s “re-vengeance” campaign against political enemies.

“We just can’t stand what’s happening,” Sallee added as she and her husband took shade under a tree in the Roundhouse courtyard. 
Former Santa Fe City Councilor Ron Trujillo, currently a candidate in the city’s upcoming mayoral election, said he was heartened to see the thousands of people who turned out for the protest.
“People need to come out, stand up for what they believe is right,” Trujillo told Source NM. “This federal government that’s that’s telling us what they they think is best for us, this isn’t the America we live in.  It’s about the democracy.”

As they have previously, members of Danza Tonantzin de Analco showed up to perform a ceremonial blessing for the event, and were accompanied by Kathy Wan Povi Sanchez (San Ildefonso Pueblo), one of the founders of Tewa Women United.

“It was very, very humbling and honoring for me to be here to acknowledge our ancestors and the connectivity between all the people that are here,” Sanchez told Source. “Because they’re coming from all four directions, like the blessing for the directions calling into energy and the spirit. And we are all energy beings of caring and within us our love, the multi-versal infinity of loving, caring, sharing. So it was important for me to convey my gratitude for each and everyone that is here, young and old and first-timers. Just knowing that we don’t have to carry the anger or the grief and that we can heal immediately from all those that have been put here to keep us oppressed. Breaking the silence, it is very, very empowering for all people here to continue to be blessed in that way.”
Zoey Craft from Youth United for Climate Crisis Action, spoke to the crowd from a stage at the Roundhouse, and urged attendees to take even more action.

“What we’re witnessing isn’t the system breaking or democracy dying,” Craft said. “It’s the illusion fading. It’s an empire built on stolen land and labor extraction and white supremacy revealing itself for what it’s always been. And if that’s what we’re up against, then it’s not enough to just be outraged. We have to be organized, because young people and frontline communities don’t need more allies in name. We need co-conspirators in action.”
In Albuquerque, more than 5,000 people took to the streets in a march that nearly encircled the city’s downtown core.
Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller and House Speaker Javier Martínez (D-Albuquerque) were among the attendees.
Keller said the city continues to oppose the Trump Administration, telling Source NM that Albuquerque is committed to being “a family-friendly city that fights for immigrant rights.”

“Most recently, we’re working with Chicago and Portland on the legal side to make sure that we’re doing everything we can to be ready and prepared should the [national guard] show up here,” he said. 
Martínez, holding a “No kings, no crowns, we don’t kneel down,” sign, told Source NM that the march “filled his heart,” and was energizing democracy. “The cruelty of the federal government, what they’re seeking to do is to strip us of our humanity, of our compassion, of our sense of ownership of this process and system,” he said.

A menagerie of inflatable costumes also speckled the Albuquerque protest, as people carried signs with slogans such as “Democracy Dies in Silence,” “Only you can prevent fascism” alongside Smokey Bear’s image and “No Trump, No ICE, No Troops.” 
“The best approach to undercutting tyranny is satire and mockery,”’ Paul Szauter, 70, bedecked as an inflatable chicken, told Source NM Saturday morning, after clucking like a chicken.

Szauter said he felt the need to march because he is a “first-generation American and birthright citizen,” and said he needed to protest the administration’s immigration policies, which he called “cruel.” 
Lily Jensen, 27, and her mother, Amberlyn Lopez, 46, said the event was their first-ever participation in a protest or march, saying that while they previously volunteered with their communities, or called elected officials, they felt compelled to do more. 
“It just felt like everything I was doing wasn’t enough,” Jensen, a health care educator, told Source NM. “I need other states to see that everyone here has the same message: We don’t accept a king.”
Lopez added that she’s concerned about a slide into autocracy, saying: “It’s important that we use our voice, while we still can.” 
James Bourguet, 22, was one of the younger participants in a crowd that skewed older. When asked for his reasons for protesting, Bourguet responded “there weren’t enough words.”
“It’s a Watergate everyday, and these are the people that actually want to do something about it,” he said, gesturing to the crowd.

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Exactly 250 years to the day after the British attacked what is now Portland, Maine, during the Revolutionary War, thousands gathered in the city and across the state to declare the same thing Americans had been fighting for then: no kings. 
This was the overarching rallying cry of the more than 30 demonstrations across the state and more than 2,600 across the country known as No Kings day in response to what a broad coalition of liberal advocacy organizations say is “the increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption of the Trump administration, which they have doubled down on since June.”   
Saturday marked the second nationwide protest organized under this name. The first, on June 14, coincided with President Donald Trump’s massive military parade on his 79th birthday. This time the demonstrations occurred against the backdrop of a federal government shutdown with no end in sight and as Trump threatens to deploy more federal troops on American cities. 
In Portland, participation nearly doubled, with 3,000 turning out in April and nearly 6,000 on Saturday. New attendees said they decided to show up because they feel the country has reached an untenable state, but speeches at the protests showed continued hope for change.   
Wearing a t-shirt that read “Facism is bad -history,” Katya Fromuth, a high school senior from Yarmouth, told the crowd gathered in Portland’s Deering Oaks Park that she started a youth organizing effort yesterday from her kitchen.
It’s called the Franklin Project, named after Ben Franklin’s reply when asked if the country was a republic or a monarchy: “A democracy — if you can keep it.”

What Mainers are saying 
Many participants said this type of demonstration was important to help them not feel alone in their fear and anger. 
“I think protesting is one very important part of that resistance because it’s visible,” said Madeline Jones of Portland, “and because so much of what Trump is doing to us feels so isolating.” 
Others said this form of political action is helpful — even to those who don’t attend. 
Erin Houghton of Cumberland, 48, and her daughter Penny Houghton, 15, attended the Portland protest together.
“I think we have a lot of privilege, which makes it even more important that we stand up and stand out publicly for other people who may not be able to,” Erin Houghton said, “and that includes people with disabilities, for whom there are major barriers to standing up at a protest, literally and figuratively, as well as people who could be taken [by immigration authorities].” 
Linda Davis, who was visiting Portland from Boston, said attending a protest is a relatively easy, low-lift effort, “but then it gives other people who are maybe more willing to do the scary things,” such as higher education institutions refusing to comply with executive overreach, “it gives them that that support to do that.” 
Many had concerns about the future of education.
Holding an American flag and wearing a shirt that read “protect banned books,” Dawnelle Sullivan, who traveled from Monmouth for Portland’s protest, works in special education and is concerned about the Trump administration’s attempt to gut the special education office. “I need to protect those kids,” she said.
Ann Weber of Portland, sporting a Columbia University hat and Harvard sweatshirt, said she’s concerned about the future of higher education. 
Her youngest son attends Harvard and her older son attends Columbia, both institutions Trump has battled. And her other son works as a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, awaiting federal funding for cancer research, which overall has seen cuts under the Trump administration. 
Her husband Bill Weber, who worked as an environmental engineer for 43 years, is part of a group trying to establish a climate action plan in Portland. He said, “I’m afraid municipal leaders will use Trump as an excuse to not do anything.”
An anti-ICE message
The Trump administration’s immigration policies were a focus for many at the first No Kings day in June and again on Saturday, as sweeping and aggressive immigration raids continue. 
Vanessa, who declined to share her last name, is a teacher at Portland High School. She was brought to tears when explaining how she and her colleagues have had to think about how to protect their students if U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents ever enter their school. In September, a parent was detained by ICE after dropping off their child at a Portland elementary school. 
As participants and speakers in Portland raised alarm about ICE raids, others gathered in Wells outside the town’s police station for a recurring protest of their local authorities’ agreement with federal immigration officials.

“I am hopeful that the many standouts in small towns and larger cities will show that there is strong resistance across Maine and across the country to the current policies of the current administration,” said Peg Duddy, who attended the protest in Wells and is a part of the core group that’s been calling for an end to the contract. “We are standing together to help save our democracy.” 
Wells Police Department remains the only agency in the state to enter an agreement under the 287(g) program, which permits local officers to arrest people on immigration violations, an authority otherwise reserved for federal agents. The department is continuing what Police Chief JoAnn Putnam has described as a “wait-and-see approach” to credentialing its officers under the program in light of the pending state legislation that would ban such agreements. 
In Bangor, where roughly 2,000 people gathered Saturday, state Rep. Amy Roeder called on Gov. Janet Mills to sign that legislation and urged all Mainers to not accept the Trump administration’s immigration policies as the status quo. 
“Don’t sleep while democracy dies,” Roeder said.
 Local and national candidates stand out

Speaking in Portland, Democratic U.S. Rep. Chelli Pingree of Maine condemned recent comments made by U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, who said No Kings day was a “hate America rally.”  
Pingree told the crowd they’re doing the most American of things: protesting the government. 
She encouraged continued protesting but said only Congress, by taking back the power of the purse, can stop the illegal actions of the president. 
“In November 2026,” Pingree said, “we need a brand new Congress.”
The demonstration in Portland featured speeches from numerous candidates for local and federal offices, including several Democratic candidates for U.S. Senate — David Costello, Jordan Wood, Tucker Favreau — who showed a united front in saying they’re running to stop Trump’s assault on democracy, though each pitching themselves as the best fit for the job.  
Gubernatorial candidates also took the stage, including Hannah Pingree, daughter of Chelli Pingree. She said, “Governors are really leading the way.”
Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, a candidate for governor, spoke about when she removed Trump from the ballot in 2023 after a citizen challenged his candidacy under the U.S. Constitution because of his involvement in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. 
“Doing the right thing even when it is hard is what we must do,” Bellows said, “and this is the secret of righteous resistance.” 
More recently, Bellows twice refused to share sensitive voter information with the Trump administration and was sued over it. 
“What I’ve learned unfortunately over the years is that lack of courage is contagious,” Bellows said. “Someone makes a decision based on fear, they get rewarded for it. Another person or institution catches the disease. But here’s another secret: courage is contagious.” 
The two statewide referendums were also highlighted in speeches, with proponents calling for attendees to vote yes on Question 2 (to create a red flag law) and opponents of Question 1 (which seeks to make changes to election procedures) urging people to vote no.

(Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A thick sea of Hoosiers flooded the Indiana Statehouse’s lawn for hours on Saturday — raising defiant fists and signs as they protested President Donald Trump’s administration.
It was one of about 40 No Kings demonstrations around the state, and one of 2,600 scheduled around the country that organizers said drew millions collectively. The Indianapolis crowd was several thousand and organizers in Fort Wayne said 8,000 attended.
Protesters are “not subjects” or “pawns,” but are citizens and voters, said Danielle Drake, advocacy manager for the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana.
“We gather not in despair, but in defiance,” she said. “… knowing that together, we can and will hold this unkempt power accountable! We will hold the line.”
Story continues below.































































































Several speakers denounced the Trump administration’s mass deportation campaign.
“We cannot let anti-immigrant rhetoric and policies tear apart the two fabric of our nation, because who are we? We are a nation of immigrants!” shouted the Rev. Felipe Martinez of Columbus Community United Church.
Others targeted Indiana Gov. Mike Braun — along with Republican supermajorities in the state’s House and Senate — who are considering redrawing congressional maps early.
“We might be called back into special session, and if they do (that), I hope that we translate our feelings, our energy, our emotions in action,” called Sen. Fady Qaddoura, D-Indianapolis.
He pushed the crowd to call their lawmakers.
“If they cheat and they succeed, what does that mean to you and to Hoosiers across Indiana? It means that they will cement their agenda of cutting Medicaid, of cutting funding for (child care assistance), of shifting wealth and helping with tax cuts for the most ultra-wealthy in our nation,” Qaddoura added, unleashing a chorus of booing from the crowd.
Some critiqued Braun’s overhaul of Indiana University’s board of trustees, the university’s tussle with its own student newspaper, statewide degree program cuts and a crackdown on outspoken state and public education staffers.
Suzanne Swierc, a Ball State University employee who lost her job after she posted about the late conservative influencer Charlie Kirk, emphasized the importance of free speech.

Swierc, who is suing her former employer, said she encountered social media comments saying that freedom of speech doesn’t mean freedom from consequences.
“What happened to me has happened and is happening to so many others,” Swierc told the crowd. “There are so many people across our state and our country who are hesitant to speak up, whose speech is being chilled, and that is not okay.
“We should be able to freely express ourselves. We should be able to point out injustices against ourselves and our neighbors. We should be able to advocate for the good of others, and we should be able to do all of this without the government affecting what we can and cannot say,” she added.
Protesters at the Statehouse’s southern steps repeatedly clashed with a Trump supporter wearing a red “Make America Great Again” cap and toting a 2024 campaign sign — even as demonstrators warned each other not to engage with him.
After a shouting match with a blue-vested event security official, an Indiana State Police officer took the man aside for several minutes, before letting him back into the crowd.
Protesters wedged their own signs around his, following his movements. The man, who identified himself only as Hugh, told reporters, “I’m just here to exercise my rights, just like everybody else.”
Attendees chanted and clapped their way through hours of speeches, poems and prayers before flowing out of the lawn to march around the Statehouse.
Families gather outside Indianapolis
Several hundred protesters ringed the Boone County Courthouse Saturday afternoon. They marched, chanted, listened to speakers and broke into cheers every time a passing car honked in approval.

“No hate. No fear. Everyone is welcome here,” they chanted, along with, “This is what democracy looks like.”
Among the issues the crowd focused on was deportation policy, health care cuts and the belief that Trump is an authoritarian.
Cathy VanArsdall said she hasn’t attended a protest since the 1970s but wanted to come out Saturday so that others in the community know they aren’t alone and can speak up.
“We want to show that we do not believe in what’s happening right now,” VanArsdall, a Lebanon resident, said. She accused federal officials of “abducting” people from the streets, violating the U.S. Constitution and lying to the American public.
Melissa, Mike and Liam McMann from Fishers also came to the rally and held signs.
“I came out for my son’s future,” Melissa McMann said. “His rights and liberties and his classmates’ are in jeopardy.”
Liam McMann, 14, said he wants a stable government and to end Trump’s tyranny.
His father, Mike McMann, said, “I served in the Army and this is not what I served for.”
No police were at the event.

(Photo by Shannon Heckt/Virginia Mercury)Thousands of Virginians gathered at Capitol Square in Richmond, in the shadow of statues of the nation’s founding fathers, to join a nationwide demonstration against President Donald Trump’s administration on Saturday. Organizers said over 10,000 people participated in the event, one of dozens in the state and hundreds across America that drew millions of attendees. 
Families of all ages and backgrounds held signs, donned costumes, and sang pro-America songs at the state Capitol before marching down Broad Street. Speakers from pro-democracy and civil rights organizations shared messages of resistance to the federal government upheaval that has come to define Trump’s second term. 
It was a seemingly peaceful demonstration, with no reported arrests or violence as of 4:30 p.m. Saturday when the event was set to disband.
Ahead of the march, Linda Wicks and Jaclyn White sat with their signs in the shade, having traveled from the city of Petersburg and Prince George County to voice their concerns about the country, which has become so polarized that eight in ten Americans “cannot agree on basic facts” about important issues facing the country, according to Pew Research Center polling published earlier this year.

“I am so worried about the direction that our country is taking and we need to stand up and let everyone know how wonderful this country is. We need to go back to decency and following the law,” Wicks said.
White’s sign read “America is a Democracy. No Kings since 1776,” while Wicks’ read “I’m here because I love America.” They were nervous about speaking with the media, the women said, due to the Trump administration’s censorship and targeting of progressive voices.
Giant letters placed at the steps of the state Capitol read “Tax the Rich” and thousands filled the surrounding area to hear speeches centered on education funding, the necessity of leaders abiding by the county’s laws, and federal targeting of immigrant communities. Some signs called for Trump’s impeachment.

Lindsey Dougherty, a Democrat vying to unseat Republican Del. Carrie Coyner for the second time in House District 75, also spoke at Saturday’s protest in Virginia’s capital city.

“Every event that I go to this year, the crowds have grown more and more. I think that is a really great opportunity for us to capitalize on our own community … because we serve communities, not kings,” said Dougherty, whose head-to-head contest with Coyner is considered one of the most competitive in this fall’s elections where all 100 House of Delegates seats are on the ballot.
A group of attendees who had also participated in the June No Kings rally in Richmond said public turnout at the October event was much higher.
Kevin Perry and his 12-year-old son Dezmond came from Dinwiddie to “fight authoritarianism.” Perry said Dezmond said in his small community it can be hard to find like-minded kids at his school. He finds connection with people online and at events like Saturday’s demonstration.

The fall wave of No King protests in Richmond and elsewhere in the nation came at the end of a second week of a government shutdown, as frustrations continue to mount due to federal worker furloughs, with some employees going weeks without paychecks. 
Richmond speakers also highlighted federal workers’ interrupted paychecks because of the shutdown, as well as the proposed cuts to Medicaid that have brought Congressional deliberations and federal government functioning to a standstill, and their fear of the rise of fascism.

Republican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson had called the planned protest a “Hate America rally,” claiming without proof it was organized by pro-Hamas and “antifa” groups. 
Deirdre Schiefeling, the Chief Political and Advocacy Officer for the ACLU, said in a press call ahead of the event that the rallies were about protecting free speech, putting a spotlight on the crackdown on immigration, and weighing in on lawmakers’ government funding discussions.
Several protesters at Richmond’s rally rebuked Johnson’s comments, saying that free speech is an integral part of America’s foundation.
“The entire American experience is based on protesting an oppressive government. So why is this un-American? There is no logic in that in any way, shape or form,” said Jason Erbe, of Richmond.
Gov. Glenn Youngkin said in a statement on X that “Virginians have a fundamental right to free speech and peaceful assembly, but that right does not include the destruction of property, looting, vandalism, disruption of traffic, or violence of any kind—for which there will be zero tolerance.”
The governor added that his administration was coordinating with local, state and federal law enforcement, and said he “authorized members of the National Guard to be placed in ‘state active duty’ status to ensure the Guard will be ready to respond alongside our substantially increased police presence to help keep Virginians safe.”

Capitol Police, the Richmond Police Department, and Virginia State Police officers were present at the Richmond rally, helping to direct traffic as protesters closed down both directions of Broad Street in downtown Richmond on their way to Monroe Park, where more speeches took place.

The Concord demonstration was one of more than 30 official rallies organized across the state by the national coalition No Kings, and one of more than 2,700 planned across the nation. In the capital, the protest filled the State House lawn and spilled out along North Main Street.
“What’s going on in America is intolerable. This administration is trying to eliminate democracy,” said Donald Winchester, of Antrim. “Mayflower pilgrims were immigrants too,” read a sign he carried.
“I’m an eighth generation New Hampshire native. I was raised a Republican, fiscally conservative, socially responsible, protectors of the environment, party of Lincoln, and so now I’m a very active Democrat, because I am just beside myself with what’s going on,” said Meredith resident Sandy Mucci, who cited concerns about the “militarization” of American cities.

Sandy Mucci, of Meredith, said she was concerned about the administration’s use of the military and hoped the protest would help push more lawmakers to take action against what she said was executive branch overreach. 
“I’m an eighth generation New Hampshire native,” she said. “I was raised a Republican, fiscally conservative, socially responsible, protectors of the environment, party of Lincoln, and so now I’m a very active Democrat, because I am just beside myself with what’s going on,” she said. “… I am scared to death.”
Retired Air Force Master Sgt. Mike Scism, of Sanbornton, waved an American flag at passersby. The administration’s management of the military has disturbed him, Scism said.
“When you join (the military), you swear an oath to protect the Constitution, not to uphold a dictator. What (Secretary Pete) Hegseth is doing to the Department of Defense is horrible,” he said, referencing remarks Hegseth has made targeting diversity and equity initiatives in the military. “… Diversity and having people from all walks of life in the military is key to our strength. It’s not a weakness,” Scism said. 
He added that he believed more veterans were in attendance Oct. 18 than had been present at the first No Kings rally in June.
Chris Farrell, a protest organizer and military veteran, also spoke about the importance of diversity to the military. He led attendees in a recitation of the oath of enlistment, a version of which is taken by military and federal officials when they are sworn in to a role.
“I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States of America,” the oath began. “… As long as there are Americans willing to speak those words, there will be no kings in this nation,” Ferrell said after the oath had concluded.

Other speakers included disability rights advocate Lisa Beaudoin, who criticized federal funding cuts to the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services and health care, and called for more support and respect for disabled Americans. She also criticized New Hampshire Republicans in particular, who she said were “leading the nation in cuts to Medicaid.”
Bob Sanders, of Concord, who recently concluded a cross-country bike trip protesting the war in Gaza, also spoke at the event, calling for a lasting ceasefire. New Hampshire Youth Movement representative Ty Wyman called for more youth involvement in politics. Other speakers discussed topics from vaccines to health care and immigration.
In bright costumes and with signs bearing messages from lighthearted to urgent, protesters in Concord cheered, chanted, and waved at passing cars throughout the afternoon. A crew of 18 “peacekeepers” from New Hampshire Peace Action patrolled the crowd; the team is trained in deescalation, said peacekeeper Lee Anne Tigert.

Many protesters said they hoped the demonstration would lead to change, but others were skeptical. “If protesting changed anything, they’d make it illegal,” read a sign carried by attendee Brett Power. 
“I think a general strike is needed,” Power said, adding that he did not believe demonstrations on their own would effect significant change at the federal level. “The leverage people have is their labor,” he said.
Others said they hoped the protest would catch the attention of legislators and lead to change.
“This is what it’s going to take. Grassroots stuff like this, to get stuff done,” said protester Betty McKay. “Our legislators and congressmen need to be paying attention.”

(Photo by Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)Hundreds of Arkansans marched down Capitol Avenue in downtown Little Rock Saturday morning in a joint effort to protest President Donald Trump’s administration and to celebrate LGBTQ+ Arkansans.
Little Rock’s addition to the nationwide No Kings protest movement, the second this year, coincided with Central Arkansas Pride’s annual march and celebration. The organizations behind both worked together to share resources and advocate for some of the same causes, Central Arkansas Pride Executive Director Dolores Wilk said in an interview.
Wilk said it’s important for Arkansans to challenge the stereotype that southern, Republican-led states are overwhelmingly bigoted against marginalized communities.
Harry Bounds and Bryan Strickland of Little Rock agreed that southerners can be “just as progressive” as non-southerners. Strickland is a lifelong Arkansan while Bounds grew up in Alabama.
“We believe in democracy, we believe in free speech,” Bounds said. “It’s very important that we dispel those [negative] stereotypes.”

Strickland and Bounds have been married for six years and told the Advocate they are concerned that the political right wing will overturn the legal right to same-sex marriage.
“We are here for equality, [so] everyone gets the same playing field,” Strickland said. “That’s not happening now.”
The couple said they also attended the first No Kings rally in June. That event saw thousands of attendees, who marched across the Broadway Bridge between Little Rock and North Little Rock.
Saturday’s No Kings rally began at 10 a.m. at the intersection of Broadway and Capitol Avenue in front of the federal courthouse. Five blocks down Capitol Avenue, Pride festivities kicked off at 11 a.m. between Chester and Pulaski streets, where No Kings rallygoers joined the Pride parade.
Central Arkansas Pride has held its annual event on the third Saturday in October for years, and it moved from North Little Rock’s Argenta neighborhood to Capitol Avenue this year because it needed more space to accommodate growing attendance, Wilk said.

Allowing the No Kings organizers to join the parade was an easy decision because of their support for civil rights of all kinds, Wilk said.
“They support queer rights, they support women’s rights, veterans rights, health rights,” Wilk said.
Grace Daugherty of Sherwood pointed out that Pride celebrations originated from a protest in New York City in 1969.
“It’s very important as a queer person, and especially as a white person, to stand up and be loud and fight back against fascism and the unfairness of this regime,” Daugherty told the Advocate.
The People’s Protests and Marches of AR hosted the Little Rock No Kings rally. Central Arkansas Pride, Indivisible LRCA and 50501 Arkansas are also listed as organizers of the Little Rock protest on the No Kings website.
 ‘Right is right and wrong is wrong’

Slogans on protesters’ signs included, “No kings, just drag queens,” “Fight truth decay,” “Jesus had 2 dads and he turned out fine,” and “The only orange monarch America wants is a butterfly.”
Protesters shouted a series of chants, including “The people united will never be divided,” “This is where we should be,” and “Love, not hate, makes America great.” Some attendees wore inflatable animal costumes, a trend that started with Portland, Oregon residents’ protest against National Guard presence in the city.
Portland is among a handful of Democrat-led major cities to which Trump has deployed troops with the stated purpose of fighting crime and maintaining order. One protest sign read, “Wait… we’re invading ourselves?”

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has become more active under the Trump administration, sometimes detaining and deporting immigrants that are legally present in the country.
Elizabeth Wiggins carried a sign that said “Fight ignorance, not immigrants.”
“I think [Trump] wants us to be silent and not fight back and just take what he wants us to do, and I don’t agree with that,” she said.
Wiggins drove two and a half hours from El Dorado. The protest in Monroe, Louisiana was closer to home, but Wiggins said she wanted to protest with her friends that live in Central Arkansas.
Teana Bailey of Perryville, a 50-minute drive from Little Rock, said she was raised Republican but has been protesting the Trump administration because “right is right and wrong is wrong.”
“Everybody needs to talk now, because there may be a chance where it’s going to be harder and scarier,” Bailey said.

The Little Rock Police Department and Pulaski County Sheriff’s Office both sent officers to monitor Saturday’s events in coordination with the Pride and No Kings organizers. City police were present on the Arkansas Capitol steps, where some protesters came face to face with a small Christian rally that featured live music and calls for people to turn to Jesus.
Organizers planned the second annual Christian event months in advance and did not know until a few days ago that Pride and No Kings rallies were scheduled the same day, attendee Skylar Weidman told the Advocate.

“We almost didn’t do it again this year, but we believe the Lord told us to,” Weidman said.
The National Weather Service forecast severe storms, including lightning and high winds, for Saturday afternoon. Saturday morning saw sunny weather and temperatures in the 70s, and the weather became cloudy but not rainy in the early afternoon.
Wilk said organizers were “watching the weather very closely since the beginning of the week” and had contingency plans in place. Lightning within three miles would require shutting down the entertainment stage, which showcased live music and drag performers. The organizers planned to use the Victory Building near the Capitol as an emergency shelter from severe weather if necessary.
Small amounts of rain would not have deterred Pride festivities, Wilk said.
“Some of my best rainbows I’ve ever seen have been at Pride after rain,” Wilk said.

(Photo by Nate Billings/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — More than 1,000 people joined a No Kings protest Saturday outside City Hall in Oklahoma City, donning ponchos and inflatable costumes in the rain to rally against President Donald Trump. 
The No Kings protests, which took place in hundreds of cities across all 50 states and in the nation’s capital, are intended to denounce the Trump administration and rally against “chaos, corruption, and cruelty.” 
Many protest signs and speakers focused on anger with Trump’s deportation campaign using Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Congress’ failure to release the Epstein files and the conflict in Gaza.

Rosa Valdez said she’s never been involved in politics, but that seeing immigrants removed from their homes without due process brought her to the protest.
“There’s a lot of people that have been around me in my lifetime that have fallen victim to what is going on right now and have, unfortunately, been deported,” she said. “And just the way that everything has gone down, I know that they didn’t get any court (date) or anything like that.”
Duwayne Mills, an Oklahoma native, attended Saturday’s protests wearing a Ghostbusters outfit he altered to instead be a “Trump-busters” jumpsuit. 
He said the outfit was meant to be silly because “tyrants hate to be laughed at.”

“I’ve got two kids at home, and I will not have them brought up in this B.S.,” he said. “Because somebody … has some kind of ego trip going on and no one in that party will stop him because they’re just as corrupt as he is.”
Georgia Williams and Kim Reed said they joined the protest because of the actions of GOP leaders like House Speaker Mike Johnson and a dislike of the administration limiting press access at the White House. 
Organizers of the protests held a mock trial for Trump, alleging crimes such as using the military against civilians, obstructing justice, corruption and bribery. Speakers acted as prosecutors and witnesses in the trial, with the crowd of protestors acting as the jury and found Trump “guilty.” 
The protests were peaceful and there was no prominent counter protest or local police presence, but organizers hired security to ensure safety. 
Local organizations like Indivisible Oklahoma and 50501OK were the main organizers in Oklahoma City.
No Kings protests were planned in at least 18 other Oklahoma cities, according to organizers, including Ponca City, Bartlesville, Miami, Enid, Stillwater, Tulsa, Tahlequah, Muskogee, Guthrie, Chandler, Norman, McAlester, Ada, Pauls Valley, Lawton, Ardmore, Durant and Idabel.

Free.,No Kings day brings millions into US streets in anti-Trump protests,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/no-kings-day-brings-millions-us-streets-anti-trump-protests,,"WASHINGTON — Millions of Americans packed streets, parks and town squares across the United States Saturday for No Kings day, according to the organizers of the massive day of demonstrations protesting President Donald Trump’s administration — from his deployment of troops to cities to his targeting of political opponents.Thousands upon thousands showed up for the second organized No Kings day in America’s largest cities like Atlanta, New York City and Chicago, to smaller metro areas and towns including Greensburg, Pennsylvania; Bismarck, North Dakota; and Hammond, Louisiana. More than 2,600 nonviolent demonstrations were planned.The first No Kings day coincided with Trump’s military parade that occurred on his 79th birthday in June. Demonstrators decried Trump’s dispatch of National Guard troops to several U.S. cities, as well as ongoing immigration crackdowns in Los Angeles, the nation’s capital, Portland, Oregon, and Chicago and where U.S. citizens have been swept up in raids.

Ben Grimes, of Northern Virginia, who said he spent two decades in the U.S. Army piloting helicopters and working as a military lawyer, held a sign bearing the message “I Served America Not Autocracy.” Grimes stood among tens of thousands of demonstrators who stretched down several blocks of Pennsylvania Avenue at the Washington, D.C., No Kings day event.“We’re sliding very rapidly into autocracy and lawlessness,” said the 52-year-old veteran, whose career included a deployment to Baghdad. “Just about everything has worried me, but I am particularly concerned about the use of the deployment of military troops in the U.S. and the apparent lawless killing of civilians in the Caribbean,” Grimes said.

JB Pritzker, a Democrat, also called on the crowd to be united and speak out.

Thousands of people gathered in Times Square in Manhattan for New York City’s No Kings day peaceful 1.6-mile march down 7th Avenue.Silas Perez, 21, who lives in the Bronx, said she “wants to fight for our rights while we still have them.” “They want to say ‘Make America Great Again.’ It was better before,” Perez said. “This is worse.” ""Democracy requires your courage, and tyranny requires good people doing nothing … and it fails when ordinary people refuse to cooperate and they say, 'no kings' and mean it,"" Pritzker said. In Lexington, Kentucky, protester Garcia O’Brien, 71, said, “I’m old, and I’ve never been scared for our democracy. I am now.” In Fargo, North Dakota, Ken Opheim showed up in a red hat but with an anti-Trump message: Quid Pro Quo Trump Must Go. ""Everything he does, he gets something back for himself,"" Opheim said.Lawmakers, activists and celebrities spoke at rallies across the country — Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock in Atlanta, actor John Cusack in Chicago, Bill Nye “the Science Guy” in Washington, D.C. Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Chris Murphy of Connecticut also spoke to the massive crowd in the nation’s capital.“He has not won yet, the people still rule in this country,” Murphy, a Democrat, said. “Trump thinks that he’s a king, and he thinks he can act more corruptly when the government is shut down.”

The protesters took to the streets during the ongoing government shutdown to question Trump’s actions since he took office for his second presidential term on Jan. 20.Trump revamped his legally questionable mass firing of federal workers on Oct. 10, this time against the backdrop of the nearly three-week government funding lapse. Amid the shutdown, Trump this past week authorized a $20 billion bailout for Argentina. The administration also continues to amass defense resources along the coast of Venezuela and carry out extrajudicial strikes on alleged drug running boats in the Caribbean Sea, killing dozens.

Repeatedly, Trump has threatened to use the shutdown as an opportunity to permanently cut “Democrat programs that aren’t popular with Republicans” by canceling funding already appropriated by Congress.A member of his own party, GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, said the Government Accountability Office should sue the for his administration’s illegal impoundment of funds already written into law — something he began to do long before the shutdown.Since January, Trump has canceled billions in foreign aid, medical research, natural disaster assistance, and funding for museums and libraries, early childhood education and energy efficiency programs for K-12 schools.

Trump’s use of power was on full display when he invoked the Alien Enemies Act in March and defied a federal judge’s order by sending hundreds of immigrants, many without due process, to a mega-prison in El Salvador. The mistakenly deported Kilmar Arego Garcia became the face of Trump’s mass deportation campaign.Nearly 300 partner organizations signed on to the nonviolent No Kings day, from local- and state-level groups to large national liberal advocacy bodies and labor unions, including the ACLU, Common Cause, Indivisible, the League of Women Voters and SEIU.

He left the White House Friday afternoon to spend the weekend at his Florida residence and was at his golf course on Saturday, according to the White House press corps traveling with the president.Republicans have characterized the No Kings event as anti-American. House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana recently described the event on Fox News as a “hate America rally,” claiming “it’s all the pro-Hamas wing and the antifa people.”Trump declared “antifa” as a “domestic terrorist organization” last month, despite the fact that such a group does not exist. “Antifa,” shorthand for anti-fascist, is an ideology disapproving of fascist governance.  He also issued a directive targeting progressive organizations, including Indivisible, according to a list the White House provided to Reuters.IN THE STATESWest VirginiaProtesters turn out en masse against Trump during No Kings protest at West Virginia Capitol, West Virginia Watch reports.Hundreds of protesters descended on the West Virginia capitol to speak out against detainments by ICE, potential federal cuts to health care programs, social safety nets and more that would largely impact already vulnerable people. OklahomaOver 1,000 gather in Oklahoma City as part of nationwide No Kings protests, the Oklahoma Voice reports.More than 1,000 people braved the rain in Oklahoma City, donning ponchos and inflatable costumes to join a protest outside City Hall.

Around 11 a.m., more than 200 people met at the Robert C. Byrd federal courthouse in downtown Charleston before marching two miles together to the state Capitol, on the city’s east end. There, they were met by about 200 more residents for a rally. Individuals continued to arrive as the event progressed.

Hundreds of people marched 2 miles this morning from the federal courthouse in Charleston, WV to the state capitol as part of the No Kings protests.
Marchers chanted “No kings, no KKK, no fascist USA” as they walked. Dozens of people honked as they drove by and others parked to join the march.

Attendees throughout the crowd wielded protest signs. Some were witty, some were insulting to Trump and other Republicans, while others featured pleas to the federal government to preserve democracy and work for the common good. The ages of the crowd widely ranged — parents pushed babies and toddlers in strollers while older residents, many in their 80s and 90s, sat holding their signs under trees to the side of the Capitol building.
Kathy Stalnaker, 65, said she attended the protest because she’s afraid for her childrens’ and grandchildrens’ futures. A retired teacher, it was far from Stalnaker’s first time protesting the government at the West Virginia state Capitol. She was present at the teacher and school service personnel strikes in 2018 and 2019.
Now, she said, it feels like there’s even more to speak up about.
“My main concern is for my children and grandchildren. I’ve studied history and Hitler and Mussolini — all of those dictators. That’s where we’re headed right now,” Stalnaker said. “Our country can’t go down the toilet this way. We’ve worked so hard and so long to establish this democracy. Now, we’ve got to fight for it.”

Stalknaker said it was a challenge deciding what to write on her protest sign. 
“There were so many things I could say, that I want to say,” Stalnaker said. “All week I’ve just been thinking, ‘I’m so sick of this. I’m sick of this fear and these threats.’”
Generally on Saturday, residents spoke against recent actions and detainments by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement as well as potential federal cuts to health care programs, social safety nets and more that would largely impact already vulnerable people. They also spoke out against threats that have come against people of color, LGBTQ+ individuals, journalists and activists, among others.

“It really does feel like people are in danger right now, real danger,” said Cheryl Pinckney, who attended the rally from St. Albans with her husband, Don Pinckney.
The Pinckneys moved to West Virginia more than 28 years ago. In recent years, Don Pinckney said, it feels like things have gotten more challenging. Now, they’re seriously considering leaving the state for the first time since they moved here.
“Politics didn’t feel as polarizing in the past, but honestly now we’re afraid,” Don Pinckney said.
“Things feel more permanent now — this hate, this division, all of these threats [to democracy],” Cheryl Pinckney continued. “I don’t know how we’re going to turn things around, but we’ve got to figure it out.”

The march and protest Saturday was a peaceful affair. People yelled in the crowds and chanted when prompted. Across Kanawha Boulevard, on the edge of the river, several law enforcement officers — from the West Virginia State Police, Charleston Police Department and the State Capitol Police — oversaw the event.

Speakers at the rally included representatives from several nonprofit organizations, including CAG and the ACLU. Del. Mike Pushkin, D-W.Va., played guitar for those in attendance after a speech where he asked all the older people in the crowd — those over 70, 80 or 90 years of age — to clap their hands.
Applause came from throughout the area.
“They’re out here because they know better. They’ve lived through several administrations and they know better,” Pushkin said. “These are the folks who know that democracy does not defend itself. We are not subjects, we are citizens. In America, we have no kings.

Salesianum scored in all three phases of the game to defeat the Jaguars, Friday night.
 
MIDDLETOWN — Salesianum defeated the Appoquinimink Jaguars, 49-0, Friday night earning its fourth win in a row and second straight shutout. Sallies scored all but seven of their points in the first half.
Appoquinimink started its first possession of the game with a trip to the red zone courtesy of a 48-yard pass from senior Desai Drummond to fellow senior Dominic Montebell on a deep crossing route to the right hashmark that Montebell secured with a one-handed grab on the run. Sallies’ defense held the Jaguars out of the endzone on the ensuing set of downs and forced a field goal attempt. 
Salesianum senior Jayvian Burrell rushed around the left side and blocked the attempt. He recovered the loose ball and ran it back down the left side for an 80-yard score to begin the night.
Sallies’ offense — led by quarterback Brady Nabb — scored on their first offensive possession with a 28-yard touchdown grab by receiver Devin Hasan near the front left pylon. Junior Jett Healy scored his first of two touchdowns of the game a possession after on a four yard run out of the wildcat formation. Healy’s other touchdown came on a punt return later in the second quarter.
The Sallies defense contributed a score in the first half on an interception from junior Kevin McConaghy in the late stages of the second quarter. A Jamar Taylor touchdown catch completed Sallies first half scoring on a night where Salesianum executed well in every phase of the game.
The Jaguars offense was able to move the ball down the field by completing a couple of deep passes, but the Salesianum defense held firm as Appoquinimink threatened. It’s the first time this season the Jaguars were held scoreless.  
It’s only Appoquinimink’s second loss of the season, but it breaks a stretch of three straight wins for the Jaguars including a thrilling overtime victory over Caravel on October 10. The Jaguars will remain at home for a matchup against Hodgson next Friday.
Sallies will play at home next week with Middletown coming to Abessinio Stadium next Friday. Salesianum is 5-2 this season and undefeated against in-state competition.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4225-1024x704.jpg,,,2025-10-18 13:58:08.404856
,Mississippi Today,2025-10-18 17:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Reddit AMA recap: How does Mississippi spend its opioid settlement dollars?,Mississippi Today,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/10/18/mississippi-opioid-settlement-reddit-ama/,Allen Siegler answered your questions about how Mississippi’s elected officials have been managing about $124 million of Mississippi opioid settlement money.,"Mental health reporter Allen Siegler recently published a series of stories investigating how Mississippi’s elected officials have been managing about $124 million of Mississippi opioid settlement money — money that the state is receiving as a result of lawsuits against companies that profited off a devastating overdose crisis.
His findings were staggering.
Most of the money spent so far has been for lawyers’ fees or stuff that isn’t related to addiction, like police cameras and fiber optic cable installations.
And it’s not that the crisis is over — more people are dying now than seven years ago, when the biggest lawsuit was filed. But less than 1% of the Mississippi money has actually been used to stop the problem.
This project took over three months to report and write, and there were plenty of weird things that happened along the way. So Allen answered questions from our readers on Reddit, taking them behind the scenes on what it takes to undertake such an investigation.
You can read the conversation below. This includes guidance on how people can file a Freedom of Information Act request to access public records (with a link to a sample FOIA request you can use) and other actions community members can take to ensure these funds are used to address the problems highlighted in the lawsuits.

Some questions have been edited for length and clarity.
Q: What can we do to help pressure whoever is in charge of distribution of the funds?
Click for the answer.
I think it depends on what someone would want to accomplish. At the most direct level, the city/town council members and county supervisors are the people who decide where the local money goes. If your town, city or county is spending the money without the input of those most impacted by the crisis (which, to our knowledge, is every local government besides Hattiesburg), you could call city hall or the your supervisors and let them know what you think of that and where you think the money should go. Most elected officials’ emails are also publicly available, so contacting them that way could be a good strategy as well. 
The contract Attorney General Lynn Fitch made with the local governments is already finalized, so I don’t believe she can change the unrestricted terms of that spending. But other states’ attorneys general have provided guidance for how local governments should spend their money in overdose prevention, regardless of what their contracts say the cities and counties have to do. North Carolina’s former attorney general wrote extensive FAQs about local settlement spending that experts have brought up to me multiple times. If she wanted to/if her constituents made it known that’s something they want to happen, Fitch’s office could write similar guidelines.
To my knowledge, the only state group that can legally change how the towns, cities and counties spend their opioid settlement money is the Mississippi Legislature. And we’ve seen that happen in other states. Similar to Mississippi, Maine didn’t require its local governments to report what they were spending their settlement money on (although Emily Bader with The Maine Monitor did a remarkable job filling those reporting gaps where she could). Then this spring, state lawmakers passed a simple bill to require that from hereon out. If Mississippi lawmakers hear from their voters that they want a bill like this as well (or others that require the money to be spent on addiction-related purposes), they might look to pass similar legislation during the 2026 regular session. 

Q: I see a lot about police funds and even some that explicitly state money was put towards guns. My understanding is that some funds were allotted to counties to be used at their discretion.
Click for the answer.
In Mississippi, Fitch wrote a contract that says all the settlement money flowing to towns, cities and counties (expected to be around $63 million when all is said and done) can be spent for whatever public purpose their town/city council and Board of Supervisors think is appropriate. The settlements allow for up to 30% of spending to be on things that don’t have to do with addiction; because the local governments are getting 15% of the total Mississippi opioid settlement pie, all of their shares can be spent like any other public dollars. 
While this is technically allowed by the national settlements, the lawyers who wrote the settlements explicitly said they didn’t want that to happen. Most states created arrangements that say all the lawsuit money has to go to something related to addiction (even for purposes that have been criticized by the public). But as of right now, that’s not the case here.

Q: Are any of these funds discussed with constituents, or does it seem to entirely be at the whims of the ones in charge? How can we know whether or not they will a) use the remaining funds at all b) use them for anything remotely related to dealing with the supposed target issue?
Click for the answer.
Entirely at the whims of the ones in charge, at least for the local money. But it doesn’t have to be that way. Toby Barker, the mayor of Hattiesburg, created a committee this summer to advise how to spend the city’s settlement money. The committee, made up of locals who have experience addressing addiction, has come up with a few priorities so far, and I heard they’re in the process of moving forward on putting up money for those priorities. 
For questions A and B, it’s going to be hard if the current setup continues. For example, cities and counties have been getting money for three years now, but even those I consider most familiar with the Mississippi overdose crisis (people like James Moore in Hattiesburg) didn’t know anything about the local spending until I requested records and told him about that. But, as you allude to in your next question, anyone can request records from Mississippi governments. And I think we proved that while not ideal, the public record technique is an effective way to bring spending information to light. 

Q: Could you give a rundown of how one goes about requesting (or accessing) these documents?
Click for the answer.
Yep, no problem! First, you need to have an idea about what information you’re looking for and what documents might contain that information. I knew very little about the recordkeeping of these local settlements going into the project, so I asked for “All receipts of dollars received by the [local government name] related to the National Opioids Settlements since June 1,2022,” and “All internal records related to [local government name]’s spending of money received from the National OpioidSettlements since June 1, 2022.”Here’s one I sent to the city of Hattiesburg, which has all the template information to make sure we get the information as quickly and accessibly as possible. I tried to email them to city/town/chancery clerks, and sometimes added in the county administrator/government attorney. When a local government has a specific city portal or form, like Oxford and Long Beach respectively, I put the same information into those forms. I was expecting to receive documents like spending ledgers and city council resolutions from this request, which I sometimes did. But there were tons of other formats clerks and administrators used to provide me the information. I got everything from county budgets mostly unrelated to opioid settlement spending to a handwritten note saying nothing has been spent yet.
Sometimes, helpful public servants would call me to clarify what information I wanted. I nudged some of the clerks a lot, and made sure the Mississippi Ethics Commission knew when the public bodies were breaking state law. It took up most of my summer to do this with all 147 local governments, but I think the importance of this information justifies the work

Q: How are other states handling/distributing funds to address opioid overdoses? Who should the public turn to for recommendations on how best to use these funds to address the problems? Health professionals? Law enforcement officials? Local Politicians? How can the public be more involved?
Click for the answer.
It’s a very mixed bag from state to state. Like I wrote in this story, every other state has used at least $3 million of opioid settlement money to at least try to address their overdose crises. But that certainly doesn’t mean everything’s sunshine and roses everywhere else. 
Christine Minhee has a better national perspective on the settlement distribution than anyone I’ve met, and she created a state opioid settlement guide last December to give folks baseline information about what’s going on in each state. And the guides show that while there are states effectively using their dollars to prevent more deaths, there’s plenty of opportunities for spending that doesn’t address the opioid epidemic across the country. When I was reporting in West Virginia, I wrote a story about county leaders using nearly half a million settlement dollars for a shooting range. I just saw a story from Hawaii that leaders are using some of the state’s money for waterpark and Chuck E. Cheese vouchers. 
For best practice recommendations, there are a lot of national level resources (like Johns Hopkins University’s guide) that provide broad recommendations for how the settlement money can prevent more deaths.The settlements themselves have lists of strategies that are proven ways to curb the crisis. But public health professionals repeatedly told me that for any given town, city or county, the people who make up the community whose lives have been touched by the overdose catastrophe are the best people to share what will and won’t work. 

Q: Why would the crowd that diverted welfare money to a volleyball stadium with little consequences be expected to do the right thing with the settlement money?
Click for the answer.
I sent Anna Wolfe this question, and she said the welfare scandal teaches us that when public money intended to assist the state’s most vulnerable residents has so few guardrails, the likelihood it will be squandered is great (whether straight-up stolen or spent on things that have nothing to do with the intended purpose–both of which yield the same result: people don’t receive help and opportunities for better outcomes are lost). I think she’s completely right.
What I would add about the opioid settlement situation in particular is that the State Legislature, the group that will control as much as $300 million when all the payments come in, hasn’t done much to indicate one way or another how it will spend the money it oversees. We’ll know a lot more about what’s to come when the Opioid Settlement Fund Advisory Council presents recommendations for which overdose response efforts lawmakers should fund in December, and when the lawmakers act on those non-binding recommendations in the 2026 regular legislative session. I’ll be keeping eyes on what happens there, and I hope the public does too. 

Q: Are there any accountability frameworks that would allow the money to be used in a way that it benefits the actual victims of the opioid crisis?
Click for the answer.
I think so! I think the Maine bill that requires local spending reporting is a great way to encourage city and county leaders to be responsible stewards of the money. I think there could be a lot of ways states can incentivize spending on preventing more deadly overdoses and a lot of people willing to help develop these incentives. I cite many people with a lot of experience in that department in my stories. 

Q: How will the One Big Beautiful Bill impact mental health and those that work in this field in private practice, agency settings and psychiatry hospitals?
Click for the answer.
I won’t pretend to know everything about the health and health care implications of this summer’s federal spending bill. But nearly half of people diagnosed with opioid addiction used Medicaid, the state-federal insurance program for vulnerable Americans. 
So, I would guess that if fewer people have health insurance through Medicaid – which is what I understand the spending bill to incentivize in 2027 – that likely means fewer people can get effective opioid addiction treatment, like the medications buprenorphine and methadone.
This Kaiser Family Foundation article was published before the bill was passed, but I think it does a good job laying out the implications of Medicaid cuts on addressing the opioid epidemic.

Q: Has any of the spending been audited so far?
Click for the answer.
I have not come across any audits in my reporting. 

Q: How will the settlement be spent?
Click for the answer.
We mostly don’t know right now. Mississippi has received about $125 million as of this summer, but it’s slated to receive another roughly $300 million over the next 15 years. A lot can change in that time, from who’s making the decisions to what the addiction epidemic looks like. 
This graph I made breaks down what’s broadly happened with the $125 million. The biggest chunk of money is with the Legislature, and it’s unspent as of now. That will very likely change after the 2026 Regular Legislative Session, which begins in January and ends in April. I expect lawmakers to make some decisions for these dollars by April, and the public will know more then. 
The $15.5 million controlled by 147 towns, cities and counties can and is being spent on any public purpose their leaders want. This other graph I made digs into whether the local governments are spending the money on addiction, spending it on something else or not spending it yet. 

Q: A lot of states are using the opioid settlement to purchase equipment like Reassurance Solutions cell monitoring devices; basically vital sign radars that go in county detention centers and jails to monitor for overdoses (which happen most often within the first 24 hours of incarceration). Is tech like that a viable option for Mississippi’s funds?
Click for the answer.
I don’t know anything about that specific device, so I don’t want to comment on that specifically. But the settlement lawyers list initiatives that prevent more overdoses for inmates and former inmates as acceptable ways to address the crisis. They speak about providing “MAT (medication assisted treatment), recovery support, harm reduction, or other appropriate services” to people involved with the criminal justice system. 

Q: Grant decisions will be determined by the legislature. Will there be any opportunity for public comment on the grants recommended to the legislature?
Click for the answer.
I have not heard of any opportunities for public comment, and I don’t see anything in the law state senators and representatives passed in spring that says there will be public comment opportunities. But lawmakers don’t just make laws — they can also change them! So if Mississippians think public comment opportunities for how these dollars get spent are important, a good way to make that known would be to call/email their state senators and representatives. 

Q: Did you find that Mississippi officials resisted sharing records or delayed responses? If so, how did you overcome that and what rights do regular residents have to push back when agencies ignore or stonewall?
Click for the answer.
Oh, absolutely. The most common obstacle I came across was staying in contact with whoever handles the public records in any given town, city or county. I filed almost all of my records requests in mid-June, so I started following-up with local governments I hadn’t heard back from in early July. First, I would ask for an email update and often add the town/city/county attorney. For a lot of governments, that was enough. But going into mid-July, there were still dozens of governments that I hadn’t heard back from. 
From there, it branched out into a lot of phone calls to city halls and county boards of supervisors. Mississippi has laws that say public officials have to fully respond to public records requests by at most 14 business days, and it has a state Ethics Commission to enforce them.So I spent a lot of July reminding city or chancery clerks what the state’s public record act says. My deskmates got a kick out of the number of times I told record keepers I was going to loop in the ethics commissioner Thomas Hood about not receiving these records in a timely manner. But doing that usually worked, so I stand by it. 
For anyone looking to file records requests, feel free to copy and paste the language from my Hattiesburg FOIA where I talk about asking for electronic copies and other things of that nature. I would also recommend reading the public records act I linked above and the state’s model law so they know what you are and aren’t entitled to. If a government is looking to charge 50 cents a page for emailed copies of documents (as happened to me multiple times), that’s a problem. Tom Hood successfully mediated a number of these disagreements between public officials and me. If you run into any issues, you can loop him into the email thread (thood@ethics.state.ms.us), and he might be able to clear up any disagreements. If not, you can file an ethics complaint with his office. 

Q: Who is responsible for making sure this money is spent on addiction treatment instead of unrelated projects?
Click for the answer.
For the local Mississippi money, no one right now. There’s very few reporting requirements the settlements themselves actually require, and Attorney General Fitch’s agreement with cities and counties doesn’t require it either. But the state Legislature could pass a law to change that, if lawmakers think that’s an important priority. 
For the state’s money, Fitch has designated a small chunk of its share (“small chunk” is relative as it’s still expected to be over $60 million in total) for purposes that don’t have to address addiction. The settlements say the remaining pot of money, set to be around $300 million by 2040, has to be spent on addressing addiction. 
The law the Legislature passed this spring says the Attorney General’s Office is in charge of making sure the money is spent legally. So, unless the Legislature changes something, the person responsible is Fitch or whoever is attorney general in the future. 

Q: When you filed 147 records requests, how many governments actually complied fully and how many gave partial or no responses?
Click for the answer.
For 141 governments, I believe public officials gave me their best estimates of how much money they’ve received and how they’ve been spending the funds. That doesn’t mean I think they got all the information right. For instance, Gulfport wrote me a letter that they hadn’t spent any of their money despite meeting minutes showing that they spent $4,000 for a holiday feeding program in 2023. There could be other governments that did similar things that my editor and I didn’t catch. 
Three governments — Byram, Tunica County and Kosciusko — found some but not all of the payments they’ve received. So their numbers are likely underestimates of the total money they’ve received. 
Moss Point and Rankin County never told me how they’re spending their dollars, and we noted that in the various charts and graphs. Mound Bayou was the only government to provide no information, which led me to file this ethics complaint against the city in August. 

Q: Were there clear reporting requirements for these funds, or is it left up to local officials to decide what to disclose?
Click for the answer.
The only reporting requirements I’m familiar with in the settlements is for a chunk of the money that is allowed to be spent for purposes other than addiction. My understanding is this provision was added for tax purposes for the pharmaceutical companies paying the settlements. 
That money is supposed to be reported here. My understanding is that if/when the Legislature spends some of its settlement money without the recommendations of the advisory committee, that spending will have to show up here. But I don’t know if there’s an enforcer of this reporting.


Q: From your experience, what is the most effective way for everyday citizens to get attention on financial mismanagement of public records, media coverage, state agencies, or something else?
Click for the answer.
I think reaching out to the local public officials making decisions is a good first step. Now that MT has published our database, there’s hopefully less room for elected officials to say they don’t know what’s going on with the opioid settlements they oversee. I came across many local officials who said they wanted this money to be spent appropriately — they just didn’t exactly know how to do that. So a nudge/recommendation from a helpful constituent could go a long way. 
If that doesn’t work, and state senators and representatives don’t respond to calls and emails, I think going to the media might be a good idea. It’s a story I’d be interested in trying to write, and it looks like Gulf States Newsroom’s Drew Hawkins (whose opioid settlement work I really admire) is looking to produce stories like that as well.  

Q: If Mississippi is spending less than 1% of opioid settlement money on the crisis itself, what avenues are there for residents to push for change? Lawsuits? Federal oversight? Public campaigns?
Click for the answer.
I’m not sure. The general local spending is allowed by both the law and the settlements (although the lawyers say non-addiction spending is “disfavored”), so it’s not illegal. One of the biggest issues I’ve seen in Mississippi’s opioid settlement distribution is because so little information was made public, most people aren’t familiar with the spending or the settlements themselves. 
At large, it just hasn’t been on the Mississippi media and public’s radar.
I hope that starts to change with this “Black Box” series, but I don’t know what will happen. In my experience, nearly everyone I’ve talked with says overdoses are bad and the government should do whatever it can to prevent them. 
Attorney General Fitch and Jackson Mayor John Horhn held a press conference yesterday to say just that. So, if the public continues to connect those dots to the opioid settlement money, I would hope that decision makers see that spending the money for overdose response and prevention is aligned with their priorities. 
In other states, citizens dismayed by opioid settlement spending on things other than addiction have been able to draw a lot of public attention with protests and editorials. I don’t know if that solves all the problems, but it would certainly make this general spending more visible. 

Q: How were local needs assessed, what outcomes will be measured to determine program effectiveness due to funding, and how are programs or intervention evaluated & will the results be shared publicly? 
Click for the answer.
Because Attorney General Fitch didn’t require local governments to spend the money they oversee on addiction, I found little evidence that there’s been many needs assessments or program evaluation. That could change if Mississippi’s laws and resources change, but for now Hattiesburg is the only government I could find using citizen input to assess how this local money can be spent to best prevent more overdoses.

Q: Can you let me know if ANYONE/ ANYWHERE has purchased or contemplated purchasing Fentanyl test strips?
Click for the answer.
Anecdotally, I know people who use test strips to verify what’s in their drug supply. But I haven’t asked them if they purchased the strips or were given them by a mutual aid group.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/17143758/IMG_6416-1.jpg,,,2025-10-18 13:58:08.404856

This was not law enforcement done responsibly; it was just another example of a show of force from an administration that seeks to pit neighbors against neighbors in a calculated and continued effort to divide the American public and consolidate power.
I don’t dispute that Homeland Security and ICE have the authority to enforce immigration law, but authority without compassion erodes legitimacy. The Hamden raid was not targeting dangerous criminals or fugitives. It targeted our neighbors who were washing cars to earn a paycheck, trying to make ends meet and provide for their loved ones.
Similar ICE raids have been reported in New Britain, Southington and Newington in recent months. Each time, ICE has acted unilaterally, disregarding the work of local leaders who strive to balance enforcement with compassion. We do not want our neighborhoods turned into staging grounds for immigration crackdowns aimed to stroke the right-wing base. When federal agents act as if our communities are the battlefield, they undermine the very democratic values they claim to protect.
ICE raids don’t happen in a vacuum. Raids lead to community fear and fear keeps people from reporting crimes or cooperating with police. How can local police department build trust when residents worry that any knock on the door might be ICE in disguise? Effective law enforcement relies on relationships; heavy-handed raids by masked law enforcement agents destroy them.

ICE must coordinate with local governments when operations could affect families or children. Schools and social services must have emergency protocols to identify and assist minors whose parents are suddenly detained. And above all, our elected officials should reaffirm that Connecticut stands for dignity, due process, and decency. 
At a press conference following the raid, State Sen. Jorge Cabrera said, “Give people a path to citizenship. That’s what American’s support. But don’t arrest hardworking, taxpaying immigrants.” Gallup’s July 2025 data supports Cabrera’s statement. According to Gallup, “support for allowing undocumented immigrants to become U.S. citizens has risen to 78%, up from 70% last year.”
After a couple of days, the story is beginning to fade on local news stations, but for the families torn apart, the trauma will last far longer. We are overwhelmed with story after story, and too many of us have become numb to the callousness of the Trump administration. We can’t allow this to become the new normal. 
More than three quarters of us agree that a pathway to citizenship is the answer; more of us must believe that no child should come home from school to find their parents gone without a trace.

Stephen C. “Steve” Cawood, an Eastern Kentucky lawyer who championed coal miners, clean water and better schools, died Oct. 17, three days after his 82nd birthday. 
Grandson to both a county sheriff and a circuit judge, Cawood worked to alleviate Appalachia’s poverty as a volunteer and activist. He was unafraid to challenge the region’s powerful coal industry as an attorney and one-term state legislator. 
He died at Baptist Health Hospital in Lexington after a lengthy battle with bladder cancer. 
“The loss of Steve Cawood will be felt throughout our commonwealth, but especially in Eastern Kentucky,” said Gov. Andy Beshear. “From protecting our state resources to increasing education access, Steve dedicated himself to work that helped build a brighter future for Kentuckians. Britainy and I are praying for his family. He will be missed.”
Environmental lawyer Tom FitzGerald of the Kentucky Resources Council said Cawood “embodied a rich tradition in Eastern Kentucky of progressive people who could have gone anywhere and been successful but decided to stay home and work with the cards dealt them to make the lives of their neighbors better.”
Pineville days
Cawood was born in Pineville on Oct. 14, 1943, to Murrell and Sophia Gilbert Cawood. His father ran a hardware store. Cawood’s maternal grandfather was Circuit Judge James M. Gilbert, who presided in Bell and Harlan counties. His paternal grandfather had been a sheriff of Harlan County. He was predeceased by his sister, Janie Cawood Brooking and brother Tom Cawood.
Cawood said in an oral history interview that his family’s social and economic position, as well as living in town, insulated him from the poverty in the surrounding countryside and coal camps.
“I grew up in the small town of Pineville and it’s a funny, peculiar kind of town to the extent that it is a very cohesive community that revolves around one little high school,” he said. “It has a very leveling effect on the children who are raised here. It did then and it does today to the extent that it was not unusual to find myself on a given summer day as a child lying on the river bank with kids from the poor section of town and kids from the wealthier section of town. Or playing in the woods or in a Scout troop or in a football game.” 
“I knew there were coal miners,” Cawood said of growing up in Pineville. “There were six or eight kids in my class who were left fatherless by the Fourmile mine explosion in 1945. But I knew nothing of the life they lived at home. I had not ever been exposed to the anger. I was not raised in poverty.” 
Kid from Eastern Kentucky
As a student at Eastern Kentucky University, Cawood became involved in the initial planning of President Lyndon B. Johnson’s 1964 War On Poverty. 
“Shortly after the death of President Kennedy and the presidency of Lyndon Johnson, there was a think tank established in Berea, Kentucky,” Cawood recalled in a 1991 interview. The group met to talk about “how to go about designing a program to have socio-economic change in Appalachia, ” he said, and “basically designed” the Economic Opportunity Act, the 1964 law that was the centerpiece of the Johnson era War on Poverty. The Berea confab pieced together what became the Appalachian Volunteers, a kind of domestic Peace Corps. 
“I got involved because they (those organizing the War On Poverty) wanted kids from Eastern Kentucky to advise them,” Cawood recalled. “They were looking for ideas. They didn’t pretend to have all the answers.” 
The impetus for this effort came from President John F. Kennedy’s tour of West Virginia during his 1960 primary campaign. Kennedy “was shocked by what he saw in West Virginia,” Cawood said.

In his senior year at EKU, Cawood joined the Appalachian Volunteers, which he described as a “ragtag bunch of bright, caring people.”
Initially under the Council of the Southern Mountains, the Appalachian Volunteers, or AVs, took on community projects such as repairing schools, winterizing homes and leading recreation programs. The group split off in 1966 and took a more activist stance, helping organize local citizens groups, pushing for poor people to have more say in anti-poverty programs and supporting protests against surface mining, according to “Uneven Ground: Appalachia Since 1945” by Ronald D. Eller and The Kentucky Encyclopedia.
Politicians in Appalachia came to regard the AVs as a threat to local power structures. The federal government cut funds and the program closed in 1970, though many members stayed on and continued their advocacy.
Cawood later said the AVs’ most lasting contribution was giving individuals like Eula Hall the courage to speak up and gain support. Hall was an Appalachian activist and health care pioneer who founded the Mud Creek Clinic in Grethel in Floyd County.
In his second year of law school at the University of Kentucky, Cawood married Jeanette “Sissy” McCauley, the daughter of a Middlesboro mayor, who was starting her junior year of college. They would have two daughters: Beth (Bill) Overman of Lexington and Mandy (JD) Hickey of Lookout Mountain, Tennessee, and five grandchildren.
He was in a group of law students who went to Bell County one summer to find out what legal services were needed. The “raw anger” and tremendous poverty he encountered made a permanent impression on him, he said, in part because he had grown up in Bell County oblivious to the conditions.
In 1968, Cawood helped coordinate Robert F. Kennedy’s presidential campaign tour of Eastern Kentucky. He rode in the car with Kennedy. “I was getting ready to join (the campaign) when Bobby was killed (June 5, 1968),” said Cawood.
Working with coal miners
On Dec. 30, 1970 an explosion at the non-union Finley Mine at Hurricane Creek near Hyden killed 38 men, bringing attention to lax enforcement of federal mine safety laws. Cawood represented survivor A.T. Collins who was blown out of the mine by the explosion.
Phil Primack, who had started working as a reporter at The Mountain Eagle a few months earlier, first met Cawood when he covered the disaster. Cawood “became an invaluable guide to mine safety laws, multiple violations of which led to the explosion, as well as the failures of state and federal regulators to enforce them,” Primack said.
“When he represented A.T. Collins, the disaster’s sole survivor, Steve was more than just the attorney for an individual — he stood for all coal miners and their families and communities,” Primack said. “He was a caring and passionate advocate, a great storyteller, and a good friend.”
Cawood represented striking miners at the Brookside mine in Harlan County in 1973-74 and traveled with them on tours of the country.
Cawood also represented opponents of strip mining in a group called Save Our Kentucky. 
Cawood helped spotlight the plight of coal miners suffering from black lung, an incurable occupational disease caused by breathing coal dust. He completed a legal services survey identifying injustices facing black lung victims. He recalled that some of those involved in the survey later became instrumental in the Black Lung Movement, demanding recognition and compensation for health damage and better dust control in mines.

Working for the Presbyterian Board of Missions, he helped launch the Appalachian Research and Defense Fund or AppalReD, which still provides legal services to low-income people across the region.
In Pineville, Cawood, a Presbyterian, became city attorney, president of the Pineville Chamber of Commerce and chairman of the Salvation Army Board. He was a member of the Sierra Club and Masons and served on the Governor’s Task Force on Floods and the Pineville Flood Evacuation board. 
Stephen Ford, then a reporter for the Courier Journal in Louisville, covered widespread flooding in Eastern Kentucky in 1977. “Pineville was inundated by the Cumberland River,” he recalled. “Most of the town was under water, and it was completely inaccessible by road. I was able to get to Pineville on a boat operated by the Army Corps of Engineers. The Cawoods’ house was on dry ground on a hillside, and Steve and Sissy immediately offered their home as a makeshift news bureau. Local reporters and I were able to work there.
“I suppose as an activist lawyer and someone with modest political aspirations, Steve felt comfortable working with the press. But I also think he deeply loved Pineville and Bell County, and he truly wanted people elsewhere to understand the grave crisis and destruction his community faced.
“That was characteristic of Steve. He stood ready whenever called upon to make contributions, large and small.”
Courier Journal reporters and editors began jokingly referring to Cawood’s office as the “Pineville bureau,” a place where reporters could write, make calls or just collect their wits and some good stories. 
Like many in Pineville, the Cawoods were involved in putting on the annual Mountain Laurel Festival at Pine Mountain State Park. His wife has a photo of Steve at age 5 serving as a train bearer for the festival’s queen with the late Gov. Earle Clements in the background.
Recovery
Sissy Cawood said her husband “would want others to know there is a good life in sobriety” and that he “earned” a chip for 29 years of sobriety in August. Her husband, she said, was grateful to Alcoholics Anonymous and his sponsor, Al Smith, the founding host of Kentucky Educational Television’s “Comment on Kentucky.”

Smith’s sponsorship “was not an easy job,” Sissy Cawood said, “as Steve dealt with feelings of anger, frustration and whatever else alcohol does to your brain after a lifetime of drinking.”
Smith’s wife, Martha Helen Smith, asked Cawood to speak at Smith’s memorial service in 2021. “Al thought the world of Steve,” she said.
Frankfort
In 1980, Cawood, a Democrat, was elected to the state House of Representatives and quickly made a name for himself.
House Speaker Bill Kenton appointed Cawood to chair the House subcommittee on strip mining, which overhauled Kentucky’s law to meet tougher federal standards enacted by Congress in 1977. 
“Add his black-lung efforts and other legal work for miners, and you have one of the greatest bodies of work of any Kentuckian to protect people in the mountains from the adverse effects of what was their major industry. I am proud to have been his friend,” said Al Cross, emeritus journalism professor at the University of Kentucky.
Former House Speaker Greg Stumbo, D-Prestonsburg, entered the House in 1980 with Cawood.
“Steve Cawood had a good moral compass. Everything he did was for the right reasons — whether it be for the environment or the people of Eastern Kentucky,” said Stumbo. “He had to walk a tightrope sometimes in his political battles, and he failed, like all of us, sometimes. But he represented the kind of person in government that we need more of today. He was willing to reach across the aisle to work with his political opponents if he knew that was the right thing to do for the people.”
Rocky Adkins, Beshear’s senior adviser and a longtime friend of Cawood, said, “Steve Cawood was a true and trusted friend, and I was lucky to know and work with him for years. We were focused on making our state a better place for families — especially in our home of Eastern Kentucky. This is a tough loss, but I know his legacy will continue on. Leah and I are praying for Steve’s family.” 
Former state representative and chairman of the Kentucky Democratic Party Jerry Lundergan, of Lexington, was also in the House’s freshman class of 1980. 
“You didn’t have to talk to Steve Cawood very long to tell where his interests were. They were in Eastern Kentucky,” said Lundergan. “At an early meeting with Greg and me, Steve wanted us to be sure to know how important the severance tax on coal was to Eastern Kentucky. He was a model citizen-legislator.”
Cawood lost his bid for reelection to another Democrat, Pearl Ray Lefevers, but remained a citizen activist.
Advocacy
He was one of the early members of the Prichard Committee for Academic Excellence which advocated for the Kentucky Education Reform Act of 1990. He took the challenge of reform seriously and ran for the Pineville Independent school board. He became its chair, hired a new superintendent and worked to create a space between the old and new schools called the Commons that became a community venue in Pineville as well as a place for students. 
Cawood worked to protect his region’s water and forests. He collaborated on successful legal efforts to protect the watersheds that supply Pineville and Middlesboro from the effects of mining. He was a supporter of the Kentucky Natural Lands Trust, especially its efforts to preserve Blanton Forest in Harlan County. 
In his later years, Cawood, a railroad buff, worked on moving archives of the Louisville & Nashville Railroad from a basement in Bowling Green to the Tennessee Rail Museum in Chattanooga where they are now housed.He did the legal work and negotiations at no charge because of his lifelong love of trains, Sissy Cawood said.
He also assisted Dr. John Fox, a Lexington surgeon, in identifying pioneer Daniel Boone’s actual steps through Kentucky.
For fun, Cawood amassed a large collection of scrip, currency used to pay coal miners that was redeemable only at stores owned by the coal company that employed them. 
James Branscome, a journalist and retired managing director of Standard & Poor’s, has known Cawood since 1971.
“Of all the mountain advocates for miners and others in Eastern Kentucky, I don’t know of anyone who has been the source of more information for journalists, congressional staffers, fellow attorneys, organized black lung groups, and labor leaders like the United Mine Workers Association,” said Branscome.
“Steve was a highly respected source for the latest news on topics related to coal and miners, coal history, and virtually any topic related to Appalachia, and especially black lung and black lung regulation and compensation. 
“He was a frequent visitor with friends for trout fishing and camping in the Cherokee National Forest in Tennessee. He and Sissy vacationed on Pawley’s Island, South Carolina, almost every year.”
Funeral arrangements are pending.

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)President Donald Trump has endorsed an opponent to challenge Northern Kentucky Republican U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie. 
In a lengthy Friday evening post to Truth Social, Trump said he hoped Ed Gallrein “gets into the Race against Massie” and was highly critical of the incumbent congressman, calling him “a Weak and Pathetic RINO from the Great Commonwealth of Kentucky, a place I love, and won big SIX TIMES” who “must be thrown out of office, ASAP!” 
Ed Gallrein
A a former Navy Seal from Shelby County, Gallrein has not formally announced a run in the 4th Congressional District, but the president’s “Complete and Total Endorsement” makes the case for why he should. Shelby County is in the southern part of Kentucky’s 4th Congressional District. 
Gallrein lost a competitive Republican primary to state Sen. Aaron Reed in the 7th Senate District last year. Former state Sen. Adrienne Southworth lost the race amid tension within her caucus. Gallrein was seen as the establishment candidate in the primary, having a donation from Republican Senate President Robert Stivers and an endorsement from the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce. 
Reed’s name had been floated as a possible challenger to Massie this summer, but he told reporters in August that he was “happy being a senator right now” and was preparing for the 2026 legislative session.
Massie recently toured the congressional district with ally U.S. Sen. Rand Paul for a mix of official and campaign events. During that, Paul, a leader of Tea Party Republicans, said he was ready to endorse Massie and if someone asked about waiting to see who could run against the congressman, “I can’t imagine that they’d even try it.”
In his post, Trump said “the Great People of Kentucky are wise to” Massie’s positions — which are sometimes at odds with the president. Trump said Massie “only votes against the Republican Party, making life very easy for the Radical Left.”  
“Unlike ‘lightweight’ Massie, a totally ineffective LOSER who has failed us so badly, CAPTAIN ED GALLREIN IS A WINNER WHO WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN,” Trump said. “Should he decide to challenge Massie, Captain Ed Gallrein has my Complete and Total Endorsement. RUN, ED, RUN — MAGA!” 
Massie, whose brand of Republican politics has drawn a loyal base of Libertarian supporters in the congressional district, has been leading the charge to release the federal investigation files on convicted sex offender and financier Jeffery Epstein. Though the president campaigned on declassifying the files, Trump has more recently opposed releasing them.
Earlier this year, Massie also drew the president’s wrath for opposing Trump’s bombing of Iran and voting against the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. 
Trump has previously vowed to oust Massie from office. A super PAC tied to the president spent more than $1 million on ads against the congressman — without a clear challenger named yet. 
After Trump’s endorsement of Gallrein was issued, Massie pushed a fundraising link on X, saying “I can beat this candidate if I have your support.” Earlier this week, the congressman posted the best fundraising numbers of his career, including bringing in nearly $768,000 in contributions from July to September.
Massie told Politico that Gallrein is a “failed candidate and establishment hack” following Trump’s endorsement.
“After having been rejected by every elected official in the 4th District, Trump’s consultants clearly pushed the panic button with their choice of failed candidate and establishment hack Ed Gallrein,” Massie said. “Ed’s been begging them to pick him for over three months now.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-2204622175-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-18 10:00:18.284436

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska’s two largest airports aren’t airing a video by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem that blames Democrats for the government shutdown.  
Officials with the biggest airport in the state — Omaha-based airport Eppley Airfield — aren’t playing the video because DHS and the Transportation Security Administration have not requested to show the video at the Omaha airport or on its screens or systems, an Eppley Airfield spokesperson said. The airport in Lincoln lacks video monitors in its TSA screening area, so the video can’t be played. 
Omaha and Lincoln join airports in Atlanta, Buffalo, N.Y., Charlotte, Chicago, Las Vegas, New Jersey, Phoenix, Portland, Ore., and Seattle that have confirmed not playing the Noem video. Airport officials in those states point to local policies and state laws restricting politicking in those spaces for the reason, according to NPR. Texas airports are refusing to play the video for similar reasons.
Airports typically run most videos from the Homeland Security head on screens at Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, but these generally relate to safety information and don’t get political.

The video posted by White House shows Noem saying it’s “​​TSA’s top priority to make sure that you have the most pleasant and efficient airport experience as possible while we keep you safe,” but “Democrats in Congress refuse to fund the federal government, and because of this, many of our operations are impacted, and most of our TSA employees are working without pay.”
With the federal government shut down and no end in sight, the Trump administration has used government websites and agencies  — which are supposed to avoid politicking — in a messaging battle over who is to blame for Congress not funding the federal government, for the shutdown. 
For example, websites for the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Department of Housing and Urban Development posted messages blaming the “Radical Left” in Congress. The Trump administration is also inserting language in some automated email responses blaming Democrats for the impasse. 
Democratic senators now allege that the Department of Homeland Security violated the Hatch Act, a 1939 law that prohibits political activities of federal employees to ensure government programs are administered in a nonpartisan fashion, by asking airports to play the video blaming Democrats for the shutdown. It’s unlikely Noem would face any consequences, according to legal experts.

Sign up for Votebeat Michigan’s free newsletter here.
Taxpayers will be on the hook for reprint costs after Dearborn, Michigan, printed and mailed out thousands of ballots that listed an incorrect candidate. But it’s unclear whether paying the bill will be the responsibility of the city or Wayne County.
City officials estimate that Dearborn printed about 10,000 ballots that incorrectly listed Mohammed Shegara as a candidate for City Council even though he dropped out of the race in April. Roughly 9,000 of those went out to voters, City Clerk George Darany told Votebeat.
To reprint and resend corrected ballots cost about $3,600, Darany said. The postage part of that, 21.3 cents per ballot, came out of the city’s account already, but no one has been billed yet for the reprint part, which is about 15 cents a ballot.
Darany said the error involved officials in both the city and county clerk’s offices — the county is responsible for designing the ballot — so the city may ask the county to shoulder part of the cost. County officials, for their part, say the cost should fall squarely on Dearborn.
When his office submitted the lists of candidates to the county in the spring, Darany said, officials noted multiple times that Shegara had dropped out of the race by the city’s deadline.
“Unfortunately, when we received the proof ballot (from the county), his name was still on it,” Darany said. His staff found and pointed out other errors, he said, but “we didn’t notice that person’s name.” (Shegara told the Detroit Free Press that he was confused when he saw his name on the ballot.)
Several people in the Dearborn Clerk’s office review the ballot, including the deputy clerk and the elections supervisor, but Darany is the final signoff.
While Wayne County officials designed the ballot, they said Dearborn should pay for the reprint, particularly as the ballot contains only local races: Dearborn’s mayor is up for reelection, as is Darany. The entire City Council is also on the ballot, alongside a proposal to expand the council and divide the city into wards for council representation.
“In this case, the Dearborn City Clerk and the Dearborn City Election Commission failed to correct the error on the ballot proof prior to approval,” Dorian Tyus, spokesperson for Wayne County Clerk Cathy Garrett, wrote in an email Wednesday.
The city clerk’s office and the city’s election commission “will be responsible for the cost of reprinting the ballots in this case,” Tyus wrote.
Genya Coulter, election systems analyst at the Open Source Election Technology Institute, said such issues with ballots are more common than people realize, particularly in places like Michigan where so many communities run their own elections.
In Owosso last summer, a misplaced decimal point meant a heading in a millage question was different from the question itself. No one caught the error until a few weeks before the election, “despite multiple rounds of proofreading,” City Clerk Amy Kohagen said at the time. (In an interview with Votebeat, she recalled the time years ago when a county ballot had the word “public” misspelled as “pubic.”) Reprints have also been required after candidates were incorrectly left off the ballot or after incorrect color coding meant voters got the wrong ballot for their precinct.
Coulter said Dearborn officials did the right thing after discovering the error by publicizing the problem early and immediately implementing a solution
That quick acknowledgement meant that only a small number of residents — about 5% of absentee voters — had actually returned the incorrect ballots before the problem was noticed, Darany said. Voters should have their new ballots, marked with a bright green sticker, in their hands already.
If voters return both ballots, the original ballot will be spoiled and the correct one will be processed. For voters who return the initial ballot but not the corrected one, poll workers will have to copy their choices onto a corrected ballot and process that one. Only one ballot will ultimately be counted for each voter.
That’s already a familiar procedure for the city, Darany said. Last year, the city had to process about 350 ballots that way because overseas and military voters’ ballots “come back on a form,” and the choices have to be copied onto a ballot for counting, he said.
This year, he expects that even with the error, that number of ballots that need to be copied over will be the same or lower. The city will have extra people on standby to help.
As for the cost, Darany figures the city is still ahead of the game.
“One thing people don’t know is that we were planning at the end of the November to give the City Council a report letting them know how much we saved this year on elections because we did some consolidations, which means fewer workers, fewer tabulators to test and so on,” Darany said. “We were prepared to give the council a letter saying we had saved $27,000 this year amid our effort to make our elections more efficient. Now it just might be $27,000 minus that $3,600.”

North Dakotans wishing to participate in the online forum and ask questions must register for the event through Fedorchak’s website by noon Tuesday.
“While I’m hopeful that by the time we hold this forum, Senate Democrats will have chosen commonsense and voted to reopen the government, it’s important that those affected by the shutdown have the opportunity to get answers and support,” Fedorchak said in a statement.
Her office also provided answers to frequently asked questions about the federal government shutdown and listed resources people can use.
During a recent news conference, Fedorchak said her office was still able to provide constituent services during the shutdown, but issues may not be resolved as quickly.

(Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)Demonstrators will gather in dozens of Colorado cities and towns on Saturday as part of a nationwide No Kings protest in opposition to President Donald Trump’s administration.
It’s expected to be the largest day of anti-Trump demonstrations since June, when an estimated 5 million Americans attended No Kings events held in at least 2,000 cities around the country. The No Kings movement’s organizers include a long list of liberal and progressive groups like Indivisible, MoveOn and the ACLU.
Events are planned in Colorado communities as far-flung as Lamar, Fort Morgan, Steamboat Springs and Cortez, according to a map shared by organizers. They include a protest on the steps of the state Capitol in Denver, scheduled for noon, as well as one planned for 10:30 a.m. on Main Street in the Costilla County town of San Luis, population 628.

Organizers say they’re demonstrating against Trump’s “authoritarian actions and power grabs.” Since taking office in January, Trump has drawn widespread criticism and countless legal challenges to a series of attempted executive actions that run contrary to longstanding separation-of-powers principles in the U.S. Constitution, including the mass firings of federal workers and the freezing or cancellation of congressionally-authorized spending.
Trump has also invoked centuries-old wartime powers to justify an unprecedented immigration crackdown as he seeks to fulfill his promise to deport 12 million people living in the U.S. without permanent legal status. The latest No Kings protests come as Trump has ordered the deployment of National Guard troops to support Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations in the cities of Chicago and Portland, which he has falsely described as “war ravaged” in spite of recent nonviolent anti-ICE protests that have prominently featured inflatable animal costumes and naked bicycle rides.
Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, a Democrat who is running for governor in 2026, is among those who have encouraged Coloradans to demonstrate peacefully at Saturday’s protests. As attorney general, Weiser has sued the Trump administration at least 37 times since January on matters ranging from withheld funding and federal worker layoffs to tariffs and the administration’s attempt to end birthright citizenship.
“Show up at the No Kings rally on Oct. 18 at the Capitol — as many people as possible, and be as peaceful as possible,” Weiser told 9News in an interview last week. “Don’t be afraid to show up, but also, we’ve got to be peaceful.”

(Photo by Christina Lords/Idaho Capital Sun)America was born in protest. In fact, we might never have separated from Great Britain, were it not for a list of grievances written into our Declaration of Independence 249 years ago. The 13 British colonies had had enough of the arbitrary actions of King George III and peaceably advised him so in that treasured document. 
Several years later, with those grievances in mind and in hopes of preventing a recurrence of lawless actions by America’s new government, our ancestors wrote up a Constitution and Bill of Rights. Our First Amendment, guaranteed “the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.” The First Amendment stands out as a principal protection against arbitrary king-like rule.
Why this former Republican is going to a No Kings protest in Idaho

Ever since he took office in January, we have witnessed a growing contempt for the constitutional order, including free-speech rights, by Donald Trump and his MAGA crowd. If wide swaths of Americans object to his arbitrary, unconstitutional orders and actions, he and his minions don’t write it off as Americans exercising their constitutional rights. He sees it as a threat to his royal eminence. Those who protest are labeled as “domestic terrorists, agitators, anarchists” and even worse. 
Many who fear the path Trump is taking toward despotic rule have gathered in communities across the country to hold “No Kings” rallies. The purpose is to speak out against despotic words and unconstitutional action by the Trump regime. I spoke at a rally held on April 5 in Twin Falls by the local chapter of Indivisible. It was a well-attended patriotic rally of good, decent folks spanning the political spectrum.
The No Kings rallies across America on June 14 protested Trump’s lavish military parade in Washington that was timed to celebrate his kingly birth. The protest also called him out for his repeated and deliberate transgressions of the U.S. Constitution. The Indivisible patriots had to step forward because the cowardly GOP members of Congress don’t have the courage to stand up for the Constitution. Idaho’s U.S. House and U.S. Senate members – Sens. Risch and Crapo and Reps. Simpson and Fulcher – know Trump is trampling over the Constitution, but they don’t have the courage to protest, being much more interested in maintaining their political offices. Thank Heaven for the First Amendment. 
Another Indivisible rally is scheduled for 2,200 communities throughout America on Oct. 18, including Boise, Idaho Falls, Hailey, Moscow, Pocatello, and Twin Falls. I’ll be speaking at the one in Twin Falls. Many concerned, civic-minded folks will attend.
Trump’s obedient sycophants, like U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, have condemned those who are concerned by Trump’s march to despotism. Johnson called the upcoming rally a “hate America rally” of the “antifa, pro-Hamas crowd and the Marxists.” 
That’s quite a mix and match of ideologies and dead wrong on all counts.
It is interesting how antifa, an ideology that opposes fascism, always manages to get woven into the MAGA worldview as the root of all evil. It is not an organization and does not hold meetings or carry out sinister actions. Even if it were an actual group, the idea of opposing fascism is not really obnoxious, unless you happen to be a fascist. Mussolini would have tried to stamp them out.
Nevertheless, Donald Trump has had it in for antifa for many years. During his first term, Trump said he would be “designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization” for allegedly inciting violence during Black Lives Matter protests. A June 2020 protest in Spokane sparked a panic in Coeur d’Alene when false rumors spread about an antifa invasion of North Idaho. 
Armed citizens lined the streets to fight off the ideology. Not a single antifan materialized.  As far as anyone knows, Trump has not yet been able to produce a picture of an antifan or antifa gathering, making them as elusive as the Northern Sasquatch.
But, even if antifa were not more than just a way of thinking, why shouldn’t those who hate fascism have the right to think and speak their beliefs under the First Amendment? Trump seems to think they should be rounded up and punished. What could be a more clearcut violation of free speech rights?
The idea that America should not return to rule by a king, be it Trump or some other wannabe monarch, will be revisited on the 250th commemoration of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 2025. I pray that he will not have managed, with his 10,000 more ICE agents funded by the Big Beautiful Billionaires Bill, to impose his vision of a kingship on our beloved democratic republic. 
With the good work of Indivisible and other American patriotic organizations, we might well survive as a free nation.

Cindy Hyde-Smith, said he would largely side with Democratic leaders in the current partisan dispute that has the federal government shut down and has pitted Senate Democrats against President Donald Trump. 
While campaigning in Jackson on Oct. 11 at Jackson State University’s homecoming game, Colom told Mississippi Today that if he were a U.S. senator from Mississippi, he would pressure congressional leaders to reach a deal on health insurance costs alongside an agreement to fund the government. 
At the heart of the government shutdown fight is a dispute over extending expiring subsidies that help people buy health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. Colom said this is “common sense policy” for Mississippi. 
Hyde-Smith, Mississippi’s former agriculture commissioner and a former state senator, has voted with the Republican leadership in favor of funding the government, but punts the issues of the health insurance subsidies.  
She wrote on social media that Democratic senators were putting on a “political show” by not agreeing to pass a bill to fund the government without promised protections for the subsidies. 

If the subsidies are not extended before the end of the year, the cost of insurance will go up on average $480 annually for an estimated 285,000 Mississippians on the federal health exchange, according to KFF, a national nonprofit health care research organization. The premiums would increase significantly for some Mississippians.

Participation in the marketplace by Mississippians has increased 242% in recent years since the enhanced federal assistance program was enacted, according to KFF, and Mississippi has one of the highest percentages of residents who don’t have health insurance. 
Some Republicans argue that Congress should debate the subsidies once the government is funded, but most Democratic senators have said they should act urgently to extend them because they will expire in the coming months. 
Colom, like most of the current Democratic senators, said the deal on funding the government should happen concurrently with an agreement over the subsidies because less affluent Mississippians would suffer without the extra government assistance.
“It has to be at the same time,” Colom said. “We have to do it at the same time.” 
Colom, the current district attorney in the Golden Triangle area, also criticized Hyde-Smith for not using her close relationship with Trump to negotiate a deal on the subsidies or the shutdown.

“Why do we have a senator who is constantly giving away her voice?” Colom said of Hyde-Smith. “Why isn’t she in the negotiating room?” 

“Democrats have repeatedly refused a clean, bipartisan bill to reopen the government,” Hyde-Smith said. “Everyday Americans are beginning to feel the pain, and it will only get worse as this unnecessary Democratic shutdown continues. This did not have to happen.” 
The U.S. government shut down on Oct. 1, and federal lawmakers have been unable to reach an agreement for three weeks now on how to fund and reopen it.

There are almost 1.1 million licensed physicians in the United States. That may sound like a lot, but the country has struggled for decades to train enough physicians to meet its needs – and, in particular, to provide care in rural and underserved communities.
Foreign-born physicians have long filled that gap, reducing the overall national shortage and signing up to practice in often overlooked regions and specialties. Today, 1 in 5 doctors licensed to practice in the U.S. were born and trained in another country.
But the ability of physicians from other countries to obtain work in the U.S. may be threatened by the Trump administration’s aims of limiting foreign workers. In September, Trump issued a proclamation requiring employers sponsoring foreign-born workers through a type of work visa called an H-1B to pay a fee of US$100,000 to the government. The White House has signaled doctors may be exempt but has not clarified its position.
As a physician and professor who studies the intersection of business and medicine, I believe increasing restrictions on H-1B visas for physicians may exacerbate the physician shortage. To grasp why that is, it’s important to understand how foreign-trained doctors became such an integral part of U.S. health care – and the role they play today.
 
The roots of today’s physician shortage

	The Association of American Medical Colleges, a trade association representing U.S. medical schools, estimates there will be a deficit of about 86,000 physicians in the country by 2036.
The roots of this shortage stretch back more than a century. In 1910, a landmark study called the Flexner Report detailed significant inconsistencies in the quality of education at American medical schools. The report resulted in the closure of over half the country’s medical schools, winnowing their numbers down from 148 to 66 over two decades.
As a result, the number of doctors in the U.S. declined until new training programs emerged. Between 1960 and 1980, 40 new medical schools launched with the help of federal funding. In 1980, a congressionally mandated assessment deemed the problem solved, but by the early 2000s, a physician shortage emerged once more. In 2006, the American Association of Medical Colleges called for raising medical school enrollment by 30%.
Growth in medical school enrollment hit that target in the late 2010s, but even so, the U.S. still lacks enough medical graduates to fill yearslong training programs, called residencies, that early-career physicians must complete to become fully qualified to practice.
Especially lacking are primary care physicians – particularly in rural areas, where there are one-third as many physicians per capita as in urban areas.
 
Opportunities for foreign-born doctors

	Even as the U.S. built up medical school enrollment in the 1960s and 1970s, the government joined other countries such as the U.K. and Canada in creating immigration policies that drew physicians from developing countries to practice in underserved areas. Between 1970 and 1980, their numbers grew sharply, from 57,000 to 97,000.
Foreign-born and -trained physicians have remained a key pillar of the U.S. medical system. In recent years, the majority of those physicians have come from India and Pakistan. Citizens of Canada and Middle Eastern countries have added significantly to that count, as well. Most arrive in the U.S. as trainees in residency programs through one of two main visa programs.
The majority come on J-1 visas, which allow physicians to enter the U.S. for training but require them to return to their home country for at least two years when their training is complete. Those who wish to remain in the U.S. to practice must transition to an H-1B visa.
A small percentage of physicians come to the U.S. on H-1Bs from the start.
H-1B visas are employer-sponsored temporary work permits that allow foreign-born, highly skilled workers to obtain U.S. employment. Employers directly petition the government on behalf of visa applicants, certifying that a foreign worker will be paid a similar wage to U.S. workers and will not adversely affect the working conditions of Americans.
Several programs sponsor H-1B visas for physicians, though the most common requires a three-year commitment to work in an underserved area after completing their training.
 
Foreign physicians fill a crucial need

	In 2025, foreign-trained medical graduates filled 9,700 of the nearly 40,000 training positions. Of those, roughly one-third were actually U.S. citizens who attended medical schools in other countries, with the remainder being foreign citizens seeking more training in the U.S.
After residency, these doctors frequently practice in precisely the geographic areas where the physician shortage is most severe. A nationwide survey of international medical graduates found that two-thirds practice in regions that the federal government has designated as lacking sufficient access to health care.
These doctors also occupy a disproportionate number of primary care positions. In a sample of 15,000 physicians who accepted new jobs in one year, foreign-born doctors were nine times more likely to enter primary care specialties. In 2025, 33.3% of internal medicine, 20.4% of pediatric and 17.6% of family medicine training positions were filled by physicians trained in other countries.
 
Who will pay?
Approximately 8,000 foreign-born physicians received H-1B visas in 2024. The new requirement of a $100,000 sponsorship fee would hit hardest for hospitals, health systems and clinics in areas of the country most significantly affected by the physician shortage.
These organizations are already under economic strain due to increasing labor costs and Medicare payments that have not kept pace with inflation. Dozens of these hospitals have closed in recent years, and many currently do not make enough money to support their operations.
On Sept. 25, 2025, 57 physician organizations cosigned a letter petitioning Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to waive the new application fee for physicians.
Already, however, the new rule may be having a chilling effect. Despite years of annual growth in the number of foreign-born applicants to U.S. physician training programs, 2025 has seen a nearly 10% drop. If the new H-1B fee is applied to physicians, the number is likely to keep falling.

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)Five years ago, on the second floor of Teachers College Hall at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, my wife and I took turns rocking our 1-year-old son while we pored over our laptops. My doctoral studies in the Department of Educational Administration were in full swing.
Amid the chaos of dissertation drafts and grant proposals, Educational Administration faculty didn’t just teach — they became family. Without them, I wouldn’t have had the support to graduate and become a professor of educational leadership at North Dakota State University.
Yet Nebraska’s Educational Administration department — the only Ph.D.-granting educational leadership program in the state — faces dire cuts that would hurt not just Ph.D. students, but also schools and students throughout the state.
On Sept. 12, University of Nebraska-Lincoln Chancellor Rodney Bennett announced a $27.5 million budget cut to address a $21 million deficit, plus $6.5 million in proactive cuts. This proposal would eliminate the Educational Administration Department entirely, resulting in the loss of 17 faculty and staff positions and the termination of key doctoral programs, including the Ph.D./Ed.D. in educational studies and the Ed.D. in educational administration.
Cutting the department accounts for $1.95 million of those savings. But it would come at a great cost. The department serves over 300 graduate students each year, delivering thousands of credit hours of instruction last academic year alone. It has strong retention and completion rates that outpace broader higher ed trends. These hours net the university $383 per credit hour from in-state students — a sizable contribution to UNL, in addition to grants that faculty obtain.
Alums like me — a lifelong Husker and four-time alum — fan out across Nebraska and beyond. Many serve in leadership roles for their school districts as principals and superintendents. Others pursue careers in higher education as faculty, impacting policy and research.
One such person, a close friend and recent graduate of the program, is a rural principal in Nebraska. When we talked about the department being closed, he explained that the biggest issue he saw would be the lack of understanding of the importance of research in driving practice in schools. Many school practices rely on experience rather than new ideas. Strong research programs help schools use more innovative approaches that better prepare students for careers.
Zoom out, and the ripple effects worsen. The U.S. faces a dire shortage of school leaders. Qualified principals can boost student achievement by up to 25%, reduce teacher turnover in high-need areas and champion policies that break down barriers for students to ensure everyone can succeed.
In Nebraska’s rural areas, where districts already struggle to attract talent, the Educational Administration Department has been a homegrown solution, producing leaders who understand Cornhusker State realities from small school mergers to choice in curricula. Without the department, students will lose out on leaders who learned how to make difficult choices and enhance the lives of students and teachers.
To be clear, budgets often involve difficult decisions. Over the past five years, UNL has already trimmed $75 million from its budget amid stagnant state funding and enrollment pressures. But targeting the Educational Administration Department is a quick fix that will backfire. Its metrics, vibrant enrollment and high-impact research demonstrate its value to taxpayers and the community.
Rather than cut the department, the budget committee might explore other alternatives in the plan, such as using some of the projected $17.25 million saved from administrative reorganizations and voluntary resignations to maintain the Educational Administration Department, leaving a surplus of $15.35 million.
Nebraska deserves the opportunity for every aspiring educator to enroll in a program that has high standards and high involvement. If the goal is to increase tuition revenue and state appropriations, cutting a department as pivotal as this one won’t work.
Even the threat of eliminating the department is detrimental to future success, as future students are significantly less likely to enroll in a program they believe might be eliminated.
Moreover, as a land-grant, flagship university, UNL’s mandate is to enhance Nebraska’s public good, with a focus on education at the forefront. Seen in that light, maintaining the Educational Administration Department is mission-critical.
Erasing the department that trains leaders and educators sends the wrong message: When times get tight, we turn our backs on the very systems that help hold our communities together.

(Photo provided by the Alaska National Guard)After the latest catastrophic storm hit Western Alaska, displacing more than 1,500 people, killing at least one and leaving villages in ruins, residents face an existential crisis. 
Will the wide delta that fans out between the lower Yukon and Kuskokwim Rivers and has supported one of the circumpolar north’s largest Indigenous populations for millennia continue to be a place where Alaska’s Yupik people can live?
One elder has his doubts.
“We’re not going to be well. Storms are going to get worse, and it’s not going to be livable,” said Mike Williams Sr., a tribal leader from the Kuskokwim River village of Akiak. “We’re past the tipping point, maybe.”
Fairbanks-based scientist Torre Jorgenson, who has studied the region for decades, has doubts as well.
Intertwined climate change forces make long-term prospects grim in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, according to a wide-ranging scientific study he led. The study was published in mid-August, just two months before the remnants of Typhoon Halong hit on Oct. 12. 
Coastal erosion, permafrost thaw, sea-level rise, intrusion of saltwater into freshwater systems – are combining with storm surges to dramatically transform the coastal area, damaging communities and the food resources that have sustained Yup’ik people for centuries, the study said.
Of the 18 villages on the outer coastal area of the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, at least 10 will likely have to be relocated, said Jorgenson, who is affiliated with the University of Alaska Fairbanks while operating an independent science consulting company.
The at-risk villages sit atop permafrost that, when intact, is a platform a meter or two above the region’s salt marshes, Jorgenson said. That permafrost is no longer intact, and it will likely disappear in the next two to three decades, he said.
“So the ground is going down, and the water is coming up, and they’ll be unlivable,” he said
If those villages move, they will follow the lead of Newtok. The village of about 350 escaped erosion and flooding by moving farther inland to a site called Mertarvik, but the effort took decades and is still challenged by infrastructure problems.
Williams, of Akiak, said it is not easy for coastal villages to find suitable relocation spots. “Even though they head toward higher ground, there’s a lot of wind in the higher ground,” he said.

	But some residents of Kipnuk and Kwigillingok are determined to stay and rebuild, and others who evacuated to return. 
“We will go back, because it’s our home,” said Missy Chuckwuk of Kipnuk, waiting in line to board an evacuation flight in Bethel on Wednesday, with her husband and their three children. Once freeze-up hits, the community will begin to move homes back that floated away, she said.
An estimated 50 to 100 people stayed and did not evacuate from Kipnuk, according to a representative with the Alaska National Guard, and 200 to 300 people in Kwigillingok. 
Jorgenson said necessary action in the most at-risk villages will be expensive.
“They can do kind of short-term adaptation, but over the period of decades, they are going to be looking at having to relocate, and there’s going to be a huge, enormous cost to that,” he said. Newtok’s relocation cost hundreds of millions of dollars, he noted. “And if you’re looking at 10 or more villages that have to move, who’s going to come up with the money for that?”
Combined climate change forces amplify each other
For the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, the connected climate change forces include sea ice retreat. It erases the frozen barrier that prevented waves from reaching shore during late-fall and winter storms. By the end of the century, Jorgenson said, the ice-free season in the Bering Sea will last approximately 8.5 months, with ice forming two months later in the fall and melting a month earlier in the spring, he said.
Bering Sea residents already got a taste of the future in 2018, he said, when winter ice was scarcer than at any time in the past 150 years of records.
Storm surges and floods enhance permafrost thaw, Jorgenson said. Saltwater pushed ashore kills tundra plants that make up an insulating mat, thus allowing more heat to penetrate the surface and thaw yet more permafrost.
Beyond damaging homes and villages, the changes hurt people’s ability to gather wild food in their traditional ways, Jorgensen said.
Earlier sea ice melt exposes coastal regions to more flooding in the critical spring nesting season time for migratory birds that are residents’ sources of eggs and meat, Jorgenson said. Saltwater intrusion is changing habitat for migrating birds that use the region, which is a major nesting and breeding site for several species. Saltwater intrusion also contaminates drinking water supplies. Permafrost thaw undermines the once-stable areas that have been long used for traditional hunting camps and that have produced wild food, he said.

	“These permafrost plateaus are really very rich areas,” he said. “Those have been really important berry picking areas, and those are going to disappear pretty soon.”
The origins of this fall’s storm, like Merbok three years ago, lie far to the west, in the North Pacific Ocean. There, water has become hotter; a new marine heatwave is currently underway. The ocean heat amplifies seasonal storms that reach Alaska, like Typhoon Halong and the Typhoon Merbok, which sent destructive floods and high winds across the region in 2022.
While Merbok formed in a part of the ocean that is normally too cool to produce typhoons and Halong formed in a more standard ocean spot, both storms picked up intensity from unusual North Pacific heat, said Rick Thoman, a scientist with the Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Preparedness at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.
“Passing over near or at-record warm sea surface temperatures outside of the tropics, that’s something that both of those storms have in common,” Thoman said.
Such ocean heat will not always be present, but it is likely to be more frequent, he said. “The trend is going only one way,” he said.
People of the Yukon-Kuskokwim recognize the trend.
Alaska Federation of Natives co-chair Ana Hoffman, in her opening address at the organization’s annual convention on Thursday, spoke directly to her fellow Yup’ik people about it, hundreds of whom had been evacuated by then to Anchorage.
“You were at the forefront of this recent storm and endured what is now becoming a new reality here: typhoons in the Arctic,” she said.
Climate change threats in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta and other parts of rural Alaska have long been recognized by state and federal government agencies and by state and regional organizations like the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium and the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta Subsistence Regional Advisory Council.
Wiliams said there have been warnings for several decades. Speaking during a break Tuesday in this week’s Elders and Youth Conference in Anchorage, he said he remembers listening to elders talk 50 years ago about the big changes to come.
“They said, ‘The weather is going to be changing, and we’re going to have more frequent storms, and it’s going to get warmer,’” he said,

	Those predictions come true, Williams said.
“We used to have seven feet of ice on the river; now it’s three feet. And the permafrost is going away pretty fast. Tundra communities are sinking,” he said.
State Sen. Lyman Hoffman, who has represented Western Alaska for four decades, attested to similar observations.
“There has been more and more warming that is disrupting lives in the Y-K Delta,” the Bethel Democrat said at a Monday news conference held by Gov. Mike Dunleavy.
Alaska House Speaker Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham, said the latest storm should be seen as a call to action.
“We know this is not going to be, unfortunately, the last typhoon,” Edgmon said in his address Friday at the Alaska Federation of Natives Conference. “We need to be very conscious about living in a  state with a changing climate.” That is necessary for “a future that doesn’t involve waking up in the middle of the night and having water come up from your floor and 100-mile-an-hour winds and your house floating off somewhere,” he said.
Trump administration cuts
The Trump administration, however, does not share that perspective.
The administration canceled previously awarded grants intended to prevent damages in rural Alaska from disasters that have been exacerbated by climate change – including a $20 million grant for coastal erosion control in Kipnuk, a village of about 700 that was one of the communities hardest hit by ex-typhoon Halong.
The Kipnuk grant was among several awarded during the Biden administration to rural Alaska communities under the Environmental Protection Agency’s Community Change Grant Program. The grants were for work like permafrost and shoreline protection, renewable energy development and permafrost protection.
Trump administration officials characterized those projects as unnecessary projects. In a post on the social media site X, EPA Administrator Lee Zelden called them “wasteful DEI and Environmental Justice grants.”
EPA officials defended the cut.
“The ‘environmental justice’ funding cancelled by EPA would not have prevented or safeguarded the community from the mass destruction and tragedy caused by such a large and devastating typhoon,” Brigit Hirsch, the agency’s press secretary, said by email on Friday.

	Administration cuts to the National Weather Service, part of broader cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, likely had an effect on the weather forecast and interfered with  preparations for ex-Typhoon Halong’s impacts in Alaska.
Thoman said predictions for Halong’s path into Alaska, made after Trump administration cuts forced reductions in rural Alaska weather staff and monitoring, were not as accurate as those for Merbok in 2022. Atmospheric observations from weather balloons have been cut in Kotzebue, Bethel, St. Paul and Cold Bay, and technical problems prevented the normal launches in Nome, he noted. “It’s almost inconceivable that that lack of upper-air observations had no effect,” he said.
The Government Accounting Office has already identified National Weather Service cuts as a problem. The shortage of meteorologists has created a need for “urgent action” to protect aviation safety, said a GAO report issued on Aug. 28.
Also axed by the Trump administration was a Federal Emergency Management Agency program aimed at preventing disaster damage; a statement from the agency called Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program “wasteful and ineffective,” even though earlier analysis found it saved $6 in response cost for every $1 in preparation spending.
Overall, Trump administration cuts to FEMA have undermined the agency’s ability to respond to disasters that are increasing in frequency, according to a Sept. 2 GAO report. FEMA has lost about a tenth of its staff, compromising its capabilities, and there are similar concerns about disaster responses at the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers, the GAO said.
In the short term, Alaska Native organizations were waiting this week for FEMA assistance. Resolutions passed by the Association of Village Council Presidents, a group of Yup’ik tribal governments, and the Yukon Kuskokwim Health Corp., the largest tribal health provider for the region, and other groups have requested a presidential disaster declaration and the aid that comes with it.
Gov. Dunleavy on Thursday sent a formal request for a presidential declaration, not just for the Yukon-Kuskokwim area but also for northwestern Alaska, which was lashed days earlier by remnants of the typhoon.
As of Friday, the disaster response was being led by the state, according to a FEMA statement. But opportunities for immediate action beyond evacuations and temporary shelter were limited.
“There is very little time to do anything, like even dry stuff out at this point,” Thoman said. “Winter is nigh.”

Dan Sullivan during his address on Friday to the Alaska Federation of Natives.
Several demonstrators stood and turned their backs to the senator as he spoke, and some held signs reading “Medicaid matters” and “Public radio saves lives.”

Sullivan did not acknowledge the protesters or stop speaking during a roughly half hour of remarks to the ballroom of attendees. The three-day conference in Anchorage is the largest representative gathering of Native peoples in the state, drawing roughly 6,000 people each year. 
Protesters stood on behalf of a variety of issues. Some were residents of the community of Ambler, some advocates and supporters, all opposing the proposed Ambler Road, a 211-mile road to a mining district, recently advanced by the Trump administration with the support of Sullivan.
“Crossing hundreds of streams, it will affect everything,” said Teresa Clarke, executive director of the Yukon River Inter-tribal Watershed Council, a coalition representing 74 tribes and First Nations from Canada, opposing the proposed development, saying it risks environmental degradation.
“We’re already affected by extreme weather events, as we’ve realized this past week, and those types of events will probably speed up more extreme events and then degradation, melting of more permafrost, it will affect the animals, and everything,” she said, referring to severe storms that have devastated coastal communities.

Following the event, Amanda Coynce, a spokesperson for Sullivan, responded to the protest repeating the senators positions on Medicaid and public radio, and saying “Senator Sullivan welcomes respectful debate. He listens to all Alaskans on Ambler.”
Aubrey Weber, executive director of the non-profit advocacy group 907 Initiative, criticized Sullivan’s refusal to hold public events or town halls this year after his support of the Trump administration. 
“​​Well, this is the only public event he’s done all year, and the public has been routinely, repeatedly asking him to show up and hear from constituents,” Weber said. “And he’s pretty quick to go to a private event with donors, you know, something that’s maybe $500 a plate, but he’s not coming and talking to Alaskans. And so this is one of the very few opportunities that we had to voice our opinions.”
Weber was among those who stood to protest Sullivan’s support of the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” the Trump administration’s landmark legislation advancing the conservative blueprint for government known as Project 2025 that passed this summer. It included tax cuts as well as cuts to social services like Medicaid and funding for public media.

“The simple fact of the matter, standing up here and saying nobody’s getting cut from Medicaid is a lie, because you cannot take a trillion dollars from the federal Medicaid budget, give those to millionaires and billionaires in the form of tax cuts and then open up this $50 billion rural health care fund. You know, one of those numbers is much bigger than the other,” he said.
Weber said the proposed cuts to Medicaid — and health insurance premium tax credits being bitterly debated during the federal government shutdown — will hurt Alaskans and the health care system, and he urged the senator to support funding and re-opening the federal government.
“Listen to Alaskans. Do what’s right for Alaskans,” he said. “Stop being a yes man for party bosses and stand up for your constituents.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSCF8622-scaled-e1760759733717-1024x619.jpg,,,2025-10-17 23:57:00.995874

(Photo by Josh Kurtz/Maryland Matters)The U.S. Department of Transportation showed an alarming disregard for the nation’s security a few weeks ago by clawing back a $47.3 million grant intended to launch a new era of steel production at Sparrows Point.
Members of our union, the United Steelworkers (USW), are profoundly disappointed by the Trump administration’s abandonment of a project primed to create jobs, boost manufacturing capacity and meet our country’s growing energy needs.
But it’s important to emphasize that the government’s turnabout represents only a setback, not the end of this forward-looking initiative.
The USW and our partner, US Wind, remain committed to bringing steel back to Baltimore and injecting new life into Sparrows Point. We’re confident that this site, once the home of the largest steel mill in the world, has yet another pivotal role to play in America’s future.
The USW and US Wind joined forces about four years ago. We intend to use a portion of the mill property to build monopiles — the huge foundations sunk into the seabed to support wind turbines — through a new company called Sparrows Point Steel.

Over the full scope of US Wind’s offshore projects, the company will consume more than 330,000 metric tons of steel plate, a huge boon to the steel industry. This is directly in line with the Trump administration’s stated goal of building more in America — and makes the administration’s cancellation of the grant all the more puzzling.
Current projections call for Sparrows Point Steel to employ more than 500 USW members in production, maintenance and a variety of other roles. We’re talking about good-paying, middle-class jobs that enable workers to support their families and lift up the entire community.
Our commitment to building out the wind energy supply chain means sourcing not only our steel plate but many other kinds of materials and supplies from domestic producers. In all, workers from nearly 50 companies across Maryland will benefit from vendor relationships with Sparrows Point Steel.
On top of that, US Wind intends to establish an operations and maintenance center at the harbor in West Ocean City. This facility will coordinate turbine and substation maintenance for offshore wind developments, creating still more jobs in the manufacturing, maritime and energy sectors.
But there’s more. While catalyzing the economy, the Sparrows Point project simultaneously strengthens our national security.
Our work will help to position America as the leader in a global, evolving industry. It will also help to deliver a more reliable energy supply at a time of growing demand and more frequent disruptions in the power grid resulting from climate change.
Marylanders get this.
A recent poll found that seven out of 10 respondents support the construction of wind projects off the Maryland coast because of their potential to stabilize energy prices, enhance the nation’s energy supply and reduce pollution.
The respondents’ support cut across political lines, underscoring the high stakes. What’s more, 81% opposed the reversal of offshore wind projects already underway out of concern for job losses, according to the survey, conducted by Turn Forward, a nonprofit supporting wind energy.
Sparrows Point is hallowed ground for the USW.
At one time, tens of thousands of union members worked here, producing the steel that built the middle class, fueled prosperity and made America a superpower.
We now have an opportunity to build on that legacy — to harness manufacturing and energy for a stronger future.
With or without federal support, USW members will do what we always do. Alongside our partners at US Wind, we’ll get the job done.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/20210803_104844-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-18 05:56:22.755405

(File photo by Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters)Maryland will not be able to enforce part of a 2021 law that allowed it to obscure the costs of a digital ad tax from consumers who were paying it.
The order — which will not be appealed by the state — strikes down one portion of the first-of-its-kind tax on digital advertising within the state. That provision prohibited online companies from alerting consumers to the tax, by passing it on to them as a surcharge, fee or line item on their bills.
Opponents of the law had said that it required them to collect the tax but prohibited them from telling customers where the tax came from — shielding lawmakers who approved the tax from criticism, and violating the businesses’ free speech rights, they said.
U.S. District Court Judge Lydia Kay Griggsby, in a one-page order Wednesday, issued a declaratory judgement in favor of the tech industry that had sued to block the tax, saying the targeted provision of the law “facially violates the First Amendment.”
Griggsby permanently barred the state from enforcing that provision, but left the digital advertising tax in place, for now.
Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore), a sponsor of the 2021 bill, did not respond to a request for comment Friday. A spokesperson for the Office of the Comptroller said the office has Griggsby’s final order under review.
Appeals court rules provision of digital ad tax violates First Amendment protections

The case is just one of several challenges brought by NetChoice, a trade group representing large technology and social media companies, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Computer & Communications Industry Association (CCIA).
A challenge to the tax itself remains open in Maryland Tax Court. The case was filed by big tech firms, including Apple and Meta. The state has collected nearly $419 million from the tax since 2022, according to the Office of the Comptroller.
An official with the NetChoice Litigation Center called Griggsby’s order “a victory for free speech, political discourse and internet freedom.”
“The Fourth Circuit was clear: states cannot shield themselves from criticism by preventing companies from highlighting the consequences of a new policy,” Paul Taske, co-director of the NetChoice Litigation Center, said in a statement.
“Businesses will finally be able to see that Maryland’s policies are directly impacting their bottom line. And Maryland will have to reckon with that,” Taske said.
Griggsby’s order comes two months after a three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the provision violated the First Amendment. The panel sent the case back to Griggsby, who in 2024 had sided with the plaintiffs — a group of tech firms and business associations — that the law created some First Amendment issues. Even so, she allowed the law to stand because the offending provision had “many constitutional applications.”
The 2021 law targets big tech firms including Apple, Meta, and Google.
Under the law, companies reporting gross global annual revenue of at least $100 million are subject to a 2.5% levy. The tax increases in increments of 2.5% to a maximum rate of 10% levied against companies reporting more than $15 billion in gross global revenue.
The state could collect as much as $250 million annually from the digital ad tax, according to a legislative analysis. The funds are earmarked for the state’s education reform program.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The sharply worded July ruling invoked American protests against the Colonial-era Stamp Act. Circuit Judge Julius Richardson, in that ruling, wrote “complaining about taxes remains a grand American political tradition.”
The questioned provision in the tax bill was intended to shield lawmakers from public criticism. The provision went too far, Richardson wrote.
“Perhaps fearing such complaints, Maryland paired its tax with another rule,” Richardson wrote for the court. “Companies that make money advertising on the internet must not only pay the tax, but avoid telling their customers how it affects pricing: No line items, no surcharges, no fees.”
The court’s ruling noted that elected officials might have a reason for such a provision, but “keeping out of hot water with voters” cannot be a justification.
“If companies pass on the cost of the tax, they must do so in silence — keeping customers in the dark about why prices have gone up and thereby insulating Maryland from political responsibility,” he wrote.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Greenbelt-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-18 04:56:41.237867

(File photo by Sam Gauntt/Maryland Matters)The University System of Maryland Board of Regents held a special, closed-door meeting Friday afternoon to review “an athletics-related contract under consideration,” an apparent reference to a $2 billion offer to buy a stake in the Big Ten athletic conference.
The board immediately went into a closed session to discuss “confidential commercial and financial information” with its attorneys, according to the board agenda. It met for about an hour before leaving without taking any public action.
The 4 p.m. meting was called on short notice.
“The board has been informed that the Big Ten Conference member institutions, which include the University of Maryland, will be voting in the next few days on a proposal that may have board implications,” Board Chair Linda Gooden said a few minutes before the closed session. “Given the short notice, we have requested to meet and seek legal advice and legal counsel on the board’s role and authority regarding this matter.”
The board is responsible for overseeing academic and financial operations and crafting policy for the 12 institutions and three regional higher education centers in the university system. That includes the College Park campus, the state’s flagship institution.
According to published reports, officials at the Big Ten Conference are negotiating a more than $2 billion deal with UC Investments, which manages the University of California Pension System investment fund, for a 10% stake in the conference over the next 20 years. The conference’s athletic departments would each get a share of the money from UC Investments, which would get 10% of conference revenues in return.
Universities told they should brace for the coming year’s 7% budget cut

Money generated would include sponsorships, media rights and league revenue streams for the 18 schools in the conference, which stretches from Maryland and Rutgers on the East Coast to the University of Southern California, the University of California Los Angeles and the University of Washington on the West Coast, with traditional heartland rivals in between.
But not everyone is on board with the idea.
U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) sent a letter to the conference’s school presidents, including an Oct. 10 letter to University of Maryland, College Park, President Darryll J. Pines, warning that a deal with a private investor may require the sale of university assets and affect the schools’  tax-exempt statuses.
“The primary goal of these companies is to make money for the firm, which is unlikely to align with the academic goals of your university or its obligations as a not-for-profit organization,” Cantwell wrote. “These investors will be focused on maximizing their investment, not on preserving and growing athletic and academic opportunities for student athletes.”
A spokesperson with the College Park campus said in an email Friday evening the school would need more time to comment on the negotiations.
Higher education officials from at least one state, the Michigan Board of Regents, reject the idea of a private equity firm dippinng not in college sports, according to the Detroit Free Press.
On that same day that  Michigan officials discussed the proposal Thursday, the Big Ten Conference released a statement on behalf of the league’s presidents and chancellors defending the negotiations.
“Over a year ago, we instructed the conference to undertake a comprehensive process, alongside our members, to innovate for the future and extend the conference’s legacy of academic and athletic excellence,” according to the statement. “The Big Ten remains committed to modernizing the operations of our conference, strengthening conference stability, preserving Olympic and women’s sports, and enhancing the student-athlete experience.”
The statement noted that UC Investments would be “a non-profit partner – not private equity.”
“Ultimately, it is the decision of the Big Ten member institutions’ presidents and chancellors to decide if it’s the right opportunity and those conversations are ongoing,” the statement said.

Wes Moore speaks at a federal government shutdown resource fair in Howard County on Friday. (Photo by Nicole Pilsbury/Maryland Matters)On day 17 of the government shutdown, furloughed Defense Department contractor Glenda Lassiter found herself at a federal government shutdown resource fair in Howard County, looking through loan and insurance information offered to affected federal workers.
“I am here in the event that I do need it [resources] — hopefully I don’t,” she said. “I extend prayers to those that do.”
Lassiter is among the 200,000 federal contractors and 260,000 federal workers in Maryland who are facing the burdens and the uncertainty of a government shutdown. Most workers were sent home after Congress could not agree on a budget by Oct. 1, when fiscal year 2026 started, while others have to continue showing up for work, but aren’t getting paid.
State and local governments have been offering services and resources to help residents affected by the shutdown, including Gov. Wes Moore’s announcement Friday that the Maryland Transit Administration would offer federal workers free rides on commuter buses and MARC trtains for the duration of the shutdown.
“You are not going to have to worry about your transportation because this [Trump] administration can’t figure it out,” said Moore, who visited tables at the fair and talked to workers.

The state had previously offered protections on housing and utilities, such as gas and electric, for furloughed workers, and Moore said Friday that utility companies are “holding to their pledge” of pausing shutoffs for federal workers during the shutdown.
The resource fair had tables with unemployment insurance and loan information from both the state and from banks like Truist and Fulton. Resume reviews and critique stations were offered to support workers looking for new jobs.
Health care assistance was present through United Healthcare and Blue Cross Blue Shield, stationed next to tables for Maryland agencies like the Department of Human Services, the Department of Veterans and Military Families and the Department of Labor.
“You see so many people working here because they are afraid of how they’re going to put food on their tables, how they’re going to keep a roof over their heads, how they’re going to care for their families,” Howard County Executive Calvin Ball said at the fair.
Ball assured the community that Maryland officials will continue to “fight for what’s right” among the challenges and negativity during the shutdown.
The governor said more than 2,000 people have applied for unemployment insurance because of the shutdown, and more than 1,000 have applied to the Federal Shutdown Loan Program, a $700 no-interest loan for excepted federal workers — those who work without pay during the shutdown.
Moore and Rep. Sarah Elfreth (D-3rd) called on Congress to end the shutdown, with Moore saying he wants Washington to “see what we’re seeing and the real pain that it is causing.”
The House passed a stopgap budget in September to keep the government open until Nov. 21, while fuller budget discussions continued. But the bill stalled in the Senate, were Democrats are pushing their own bill that would retain subsidies for health insurance coverage that are set to expire at the end of the year — which could cause millions to lose health care, the Democrats argue.
Since then, neither side in the Senate has budged.
Elfreth said she is pushing for the government to come to an agreement that reopens the government and “does not risk health care for tens of millions of Americans.” She emphasized the importance of restoring citizen’s faith in government institutions and the idea that Congress is able to make progress.
“I have been … demanding that Democrats and Republicans do something radical, which is actually sit down at the table and come up with a bipartisan budget deal,” she said.

It was announced Friday that Otto had died at age 61. No cause of death has been given.
Otto, who represented parts of Somerset, Wicomico and Worcester counties since he was first sworn in to the House of Delegates in 2011, had just filed for reelection to a fifth term on Tuesday, said Del. Jay Jacobs (R-Upper Shore).

Jacobs said he and Otto were “almost inseparable” in the General Assembly, both starting in the House in 2011 and representing parts of the Eastern Shore. The two were put on the same committee, Environment and Transportation, shared office space and worked on various agricultural issues during the last 14 years, Jacobs said.
“Everyone liked him, he was a likeable guy,” Jacobs said. “He had always had a good sense of humor. Never saw him get angry about anything – unless it had something to do with his district.”
Jacobs admitted that he and Otto were some of the more reserved members on the House floor, but spoke up in matters that were important to them and the Eastern Shore.
“We were quiet … If we stood up, which we did occasionally, I can tell you people paid attention because we didn’t do it very often,” Jacobs said. “If we did, you knew it was serious.”
House Republicans said in a joint statement that they were “devastated by the loss” of Otto.
“He was, in many ways, the heart of our Caucus,” the statement said. “A rarity in politics, Delegate Otto was never someone who was in love with his own voice. But when he spoke, he did so with heartfelt wisdom, and members listened, no matter their political party. He was unceasingly generous and hilariously funny.”
Senate Republicans called him a “steadfast voice for Maryland’s farmers, rural communities and small businesses.”
“Charles brought common sense and integrity to every discussion in Annapolis,” Senate Republicans said in a statement. “He worked across party lines to ensure that rural Maryland’s needs were heard and respected, and his leadership and friendship will be greatly missed by all who had the privilege to serve alongside him.”
Otto was born in Salisbury on Feb. 15, 1964. He attended University of Maryland Eastern Shore and graduated from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University with a degree in animal Science in 1986.
He was a field representative for the Maryland Farm Bureau from 1987 through 1995 and continued other agricultural work throughout the years.
“As a farmer himself, he was firmly rooted in the agricultural community and faithfully served his lower shore constituents in the House of Delegates since 2011,” the Maryland Farm Bureau said in a statement Friday. “Delegate Otto was a steadfast champion for Maryland agriculture and will be sorely missed by his friends and colleagues throughout the state.”

He was elected to the House of Delegates in 2010, where he continued to push for agricultural issues on the Environment and Transportation committee, as well as various subcommittees.
“He served the Maryland House of Delegates with integrity and an unwavering dedication to the people of District 38A,” House Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County) said in a statement posted to social media. “I extend our heartfelt condolences to his family, loved ones, constituents, and staff. He will be sorely missed by all.”
Otto’s legislative seat will be filled by appointment: The three county Republican central committees in his district will meet to select a nominee, whose name will be forwarded to the governor, who makes the final decision.
In a statement, Gov. Wes Moore (D) said that Otto had “a fidelity to our state that could never waver, and a commitment to our people that could never fade.”
“This was a man who loved Maryland to his core,” Gov. Wes Moore (D) said in a statement, “fighting every day for his constituents and moving in good faith with partners in the General Assembly to deliver results.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/IMG_2060-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-17 23:02:05.418921

John Curtis believes his colleagues are not too far apart to approve his bipartisan-backed plan changing up wildfire management. 
“I think the odds are very, very high,” Curtis, a Republican, told reporters Friday when asked about the chances of the fire proposal reaching final passage.
The bill was a focus of Curtis’ annual Conservative Climate Summit. The Friday event came just three weeks after President Donald Trump called climate change a “con job” at the United Nations and as the administration plans to keep coal-fired power plants running to meet energy demands.

Curtis said he does not agree with the “demonization of fossil fuels” and believes the nation’s energy demands require multiple types of generation. 
Asked about the cancellation of $7.5 billion in clean energy projects, Curtis said, “I have concerns.”  
He said he’s not familiar with each project, “but I’ll come back to this: We need every electron we can get.” 
Over a video feed on Friday, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright also addressed the canceled projects in a speech to attendees of the climate summit. 
“A lot of the stopping of funding of projects we’re working on right now have really been mutual decisions with the original applicants for them, that I think were counting on government support to continue on, you know, subsidized purchases of things that didn’t, that wouldn’t exist without subsidies,” Wright said. “We need things that will fly on their own.”
The National Resources Defense Council has said the projects were “crucial” for manufacturing and grid upgrades, and ending support for them will stall American innovation and competitiveness, raising costs for consumers, and further cementing our reliance on dirty fossil fuels.”

Some Republicans in Congress have shifted away from focusing on climate change, but Curtis said he’s still winning over support from those in his party who attend the yearly event. 
“Some of them come, and they fold their arms like that, and they’re very suspicious. And then by the end of the day, they go, ‘I get it’,’” he said, “and they realize that it’s been a mistake for Republicans to not be engaged, because we do, we care deeply about the Earth.”
Curtis is sponsoring the bipartisan fire legislation along with Sens. Alex Padilla of California and John Hickenlooper of Colorado, both Democrats, and fellow Republican Tim Sheehy of Montana. 
The wide-ranging bill would set up a Wildfire Intelligence Center, require evaluations of fireshed areas, and boost forest restoration funds, among other changes. Several environmental groups oppose the measure, saying it would open millions of acres of federal land to logging without allowing for scientific review or community input first.  
In its fourth year, the event brought together representatives from the energy industry, government and environmental groups, with conversations focused on emerging technology, 
the permitting process, employing local workers in new projects, and finding ways for industry and government to work together. Curtis said attendance topped 600. 
Part of the event focused on the future of “the future of conservative climate policy” — something Curtis said “absolutely” has a place in today’s world. 
“Look at the turnout today,” he said. “I would say absolutely, of course.”

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said Friday “nuclear is going to become sexy again” and he sees Utah playing a part in a comeback as the nation tries to raise its energy output to feed demand from artificial intelligence. 
“We’re really going to see nuclear move again. Nuclear is going to become sexy again” Wright said, speaking by a video feed at Utah Sen. John Curtis’ Conservative Climate Summit in Salt Lake City.
Wright said tech companies operating large-scale data centers known as hyperscalers to power AI “really want to see nuclear happen,” and noted they’re investing in advancing nuclear technology.  
He said the country is making rapid progress in nuclear fusion, although experts have said the technology will not solve energy problems until the end of the decade or in the early 2030’s. 
President Donald Trump has signed executive orders this year intended to bring about a “nuclear renaissance,” and Wright used the same phrase Friday.  
“Utah absolutely is going to be a key part of that,” he said. 
With nuclear projects coming to Utah, Cox hopes for rural jobs, but that’s no easy task

Utah Republicans, including Gov. Spencer Cox, share the desire to develop nuclear technology in the state, passing legislation creating governing bodies to advance nuclear systems, appropriating $10 million to fund Cox’s nuclear energy regulations through Operation Gigawatt, and making deals with nuclear innovators. 
Cox has said he envisions the state as a home to dozens of small modular reactors. In the last six months, the state has signed an agreement with a company owned by Bill Gates to explore a Utah site for a new nuclear reactor and announced a partnership with another firm to bring an advanced reactor to Emery County. 
Asked if the Emery County project will get off the ground, Curtis told reporters at his conference Friday, “I don’t think we have a choice of it being a reality, the demands for energy are so high, we have to figure this out.
Carmen Valdez, senior policy associate with HEAL Utah, said she has concerns about possible radiation exposure in communities near nuclear facilities, along with the years that could lapse between public investment and the day a reactor’s up and running.
“We are a little concerned about hearing ‘making nuclear sexy again,’ because there’s a lot of not great things that come with that industry that are just being brushed aside,” Valdez said.  
Wright emphasized the plan to raise the nation’s energy output includes keeping coal-fired power plants running. 
“I’m also super excited about next-generation geothermal, and frankly, Utah is the leader in that,” he said, referencing an enhanced geothermal plant being built in Beaver County.

On Thursday, Gov. Mike Dunleavy formally requested a federal disaster declaration for parts of western and northwestern Alaska after a pair of devastating storms flooded Kotzebue and nearly destroyed a series of coastal villages on the Kuskokwim River delta.   
“It is anticipated that more than 1,500 Alaskans will be evacuated to our major cities, many of whom will not be able to return to their communities and homes for upwards of 18 months,” the request letter reads in part.
The disaster declaration would cover the Northwest Arctic Borough, Lower Yukon Regional Education Attendance Area and the Lower Kukokwim Regional Attendance Area, places hit by the remnants of Typhoon Halong.
“Due to the time, space, distance, geography and weather in the affected areas, it is likely that many survivors will be unable to return to their communities this winter,” the letter said, explaining that local and state officials are developing temporary housing plans “until permanent housing plans can be developed and executed over the next year.”



How to help
The Alaska Community Foundation is coordinating relief with multiple partner organizations and providing support as a central clearinghouse for financial aid.
The Association of Village Council Presidents, a group of Yup’ik tribal governments, is coordinating requests for support and donations across the region.  
GCI has donated $100,000 to that relief effort and is collecting relief supplies at stores in Anchorage, Wasilla and Fairbanks through Oct. 27.
In Anchorage, the Alaska Federation of Natives is collecting donated items during its ongoing conference.
Bethel Friends of Canines is collecting donations to charter flights and continue evacuation efforts for pets abandoned during refugee flights.



The state is requesting the federal government fully fund individual assistance and public assistance programs for 90 days.
In Anchorage, where many evacuees are expected to live temporarily, municipal officials waived their normal requirements in order to declare a disaster during a special meeting Friday afternoon.
“We have been told to prepare for up to 1,600 evacuees being relocated here,” said Anchorage Mayor Suzanne LaFrance. “We know at least 572 have arrived in the last two days, and more will be coming. It’s a huge undertaking to find emergency shelter for so many people, but we have so many amazing partners who have come to the table, and we take pride in doing our part.”
In a news conference after the meeting, municipal officials said they have opened the Egan Civic and Convention Center to evacuees. On Thursday night, 119 people slept there; the building has a capacity of between 400-600.
At the Alaska Airlines Center on the campus of the University of Alaska Anchorage, dozens of cots filled a space normally reserved for sports and concerts. 
Community rec centers are also available if additional space is needed, municipal officials said, and they’re working on long-term housing for evacuees.

She and other officials visited the Alaska Airlines Center to speak with the evacuees.
“Just to share a very hard story,” she said, recounting to the Anchorage Assembly a story she was told, “a grandfather had no choice but to walk in the storm in high waters, holding one grandchild and pulling another and fighting against the wind. He didn’t realize his own grandchild was face down in the water. She had passed out, so he raised her up and started shaking her, and she came to, and thankfully, they got to safety right away. There’s going to be more stories that are going to be shared,” Jimmie said. 
To date, the state has funded disaster recovery itself. No cost estimates have been published so far.
“Response and initial recovery costs associated with this disaster in rural, remote, and insular regions of Alaska are exponentially higher than a traditional response along the road system in the Lower 48 states not in the U.S. Arctic,” the letter said.
The letter also includes preliminary damage assessments. In Kipnuk, a community of 714 people that was the hardest-hit by the remnants of Typhoon Halong, “90 percent of all structures are destroyed, including critical infrastructure/lifeline facilities and residential structures.”
In Kwigillingok, a nearby village of 377 people, “35 percent of all structures are destroyed.”
At Napakiak, a village of 325 people, a quarter of all homes were shifted from their foundations by flooding, local officials told KYUK Public Media. Of those that didn’t drift, many were inundated and damaged.
Kotzebue and Deering, in northwest Alaska, were hit by a storm days before Halong’s remnants arrived. There, “more than 50 homes have been compromised, and emergency measures must be taken to rapidly repair homes to make them safe, sanitary, and habitable prior to winter,” according to the state’s federal disaster request.
The day after Dunleavy’s request, Alaska’s three-person congressional delegation sent a joint letter to President Donald Trump, urging him to approve the disaster declaration quickly.
Dunleavy was scheduled to tour the storm-hit region on Friday before returning to Anchorage for further work. 
Speaking to reporters in Bethel, Dunleavy said he’s heard from a lot of people asking what they can do to help.
“Donate money, donate your time, because that’s what we’re going to need right now,” the governor said. “Then, all of the agencies that we’re working with here in the region, here statewide, here federally, I think we’ve got the resources. We just need make sure we pull it all together like we have in other disasters. And I think people will start to see lights going on, houses being put back on their foundations, insulation dried out, and you’re going to see people moving back to their homes.”

,DC,2025-10-18 00:31:39+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Federal judge broadens order blocking Trump administration layoffs during shutdown,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/federal-judge-broadens-order-blocking-trump-administration-layoffs-during-shutdown,,"WASHINGTON — A federal judge on Friday clarified and broadened a temporary restraining order she issued earlier this week that blocks the Trump administration from laying off federal employees during the ongoing government shutdown. U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California Judge Susan Illston said during an emergency hearing the restraining order affects any agency that has employees who are members of the unions that brought the lawsuit or are in collective bargaining units.The Trump administration choosing not to recognize those union activities based on an earlier executive order doesn’t mean an agency can issue layoff notices, she said. Illston, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton, specifically said the departments of Interior and Health and Human Services must comply with the TRO and cannot issue Reductions in Force, or RIFs. “It is not complicated,” Illston said. “During this time these agencies should not be doing RIFs of the protected folks that we're talking about.” She also added the National Federation of Federal Employees, Service Employees International Union and National Association of Government Employees, Inc. to the lawsuit and the temporary restraining order. Meanwhile, as the shutdown that began Oct. 1 extends with no end in sight, administration officials said they will freeze $11 billion in Army Corps of Engineers projects and furlough Energy Department employees at the National Nuclear Security Administration.Unions argue administration ignoring part of judge’s orderThe California case was originally brought by the American Federation of Government Employees, the AFL-CIO and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.Danielle Leonard, an attorney representing those unions, said during the hearing the Trump administration had been “overly narrowly interpreting the scope of the TRO and ignoring some of the language in the TRO.”Leonard pointed to a brief filed by the Department of Health and Human Services that said the agency hadn’t issued any layoff notices to workers covered by the TRO, even though an earlier filing to the court said HHS had sent notices to 982 employees.That department, Leonard said, appeared to take the position that an earlier executive order ended all union representation at HHS. “The government is well aware that is a disputed issue,” Leonard said. Elizabeth Hedges, counsel for the Trump administration, said after considerable back and forth that she didn’t agree with Leonard and the judge’s interpretation of the temporary restraining order’s impact. “I would submit that’s not what the TRO says,” Hedges said, though she later told the judge she would make sure the administration complied with the updated explanation of the restraining order.  Hedges also told the judge the Interior Department didn’t previously disclose it was contemplating layoffs because officials began considering those RIFs before the shutdown and were only going to implement them during the shutdown because it’s gone on so long. The judge ordered the Trump administration to tell the court by 9 a.m. Pacific on Monday about any actual or imminent layoff notices under the full scope of the restraining order. Army Corps to pause billions in big-city projects White House budget director Russ Vought announced hours before the emergency court hearing the administration plans to freeze and may unilaterally cancel billions more in funding approved by Congress. “The Democrat shutdown has drained the Army Corps of Engineers' ability to manage billions of dollars in projects,” Vought wrote in a social media post. “The Corps will be immediately pausing over $11 billion in lower-priority projects & considering them for cancellation, including projects in New York, San Francisco, Boston, and Baltimore. More information to come from the Army Corps of Engineers.”The Trump administration has been cited several times by the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office for not spending money approved by Congress as lawmakers intended. Generally, after Congress approves a spending bill and it becomes law, the president is supposed to faithfully implement its provisions. Any president that wants to cancel funding lawmakers already approved is supposed to send Congress a rescissions request, which starts a 45-day clock for members to approve, modify, or ignore the request. The Trump administration followed that legal pathway earlier this year when it asked Congress to cancel billions in funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and foreign aid. The House and Senate, both controlled by Republicans, approved the request after senators preserved full funding for the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR.The White House budget office sent up another rescissions request in late August, asking lawmakers to cancel billions of additional spending on foreign aid programs. Neither chamber has taken action to approve that request, but Vought believes that since it was sent up within the last 45 days of the fiscal year, he is allowed to cancel that funding without congressional action. The GAO and Senate Appropriations Chairwoman Susan Collins, R-Maine, have both called the maneuver, known as a pocket rescission, unlawful. Nuclear security workers to be furloughedThe Trump administration also announced Friday that it would have more than 1,000 employees at the National Nuclear Security Administration stop working for the remainder of the shutdown, joining hundreds of thousands of others on furlough. According to its website, the NNSA’s job “is to ensure the United States maintains a safe, secure, and reliable nuclear stockpile through the application of unparalleled science, technology, engineering, and manufacturing.”An Energy Department spokesperson wrote in an email to States Newsroom that “approximately 1,400 NNSA federal employees will be furloughed as of Monday, October 20th and nearly 400 NNSA federal employees will continue to work to support the protection of property and the safety of human life. NNSA’s Office of Secure Transportation remains funded through October 27, 2025.”Energy Secretary Chris Wright, the spokesperson said, “will be in Las Vegas, Nevada and at the National Nuclear Security Site Monday to further discuss the impacts of the shutdown on America’s nuclear deterrent.""During past shutdowns federal employees that must keep working as well as those placed on furlough have received back pay. But Trump and administration officials have signaled they may try to reinterpret a 2019 law that authorized back pay for all federal workers once Congress passes a funding bill and the government reopens.",,,,2025-10-17 20:58:03.226601

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Drive across the top of the levee; come back along the levee’s “toe” slope; pause when a flood wall or obstruction crosses the levee; move to the next section. 
This has been the methodology for the Iowa Geological Survey team members the past several fall seasons as they survey the geological integrity of Iowa’s 900 miles of levees. 
The crew is on year three of a five-year, legislatively directed initiative to assess levees across the state to help the state Office of Levee Safety to prioritize funding for repairs on the structures that help prevent flood damage. 
Jason Vogelgesang, a geophysicist with Iowa Geological Survey, said the data collected with the survey helps to point out specific areas of a levee in need of repair, which can help to lower the cost to fix a levee. 
“What we’re trying to do out here is find anomalous areas, or different areas, in the levees that could be a potential area of weakness,” Vogelgesang said. 
He said this way, rather than tearing out an entire levee, a levee system can instead focus repairs to the areas that, based on geological data,  could be more susceptible to failure in a flood event.

How the survey works 
Vogelgesang and his colleague Thomas Doyle, also with the Iowa Geological Survey based at the University of Iowa, head out a couple of times a week during the fall, when the levees are usually mowed and accessible, to drive along the systems. 

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers defines a levee as “an earthen embankment, floodwall, or structure along a water course whose purpose is flood risk reduction or water conveyance.” 

To start the surveying day, the crew rig up a set of PVC pipes on a side-by-side utility vehicle. A ground conductivity meter is then strapped to the PVC, which keeps the vehicle a safe distance from the meter and prevents it from interfering with the meter’s metal readings. 
Vogelgesang said the meter is actually meant to be strapped over a shoulder and carried, but the Iowa Geological Survey team created the rig on the vehicle to more efficiently survey the hundreds of miles of levee systems across the state. 
“It’s kind of an innovative method of collecting these data,” Vogelgesang said.

As he drives along the top of the levee, the meter sends an electrical current that penetrates the subsurface before it comes back up to the meter’s receiver. The current changes as it pass through the ground, which is how the geological team is able to determine the makeup of the subsurface. 
The meter sends five readings per second, which are automatically collected via Bluetooth on a tablet inside the side-by-side. 
The current travels 20 feet down, which Vogelgesang said shows his team “pretty much the whole swath of the levee.” 
After driving along the top of the levee, the crew turns around and drives back along the levee’s “toe slope” or base of the embankment in the floodplain. 
Vogelgesang said driving along the toe slope collects data on the geology below the levee, which can reveal things like a deposit of coarse sand, or a forgotten metal culvert, both of which could allow water to flow through if there were enough hydrological pressure. 
When it comes to levee structures, and geological features below the levee, compact materials like clay are more secure. Sand- and gravel-based levees — which Vogelgesang said he has come across while doing the survey project — could be more likely to fail in the event of a flood.
Vogelgesang’s and Doyle’s Friday trip to Des Moines was the second time they had surveyed levees in the capital city. While they spent their day surveying about 10 miles of levees along the Raccoon River, Vogelgesang said two years ago, they surveyed levees along the eastern side of the Des Moines river. 
Each year, the team aims to survey about 200 miles of levees. Vogelgesang said it takes a significant amount of legwork, before he shows up on site with the side-by-side to map the levees, figure out where obstructions could be and get permission from the cities and levee districts.
After the levees have been driven,  Vogelgesang and his team spend the winter and spring processing and analyzing the thousands of generated data points. Each levee system, which encompasses the levees in the a given region or city, will receive a report from the geological survey about their levees. 
Vogelgesang said these reports are also due to the Iowa Office of Levee Safety.
The office uses the geological findings to rate the levees on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 meaning the levee has a “critical need for repair” and 1 meaning the levee is “optimal,” according to the office.

Iowa Levee Improvement Program
The geological survey of the levees, the Office of Levee Safety and a Levee Improvement Fund, which has an annual appropriation of $5 million from 2024 through 2028, were created in 2023 with the enactment of House File 711. 
These programs comprise the Iowa Levee Improvement Program, which according to the 2024 Iowa Levee Safety report, has a goal of reducing and managing the risks associated with “a hazardous event caused by inadequate levee design, structural performance, or operational control.” 
Under the program, levee districts can apply for cost-share funding to improve their levee systems. The levee ratings, issued by the Office of Levee Safety and informed by Vogelgesang’s surveys, are considered when the Iowa Flood Mitigation Board issues the funds.
Levee improvement program was established after a 2022 study found that “the current approach of managing and financing levee districts within the state of Iowa is unsustainable.”
The Iowa Levee Improvement Program is a step toward improving the state of Iowa’s levee structures, which help to control flooding events. 
So far, the Iowa Geological Survey has driven and collected data on more than 300 miles of Iowa levees and will be over halfway done surveying at the end of the season. 
The Office of Levee Safety has held several town halls, established the levee rating system and generated partnerships across levee districts to develop a “unified approach to flood risk management” according to the annual report.

All accident and health insurance policy issuers in the commonwealth will have to cover vaccinations “without cost-sharing and the imposition of other administrative barriers”, under a notice issued Friday by the Pennsylvania Insurance Department.  
That means Pennsylvanians can receive the COVID-19 vaccinations without copays, deductibles, or other costs, when administered by an in-network provider and without insurers requiring extra steps that make it harder for people to get vaccinated. It also allows pharmacists to follow guidance from a number of trusted medical organizations when giving vaccines.
It also encourages insurers that handle employer-funded health plans, which are not directly regulated by the commonwealth, to ensure that access to vaccines remains consistent for their insured.
The directive comes in response to changes at the Centers for Disease Control that could make obtaining the vaccine more difficult across the country. 
“This is about keeping promises to Pennsylvanians. Vaccines are one of the best ways to prevent serious illness, and we want every Pennsylvanian to have affordable, easy access to protect themselves and their families,” Insurance Commissioner Michael Humphreys said in a statement. “If your health insurance plan says it covers vaccines, that coverage will remain in place at least through 2026. It should be easy for you to get vaccinated.”
The agency has received numerous questions about vaccine coverage following the CDC’s actions this year, according to the notice published in Saturday’s issue of the Pennsylvania Bulletin. 
The CDC recently dropped its universal COVID-19 vaccine recommendation, as well as other changes to its immunization schedule that include toddlers receiving the measles, mumps and rubella shot separately from the chickenpox vaccine. 
“Informed consent is back,” declared Acting CDC Director and Deputy Secretary of Health and Human Services Jim O’Neill upon approving the changes Oct. 6.
The CDC’s 2022 blanket recommendation for the COVID-19 immunization “deterred health care providers from talking about the risks and benefits of vaccination for the individual patient or parent”, O’Neill said.
The CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) had recommended changes to the immunization schedule in September – a few months after all 17 members of the committee were removed and replaced by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime and outspoken vaccine skeptic. 
Kennedy gutted the committee – a panel of experts who issue guidance for the nation’s doctors and pharmacists – shortly after he declared the CDC would no longer recommend COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women. He didn’t cite any specific studies and potentially put the authority’s guidelines at odds with professional associations representing thousands of pediatricians, gynecologists, family doctors and scientists across the country.
Historically, Pennsylvania’s Board of Pharmacy has followed the recommendations of ACIP. But on Sept. 3, the board unanimously approved a measure allowing the agency to issue vaccine guidance based on the recommendations of three medical professional societies: the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, as well as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
The commonwealth also joined a coalition of northeastern states to coordinate on public health efforts such as emergency preparedness and the creation of immunization guidelines. 
Other states in the Northeast Public Health Collaborative (NEPHC) include Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont. All have Democratic governors, except Vermont which is run by Republican Phil Scott.
Gov. Josh Shapiro signed an executive order Oct. 1 that directs state agencies to safeguard vaccine access through the creation of a vaccine safety net for children and by aligning policies with medical experts.
The order also launched a central vaccine portal and a vaccine education workgroup to improve public communication and fight misinformation.
“Importantly, the executive order reinforces that recommended vaccines should remain covered under both private insurance and Medicaid in Pennsylvania. This step ensures that whether someone has a state or private plan, their access to immunizations is protected and consistent,” the Insurance Department said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-1351333811.jpg,,,2025-10-17 20:03:47.572209

This photo is by no means exhaustive. Seventy-two Montanans were charged, tried and convicted for running afoul of the Montana Sedition Act. A new presidential memo on national security is a direct attack on civil liberties — and a reminder of a disturbing period of Montana history, said the head of the American Civil Liberties Union of Montana and a retired University of Montana professor.
“Countering Domestic Terrorism and Organized Political Violence,” also known as NSPM-7 (National Security Presidential Memorandum), states that recent incidents of political violence, including the fatal shooting of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk, are not isolated and merit a “new law enforcement strategy.”
It said a National Joint Terrorism Task Force, with support from local law enforcement, will root out groups rallying around “Anti-Americanism” and “Anti-Christianity” in chat rooms, in-person meetings, social media, and educational institutions.
But the directive against “anti-fascism” and “terrorism” is also a reminder of the lessons that came after the Montana sedition law of 1918, said UM professor Clem Work and the ACLU’s Akilah Deernose in recent interviews.
“Sticking to the legal aspects, it is just an assault on the First Amendment for sure — and on dissent,” said Work, who led the Montana Sedition Project of the UM School of Journalism.
In a special session in 1918, Montana lawmakers passed a law that “criminalized just about anything negative said or written about the government or its conduct of the war,” according to the Montana Sedition Project.
Smithsonian Magazine described the law in Montana as “one of the harshest sedition laws in U.S. history.”
Deernose said the memo is part of a larger pattern of the Trump administration silencing and intimidating its critics or anyone who speaks for ideologies for which the president does not agree.
“Truly, there is nothing more un-American than abrogating freedom of speech or freedom of expression,” Deernose said.
Signed by President Donald Trump on Sept. 25, the memo outlines strategies for a task force to investigate Americans who participate in “organized structures, networks, entities, (and) organizations” and “all participants in these criminal and terroristic conspiracies” that it believes pose a security threat.
There are about 200 such task forces in the U.S., including at least one in each Federal Bureau of Investigation’s 56 field offices and the rest in local, state and other federal agencies, according to States Newsroom’s Washington, D.C., Bureau, citing the FBI.
“Common threads animating this violent conduct include anti-Americanism, anti-capitalism, and anti-Christianity; support for the overthrow of the United States Government; extremism on migration, race, and gender; and hostility towards those who hold traditional American views on family, religion, and morality,” the memo said.
Deernose said part of what’s stunning is “the breadth of what is prohibited.”
However, she also said the labels used in the memo are vague and undefined, and it’s important to remember that just because the president offers a narrative, it doesn’t mean people have to adopt it.
“There’s no doubt right now that we have an administration who seems determined to undermine and constrain civil rights and civil liberties,” Deernose said. “And we’ve also seen a lot of puffery. The president is experimenting to see what he can and cannot get away with.”
She recommended people filter the narrative through what they know to be true. For example, Deernose said Americans have the Constitutional right to free speech and freedom of expression, and those rights are strong.
She also said the judiciary is a check on presidential power, and people shouldn’t take for granted that the president has all the authority he tries to claim.
“Don’t accept that you are powerless because you are not powerless,” Deernose said.
Work, who said his “hairs stood on end” reading the memo, said the ideas it presents are based on fear, as are a lot of laws and political actions.
“We need to be aware that this is an attempt to instill fear based on a fear that the enemy is within, and recognize that it is a lot more sophisticated attack on free speech than Montana’s sedition law was,” Work said.
But work also said the terms in the memo are vague and undefined.
“What is anti-capitalism? What is anti-Christianity? What is hostility toward those who hold traditional American views?” Work said. “ … If you air it to the logical conclusion, that would amount to the prosecution of a whole helluva lot of people in this country.”
Work said free speech rights were protected under the First Amendment, but the anti-sedition law would not have been held unconstitutional at the time it was passed.
He said the U.S. Supreme Court didn’t start taking a more robust view of the First Amendment until 1925, when it found in Gitlow v. New York that the protection covers abuses by state governments, not just the federal government.
Protections for dissent strengthened in the 1930s through the 1960s, “kind of the golden age of protection of political dissent,” Work said.
He said people still have those rights in this country, and while Republican-appointed members of the U.S. Supreme Court are generally sensitive to First Amendment rights, they’re also likely to give greater weight to security concerns.
“But this memorandum is a much more sophisticated assault on political dissent,” Work said. “It’s kind of comparing a broadax to an AR-15.”
For example, he said it is using the memo to go after the tax-exempt status of organizations, which has raised concerns among law firms with large nonprofit clients.
Work’s book, “Darkest Before Dawn: Sedition and Free Speech in the American West,” spurred the project to clear the names of people who were convicted of sedition in Montana in World War I.
Most of the 79 people convicted of sedition were blue collar workers, according to the Montana Sedition Project.
After attending a reading of “Darkest Before Dawn,” a UM law school professor launched a clinic with students to research the idea of posthumous pardons.
In May 2006, Democratic Gov. Brian Schweitzer signed a proclamation of clemency for 78 Montanans convicted under the Montana Sedition Act. It said the law of 1918 ushered in “one of the darkest periods in Montana’s political history,” punishing “even the mildest forms of political dissent.”
(The Missoulian said one man had his sentence commuted in 1921.)
The Smithsonsian said one “scofflaw” was Peter Ervik, who “got two-to-four years for allegedly saying, “I would sooner fight for the Kaiser than I would for the United States, f*ck the United States and f*ck the flag. I mean it.”
One refused to kiss the flag, and another criticized butter and sugar rations, according to examples from the Smithsonian.
The proclamation from Schweitzer said he had the power to grant the pardons, even nearly one century after those who were convicted faced punishment for the enforcement of “a unanimity of thought” around the war.
“There is no time limitation for correcting injustice and clearing the names of honorable people,” the proclamation said. “By this Proclamation, I have extended and do extend a full and unconditional pardon from the offense of Sedition alleged to have been committed during 1918-1919 and from the conviction of Sedition and from all sentences, judgments, and executions thereon.”
Work said the memory of the actions, especially when the gubernatorial pardons brought them to light, seemed to resonate strongly with people, but he also said history has the potential to repeat itself if people don’t exercise their rights.
“The fates of those political prisoners who were put in prison for years tells us that hysteria can take over so easily, and people can be punished for no just reason, just because it’s politically expedient at the moment,” Work said.
The ACLU was founded partly in response to the first wave of anti-sedition laws, Deernose said, and she encouraged people to learn from Montana’s sedition history to prevent repeating the mistakes of the past.
“It’s unimaginable that in Montana, people were jailed — actually jailed — for saying benign statements such as, ‘The ration system is dumb,’” Deernose said.
She said she believes there’s still time to avoid a backslide in democracy, and one way people can steer a different way is to band together.
“Hopefully, one silver lining of this scary time is that we build more connection, we build more bridges, and we unite on all the things that really connect us, because there are a lot more things that connect us than divide us,” Deernose said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Montanans-Sedition-History.jpeg,,,2025-10-17 20:03:47.572209

The sponsor of the measure is Abolish Property Taxes SD, a statewide ballot question committee formed by former legislator Julie Frye-Mueller, Matt Smith and Mike Mueller. They’re seeking to place a state constitutional amendment on the ballot in the November 2026 general election.
From property to purchases: Task force considering fundamental tax shift to reduce homeowner burden

Attorney General Marty Jackley is required to provide a fair and neutral explanation of the measure.
His Friday news release said the measure would repeal South Dakota’s property tax system set forth in the state constitution and replace it with a tax on each retail transaction. For each retail transaction of $15 or more, a flat tax of $1.50 would be assessed. For each retail transaction less than $15, a 10% tax would be assessed.
The transaction taxes would be added on top of current sales taxes, which include the state 4.2% sales tax, up to 2% city sales taxes, and up to 1% additional city taxes on alcohol, restaurants, event admissions and lodging.
The public has 10 days, until Oct. 27, to provide written comment on the explanation. The final explanation is due to the Secretary of State’s Office on Nov. 5.
The sponsors will have to circulate petitions and gather at least 35,017 signatures from registered South Dakota voters to qualify the measure for the ballot.

(Courtesy of Gov. Jared Polis on X)Colorado officials told the U.S. Supreme Court this week that any assertions it is violating the water rights of eastern neighbor Nebraska under a century-old compact are “unripe and premature.”
Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser and his office wrote in a 42-page filing that Nebraska, like every western state, wants more water. However, Colorado officials said the interstate South Platte River Compact, enacted in 1923, doesn’t give Nebraska the water rights the Cornhusker State claimed when it submitted a complaint in mid-July.
The legal response largely denies Nebraska’s claims as “speculative” and that while there might be a controversy for the high court to resolve one day, it isn’t now.
“The Supreme Court need not take a case that would put the court and the parties on a long, time-intensive and expensive path that might well, in the end, put the states right back where they were before Nebraska filed their proposed complaint,” Weiser said in a statement.

“Even if the court decides to take up part or all of Nebraska’s case, I’m confident that we will win on the merits,” Weister continued. “Both the facts and the law are on our side.”
Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen and Attorney General Mike Hilgers said they remain undeterred by Colorado’s arguments. Hilgers said his office is reviewing Colorado’s brief and will respond.
The U.S. Supreme Court will still need to decide whether to take up the case. If it proceeds, it could take years before justices hear oral arguments or issue an opinion.
“Nebraska looks forward to enforcing its water rights under this critical compact in front of the U.S. Supreme Court,” Hilgers said.
Nebraska rights questioned
Among the biggest points of contention is what rights Nebraska has during and outside of the irrigation season listed in the South Platte River Compact. Former Gov. Pete Ricketts, now a Republican U.S. senator, revived the century-old multi-state agreement in 2022, a year the country faced widespread, long-term drought conditions. Pillen has continued to carry the torch for it, and Hilgers was speaker of the Nebraska Legislature in 2022.

Under the compact, Nebraska has the right to 120 cubic feet of water per second during the irrigation season (April 1 to Oct. 15). Nebraska would have a right to 500 cubic feet of water per second at other times of the year, but only if it builds a canal in Colorado to let it capture and transport such water for irrigation.
The South Platte River originates in the Rocky Mountains in Colorado, continuing to Nebraska.
Nebraska state lawmakers have appropriated more than $600 million in taxpayer dollars to build the “Perkins County Canal.” Those Nebraska tax dollars are meant to build a canal that could divert up to 1,000 cubic feet of water per second in above-average water years, higher than the 500 cfs the state is “entitled” to under the compact. Some Democratic state lawmakers have repeatedly sought to scale back the project’s costs.
Nebraska officials assert that the state has the right to a “minimum” of 120 cfs of water during the irrigation season. The compact explicitly gives Nebraska a “priority” of 120 cfs of water in the “Lower Section” of the South Platte River during irrigation season. It prohibits Colorado from diverting any Lower Section water, unless those water users predate July 14, 1897.

Colorado says the compact guarantees a “place in line” for 120 cfs if there are no older, or “senior,” water users that need the flows downstream from the “Upper Section” of the river.
“If it is not available from shutting off, or ‘curtailing,’ junior water users, Colorado is under no obligation to find water elsewhere,” the Colorado filing states.
Colorado officials wrote that Nebraska alleges “few, if any facts,” that Colorado is harming Nebraska in the irrigation season but that if there are issues, the states might be able to resolve them together first. 
The states had been meeting at least sporadically the past couple of years to address water concerns. Colorado criticized Nebraska for filing the lawsuit three weeks before a meeting between the states scheduled for August.
Colorado noted Nebraska is still in the very early stages of canal construction— on Aug. 13, selecting a contractor for an extensive environmental review for permitting, and on Oct. 1, holding the first informational session with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

‘Day in court’
The interstate compact stands out in part because it gives Nebraska the power to condemn and seize land in a neighboring state if needed. Colorado estimated Nebraska’s project would need to secure land rights from about 30 owners. Nebraska has not yet pursued legal action but was in contact with six landowners earlier this year when negotiations fell through.

Colorado officials said that if Nebraska “overreaches” the state will fight to protect its people and water.
“Holding Nebraska to the contours of the rights prescribed by the compact is not ‘interference,’” the Colorado filing states.
Pillen this week again blamed Colorado. He said that as the Denver metropolis has grown, the Centennial State has “shirked” its water obligations and hurt Nebraska ag producers. 
“I have faith in AG Hilger’s leadership in this case, and Nebraska looks forward to having its day in court,” Pillen said.
In July, Pillen said he had not discussed the lawsuit or canal with Colorado Gov. Jared Polis. Pillen said the two “do not agree one iota, and there’s no sense in further conversations.”
‘A meritless lawsuit’
Colorado officials counter that Nebraska has no remedy under the compact to the Upper Section of the South Platte River, including any development. The response brief says Nebraska is essentially asking for an “advisory opinion” on the “pros and cons” of building a canal that could possibly be used to renegotiate the compact.
While the two states appear to be at an impasse and are led by opposing political parties — Democrats to the west, Republicans to the east — Polis invoked a phrase that Pillen has often used: “Water is the lifeblood of our state.” 
Polis said his state has always “faithfully honored” its century-old compact with Nebraska and all other water agreements with its downstream states. He said Colorado would continue to do so.
Said Polis: “We refuse to sit idly by while Nebraska chases a meritless lawsuit that threatens Colorado’s precious water resources, our robust agriculture industry and our rural communities in Northeastern Colorado.”

The day after Vermont requested federal aid for farmers, the government shut down. At an Orwell farm, farmers gathered to share how the drought is affecting them.

Peter Welch, D-Vermont, as Welch tours the Lazy Dog Farm in Orwell to learn about the impact drought has had on local farmers on Friday, October 17, 2025. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger
ORWELL — Jesse Wilbur, owner of Lazy Dog Farm, stood among his cows out in the dry pasture with U.S. Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., on Friday morning. Wilbur pointed to brown cracks in the soil, where he said he stuck his hand a foot deep a day before. 
Wilbur, in his dusted farm pants, picked up a clump of stiff grass, yellow around the edges, and put it in Welch’s hand. 
“Now, is that a piece of lettuce that you’d want to eat?” Wilbur asked. 
Welch had gathered with a handful of neighboring farmers at Wilbur’s farm in Addison County to reflect on how Vermont’s historic drought is stressing the state’s farmers.
Drought conditions have stunted Wilbur’s feed production on his dairy farm and stressed him financially. And Wilbur is just one of many farmers feeling the drought’s effects.
On the last day of September, Vermont officials wrote a letter to the U.S. Department of Agriculture and asked them to issue a statewide disaster designation, which would open up federal aid to assist Vermont’s farmers. But the federal government shut down the next day — halting work at the federal department.

Now Vermont’s letter is awaiting reply.  
The disaster designation could provide Vermont farmers with “a bevy of programs,” said Anson Tebbetts, secretary of Vermont’s Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets. Those programs include low-interest loans and emergency funding to cover losses in livestock or crops.
On Friday morning, the state agency launched a survey to get input from farmers about damages they’re facing as a result of persistent drought. It’s open until Dec. 15. Documenting the effects of drought goes a long way when pushing for policy change or asking for aid from Washington, Welch said.
Welch and Tebbetts urged farmers gathered outside of Wilbur’s big red barn to fill out the survey. In turn, the farmers shared stories about how they’re hurting.
Jon Lucas, who owns the Lucas Dairy Farm in Orwell, was the first one to speak. He said that rain in April and May pushed back planting of his crops. But then it stopped raining altogether, which made it hard for the crops to grow and delayed cutting them.
The wells that supported Lucas’s cattle went dry, he said. Then the pond did too. Now he borrows a truck to haul water from a creek down the road. 
“We just put in a well last week. It’s not up and running yet, but we had to spend money in getting more water,” he said. He had a new well drilled because he doesn’t want to haul water during the winter and isn’t sure how much longer the drought will continue.

Kylie and Jeremy Chittenden, who run nearby Richville Farms, said the quality of their feed was bad as a result of the drought, and they had to compensate by buying grain to feed their cows. 
“Maybe one of the greatest things about farmers is we’re eternally hopeful for a better day,” Kylie Chittenden said. “And so we’re like, well, we’re just going to keep going because it’s going to rain soon, but soon just didn’t come.”
The farm had to source 4,000 tons of corn from out of state and will probably have to source 2,000 more, she said. And while their crop insurance alleviates some costs, it is still going to be a significant expense, according to Kylie Chittenden.
Some farmers said they bought feed from Canada, but many said they have to truck in feed from further states because the whole Northeast has been impacted by the drought. 
The Vermont Agency of Agriculture also maintains a Feed-Finder Marketplace page to connect farmers and help them find feed to buy.
Jesse Wilbur, the owner of Lazy Dog Farm, said that even if the state received the disaster designation for the drought, it would probably still take time to receive funds, as farmers are only now receiving funds for the losses they suffered from heavy rainfall and flooding in 2023 and 2024. 
Welch said that he wants government aid to help farmers get through the drought. He said it was “terrible” that farmers have to grapple with drought conditions when they’re still reeling from the financial losses caused by flooding. 
“We had some other assets we were able to sell and move around to cover our expenses,” Wilbur said, explaining that he used that money to buy feed. 
“We’re able to survive through it, which is good,” he said, but added that many of his fellow farmers are “a bit more financially unstable.”
Jessica Hays Lucas, an organizer for The Northeast Organic Farming Association of Vermont, said that her group is pushing the state to fund an emergency relief fund for farmers.

Last legislative session, the organization lobbied for the Farm Security Fund, which would reimburse farmers for up to 50% of uninsured or uncovered losses. The organization is asking the state to buy into that fund, Hays Lucas said. In the spring, a bill to create the fund cleared the Vermont  Senate before being left behind in a House committee. 
Aid from a state fund “can be more nimble” than federal assistance and would have gone a long way this fall, Hays Lucas said. 
“I’m fearful that there isn’t that many of us in agriculture anymore,” Kylie Chittenden said. “Our numbers start to shrink really quick when we don’t have the resources to take care of our business, like our cows and feed.”

This story by Liberty Darr was first published by Charlotte News on Oct. 16.
Carrie Spear had a vision more than two decades ago: a train of tractors parading through town. Since then, that vision has taken on a life of its own.
Spear had just bought the Spears Corner Store in 2001 when Joe Bean, a well-known farmer in town, parked his “beautiful, rusty” tractor in the parking lot. At that time, Spear was looking to add some fun into the town and into her own life, knowing that much of it would soon be consumed with managing her new business venture.
So, Bean’s serendipitous trip to the store couldn’t have been better timed. She looked at him and said, “Want to have a tractor parade?”
To which Bean responded, “Well, not with that tractor.”
“It’s the gosh-honest truth,” Spear said last week. “I’m standing there a month into store keeping, not having a clue what the future would hold, and he drives up, this big old farmer, rough voice. It was just a beautiful scenario.”
The first East Charlotte Tractor Parade was held in 2001, and although it took some years off during the Covid-19 pandemic and the flooding that struck the state in 2023, it never truly left anybody’s heart.
In fact, attendance at the parade grew so much that in 2019, someone whispered in Spear’s ear, “How are you going to reign this genie back into the bottle?” she recalled, letting out a laugh.
Spear has stepped back from helming the annual tradition and passed the torch off to a younger generation that has set out to keep the tradition going, hopefully, for another 20 years.
Terra Heilenbach moved to Charlotte from California 13 years ago. She remembers the tractor parade being one of the first things that greeted her upon her arrival in town.
“I came to the parade at a friend’s house next door to us, and just loved it,” she said. “I thought it was truly heartwarming. It just touches on something timeless that I think is really neat. And those kinds of things really appeal to me.”
She helped Spear with the planning and organizing last year, but when it came down to beginning prep for this year, Spear knew her time overseeing the event was over.
“A part of me was like, ‘Am I even the person to take this on?’ Because, you know, I’m not from Vermont. I was just kind of like, am I forcing this on this town?” Heilenbach said. “And so, I just started asking people and I saw how much of a part of Charlotte the parade is.”
From there, it was off to the races for Heilenbach. And this past weekend, with the help of some dedicated volunteers and friends, she successfully ran her first-ever tractor parade, complete with 60 tractors, more than a couple hundred spectators, a band and vendors.
While not everyone in the parade is considered a farmer, many of them are. But still, the celebration brings dozens of people, who have polished and rebuilt their rides for this very moment, including an older couple from New York who made the trek across the lake on the ferry, hauling with them four tractors.

Spear, who was enjoying the day alongside her community, is at an interesting juncture. Watching the parade drive by this year, she saw all of its earliest years, while simultaneously seeing all the years that are still to come.
Charlotte is an agricultural town, with the stories of generations of farmers ingrained in its history. A story about Charlotte would be incomplete without a story about the farmers who have tended the land for generations.
Without all the frills and fun, it is the stories of the generations of farmers that is  the heart of the annual East Charlotte Tractor Parade. Aside from an event that makes even the grouchiest Charlotters crack a smile, the event is a giant tribute to who and what Charlotte is.
“I never set out to do this,” Spear said. “This is the people’s parade. And it just kept evolving so beautifully with the volunteers that I had over the years. I would have never been able to do it without them.”

An estimated 6,000 federal employees in Wyoming are not working or receiving paychecks after 17 days of the government shutdown. Some are angry.
The post Furloughed federal workers struggle, hang on, help one another appeared first on WyoFile .","Civilian federal workers in Wyoming furloughed during the government shutdown say they’re stressed, angry and trying to help one another as their paychecks are cut, leaving them languishing in uncertainty.
As the shutdown entered its 17th day, two furloughed workers said they and their colleagues are asking one another whether refrigerators are stocked, whether counseling is needed and even whether their co-workers are low on cash. After one virtual group meeting, a worker for a federal land agency said she and others were told by supervisors to apply for unemployment benefits and offered mental health counseling.
“I think I could do six months,” Betty (not her real name) said of her financial situation. “I’m in a really lucky position.
“I have worked really hard to get to this point,” she said, asking for a pseudonym for fear of retribution by her agency. “All of my savings this year have been purely out of the fear something would happen to my job.”
The savings were intended for a down payment for a home or perhaps a vacation. But they’ve become insurance for shutdowns, something she dreads every October when budget showdowns occur.
For Veronica, (another pseudonym), her survival window is shorter. “I could go probably two months if I’m really strapping down,” she said.
“It’s been an abusive relationship since this administration came in, [saying] we are worthless.” Federal employee “Veronica”
“A lot of us are, we are like ‘f*** it!’” she said. “It’s been an abusive relationship since this administration came in, [saying] we are worthless.”
Across Wyoming, 2.4% of the state’s civilian workforce is employed by the federal government, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. Wyoming had 282,703 people in the civilian work pool, according to the Wyoming Department of Workforce Services.
That would put the estimated number of furloughed civilian federal workers in the state at close to 7,000.
Intense lifestyle choices
Betty said the shutdown’s two-week mark is the turning point at which employees will start missing a complete paycheck. Her last check was about $500 short because of the shutdown, “an amount I could adjust to.”
Now, however, she’s forced to make “intense lifestyle choices.”
“I’ve got a trip — travel plans coming up,” she said. “I’ll have to be pretty frugal. I’m not eating out with friends, changing the types of activities we do, [pursuing] my less-expensive hobbies.”
“I have a lot of friends who say, ‘Why don’t you just take a road trip,’” she said. But that costs money, and she’s still basically on-call to return to work.
“It feels like a really long weekend, but every day is Sunday and I might have to go back tomorrow,” she said. “It’s harder than I thought it would be.”
Veronica worries for families. “It’s super scary for people with kids,” she said.

How is the 2025 government shutdown impacting you? WyoFile wants to hear from you.

They tell her they can’t pull their children from daycare for fear of losing a coveted slot. “There’s still a lot of money going out and none coming in.”
Colleagues who are supporting one another are asking, “Hey, what’s your fridge look like?” Veronica said. “We have full freezers but our bank accounts are low.
“Everybody’s strapped for cash right now, just to pay their bills,” she said. But none are expecting or asking for cash.
Some federal employees who are “essential workers” have to show up to work, which can entail spending money on gas. But they also don’t get a paycheck, she said.
There are several federal assistance programs available, including for counselling, the two women said. In Teton County, the community resource nonprofit One22 is offering $250 stipend gift cards to federal workers in need.
Recipients can spend the money at Smith’s on food, at the pharmacy or for gas. The application process requires proof of employment and other documentation.
“Things are going smoothly,” said Seadar Rose Davis, director of community engagement. The group had processed 113 applications by early afternoon Friday.
“I’ve talked to quite a few people,” she said. “They’ve been incredibly appreciative.
“They feel seen and feel valued,” she said. “I’m glad we can provide a small piece for them.”
The program will continue for 10 days after the shutdown ends, according to the One22 website.
‘Reduction in force’
Some employees are worried they might lose their jobs during the shutdown through a “reduction in force” initiative by President Donald Trump’s administration. “A furlough of more than 30 calendar days, or of more than 22 discontinuous work days, is also a RIF action,” the Office of Personnel Management states on its website.
A colleague of Veronica worried about a federal notice she and others received that indicated that after 30 days, “we can just get rid of you,” she said. There’s a fear that people might be fired even before then.
A federal judge, however, sided with employees Wednesday, issuing a temporary restraining order “enjoining shutdown-related RIFs.” She was ruling on a motion brought by the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees and others in a suit filed against the Office of Management and Budget and others.

U.S. District Judge Susan Illston also set an Oct. 28 hearing for an injunction. “If what plaintiffs allege is true, then the agencies’ actions in laying off thousands of public employees during a government shutdown — and in targeting for RIFs those programs that are perceived as favored by a particular political party — is the epitome of hasty, arbitrary and capricious decisionmaking,” her order reads.
The employees’ federation and other plaintiffs “are likely to prevail on the merits of their claims under the [Administrative Procedures Act],” the order reads.
Meantime, federal work is at a standstill, and some employees are quitting. Betty estimated that of her team of about 250 employees, 20-30 might be working.
“There’s one person in [Washington] D.C. doing the work of 250,” she said. “I did hear today we are losing people on a daily basis from our agency,” she said Wednesday. For them, “this is the last straw.”
“There were people who literally just quit,” Veronica added. “I know of at least three instances where that happened.”
About three or four people in her roughly 100-person agency in Wyoming are at work, she said. The ranks are down from 120 before DOGE firings and severance offers, she said.
Republicans blamed
Veronica doesn’t mince words when it comes to the question of who’s responsible for her situation. 
“I blame this on the Republicans,” Veronica said, “and the fact that we are now sliding into an authoritarian government. I can see the writing on the wall.”
“If the shutdown ended tomorrow, we better have those health care subsidies,” she said, supporting Democrats’ argument that such aid must be part of any shutdown resolution. “I don’t want to pay an extra $150 [a month].”
Betty is trying to hang on.
“I have not thought of quitting,” she said. “I feel really tied to the mission of my agency.
“I didn’t leave from [severance] offers and scare tactics,” she said. “The shutdown is the most normal of the weird stuff that has happened this year.”
“I tend to blame the Republicans more,” Betty said. “I come from that with a bias. I support what the Democrats are doing — standing up for health care. That’s incredibly important to me.”
Most important to her is mutual support.
“If you weren’t able to prepare for this, there’s no shame in it,” she said of her colleagues in need. “Community’s the most important thing we have always, but especially now.”

Larry Rhoden/Twitter)The leader of the company that abandoned its immediate plans to build a $2.6 billion ethanol-based jet fuel plant in Lake Preston said Friday that South Dakota is no longer a friendly place to do business.
In 2022, Gevo CEO Patrick Gruber stood alongside South Dakota Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden, then the lieutenant governor, at the ceremonial groundbreaking for the project, billed as the largest economic development project in state history.
This week, Gruber and his Colorado-based company announced plans for a smaller jet fuel facility at an ethanol plant in Richardton, North Dakota.
Gevo bought the plant a year ago in the wake of South Dakota pushback on a carbon sequestration pipeline that was critical to the company’s Lake Preston business plan. 
“South Dakota is a very difficult place to do business,” Gruber told South Dakota Searchlight on Friday. “Everything is oppositional. North Dakota is a breath of fresh air.”
Gruber said his company still hopes to build something on the 200-odd acres it owns in Kingsbury County at some point in the future. It wouldn’t be a standalone ethanol plant, he said, but it could be a jet fuel plant that uses corn oil or ethanol, or be used as a chemical production plant.










South Dakota is a very difficult place to do business. Everything is oppositional. North Dakota is a breath of fresh air.


– Patrick Gruber, CEO of Gevo


Gruber sees a future where 70 of the nation’s approximately 180 ethanol plants use designs like Gevo’s to convert to jet fuel production. Demand is growing, he said, and the U.S. can’t keep up with the petroleum-based refineries it has.
That’s long-term, though. Whether the Lake Preston site is a part of that conversation or is used for another offshoot of Gevo’s operations is also a ways off. 
At this point, after watching opposition to the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline drive policy changes over the past three years, Gruber said he’s wary of engaging South Dakota leaders.
In 2022, he said, there was strong support in state leadership for both the pipeline and Gevo’s Net Zero-1 complex in Kingsbury County.
Then the political winds shifted.
“Having lived through the change, I’m not doing that again,” Gruber said.
Carbon sequestration drives business
Summit Carbon Solutions had hoped to gather carbon dioxide from ethanol plants across multiple states and deliver it via underground pipe to a site in North Dakota for sequestration. In doing so, the company would cash in on federal carbon capture tax credits.
Gevo, were it to build its operations in Lake Preston and connect to that line, would be able to lower the carbon emissions of its jet fuel, boosting its value in certain markets.

Gevo’s North Dakota plant sits atop the same formation that would be used to sequester carbon by Summit. This year, Gevo’s been pumping the carbon from that plant underground and selling carbon credits to other companies that want to offset their carbon footprint. Sequestering carbon also lowers an ethanol plant’s carbon score, so Gevo can sell it for more in some areas.
Gruber said the company can also sell carbon to fossil fuel companies in North Dakota’s oilfields for use in enhanced oil recovery — pumping gas underground to force more crude oil toward a well.
“We did good by buying that plant,” Gruber told Searchlight.
Summit, meanwhile, is in limbo. Gov. Rhoden signed a bill banning the use of eminent domain by carbon pipeline companies this year. Eminent domain is the legal process by which land access can be obtained for use in projects that benefit the public, with compensation for landowners determined by a court. The specter of eminent domain sparked landowner opposition, litigation and political activism in South Dakota, leading to the ban.
The Public Utilities Commission denied Summit’s permit application twice, but the company vowed to reapply.
Issue splits governor candidates
On Thursday, Rhoden said he’s glad to hear that Gevo may still build in South Dakota. He also said signing the eminent domain ban for carbon pipelines was the right thing to do in response to citizen concerns, and that Summit has a chance to “reset” its plans and work with landowners.
Rhoden has not announced if he’ll be a candidate to keep his job in 2026, but he’s spent much of his first year in office on an “Open for Opportunity” tour to meet business leaders across the state.
South Dakota Speaker of the House Jon Hansen, R-Dell Rapids, was the first Republican to announce his intention to run for governor. He’s been among the loudest opponents of the carbon pipeline.

Hansen said he’s not saddened to hear about Gevo’s shift to North Dakota. He pointed to a $12.2 million tax rebate authorized for Gevo by the Governor’s Office of Economic Development in 2023 and said companies ought to be able to thrive in South Dakota without incentives.
“This is yet another example of what I’ve been fighting against: politicians and bureaucrats in the Governor’s Office of Economic Development getting duped by green-energy and other scams — abusing so-called ‘economic development’ programs to hand out our tax dollars to out-of-state corporations.”
Hansen said South Dakotans “want our money back,” and that “corporate welfare waste” would end if he were elected governor. 
Gruber said Friday, however, that Gevo never used its tax rebate, because it was predicated on building the Net Zero-1. Since that hasn’t happened, “we have not taken any money from South Dakota.” Josie Harms, Rhoden’s spokeswoman, confirmed that Gevo hasn’t collected any state money, and that it has paid sales taxes on anything it purchased in South Dakota to prepare the site.
Nothing has been done to the land for about two years. 
Governor race exposes divergent paths on economic development among South Dakota Republicans

Another Republican candidate for governor, Aberdeen businessman Toby Doeden, also leaned in on opposition to publicly funded economic development incentives in his statement on Gevo. He said companies that want to locate in South Dakota should “share our values” and be able to “succeed without politicians putting their fingers on the scale.”
“As governor, I will attract businesses, large and small, who will come here on fair terms,” Doeden said in a statement. “Businesses that move here should do so on their own two feet without demanding hundreds of millions in state subsidies or abusing residents in the process.”
Republican U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, who’s also declared his candidacy for governor in 2026, has talked recently about wanting to make South Dakota’s business climate more friendly again. This week, he sent out a press release on a “Data Centers Done Right” initiative, which he said would incentivize their placement in South Dakota and make the state “be a national leader in the AI revolution.”
Hansen and Doeden each responded to that announcement by saying they’re opposed to tax breaks. 
Johnson, in a statement on the Gevo situation, said anti-development attitudes are the reason the state lost ground in the latest iteration of CNBC’s “America’s Top States for Business” rankings.
“Unfortunately, this isn’t the only project looking to leave South Dakota,” Johnson wrote. “Our state has slid down the rankings to the 35th best state for business. South Dakota has many strengths, but if we are going to meet our potential, we’ll need vision and a plan.”
Robert Arnold, the only declared Democratic candidate for governor, said South Dakotans have made their feelings on the carbon pipeline clear. But he also said he’d like to see Gevo follow through and build in South Dakota.
“I hope that we haven’t turned this industry completely away from us and we can negotiate a deal down the road,” Arnold said in a statement.
Lake Preston anticipated loss
Lake Preston Mayor Donna Bumann said pipeline opposition wasn’t an issue in her community. 
“For the farmers in our area that Summit has connected with, it’s been quite positive,” Bumann said. “I realize that’s not the same in other areas.”
Gevo trumpets cash on hand, growth potential for sustainable jet fuel in earnings call

Bumann said her community had embraced Gevo and the benefits its proposed jet fuel plant promised. In a presentation offered to investors last year, the company included a slide that said Net Zero-1 would return $170 million annually to the South Dakota economy, create 1,300 short-term and 100 long-term jobs, partner with universities to promote science education and draw graduates to its operations, and pay area farmers a premium for corn.
“We are hopeful that, in due time, circumstances will make it possible for Gevo to move forward,” Bumann said.
Kingsbury County Commission Chairman Kyle Lee wasn’t surprised by the news, either.
“Once the state said that they weren’t going to allow for Summit to do any eminent domain, I think we knew that was going to end up being the straw that broke the camel’s back,” Lee said.
Net Zero-1’s footprint would’ve included an ethanol plant, a plant to turn that ethanol into jet fuel, and a wind farm proposed by a company called Zero6. It also spurred East River Electric Cooperative to invest in a switching station near the Gevo site, meant to help service the company’s power needs. 
This month, however, Zero6 pulled its application for interconnection from the Southwest Power Pool’s queue. The Southwest Power Pool manages the wholesale power market for the central U.S. 
Chris Studer of East River Electric said the cooperative will still build its switching station and use it to serve existing customers.
“We weren’t just building lines to serve Gevo,” Studer said, but he added that the upgrades will ready the area for any large-scale industrial project that might come along.

Maya Homan/Georgia RecorderPlanned Parenthood Southeast’s board of directors announced this week that it would be hiring a law firm to investigate allegations of mismanagement that reproductive health advocates say threatens to undermine the organization’s mission and has alienated donors and partner organizations.
The statement followed the circulation of a “save Planned Parenthood Southeast” petition that advocates say has garnered over 580 signatures, alleging that new leaders have “dismantled” the organization from the inside. The petition, which says it was started by “concerned former members” and supporters of the organization, alleges that Planned Parenthood Southeast has terminated employees dedicated to public policy and organizing and curtailed the organization’s emphasis on abortion services and community outreach under interim CEO Mairo Akposé’s leadership.
“What was once a trusted institution—providing lifesaving reproductive healthcare and fearless advocacy across Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi—is now under immediate and dangerous threat from within,” the petition states. It also calls for the removal or resignation of Akposé, the current board of directors and other leaders hired by Akposé.
Akposé did not respond to multiple requests for comment by phone. 
Planned Parenthood Southeast’s board of directors said in a statement issued Monday that it was made aware of “troubling allegations” against its leadership team the previous week.
“We take these allegations seriously and have retained a nationally recognized law firm to conduct a thorough review,” the board said in the statement. “In the interim, PPSE remains open for business, serving the 15,000+ patients who rely on our services.”
Speaking through a public relations company, the board of directors declined to name the firm, saying they wanted to “ensure the integrity of the process.” 
The board also denied that Planned Parenthood Southeast has taken any steps to reduce its emphasis on abortion services, and said they currently employ two full-time and six part-time public policy and advocacy staff members for the three-state area in a statement issued Thursday.
However, former employees said that PPSE leaders had explicitly called for the organization to downplay its focus on abortion. 
Kaylah Oates-Marable, who was the Georgia state director at Planned Parenthood Southeast until last month, said Akposé “specifically said that we talk about abortion too much and we put too much emphasis on abortion,” during a meeting with national Planned Parenthood leaders. 
Georgia law bans most abortions once fetal cardiac activity is detected, which is usually at about six weeks – and before most women know they are pregnant. Both Alabama and Mississippi implemented total abortion bans in 2022.
Oates-Marable and Stephen Stetson, who was the organization’s director for Alabama and Mississippi until he was terminated from his position last month, both said that the organization’s new leadership questioned the need to attend community events like Pride parades in Atlanta and Birmingham, which were a key part of the organization’s community outreach work. They said leadership would cite budgetary reasons for their decision to pull back from advocacy efforts, even when the efforts in question did not come with many expenses, or were funded by grants.

The turmoil at Planned Parenthood Southeast comes as the entire Planned Parenthood network has increasingly been targeted by Republican members of Congress. In July, President Donald Trump signed his tax and spending bill into law, which included a provision that prevents certain abortion providers, including Planned Parenthood, from receiving Medicaid funding for health care services unrelated to abortion, like annual physicals, cancer screenings and STI testing. Affiliates in multiple states have closed locations in response to the funding cuts, while Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin has announced they will pause abortion services. Other affiliates have vowed to remain open, albeit without Medicaid funding.
Both Stetson and Oates-Marable said the national branch of Planned Parenthood had been made aware of employees’ concerns with PPSE leadership, but that the organization did not step in to address them.
“Each Planned Parenthood local affiliate is an independent non-profit organization with its own board of directors, CEO, and staff,” vice president of communications Angela Vasquez-Giroux said in a statement. “PPFA has no involvement in affiliate hiring or other personnel decisions. The affiliate’s independent board of directors has the sole responsibility for personnel decisions concerning an affiliate CEO or other affiliate staff.”
The outcry has pushed some backers to withhold donations.
Carolyn Smith, an Atlanta resident and longtime Planned Parenthood Southeast donor who has been volunteering with the organization since 2016, said she is rethinking her support.
“I’m not donating to them until I know for sure that leadership of our Planned Parenthood Southeast is leadership that shares a progressive political lens, that supports women’s rights, that supports non-binary rights, that supports the rights of the people that never get a voice,” she said.
Some reproductive rights groups are also beginning to alert their supporters to changes within the organization. 
In a post on Instagram, Planned Parenthood Young Leaders of Savannah, a fundraising group dedicated to engaging future reproductive health advocates, announced that it is disaffiliating from Planned Parenthood Southeast entirely, and has changed its name to the South Georgia Reproductive Justice Coalition. On Oct. 10, the Feminist Center for Reproductive Liberation, a nonprofit that provides reproductive health care in Atlanta, put out a press release arguing that the changes “closely align with Project 2025’s agenda to dismantle reproductive rights and health infrastructure.” 
Stetson, the former Alabama and Mississippi state director, said the problems facing the organization might be a matter of bad leadership rather than ideological divides. But intentional or not, he added, the changes have damaged the organization’s credibility with other reproductive rights groups, leaving rifts that may be difficult to repair. 
“The line between malice and incompetence can be very blurry, and at the end of the day, the result is that the work isn’t getting done,” Stetson said.

Central Vermont Career Center is asking residents to approve a $149 million bond for the construction of a school building.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Central Vermont set to vote on whether to build the state’s first standalone career center.","In an otherwise quiet election year, central Vermont residents are poised to decide on one major issue this November: whether to approve a $149 million bond to construct a new technical education center. 
The Central Vermont Career Center is currently housed at Spaulding High School in Barre. But administrators say that demand for the vocational programs, which range from automotive and plumbing to cosmetology and culinary arts, has long outstripped the available space at the high school. 
For the 2025-26 school year, the career center received 414 applications for only 228 spots. The gap has only widened over the past five years, according to the career center’s data. 
Since 2018, the Central Vermont Career Center District — composed of 18 towns in Washington County — has worked on a plan to construct a new career center building in Graniteville that would expand access to trade programs and graduate more students. If the bond is approved, students could start attending school there beginning in 2029. 
Businesses and policymakers have long raised concerns about Vermont’s shortage of qualified tradespeople and the need for more young people in the workforce. The career center’s superintendent, Jody Emerson, hopes to turn that urgency into support for the bond vote. If the new center is approved, it is poised to become the state’s first vocation school that is not attached to an existing school building or campus. 
“We have thrown money at folks to move to Vermont to build our tax base and to maybe bring in a younger generation,” she said, referring to the pre-pandemic remote worker relocation grant. “And this is actually a way that we could do it, by investing in Vermont and Vermonters.”
But the request for a new high school building may run up against the state’s cost-of-living crisis. Earlier this month, residents at a public forum raised concerns about their ability to afford the higher taxes tied to the bond. 
“I support education in trades and tech. It’s just that that is a lot of money right now for all of us,” said local resident Sue Paxton. “When you can’t even go to the grocery store and spend less than 20 bucks for two items, three items, it’s not a good time.”
Here’s what to know about the tech center, the proposed construction and the cost. 
How would the tech center work?
The career center offers 15 different programs that vary widely in skillset, but there are some aspects that all students have in common. 
Right now, career center students split their time between the center and the academic education requirements at their current school, Emerson said. A typical day begins around 8 a.m. and goes until lunch, when students return to their home districts for afternoon classes. 
That divide is one thing Emerson hopes to change with a new building. 
“I have, every day, been advocating for students to stay and not have to transition,” she said. “I think what we’ve gotten from feedback from students is that the majority of them would prefer to stay and just get everything met here.”
The new building in Graniteville would be able to house full-day instruction and potentially fit 9th- and 10th-graders, she said. Right now, 10th-graders can sign up for an “exploratory” program that allows them to try different programs. A new building could allow the district to offer that to 9th-graders. 
The district has considered expanding in its current home at Spaulding High School, but there were challenges with that option, according to the Frequently Asked Questions section of the career center’s website. The high school has too little parking and not enough room to accommodate larger lab spaces required for hands-on instruction. 
Emerson said the standalone school building could also allow the district to offer more programs like Human Services, or early childhood instruction, natural resources, advanced manufacturing and diesel mechanics. 
But there is a national shortage of skilled-trades instructors, and Emerson admitted it’s something the career center has faced before. 
When a plumbing teacher resigned early in the school year a couple years ago, “we were unable to fill that opening even though we had a full class,” she said. The school was able to get one of the lab assistants an emergency license and contracted with a local plumbing company to send over a part-time instructor, who eventually joined the school permanently. 
Emerson is not too concerned about finding instructors, even if they were to expand their program. The center has been able to train new instructors by having them work alongside seasoned ones, expanding their program in increments each year. 
“We’ve also had lots of outreach from people who are excited about the new center and saying, ‘I’m interested in teaching there if you’re able to open this program,’” she said. 
Sara Walker said she’s seen the benefits of the career center to students firsthand. As a former teacher at U32 High School and Spaulding High School, she said some of her students who struggled to pay attention or connect with class materials “thrived” once they joined the career center. 
“They’re more engaged in their learning and finding more relevance in it,” she said. 
But at a social level, going from one school district to another — even if it meant just walking across the building — could be disorienting for students, she said. “I had a problem with wanderers who would go over to the tech center, because that’s where they wanted to be,” she said. 
What would the new tech center look like?
The proposed location of the new building is 16 Baptist St. in Graniteville, a 27-acre field with a paved road and municipal water and sewer connections, according to the center’s May 2025 presentation. 
Lavallee Brensinger Architects, a consulting firm for the project, designed a mockup plan for the building that would run about 167,000 square feet. The plan incorporates plenty of lab space along with classrooms, offices, a cafeteria and a gym. 
Most of the $149 million bond, roughly $125 million, would go toward construction costs, according to a budget breakdown Emerson provided via email. Another $10 million would be set aside for professional services. 
Equipment and furnishings, including lab equipment, would run about $3 million. Emerson said the center plans to bring over any equipment it can from the Spaulding High School space.
“When we renovated the space where we have our welding program shop now, we made sure that everything we got for that space could be brought with us, and that the air system we bought for it could handle double” the capacity if it was moved to the new building, she said. 
What will it cost taxpayers?
The district partnered with state analysts to figure out how the bond would impact annual property tax bills. Across all the municipalities that are part of the district, the annual impact on a $300,000 home ranged between $99 and $420. 
But Emerson cautioned that the impacts are based on 2025-26 tax data, and that the actual annual cost would vary throughout the life of the bond and depend on upcoming state-level changes to the education system. Basically, “they’re 100% not accurate,” she said. 
An expansion of the tech center would mean raising the center’s operating budget, too. The center’s budget was $5.1 million this fiscal year; the district projects it would need an additional $3 million to cover the expenses of the new building, according to the website FAQs. The center does receive state and federal assistance for its annual budget through technical education support grants. 
Emerson pointed to research elsewhere in the country that found a positive rate of return on the money spent on technical education through better career outcomes for students later in life. 
“If we invest in our students, we have a greater chance of them getting jobs here, staying here, helping to pay back this cost and growing everything here,” she said. “They’re going to be here with their families. They’re going to have kids that come to our education system. They’re going to keep Vermont growing.”
At the same time, she acknowledged that some central Vermont residents may not feel like they can afford to make that investment now, regardless of its future benefits. 
“I think we’re going to learn something from the outcome of this vote. I’m not sure what it’s going to be yet,” she said. 
Emily Walker, a member of the Barre Unified Union School District board, said via email that she was frustrated with the “one-sided” nature of the discussion about cost. “It really speaks to a mindset of scarcity that is holding us back,” she said. 
“The five interconnected factors of mobility that young people need in order to thrive are: a strong academic foundation, career-connected learning, opportunities to build social capital, support in their lives and civic engagement in their community,” she wrote. “The career center speaks to so many of those.”

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa State University researchers have unlocked new secrets within the bacteria responsible for the creation of thousands of fruits and vegetables as we know them today, with the goal of seeing how they can balance its uses as a tool versus its prevalence as infection.
Kan Wang, an ISU professor of agronomy and biotechnology, and students have released a paper detailing how they investigated the chromosomes of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, a bacterium responsible for crown gall disease in plants and the most crucial instrument in genetically modifying crops.

Using gene editing tools they tailored to their needs, Wang said the team manipulated Agrobacterium chromosomes and found that by rearranging its DNA, scientists can impact how well the plant grows, its resiliency and ability to infect plants.
“It’s our bread and butter for biotechnologists — for us,” Wang said.
Agrobacterium enables natural, human-led genetic modification
Evidence of crown gall — a disease implanted by Agrobacterium that causes bulging tumors to grow on plant roots and stems — can be found all over the world, Wang said, with her own family finding the growths on trees in Seattle, Iowa City and the Czech Republic.
The earliest mention of crown gall comes from Italy in the late 1500s, Wang said, and efforts to address the disease in the U.S. go back to the early 1900s. As technology progressed, so did researchers’ work to learn more about Agrobacterium and its mysteries, with Wang starting her own research into the subject during her time studying at the University of Ghent in Belgium in the 1980s.
It was while she was studying as a graduate student that her professor found that Agrobacterium has the ability to “deliver its own DNA into the plant and then integrate into their chromosome,” which is something no other bacteria can do. From there, researchers found they could, through gene editing, “disarm” the genes that cause tumor growth in plants and replace it with a different gene of interest.
It was these findings that paved the way for genetically modified crops, which are changed to become more resilient to stress and attack or encourage certain traits. According to the Food and Drug Administration, most corn and soy grown in the U.S. are GMO crops, as well as cotton, canola and sugar beets.
“All (of) the GMOs on the market were made by Agrobacterium,” Wang said.
Around 2,000 plant species, from black pepper to persimmons to strawberries, have also been identified as N-GMOs, which Wang described as plants that were infected in the past by Agrobacterium and became the dominant crop through domestication or other means.
One example Wang gave of this was the sweet potato. Researchers found out that all domesticated species of the root vegetable have Agrobacterium, but wild species do not. The Agrobacterium caused the sweet potato to bulge, a trait Wang said was likely preferred by those harvesting the vegetable due to it providing more food.
“It’s a horizontal gene transfer, which occurs naturally, and in this case happens to be Agrobacterium,” Wang said.
Untangling chromosomes
Thoughts of the past and lingering questions were drivers in this study, Wang said, as those who made earlier milestones in Agrobacterium research did so without the technology currently available.
The research team started their work by swapping out components of a gene editing tool previously tailored to research E. coli to ensure it would work for their purposes. After that, Wang said, they could “play around” with Agrobacterium chromosomes, deleting certain genes and adding others in.
Wang, a knitter when she isn’t conducting her work, said going through chromosomes is like having to untangle a pile of yarn that got mixed together — time-consuming and complicated.
Agrobacterium has both circular and linear chromosomes, which Wang said caused curiosity as most bacteria have only circular chromosomes. The team also found a variant in the bacteria that had its chromosomes fused together into a large, linear chromosome, and tested it against the original setup and two other variants they created with the gene editing tool.
The variants had different levels of success in infecting plants, Wang said, and varying resiliency. They found that Agrobacterium with fused chromosomes were better at replication and stronger in growth, but could not infect plants as well as variants with separate chromosomes.
Wang’s drive to keep studying Agrobacterium is two-fold, she said, and split between finding real-time solutions to disease and development of technology to improve the tool the bacteria has become.
“The more we know the bacteria, their lifestyle, their biology, maybe we can come up with a more effective biocontrol for them to not to become such a headache for vegetable and fruit farmers right then,” Wang said. “On the other hand, Agrobacterium is also a tool for us. So we want to see, okay, can we learn more from their behavior so we will know how to improve our tools for biotechnology.”
Even with all of the breakthroughs scientists have made with Agrobacterium, Wang said she’s excited to keep diving into the bacteria and other plants it has infected and changed.
Agrobacterium has shown up where it wasn’t expected, such as in hydroponics equipment used to grow tomatoes, and much is still unknown about what triggers the bacteria to leave the soil and enter plants. Wang said next steps are to apply for funding to continue with the work.
“The more we learn (about Agrobacterium’s) ability, their biology, then the more effective we can think about ways to compete (with) the pathogenic bacteria,” Wang said.

Mi Escuelita cuenta con una larga trayectoria ayudando a niños y familias a salir adelante.,"This article is also available in English. Read it here.
El hijo de Elizabeth Gibot, James, se conocía como un niño tranquilo y de buena conducta. Pero Gibot comenzó a notar que James lloraba más y parecía ansioso cuando ella no estaba presente. El también dejó de usar el lenguaje de señas que aprendió de bebé. Ella sabía que algo no estaba bien y se comunicó con su pediatra, pero el doctor no supo cómo ofrecerle ayuda. 
“Dio marcha atrás en todo lo que le había enseñado”, dijo. “Supongo que a los demás les costó mucho darse cuenta, porque nadie conoce a tu hijo mejor que tú”.
Gibot acababa de dejar a su pareja, quien, según ella, la maltrataba física, verbal, emocional y económicamente. Intentó proteger a James cuando la situación se complicaba con su pareja, pero la casa donde vivían era pequeña, lo que lo hacía difícil aislarlo de los malos momentos.
Gibot comenzó a buscar recursos en línea. Encontró Mi Escuelita, un preescolar en San Diego dedicado a estudiantes que han sufrido traumas familiares, como violencia doméstica. Tras reflexionar, inscribió a James.
“Eso me quitó un gran peso de encima, saber que él estará aquí y con profesionales que lo ayudarán de maneras que yo nunca podría. Al menos no en ese momento”, dijo. 



 Elizabeth Gibot y su hijo James Gibot recibieron servicios de salud mental ofrecidos a los estudiantes de Mi Escuelita y sus familias.
Mi Escuelita, fundada en 2006, ofrece servicios de salud mental a estudiantes  y un espacio seguro donde los niños pueden aprender mientras se recuperan. Es considerada líder entre los centros preescolares terapéuticos y se especializa en ayudar estudiantes y sus familias que sufren de trauma. 
Dirigida por la organización sin fines de lucro SBCS, anteriormente conocida como South Bay Community Services, la escuela lleva tiempo ofreciendo servicios a familias necesitadas, incluyendo a aquellas que sufren violencia doméstica. Mi Escuelita surgió de esos programas.
“Se trata de centrarnos realmente en los más pequeños”, dijo Stacey Musso, directora del departamento de salud y bienestar de SBCS.
Además de asegurar que los estudiantes estén listos para el kínder, Mi Escuelita ofrece terapia individual y en grupo. Cuenta con terapeutas disponibles para los estudiantes durante el horario escolar. Angelina Puffelis, supervisora clínica de Mi Escuelita, afirma que este acceso le brinda a su equipo la oportunidad de trabajar con los estudiantes y abordar los problemas a medida que surgen.

Muchos de los estudiantes del preescolar son latinos y provienen de familias de bajos recursos. Mi Escuelita ofrece servicios de salud mental tanto a estudiantes como a sus familias, ya que estas relaciones influyen en el desarrollo infantil.
Según un informe reciente, 28 padres de alumnos matriculados en Mi Escuelita el año pasado afirmaron haber estado en múltiples relaciones con la presencia de algún tipo de violencia doméstica. Diecisiete de ellos tuvieron que mudarse o se quedaron sin hogar como consecuencia de la violencia doméstica.
 La evidencia muestra que el programa funciona.
Un informe reciente de la Universidad de California en San Diego reveló que el 82 % de los estudiantes de Mi Escuelita obtuvieron calificaciones superiores al promedio en la prueba de preparación para el kínder, que evalúa la preparación del estudiante para el kínder. Una calificación superior al promedio indica que el estudiante debería necesitar poca atención especial y no presentar dificultades de aprendizaje significantes.
Los estudiantes asisten a Mi Escuelita sin costo y las clases se ofrecen durante todo el año. A cambio, las familias se comprometen a colaborar con los directivos escolares para abordar los problemas de salud mental de forma directa.
“Les pedimos a nuestras familias que entiendan nuestro ambiente. Es tan único”, dijo Lisa Klemp, directora del preescolar Mi Escuelita. “Realmente creemos en esa conexión. Queremos apoyar no solo a nuestros hijos, sino a toda la familia”. 
Los estudiantes participan en un safari en Mi Escuelita el 23 de abril de 2025. Todos los niños que asisten a Mi Escuelita han experimentado traumas relacionados con la familia. 
 Lecciones de la siesta
Mientras algunos estudiantes saboreaban los últimos bocados de sus sándwiches, zanahorias y puré de manzana durante el almuerzo, otros se preparaban para su siguiente actividad. Tiraron la basura, agarraron mantas y se tumbaron en colchonetas distribuidas por el aula. Algunos estudiantes agarraron peluches o escogieron libros para estar cómodos. Los profesores bajaron las luces y pusieron un video de YouTube de gatitos ronroneando mientras sonaban canciones de cuna. 


Aunque la mayoría de los estudiantes se durmieron, a algunos les costó trabajo. Una niña se negó a dormir y lloró cuando le dijeron que no podía correr por el aula. Los profesores intentaron ayudarla ofreciéndole leerle libros o haciendo burbujas, pero no se calmó. Otra niña permaneció inmóvil con los ojos abiertos mirando al techo.  Permaneció así durante la mayor parte de la siesta antes de quedarse dormida.
“Vemos que descansar, calmarse, puede ser un desafío para algunos de nuestros niños”, dijo Klemp. “Creo que han estado en espacios o ambientes que pueden haberlos puesto hiperalerta. Por eso, saber que están en un espacio seguro, donde pueden calmarse y relajarse, es crucial para algunos de ellos”. 
La maestra Ismairy Caldera le lee a un estudiante para ayudarlo a dormir durante la siesta en Mi Escuelita en San Diego el 5 de mayo de 2025. La hora de la siesta puede ser particularmente difícil para los niños que han experimentado un trauma, ya que muchos de ellos permanecen en alerta máxima y les cuesta descansar.

Según la Encuesta Nacional de Salud Infantil, el 63 % de los adultos estadounidenses reportaron haber experimentado al menos una de las experiencias adversas en la infancia antes de los 18 años, como abuso, presenciar violencia o separación familiar. El trauma puede manifestarse de diferentes maneras. Algunos pueden volverse explosivos en su comportamiento, mientras que otros pueden ser tímidos o aislarse. La siesta, en particular, puede ser un desafío para los niños más pequeños.
“En general, de niño, la noche puede ser un tiempo difícil. Y si oyes gritos, portazos, o si la policía llega a tu casa, eso acentúa mucho ese momento de miedo”, dijo Klemp.
El trauma infantil puede no tratarse o considerarse un comportamiento normal, pero sus efectos pueden tener un impacto que puede terminar en abuso de sustancias, trastornos alimentarios, diabetes y enfermedades cardíacas, según la Red Nacional de Estrés Traumático Infantil. El trauma a una joven edad también puede aumentar la probabilidad de encontrarse en el sistema de justicia juvenil y tener un bajo rendimiento académico.

Dado que a los niños les puede resultar difícil expresar sus emociones, Puffelis utiliza la terapia de juego para enternder lo que un niño podría estar experimentando. “Es como estar en un tour”, dijo. “Y para mí, el niño será el guía. Escucho, sigo, pero si tengo una pregunta, ibusco información”.

Último: El muñeco Wally se sienta con los estudiantes durante la ceremonia de graduación de la escuela el 11 de junio de 2025. Los peluches se utilizan para representar escenarios que ayudan a los estudiantes a aprender sobre diferentes emociones y cómo pueden interactuar con los demás.
En Mi Escuelita, cada estudiante participa en sesiones de terapia individual con profesionales clínicos. La terapia con un niño puede ser diferente a una sesión con un adulto. En lugar de sentarse a hablar sobre lo que siente, los terapeutas de Mi Escuelita juegan con los estudiantes y buscan con paciencia señales de emociones más profundas.
“Normalmente hay un tema, y algunos de los aspectos comunes son la protección, la seguridad, el empoderamiento o el superhéroe; lo malo, dijo Puffelis. “Como terapeuta, busco eso. Este es un tema continuo, y si hay cambios en el ambiente familiar, ese tema se refleja en la terapia de juego”. 


Entre estas sesiones individuales, los terapeutas dirigen sesiones en grupos pequeños donde enseñan aspectos de un programa llamado Años Increíbles, que ayuda a los estudiantes a aprender cómo controlar sus emociones. Estas sesiones pueden incluir actividades como leer libros, hablar sobre diferentes tipos de sentimientos o usar peluches para representar una situación que pueda ayudar a liberar las emociones.
Wally, un muñeco de pelo negro y rizado, forma parte del programa. Tiene un lugar especial en las ceremonias anuales de graduación de la escuela. Cada año, un miembro del personal escolar sostiene el muñeco para que pueda “caminar” con los niños. 
 El terapeuta Spencer Mattox lee un libro a los estudiantes durante una sesión de terapia de grupo pequeño en Mi Escuelita en San Diego el 20 de mayo de 2025.

 Generaciones de violencia doméstica
Gibot ha sufrido violencia doméstica a lo largo de su vida. De niña, vio a sus padres y a otros familiares lidiar con los mismos problemas. 
En Mi Escuelita, Gibot se benefició de algunos de los servicios de salud mental que se ofrecen a las familias de los estudiantes. Recibió terapia y asistió a reuniones de padres donde aprendió consejos para apoyar a James, como usar el contacto físico para controlar su cuerpo y usar más palabras de afirmación para fortalecer su autoestima.
En seis meses, Gibot empezó a notar mejoras en su comportamiento. Dijo que desearía que se establecieran más escuelas como Mi Escuelita para evitarles a las familias los trámites burocráticos y tener que comunicarse con diversos especialistas en diferentes lugares.
 “Lo ideal sería que la norma fuera como Mi Escuelita, sobre todo porque hay muchos niños que podrían beneficiarse de ella”, dijo. 
La maestra Viviana Vásquez trabaja con estudiantes durante una clase en Mi Escuelita en San Diego el 23 de abril de 2025. Todo el personal de Mi Escuelita debe completar un curso de 40 horas ofrecida por SBCS para ayudarlos a equiparse con el conocimiento y las habilidades necesarias para apoyar a los sobrevivientes de violencia doméstica. 
 ¿Qué pasa después de Mi Escuelita?
Cuando los estudiantes salen de Mi Escuelita, ingresan a distritos escolares que pueden ofrecer servicios o intervenciones de salud mental, pero generalmente no tan directos como están acostumbrados. Si un maestro o miembro del personal cree que un estudiante podría estar lidiando con problemas de salud mental, puede recomendarle que consulte con un consejero escolar o un trabajador social. A partir de ahí, las autoridades escolares pueden derivar a la familia del estudiante a proveedores de salud externos ofrecidos por organizaciones comunitarias o servicios de salud locales del condado. 


Hilaria Bauer, jefa de servicios de primera infancia en Kidango , una organización sin fines de lucro del Área de la Bahía, dijo que otros educadores están comenzando a adoptar conceptos de Mi Escuelita, especialmente después de la pandemia de COVID-19.
 “Al regresar a las aulas y a actividades más regulares, empezamos a ver cómo ese aislamiento, ese trauma, afectó a nuestras familias y a los niños”, dijo.
Pero construir el ambiente de aprendizaje único que SBCS creó en Mi Escuelita puede ser difícil de copiar.
 “Es una idea maravillosa y poderosa. Supongo que también es muy costosa”, dijo Bauer. 





 Los estudiantes participan en una ceremonia de graduación en Mi Escuelita en San Diego el 11 de junio de 2025.
El costo de operar Mi Escuelita es de $1.3 millones cada año; se financia con una combinación de fuentes locales, estatales y federales, así como donantes privados, según SBCS.
 Además de la financiación, Bauer afirma que encontrar el personal adecuado es otro obstáculo a considerar. Por ejemplo, puede ser difícil encontrar profesores con la licencia necesaria para impartir terapia, además de experiencia en el aula.
Aun así, Bauer afirma que hay beneficios a largo plazo de la implementación de ciertos conceptos que se ofrecen en Mi Escuelita. Los datos parecen respaldar su afirmación. Un estudio de la Universidad de California en San Diego, que analizó el rendimiento de los estudiantes durante varios años, mostró que quienes asistieron a Mi Escuelita tendían a obtener puntuaciones iguales o superiores en matemáticas, lectura y escritura, en comparación con otros estudiantes del distrito escolar primario de Chula Vista.
“Podemos gastar menos en programas de intervención e instalaciones alternativas”, dijo Bauer. “Habrá menos ausentismo escolar, menos conductas graves, expulsiones o programas alternativos, y todas esas iniciativas de ‘corrección’ si realmente nos centramos en el momento de la vida del niño que realmente marca la diferencia”. 
 Los estudiantes interpretan una canción durante una ceremonia de graduación en Mi Escuelita en San Diego el 11 de junio de 2025.
James comenzó en el kínder en agosto. y celebró su cumpleaños en septiembre. Le va bien, dijo Gibot.
 Mientras se preparaba para el kínder, Gibot dijo que le preocupaba lo que pudiera pasar. Klemp le aseguró que ella y James seguirían recibiendo apoyo de SBCS. Eso la hizo sentir más segura.
 “Ha aprendido mucho y ha adquirido habilidades que me gustaría poder enseñarle. Pero, bueno, ambos aprendimos”, dijo.
 James fue uno de los estudiantes que se graduó de Mi Escuelita en mayo. Gibot, sentada con el resto de los asistentes a la ceremonia, observó cómo su hijo cantaba canciones con sus compañeros, animaba a sus amigos y recibía un pequeño diploma.
Fue muy emotivo para mí. Pensé: “¡Wow! No tiene miedo. No siente tantas emociones diferentes”, dijo. “Lo hizo todo solo. Y ver cómo crece esa independencia es simplemente hermoso”.

Roughly 150 people stayed at an emergency shelter at the Alaska National Guard Readiness Center. Others stayed with family or friends or in accommodations arranged by the Yukon-Kuskokwim Health Corporation in Bethel.
On Thursday morning, evacuees lined up to board the second flight to Anchorage, landing at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson. Emergency shelters have been set up at Alaska Airlines Center, the Egan Center, and city recreation centers at Spenard and Fairview.
An estimated 2,000 evacuees are expected in Anchorage by Friday, said Mayor Suzanne LaFrance.

“My emotions are all over the place,” she said.
Another flight was scheduled for Thursday afternoon as new evacuees arrive from Kipnuk and Kwigillingok.
Seventy-five people were expected to be picked up in Kwigillingok on Thursday. In Kipnuk, the evacuation is largely complete, said Lieutenant Colonel Brendan Holbrook, commander of the 207th Aviation Troop Command with the Alaska Army National Guard.
“Kipnuk is evacuated for everyone that wants to be evacuated. There are about 50 or 100 that stayed behind, that don’t want to come out,” Holbrook said, and estimates there are 200 to 300 people in Kwigillingok who are staying there.
The storm killed one woman in Kwigillingok, 67-year-old Ella Mae Kashatok, and left two family members missing, Vernon Pavil and Chester Kashatok. The local search and rescue effort is still ongoing, led by volunteers and village public safety officers with the Association of Village Council Presidents.

As damage continues to be assessed, emergency crews have dispatched to begin repairs on utilities and sewer systems, water, gas lines, roads, boardwalks, boats and structures. At least 15 communities have reported“substantial damage” across the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta region.
On Thursday, Gov. Mike Dunleavy submitted a formal request to the Trump administration for a Presidential Disaster Declaration asking Trump to declare a major disaster for Alaska, and provide support and federal aid to help with the recovery.

(Pool photo by Zachary Boyden-Holmes/Courtesy of Iowa PBS)Though there have been many shake-ups in Iowa races heading into the 2026 campaign season, Republican candidates have largely kept their fundraising leads in Iowa’s U.S. Senate and House races, according to the most recent Federal Election Commission reports.
Iowa will have open races for two U.S. House seats, as well as for governor and U.S. Senate in 2026 – a large change from previous recent election cycles, in which Republican incumbents were largely able to hold on to their seats. Democrats hope the shifting campaign landscape, alongside discontent among voters over Trump administration actions and GOP-led bills like the budget reconciliation measure, will allow their party’s candidates to break the full GOP hold of Iowa’s federal delegation.
Still, Republican candidates outraised Democrats in most of Iowa’s races for federal office in the most recent FEC filing period from July 1 through Sept. 30.
There was one exception – Democrat Christina Bohannan outraised incumbent U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks in the 1st District, according to the October reports, as she aims for a rematch in 2026.
Bohannan, who unsuccessfully ran against Miller-Meeks in the 2022 and 2024 elections, raised nearly $1.06 million in the most reporting period and ended with $1.6 million cash on hand. In comparison, her opponents to become the Democratic nominee, Travis Terrell and Taylor Wettach, raised $12,940 and $429,099 respectively.
In a recent statement, Bohannan thanked her supporters for helping her campaign work to flip Iowa’s 1st Congressional District.
“Miller-Meeks’ campaign is well-funded by big corporations, billionaires, and party bosses because she does their bidding in Washington DC,” Bohannan said. “We’re showing that we can win this race the right way and for the right reasons – with the support of hardworking people who are ready to get costs down, defend the middle class, and actually put Iowa first. And we’re just getting started.”
Though Bohannan raised more than Miller-Meeks, who reported $806,731 in fundraising during the period, the incumbent Republican retains a lead in reserve funds with $2.62 million cash on hand.
Miller-Meeks’ campaign said in a statement Democrats are targeting the seat in vain, as her numbers show “best-funded campaign IA-01 has ever seen.”
“In 2024, Democrats outspent me by millions and still lost because Iowans know I fight for them, not for D.C. elites or the establishment,”  Miller-Meeks said. “With the resources we have built, we are ready to share our record, and WIN again for Iowa and American workers, farmers, and families.”
Nunn outraises Democratic challengers in 3rd District
Iowa’s 3rd Congressional District, currently represented by Republican Rep. Zach Nunn, is also a seat targeted by national Democrats as a potential pick-up. His campaign reported raising $524,657 in the most recent reporting period, ending with $1.6 million in reserve funding.
Though Nunn raised less than the leading candidates in Iowa’s 1st District, he still raised more than the two Democrats competing to take him on in the 2026 election — state Sen. Sarah Trone Garriott, D-West Des Moines, and former House Minority Leader Jennifer Konfrst. Nunn’s Campaign Manager Brendan Duffy said in a statement the fundraising numbers send “a clear message,” that Nunn is “battle-tested, well-prepared, and ready to defend the seat from far-left activists pushing an out-of-touch, radical agenda.”
“Iowans trust Zach Nunn, and as one of the top ten most bipartisan members of Congress, he will continue to build a safer, more prosperous future for every hardworking Iowa family,” Duffy said in a statement.
Trone Garriott was the closest to Nunn’s fundraising totals, ending the third quarter having raised $437,684 and keeping $598,212 cash on hand. Konfrst’s fundraising totals were lower this period, raising $175,556 — less than half of Trone Garriott — and ending with $195,333 in cash on hand. Trone Garriott’s campaign stated the recent FEC filing “clearly demonstrates that Trone Garriott is the frontrunner to take on Zach Nunn.”
Former state lawmaker Joe Mitchell emerges as top fundraiser in 2nd District
In September, U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst announced she will not seek a third term in the Senate. The news was shortly followed by U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson, a Republican who currently represents Iowa’s 2nd Congressional District, stating she will run for the Senate seat.
Political forecasters have predicted some Iowa congressional races, particularly in the 1st and 3rd districts, may be among the most competitive in the nation. Hinson’s move to run for U.S. Senate also led Cook Political Report to move its rating for Iowa’s 2nd District from “solid Republican” to “likely Republican.”
Though there is not an incumbent Republican competing in Iowa’s 2nd Congressional District after Hinson’s exit, Republican candidate Joe Mitchell, a former state legislator, raised more than both Democratic and Republican competitors. Mitchell reported fundraising $407,555 during the period and having $405,883 cash on hand. More than $307,000 of this funding came from outside contributors, in addition to Mitchell loaning his campaign $100,000.
Mitchell’s campaign called the fundraising figures “record-breaking,” covering three weeks between when he announced his campaign and the reporting period ended.
“The campaign has several fundraising events scheduled this year to continue building the resources necessary to win in November,” Mitchell said in a statement.
Other Republican candidates in the 2nd District race include Iowa Sen. Charlie McClintock, R-Alburnett, who reported raising $14,307. Former U.S. Rep. Rod Blum, who dropped out of the race Monday, reported raising $250,181, with most funding coming from a personal loan. Rep. Shannon Lundgren, R-Peosta, who entered the race Sept. 23, did not file a report.
The 2nd District Democratic primary field saw more competitive fundraising numbers. Iowa Rep. Lindsay James, D-Dubuque, led among Democrats in the most recent reporting period with $273,649 raised and $226,300 in cash on hand. Clint Twedt-Ball, the founder of the nonprofit Matthew 25, raised a similar amount at $218,815, and ending the period with $152,398 in reserves.
Twedt-Ball thanked his supporters in a statement, saying 90% of contributions came from Iowans.
“As I’ve traveled the district, I’ve heard from countless Iowans that it’s time for new leaders, instead of career politicians, to address the rising costs of healthcare, housing and other basics,” Twedt-Ball said. “Our campaign is about building a new kind of politics: lighting the way to a stronger, more affordable future for our state.”
Kathy Dolter, the former dean of nursing at Kirkwood Community College, reported raising $39,109 during the third quarter, and Guy Morgan, a Democrat from Boone, raised $2,413.
James emphasized in a news release that Hinson’s exit from the race gives Democrats a solid opportunity to flip Iowa’s 2nd Congressional District.
“This outpouring of support sends a clear message that our campaign has the momentum to win in November,” James said in a statement about her fundraising. “We’re building a well resourced campaign that will listen to voters in every community in the 2nd district and go fight on their behalf in Washington D.C.”
 Siouxland Chamber of Commerce president leads GOP field in fundraising for 4th District
In Iowa’s 4th Congressional District, a longtime Republican stronghold, is another open race in 2026, as U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra considers a bid for governor following Gov. Kim Reynolds’ decision not to seek reelection in 2026.
Feenstra has not officially announced a gubernatorial campaign but is not expected to run for reelection in the 4th District. He reported raising $24,854 during the FEC reporting period and having $1.32 million in cash reserves.
In the campaign to replace Feenstra, Siouxland Chamber of Commerce President Chris McGowan led the GOP primary field with $372,285 in fundraising.
In a news release from McGowan’s campaign, Katie Delzell, who serves as the campaign’s fundraising strategist, said the FEC filings show he is the strongest candidate to take over from Feenstra in 2026.
“Chris McGowan’s early success signals an extraordinarily strong show of support for his candidacy from across the 4th District, and this has sent a powerful message, not only to Iowans, but to the political leadership in our nation’s capital,” Delzell said. “This significant accomplishment has solidified Chris as the clear front-runner in the race to represent Iowa’s 4th congressional district.”
Ryan Rhodes, the founder of the Iowa Tea Party, reported raising $183,205 in the third quarter with $100,000 coming from a loan. Former House Majority Leader Matt Windschitl reported raising $67,425. Republican Christian Schlaefer, a software consultant who launched his campaign in September, did not file an FEC report.
Among Democrats, former state Rep. Dave Dawson raised $36,194 during the reporting period, and Ashley WolfTornabane, a stay-at-home mother from Storm Lake, reported raising $6,122. Democrat Stephanie Steiner, a retired nurse running for the 4th District seat, did not file a fundraising report.

 Hinson leads in U.S. Senate race fundraising
Hinson quickly gained sizable financial and structural support in her campaign to follow Ernst in representing Iowa in the Senate. Shortly after entering the race, the Republican representative was endorsed by President Donald Trump, Senate Majority Leader John Thune and National Republican Senatorial Committee Chair Tim Scott, alongside many other Senate and Iowa GOP leaders, quickly solidifying her place as the likely GOP nominee for the seat.
Her fundraising totals show a similar base of support. Hinson raised $1.72 million during the reporting period, outpacing her opponents from both parties. She also ends the period with $4.05 million in reserves — a total that includes funding transferred from her U.S. House campaign.
Hinson’s campaign celebrated the fundraising totals, with Campaign Director Addie Lavis saying in a statement the FEC reports show “Iowans are fired up to elect Ashley as their next senator.”
“Ashley’s commonsense message — cutting taxes for working families, lowering the cost of prescription drugs and healthcare, securing our border and keeping our communities safe, and ensuring China can’t buy up Iowa farmland — is resonating with Iowans in every corner of this state,” Lavis said. “This will be a fight, but Ashley Hinson is putting in the work to be Iowa’s next U.S. Senator and keep all of Iowa red.”
There are two other Republicans running for the Senate seat — former state lawmaker Jim Carlin and Joshua Smith. Carlin reported raising $45,492 during the filing period, while Smith did not file a report.
There is a more competitive primary field among Democrats for the 2026 race. Iowa Rep. Josh Turek, D-Council Bluffs, reported raising more than $1 million since launching his campaign in August — outraising the other Democrats in the field. He ends the quarter with $651,981 in cash on hand.
Turek’s campaign said the fundraising was the “record for the most money raised by a first-time Democratic Senate candidate in their opening quarter in the race,” and shows his campaign has strong support from Iowans.
“This campaign isn’t powered by corporate PACs — it’s powered by teachers, nurses, farmers, and working families from every corner of Iowa who are ready for a leader who will fight for them,” Campaign Manager Brendan Koch said in a statement. “Josh is building a movement, and this milestone proves Iowans are ready for something different.”
Though Turek raised the most during the reporting period, his overall fundraising falls short of state Sen. Zach Wahls’ total for the election cycle at $1.3 million. Turek raised more than Wahls, who reported $646,658 in fundraising and an ending balance for $585,045 for the FEC filing period.
Wahls called attention to receiving contributions from Iowans in all 99 state counties alongside endorsements from six Iowa labor unions in a news release on the fundraising totals.
“Our campaign’s strength comes from the people of Iowa—not corporate PACs or Washington insiders,” Wahls said in a statement. “Iowans are responding to our message of taking on the corrupt political establishment—of both parties—and standing up for the working families who make this state great. That’s how we’ll build the campaign to defeat Ashley Hinson and deliver real change for Iowa.”
Former Knoxville Chamber of Commerce Director Nathan Sage reported raising $410,501 during the most recent period, bringing his total for the election cycle to $1.12 million.
Des Moines School Board President Jackie Norris, who ended her campaign Thursday, reported raising $345,621 in the most recent FEC filing and ending the period with $227,320 cash on hand.

Shelby County officials late Friday filed suit against Gov. Bill Lee and other state leaders, seeking an immediate halt to the deployment of the National Guard in Memphis, which they say violates the Tennessee constitution and state law. 
The lawsuit, filed in Davidson County Chancery Court, seeks a temporary injunction to keep members of the Tennessee National Guard from patrolling the streets of Memphis while the court challenge remains ongoing. A hearing has been set for Nov. 3.
Davidson Counselor Chancellor Patricia Moskall late Friday denied a request for a preliminary injunction, a separate legal mechanism sought in the case, saying lawyers bringing suit had not demonstrated an “immediate or irreparable injury, loss, or damage” would occur before the Nov. 3 hearing. 
Beginning October 10, guardsmen have been deployed to the city as part of the Memphis Safe Task Force established by President Donald Trump. More than 1,000 members of state and federal law enforcement agencies — among them the Tennessee Highway Patrol, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Homeland Security — have conducted traffic stops and made arrests in support of the effort. State officials have yet to release the exact number of guardsmen and other law enforcement who are working as part of the task force.
As of Friday morning, the task force had made 1,044 arrests, a spokesperson for the U.S. Marshals Service, the task force’s lead agency, said.
But the arrests have placed strains on local resources, particularly local detention centers that were already at, or above capacity, before task force began. Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris on Tuesday declared a state of emergency to enable him to bypass normal budgetary rules to respond to the increased demands.
“Relief is needed urgently,” the 24-page complaint states. “National Guard members are supposed to help address emergencies in Tennessee communities, not cause them.”
“The Court should not stand by while the Governor asserts military power to run roughshod over Tennessee law,” it states.
The lawsuit cites a 2021 opinion by former Tennessee Attorney General Herbert Slatery III that concluded, under the Tennessee Constitution, that “only circumstances amounting to a rebellion or invasion permit the governor to call out the militia, and even then, the legislature must declare, by law, that the public safety requires it.”
The lawsuit also cites state law that entrusts local officials to determine whether there has been a breakdown in law and order requiring the presence of the guard. 
“Yet…the National Guard deployment was made unilaterally, not at the request of Local officials, but over their objections,” the lawsuit said. 
Tennessee Sen. Jeff Yarbro, a Nashville democrat, criticized Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti earlier this month for withdrawing Slatery’s 2021 opinion and replacing it with his own revised opinion in April 2024, defining the guard as a militia “only for purposes of federal law.”
Skrmetti responded that Slatery’s opinion was withdrawn in April 2024 because it didn’t “accurately reflect the state of the law.” He added that the office withdraws opinions when it finds the state of the law has changed or the analysis was incorrect.
A spokesperson for Gov. Bill Lee did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the lawsuit.
The lawsuit was brought by Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris, state Rep. Gabby Salina and Rep. G.A. Hardaway, both Memphis Democrats, Yarbro, a Nashville Democrat, and three members of the Shelby County Board of Commissioners.
In addition to Lee, the lawsuit names Skrmetti and Major General Warner Ross III of the Tennessee National Guard.

Larry Rhoden on Friday recognized a remotely piloted aircraft squadron at Ellsworth Air Force Base for its role in a June U.S. military operation that officials say helped end a 12-day war between Israel and Iran.
A news release from the governor said that “for the safety of all those involved,” Friday was “the first day the governor could publicly acknowledge” the squadron’s involvement in the operation.
The 89th Attack Squadron remotely pilots MQ-9 Reaper drones from ground control facilities at the base near Rapid City. In June, the squadron participated in Operation Midnight Hammer, which culminated in strikes on Iranian nuclear sites ordered by President Donald Trump, according to the governor’s office.
The operation destroyed three Iranian nuclear sites, according to statements from the Trump administration. Trump said at the time that the strikes were intended to end Iran’s nuclear weapons program, calling them a “spectacular military success.”
Rhoden praised the squadron for what he described as “heroic service and sacrifice in defense of America and our freedoms.” He declared Friday as “89th Attack Squadron Appreciation Day” in South Dakota. 
The governor’s office said the squadron conducted 177 hours of intelligence operations and provided information that helped safeguard more than 17,000 U.S. troops and informed the president’s decision-making on the military strikes.
Rhoden presented the recognition during a ceremony at Ellsworth Air Force Base.

Legislative committee advances two of five measures aimed at maintaining delivery services. Critics questioned whether one of the two, which set off a lengthy abortion debate, belonged in the discussion.
The post As Wyoming maternity care continues to erode, lawmakers mull ‘band-aids’ appeared first on WyoFile .","When Banner Health announced in September that it would pause labor and delivery services at Platte County Hospital in Wheatland, it marked the fifth Wyoming hospital in recent history to shutter a birth facility.
Like facilities before it in Evanston, Rawlins, Kemmerer and Riverton, the hospital called it a difficult decision. Provider challenges like physician recruitment, declining births and profitability in Wyoming are steep. The result is a loss of services and large gaps in service here. 
As lawmakers on the Legislature’s Joint Labor, Health and Social Services Committee spent most of Thursday wading through measures aimed at fortifying maternity care in the state, they acknowledged that the trend will be difficult to reverse. There were many references to the draft bills as “band-aids” that could perhaps keep maternity care limping along in its current state. 
Ultimately, the panel advanced two of the five measures. The only draft bill to receive unanimous support would authorize freestanding birth centers to be covered by Medicaid for births handled by midwives. 
The second bill that advanced, a divisive measure that ignited lengthy debate, would set rules and regulations aimed at protecting pregnancy centers, which are typically intended to discourage women from seeking abortions. The bill would prohibit the state or any municipality from compelling a pregnancy center to perform abortions, provide abortion medication or counsel in favor of abortion, among other acts. 
Critics wondered if the measure even belonged in the discussion of fortifying maternity care. 
“Please abandon this misguided bill,” said Britt Boril, executive director of WyoUnited, a reproductive rights organization. “It in no way helps us solve our issues with the maternity care deserts that I know we have a shared desire to alleviate. In fact, it aims to shield unregulated pregnancy centers from oversight.”
The committee advanced the measure on a vote of 12-2. That puts it on track to be among the committee-sponsored bills going into the 2026 session, which are historically more likely to pass.
The problem
A dearth of maternal health care has made pregnancy and childbirth increasingly tricky in widening swaths of Wyoming. That means families going to extraordinary lengths to deliver babies; doctors spread thin or on the brink of burnout and hospitals juggling the complicated cost formulas in thinking about maintaining labor wards.
If the trend continues, experts worry that mothers will put off or forgo prenatal care, travel long distances in difficult weather or give birth in emergency rooms with nurses who aren’t trained in labor and delivery, which could have dangerous or even deadly results. Births in the state, meanwhile, continue to fall.

The erosion also poses existential threats to communities, as adequate health care is crucial to attracting young families to rural towns, state leaders say. And though lawmakers and health care professionals have been searching for solutions, no single answer has emerged.
Wyoming isn’t alone, and legislative staff furnished the Labor Committee with a report highlighting strategies implemented in other states to improve maternal health care. They include expanding Medicaid to cover doula services or permit telehealth; creating incentive programs for maternal health care professionals; and integrating midwives into the state health care system.
Wyoming does grant certified nurse midwives a full and independent practice authority and provides midwives with a 100% Medicaid reimbursement rate.
The measures before the committee on Thursday represented an array of strategies to ease operations and costs for maternal services. 
What advanced, what didn’t
The committee first considered a bill that would provide for increased reimbursement for obstetric physician services and critical access hospitals. That includes reimbursing OB-GYN services at 105% of the current Medicare rate. Critical access hospitals that offer labor and delivery services authorized under Medicaid, meanwhile, would be reimbursed for inpatient services at 100% of the actual cost for the services. 
The measure could help with physician retention and family practice residencies that serve Medicaid patients, Cheyenne OB-GYN Jacques Beveridge said. “I think it could go a long way,” he said. 
The Wyoming Medical Society also supported it. “We see it as a stabilization measure,” said Executive Director Sheila Bush, noting that it could be one of many strategies aimed at making shifts, even small ones. Eric Boley with the Wyoming Hospital Association echoed that.

“I think this is one opportunity to work on a much bigger problem and a bigger process,” Boley said. “I think this is an important bill if we want to sustain what we currently have, but it will not fix those [facilities] that have closed.”
Lawmakers, apparently wary of increased state expenses, did not support the bill. It died on a vote of 6 to 8.
They did, however, support a bill regarding extending Medicaid coverage to freestanding birth centers. These facilities are designed to provide a comfortable setting for uncomplicated births. They are not part of hospitals, but often do have partnerships with nearby hospitals or doctors in case more specialized care, such as a cesarean section, is needed.
Birthing centers’ appeal relates in part to expenses. They come with lower fixed costs because they specialize in vaginal births without medical complications, need less equipment and employ midwives, who are paid less. They could establish in regions with delivery service gaps as an option for straightforward births. 
The committee was favorable. 
“I look at this program as bringing a little rain to the maternity desert,” said Sen. Lynn Hutchings, R-Cheyenne.
Lawmakers did not advance a related bill, which would mandate private insurance coverage parity for freestanding birthing center services. 
Abortion debate 
The pregnancy center bill took up most of the committee’s time. Sen. Charlie Scott, R-Casper, noted that the document’s format itself was unusual. “Is this a national bill that has been copied?” he asked. 
The 12-page bill draft includes much preamble, including statements about national events. It prohibits municipalities from interfering in specified pregnancy centers operations, and would impose severe penalties. Under the bill, a pregnancy center or any person aggrieved by a violation of the act can sue for up to three times the actual damages sustained. 
To present the bill as a maternity care solution is disingenuous, critics said Thursday. Pregnancy centers disguise themselves as medical facilities when their true intent is to advocate against abortions, Boril of WyoUnited said. 
Emma Laurant urged the committee to stop spending energy on divisive abortion measures “and actually support increasing practical solutions, such as expanding birthing centers and attracting OBs to the state to take care of Wyoming women and their tangible health and any subsequent children they choose to have.”

Valerie Berry, executive director of LifeChoice Pregnancy Center in Cheyenne, defended her center as a sound medical facility that provides quality care from licensed professionals.  
Sen. Scott wondered if there is a current crisis in Wyoming regarding pregnancy centers and threats. Berry said they are happening around the U.S., though she isn’t aware of issues in Cheyenne. 
Denise Burke, senior counsel with Alliance Defending Freedom, said the bill “was designed to protect Wyoming’s pregnancy centers from censorship or discrimination simply because they do not offer, refer for or counsel in favor for abortion, abortion-inducing drugs or contraceptives.”
Burke, who resides in Kansas, also said she isn’t aware of any potential threats in Wyoming. 
Rep. Rachel Rodriguez-Williams, R-Cody, who chairs the Wyoming Freedom Caucus and was lead sponsor on the abortion ban now before the state high court, pushed back on Scott’s question of the bill’s provenance. She drafted a previous version of it with staff, she said, and it’s modeled specifically for Wyoming.

Following Politico’s story, Vermont elected officials across the political spectrum quickly called for Douglass’ resignation, with Gov. Phil Scott, himself a Republican, leading the charge. 
In a June exchange between former New York State Young Republicans co-chair Bobby Walker and chair Peter Giunta, Walker mentioned a mutual friend who had dated an “obese Indian woman,” according to the report. Giunta replied that the woman was not Indian, to which Douglass responded: “She just didn’t bathe often.”
After Douglass made a comment about a peer’s Jewish colleague potentially making a procedural mistake, Douglass’ wife, a Young Republicans committee member, responded, stating, “you’re giving nationals to (sic) much credit and expecting the Jew to be honest.”
The Politico exposé revealed members of the Young Republicans Telegram chat referring to rape as “epic” and expressing “love” for Hitler, in addition to a slew of other racist and homophobic comments. 
After the news broke, Douglass did not respond to media inquiries but released a statement that denounced and condemned the comments in the Politico story and said he was still deciding what to do. He sought to distance himself from the group chat but did not apologize for his involvement, instead telling his constituents he regretted the unwanted attention the story had caused. 
Despite the widespread calls for Douglass’ immediate resignation, including from other Republicans in the Northeast Kingdom, Vermont GOP Chair Paul Dame was a rare exception. Dame called the group chat “shocking and grotesque” but said Douglass’ comments were not bigoted or racist. 
“If Sen. Douglass can not meet the minimum standard for informing the public about issues he is involved in, then I will also join the Governor and legislative colleagues in calling on him to resign,” he said in the press release.
Hours later, though, the executive committee of the state GOP issued its own press release retracting Dame’s statement. 
“The Vermont Republican Party (“VTGOP”) Executive Committee stands united with Governor Phil Scott and the Republican Senate and House leadership and calls for the immediate resignation of Senator Sam Douglass,” they wrote in the press release. “The VTGOP Executive Committee condemns the hateful, racist, and antisemitic messages revealed in a national Young Republican group chat.”
In an interview this week Vice President J.D. Vance called the exposed messages stupid jokes made by “kids.”

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)The University of Louisville has suspended a student group supporting Palestinian rights after President Gerry Bradley’s Oct. 10 inaugural speech was interrupted by protesters, some of whom shouted “Genocide Gerry” and carried flags.
Five UofL students and two former students were issued citations on charges of criminal trespass, according to a statement issued Thursday by Louisville Students for Justice in Palestine. The statement said the group is “interim suspended.”
According to a video the student group posted online, a protestor can be heard yelling “Genocide Gerry” during Bradley’s speech. 
After the suspension, the group rallied on campus Oct. 13, calling on university administrators to reinstate it and demanding that UofL divest investments in Israel. A student was issued a citation when university police stopped protesters who were setting up an encampment, the group said. In its statement, the group said university police “violently struck down, breaking through a human chain of students, faculty, and community members to remove tents and canopies.” 
UofL spokesman John Karman said that as of Friday, Louisville Students for Justice in Palestine remains suspended. 
Bradley sent a campus-wide message on Oct. 13 saying the university is “a strong advocate for its students’ rights to free speech and free assembly,” but added that Louisville Students for Justice in Palestine “has been warned multiple times about conduct on campus.” 
“Our free speech policies allow students to take a position on issues that inspire them and to use their voices to raise concerns, support others and call for change,” Bradley wrote. “They are not allowed, however, to disrupt university business or activities or to endanger their fellow students or faculty and staff. There are consequences for students and other members of the UofL community who do not follow university policies and directives.” 
The UofL Board of Trustees appointed Bradley, who was UofL’s executive vice president and university provost, as president in the spring following the departure of former President Kim Schatzel.
In its statement, Louisville Students for Justice in Palestine issued demands of UofL administration: 

“Disclose all direct and indirect investments from the university’s endowment by companies that are complicit in Israel’s genocide
Disclose all university partnerships with companies complicit in Israel’s apartheid and genocide in Gaza
Make all of these disclosures publicly available and accessible.
Remove all investments in companies that are complicit in the Israeli genocide of Gazans and their apartheid state.
Dissolve all partnerships with companies complicit in the Israeli apartheid.”

In an Instagram post, Louisville Students for Justice in Palestine said Bradley “spoke highly of free speech and hailed UofL as a morally righteous institution, all the while he refuses dialogue with his students, forcing them to disrupt, and then repressing and punishing students afterwards.” 
“UofL has exposed itself for what it is, an institution blindly committed to zionism and genocide before its students,” the group said at the time. 
The tension on the Kentucky university campus comes as colleges nationwide grapple with balancing students’ rights to protest. Campus demonstrations were held across the country in 2024. 
Last week, a group of students in support of Palestinian rights filed a lawsuit against the University of South Florida, claiming the university violated members’ constitutional rights after expelling one student and disciplining others.
State lawmakers who are part of the Kentucky Israel Caucus issued a letter to university presidents in 2023 calling on them to sign a statement that “condemns Hamas and affirms the humanity of Israelis and Palestinians alike.” That letter said that Schatzel, the former UofL president, had signed such a statement. 
Earlier this year, the Kentucky General Assembly enacted a law banning diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives at the state’s public universities. Part of that directed the universities to adopt “viewpoint neutrality” policies and avoid taking political stances.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_3824-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-17 17:57:31.850907

(Photo by Marc Piscotty/Getty Images)Among the dozens of petitions the U.S. Supreme Court rejected this week was one from a Sarasota resident who challenged Florida’s closed primary election system.
Michael J. Polelle is a former attorney and emeritus professor at the University of Illinois Chicago School of Law. An independent voter, he was upset after moving to Sarasota in 2012 and learning that as a nonparty-affiliated (NPA) voter, he was shut out of county commission primaries because of the state’s closed system.
Florida is one of a minority of states with closed primaries. That system locks out the nearly 3.4 million Floridians registered as NPA, as well as 443,000 more who are registered with a minor political party — more than 28% of the electorate.
In a phone interview this week, Polelle, 87, told the Phoenix that while he was bothered by not being able to vote in the primaries in 2012, he wasn’t willing to do anything about it at the time. But he said his feelings changed after the 2016 election, when he realized how “fragile” the election system was, and how it gravitates towards polarization.

“But then what really struck me is that I never realized that my real estate taxes go to pay for these primaries that I can’t vote in. And that makes no sense to me,” he said.
Without the aid of a law firm but with assistance from some of the legal contacts he’s maintained in Chicago, he filed a lawsuit in 2022 in the U.S. Middle District Court of Florida challenging the state’s ban on open primaries, saying it violates his rights under the First Amendment and Equal Protection Clause to political free speech and association. Florida Secretary of State Cord Byrd and Sarasota County Supervisor of Elections Ron Turner were listed as defendants.
U.S. District Judge Steven D. Merryday dismissed the case in November 2022, ruling that Polelle lacked standing and had failed to state a claim for relief. Merryday also found that Florida’s interest in preventing unaffiliated voters’ potential to undermine a political party’s candidate-selection process outweighed his desire to vote in a partisan primary election, especially given the minimal burdens that Florida law imposes on voters who wish to join or switch political parties.
He then filed an appeal last year with the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. In an 112-page ruling released in March, a three-judge panel rejected his arguments.
The ruling said that Polelle had “both the right to a meaningful vote and the right not to be associated with certain political groups and messages. And Florida’s closed primary burdens those rights.” They added that “Florida’s system of closed primary elections may put Polelle to a ‘Hobson’s Choice,’ but it does not do so unconstitutionally.”
Two of the three justices did write that Polelle had standing to sue the Sarasota County Supervisor of Elections, which Polelle considers “a big win, because prior cases said that people like me, who are not affiliated with a party, don’t even have rights to sue.”
He petitioned for the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case, with the Independent Voter Project, Open Primaries, and the Forward Party filing a joint amicus brief in support of his lawsuit, which was denied earlier this week.
Polelle cited in his legal brief that polls show there are more voters who call themselves independent than do a Republican or Democrat. A 2024 Gallup survey showed that 43% of Americans considered themselves independents, with 28% calling themselves Democrat and 28% Republican.
Meanwhile, the Florida Democratic Party is engaging in an internal discussion about whether to open future primary elections to NPA voters. Polelle said he received an email from Democratic chair Nikki Fried as his lawsuit was pending, and also heard from Mitchell Berger, an attorney with the party, who asked to see his legal briefs. Polelle says he’s never heard back from him, “so I figured they haven’t really decided what they’re going to do.”

(Photo by Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas lawmakers expressed concern about the state of the agriculture industry Friday and agreed to urge the federal government to provide financial aid to keep farmers afloat.
Commodity crop farmers are facing one of their worst periods in decades as a result of skyrocketing production costs and stagnant demand. Agriculture industry leaders told lawmakers last month in Stuttgart that 25% to 40% of farmers are likely to leave the industry after this season unless they receive aid.
Rep. DeAnn Vaught, R-Horatio, chairs the House Agriculture subcommittee that met in Stuttgart and has worked as a farmer herself. She said Friday during the Arkansas Legislative Council’s monthly meeting that there is “a tsunami coming” for Arkansas farmers.
“One out of every three farms shutting down in the state of Arkansas is going to affect that budget that’s sitting there in front of you,” she told Finance and Administration Secretary Jim Hudson. “And if we don’t start looking and forecasting out for that just in case the tsunami is coming, then we are failing the people of Arkansas.”
‘A dire strait’: 1 in 3 farms could close without aid, Arkansas agriculture leaders tell lawmakers

Federal lawmakers are responsible for renewing a sweeping agriculture bill every five years to set both policy and funding levels for the industry. Congress has repeatedly extended the 2018 farm bill a year at a time, but it expired Sept. 30 of this year, the day before the ongoing government shutdown began.
The shutdown is increasing farmers’ frustrations, said Senate Majority Leader Blake Johnson, a Corning Republican and longtime farmer. He told the council that “the whole U.S. agriculture sector” could go to Washington D.C. and “shut that place down” in their efforts to secure stability for the industry.
Johnson later clarified in an interview that he was not aware of concrete plans for farmers to go to D.C. and demand aid, but he emphasized that the agriculture industry needs help by the end of November.
“These guys, who are at the breaking point, have got to know something before the first of the year,” Johnson told the Advocate. “Those plans will be made for next year going into December, and they’ve got to know where they stand.”
Hudson told the Legislative Council that he is aware of “some liquidation of farming operations” and that Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders has been petitioning the U.S. Department of Agriculture for farm aid.

“It’s incredibly unfortunate those farmers are hurting,” Hudson said. “I think this is a trade issue that needs to get resolved at a national and international level.”
He attributed some of the agriculture industry’s struggles to “predatory behavior by a foreign nation,” specifically China. Vaught said farmers’ primary problems are not China or tariffs implemented by President Donald Trump.
“Prices have been bad for three consecutive years,” she said in an interview. “We’ve had increases in our input and decreases in the amount of money that you’re receiving for your products. Because of that, it’s truly affecting the farmers and what they can borrow, how they can continue to farm, because [with] those inputs going up and getting less and less money, at some point bankers look at you and say, ‘I’m sorry, I can’t lend you any more money.’”
The council passed a resolution presented by Vaught and Sen. Clarke Tucker, D-Little Rock, to “respectfully urge President Donald J. Trump to implement targeted relief for Arkansas farmers in 2025.”
Resolutions are recommendations rather than policy, but Vaught said she is hopeful the resolution will help Sanders and Arkansas’ congressmen make a case for farm aid. Republican U.S. Sen. John Boozman chairs the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee, one of the committees responsible for drafting the farm bill.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-17 20:54:34+00:00,CT Mirror,"Child posed as dead New Britain girl in meeting, DCF says",Laura Tillman and Ginny Monk,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/17/new-britain-girl-dcf-involvement/,DCF says the girl’s mother allegedly had another child impersonate the girl during a wellness check early this year.,"The Department of Children and Families says that the mother of a New Britain girl whose decomposing remains were found earlier this month had another child impersonate the girl during a wellness check with the child welfare agency early this year, months after the preteen is believed to have died. 
The remains of Jacqueline “Mimi” Torres-García were found on Oct. 8 in New Britain in a plastic container. Lamakers and advocates have demanded answers from DCF about the nature of the department’s involvement in the life of Torres-García and her family, and questioned how such a tragedy could have occurred. 
The case has also spurred renewed attention in the lack of monitoring of homeschooled children in the state, as details emerged that the girl’s parents appeared to have used homeschooling as a cover for Torres-García’s absence from school after her death.
On Friday, DCF provided some details of its role in Torres-García’s life. According to the department, it first became involved with the girl’s family when she was born. At the time, Torres-García’s mother, Karla García, was in a detention center so the baby was placed with a relative where she remained until May 2022, when she was 9 years old. That year, her parents sought guardianship of both Torres-García and her younger sibling, which was granted by the court, a decision supported by DCF at the time. 
“The Department’s recommendation was made after conducting a review of the family’s history and current circumstances, an interview with Jacqueline and her sibling and an assessment of the parents’ current ability to care for them at that time,” according to a statement provided by DCF. 
The department then interacted with the Torres-García “during a subsequent investigation” in September 2022 involving her younger siblings but there was not enough evidence to substantiate child abuse or neglect. DCF closed the case in November 2022. 
In the following two years, DCF says it had no involvement with the family, although it notes that Karla Garcia filed and was granted sole custody of Torres-García and a sibling in June 2024.
But in January of this year, allegations were again made against García, regarding the treatment of Torres-García’s younger sibling. As DCF checked on the sibling and then attempted to check on Torres-García, her mother told DCF employees that she was being homeschooled and had gone to visit a relative out of state. In response, “DCF conducted a video call with a person who (the) mother claimed to be Jacqueline.” But police have said they believe that Jacqueline had died months earlier. DCF, apparently satisfied with that call, closed the case in March 2025. 
The tragic death of Torres-García came to light at a moment when two of the state’s top child welfare positions are vacant — the commissioner of DCF, and the Office of the Child Advocate, a critical role for child welfare that has been vacant since Sarah Eagan resigned from the position in July of 2024. The child advocate is Connecticut’s critical mechanism for investigating state agencies such as DCF that handle the care of the state’s most vulnerable children. 
“This horrific situation should not have happened, and we are angry to hear that our state’s systems did not protect Jacqueline,” said Children’s Committee co-chairs Sen. Ceci Maher, D-Wilton and Rep. Corey Paris, D-Stamford, in a Thursday statement. “As we learn more, it is becoming apparent that the Department of Children and Families failed her; DCF has one of the most important roles in our state and when it accepts less than 110%, our most vulnerable children are left in harm’s way, with children like Jacqueline suffering the consequences. 
“It’s clear that DCF did not meet the moment here, and we need answers as to how and why this happened, as well as assurances that we can make certain it never happens again.”
Police found the decomposed remains of Torres-García inside a plastic storage bin in New Britain on Oct. 8 after receiving a  phone tip about suspicious activity at an abandoned building. Police say they believe she may have been dead for as long as a year before her remains were discovered. Depending on when she was killed, she would have been either 11 or 12 years old. 
Police say the child’s mother and mother’s boyfriend had previously hidden her body in their basement before a family move. Both adults, along with the girl’s aunt, have been charged with felonies in relation to the murder. Those arrested had criminal histories, some of which dealt with the treatment of children, according to court records.
Karla Garcia was convicted of third-degree assault in 2018. The child’s aunt, Jackelyn Garcia, was convicted of risk of injury to a child in 2022. In 2020, Jonatan Nanita, the mother’s boyfriend, was convicted on a reckless endangerment charge, according to court records. 
Police say there is evidence Jacqueline suffered extensively before her death from malnutrition and physical abuse. 
New Britain Mayor Erin Stewart said during a Monday press conference that no one reported the girl missing, and that the family had a prior history with DCF. The agency confirmed that the girl’s siblings have since been taken into their custody. 
DCF’s interim Commissioner Susan Hamilton said the department is conducting a review of their history with the family.
“We have already begun a thorough review of our history with the family,” Hamilton said in a statement. “Consistent with our practice, this multidisciplinary review will include our knowledge about the family, supports provided, casework decisions, adherence to policy, as well as communication and collaboration with other system and community partners.”
Josh Michtom, a senior attorney at the Center for Children’s Advocacy, said that even at such a tragic moment, policymakers should remember that removing kids from their parents is, in many cases, harmful.
““Unfortunately I think a very, very good system, which we do not have, wouldn’t prevent every tragedy, but removing more children won’t prevent them either,” Michtom said. “We need well-supported offices, mental health care, and an oversight body and I don’t think we have any of those things right now.”
Information provided by DCF that shows the family appears to have effectively used the pretense of homeschooling to deceive caseworkers, has also put renewed pressure on the state to address a total lack of oversight for homeschooling. 
The case comes on the heels of the highly publicized case of a Waterbury man who was allegedly imprisoned for decades by his now-deceased father and stepmother after being pulled out of public school around the fifth grade.
An OCA report released in May found that lax homeschooling regulations have resulted in some Connecticut children not getting a proper education, while the opaque system has been used to cover up abuse.
In 2023, another child was found locked away and abused after he had been removed from school for homeschooling. And, in 2017, a Connecticut teenager died after prolonged abuse and neglect, and it was later discovered that his parents had pulled his sister out of school for homeschooling, according to the report.
Over the past three years in Connecticut, about 5,200 children have been withdrawn from public school to be homeschooled, state officials said Monday. This number doesn’t include students who have been homeschooled for their entire education.
Christina Ghio, who has been working as the acting child advocate for more than a year, said this week that her agency has begun a comprehensive investigation of the Torres-García case that will examine DCF’s involvement with the family and the role of about homeschooling in the case
Though too early to draw conclusions, Ghio wrote in a statement that, “On the issue of homeschooling, we know from previous investigations that some parents use Connecticut’s complete lack of oversight of homeschooled children to withdraw their children from school, isolate them, shield themselves from reports to our child welfare agency, and neglect or abuse their children. This is a known policy issue that the state must address.”
Rep. Liz Linehan, D-Cheshire, also expressed concern about the lack of regulation for homeschooled children. 
“It was my position then, and it is my position now, that the law allows for abusive parents to exploit loopholes and unenroll their children from public school under the guise of homeschooling to prevent a DCF referral from the school if a child is being abused.”
“The real questions have nothing whatsoever to do with homeschool,” said Diane Connors, the founder and co-president of CT Homeschool Network, asking why the child was left with relatives who had come to the state’s attention previously. “DCF failed yet again, those are the real issues that need to be addressed, not homeschooling.” 
Rep. Patrick Biggins, D-Manchester, convened a working group earlier this year to examine homeschool issues and regulations, but that group quickly disbanded. Biggins said he views this case as separate from homeschooling.
“I think that shouldn’t be because of this tragedy,” Biggins said of the law. “It should be because it’s the right thing to do. We shouldn’t be reactive in the laws that we implement.”
He said he doesn’t want to discuss a potential proposal to regulate homeschooling until more details are ironed out.
Rob Blanchard, a spokesman for Gov. Ned Lamont, said that the governor is open to conversation about homeschooling regulations.
“The governor continues to be supportive of ideas or approaches that keep kids safe,” Blanchard said Friday.
Children’s Committee ranking member Rep. Anne Dauphinais, R-Killingly, said state lawmakers and the community need answers about the case from DCF and about the school interactions.
“However, the rush by some to scapegoat homeschooling and formulate policy changes goes too far,” Dauphinais said in a statement. “We must have a full accounting of what transpired to ensure accountability and develop appropriate responses. To do otherwise would be a failure of our responsibility to learn the right lessons from this heartbreaking loss.”
Many lawmakers believe the problem lies with DCF, and say the agency must be transparent about what happened in this case.
“The system failed Mimi on multiple levels,” said a joint statement from Sen. Jason Perillo, R-Shelton and Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield. “We owe it to her to demand answers. Thorough investigations must be conducted.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Jacqueline-22Mimi22-Torres-Garcia-Memorial-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-17 17:02:16.801020

BURLINGTON – A Florida man has been sentenced to serve a little more than three years in prison for his role in an international “grandparent scam” that defrauded older Americans, including those in Vermont, out of millions of dollars. 
The case provides an inside look at what prosecutors termed a highly sophisticated scheme that involved dozens of people posing in various and specific roles to carry it out, from fake bail bondsmen to phony attorneys. 
“This is one of the most extraordinarily serious fraud schemes that I’ve seen in my years on the bench,” federal Judge William K. Sessions III, said Thursday in ordering a 37-month prison term for Dave Leblanc during a hearing in U.S. District Court in Burlington. Sessions has served as a federal judge since 1995. 
Leblanc, 28, of Greenacres, Florida, had earlier pleaded guilty to a federal charge of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. 
Assistant U.S. Attorney Nathanael Burris, the prosecutor, said in court Thursday that Leblanc was the latest among roughly a half-dozen defendants who have been sentenced in connection with the scam. Several more people were facing pending charges or warrants for their arrests. 
Earlier this year, federal authorities in Vermont announced they had charged 25 Canadian nationals in connection with the “grandparent scam” that defrauded older Americans out of more than $21 million. 
Between the summer of 2021 and June 4, 2024, those charged engaged in a scam involving phone calls made from call centers in and around Montreal, according to charging documents.
The scam, according to federal authorities, defrauded individuals in Vermont and more than 40 other states. 
The defendants falsely claimed during phone calls to be an elderly victim’s relative, often a grandchild, who had been arrested and was in need of bail money, the documents stated. 
Leblanc, as well as others charged in the scam, would pose a “bail bondsman” or direct others to pick up packages of bulk cash at locations where the victims had mailed the money, court records stated.
“(Leblanc) and his immediate co-conspirators personally collected between $2,500,000 and $3,000,000 and participated in the laundering of this money to co-conspirators in the United States and Canada,” Burris wrote in a sentencing document filed ahead of Thursday’s hearing.
Burris called on the judge to sentence Leblanc to 10 years in prison, citing in large part the vulnerability of the elderly victims the scam preyed on, many of whom were in their 80s and 90s.
“Had Leblanc taken $3,000,000 from a bank vault, his conduct would be considered exceptionally serious, and there would be no question that just punishment would include a substantial sentence of incarceration,” Burris wrote. “The fact that he instead took the money from the hands of his elderly victims should be viewed as comparatively more serious.”
Burris called the organization of the scam “highly sophisticated,” with people even creating and maintaining payroll records for those involved.
The players involved, Burris added, also had distinct roles, from those staffing and managing the call centers to others responsible for collecting and laundering the money.  
After the initial caller contacted a grandparent, a second person posing as an “attorney” representing the family member in trouble would then tell the elderly victim in the scam to provide a “large sum of cash,” often thousands of dollars, to help bail out the family member from jail, Burris wrote. 
“The attorneys involved in this scam often identify themselves by various fictitious names, which sometimes are re-used in connection with calls to multiple elderly victims,” the prosecutor wrote. “The elderly victim is then instructed to provide the ‘bail money’ to a ‘bail bondsman’ who comes to the elderly victim’s home later the same day.”
Also, Burris wrote, the attorney tells the elderly victim that there is a “gag order” in effect that prohibits the victim from discussing the matter with anyone, adding that doing so could create more problems for the family member they are trying to help.
The call centers, sometimes called “boiler rooms,” can be located in places such as warehouses, office buildings, residences, condominiums or rental properties, Burris wrote.
“A manager may also be present in the call center and is usually responsible for logistics, such as making sure the telephones used by the call center are ready each day,” the prosecutor wrote. “The manager also controls the ‘leads’ — personal identifying information of elderly individuals in the United States purchased by the call centers for cents per lead.”
Michael Straub, Leblanc’s attorney, argued during Thursday’s hearing for a prison term of no more than 25 months for his client. 
He said Leblanc had no prior criminal record and was in his early 20s when he began his role in the scam and has since matured and become a valued member of his community. Straub said Leblanc’s role in the overall scheme was limited.
Leblanc also spoke, apologizing for his actions leading to the criminal case against him. He said he offered his “deepest condolences” to those who lost money in the scheme.
“I was young and immature at the time,” he told Sessions, adding, “I do feel terrible about this situation.” 
Vermont’s attorney general urges people who may be targeted by the scam to take the following precautions:

Resist the urge to act immediately.
Write down the phone number of the caller and hang up the phone.
If the caller references a family member, call that family member or another person who can verify their whereabouts and well-being.

,DC,2025-10-17 20:51:47+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,No Kings day expected to draw millions for anti-Trump mass protests,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/no-kings-day-expected-draw-millions-anti-trump-mass-protests,,"WASHINGTON — More than 2,600 nonviolent demonstrations against President Donald Trump’s administration are slated Saturday as part of No Kings day.The second No Kings day, following another in June, is in response to what a broad coalition of liberal advocacy and labor organizations say is “the increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption of the Trump administration, which they have doubled down on since June.”  Organizers expect millions of Americans to join in peaceful events in Washington, D.C., across the country and internationally. Locations are pinpointed on a map on the organization’s website.“No Kings is back,” said Eunic Epstein-Ortiz, a national spokesperson, at a press conference Thursday. “And over the past few months, thousands of people have organized once again in their communities, on the ground locally, volunteering to bring their neighbors, families and friends together to say, unequivocally, we have no kings. Together, they’re the ones making this Saturday’s mobilization the largest single-day protest in modern history.”Among the states:In Utah, Salt Lake City’s No Kings protest organizers canceled the march portion of the event and are instead holding a longer demonstration at the state Capitol, according to the Utah News Dispatch.In Maine, at least 30 No Kings events are set to be held, per the Maine Morning Star.In Nevada, demonstrators in downtown Las Vegas will again be confined to sidewalks, the Nevada Current reports, citing high permit costs.In Kentucky, nearly 30 No Kings protests are popping up in the Bluegrass State, according to the Kentucky Lantern.Ten No Kings protests are planned in North Dakota, according to the North Dakota Monitor.In Arkansas, the Arkansas Advocate reports that the protests in more than a dozen cities come as the potential for severe weather ratchets up at the same time the events are scheduled.Shutdown, Trump crackdown since June protestsThe demonstrations build off the No Kings protests in June, which coincided with Trump’s massive military parade on his 79th birthday.Four months later, the federal government is mired in an ongoing shutdown that began Oct. 1 with no clear end in sight. The administration has also cracked down on U.S. cities, deploying National Guard troops and partaking in sweeping immigration raids. Leading voices from labor and advocacy groups that are part of the broad No Kings coalition amplified their message ahead of the planned protests during the Thursday press conference, underscoring a peaceful day of action on Saturday. “We’re going to vigorously exercise our democratic rights peacefully and nonviolently, and against this tyrannical threat of Donald Trump and his administration, we are going to protect American democracy,” said Robert Weissman, co-president of Public Citizen.House speaker criticizes No Kings day National leaders from the coalition also pushed back against U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson’s depiction of the demonstrations as the “hate America rally.”

The Louisiana Republican claimed on Fox News Oct. 10 that “it’s all the pro-Hamas wing and the antifa people — they’re all coming out,” adding: “Some of the House Democrats are selling T-shirts for the event, and it’s being told to us that they won’t be able to reopen the government until after that rally because they can’t face their rabid base.”Leah Greenberg, co-founder of Indivisible, said “there is nothing more American than saying that we don’t have kings and exercising our right to peaceful protest,” adding: “America doesn’t have kings. That’s our entire point.” Greenberg said: “I also want to be clear: it is ridiculous, it’s also sinister, because it is part of a broader effort to create a permission structure to crack down on organized opposition and peaceful dissent in this country. “They are sending the National Guard into American cities, they are terrorizing our immigrant friends and neighbors with their secret police, they are prosecuting political opponents, and now they are trying to smear millions of Americans who are coming out to protest so that they can justify a crackdown on peaceful dissent.” Katie Bethell, executive director of MoveOn, said “let’s be crystal clear about who is peacefully taking the streets on Saturday — it’s teachers, federal workers, nurses, families, our neighbors and our friends. “All of our leaders, Republicans and Democrats alike, should listen to what these patriotic Americans have to say,” Bethell said. “The millions of people protesting are centered around a fierce love of our country, a country that we believe is worth fighting for,” she said. “This is the reality across cities and towns, large and small, rural and suburban, in red areas, blue areas — millions of us are peacefully coming together on Saturday to send a clear and unmistakable message: The power belongs to the people.”In other states: The Ohio Capital Journal noted dozens of No Kings protests set to take place in the Buckeye State.About 40 No Kings protests are planned in Indiana, according to the Indiana Capital Chronicle.Rhode Island is expected to see at least 10 No Kings protests, according to the Rhode Island Current.More than 100 communities across Michigan plan to hold No Kings rallies, the Michigan Advance reports.In Arizona — where more than 60 No Kings protests are anticipated — high turnout is expected even in the state’s rural Republican strongholds, according to the Arizona Mirror.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-10-17 17:02:16.801020

(Photo illustration by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)State contractor Deloitte has agreed to pay a proposed $6.3 million under a settlement to resolve claims related to last year’s RIBridges data breach filed Thursday in U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island.
The proposed agreement, filed Thursday in U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, still needs final approval from a federal judge, but members of the class — a total of 735,501 people, according to court filings — could receive an estimated $100 with no documentation of identity theft needed.
But those checks could quickly shrink as the settlement fund needs to pay for attorneys’ costs and other legal fees. The more claims there are, the smaller the payouts will be.
A Deloitte spokesperson declined to comment when reached by email Friday. 
Settlement in the works to resolve RIBridges class action lawsuit

The settlement agreement notes that “Deloitte denies all liability and wrongdoing,” and the agreement shields the company from future litigation by people who do not send a request to opt out, whether or not they submit a claim. 
Tim Rondeau, a spokesperson for Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha, said via email Friday that “The State is not a named party to this action and did not participate in this settlement.” But the deal does shield the state — by declaring it a “released party” — and its agencies from any related lawsuits by class members who don’t opt out of compensation. 
“The State had a contract with Deloitte for IT and computer processing of the state programs such as food stamps,” Peter Wasylyk, part of the plaintiffs’ legal team, said.
The case was originally filed last December, after the breach was first made public, by Wasylyk on behalf of food stamps and other public benefit recipients whose personal data was impacted. RIBridges is the unified platform made and still currently run by Deloitte which helps residents access public benefits and the state’s health insurance marketplace. The data plundered by cybercrime outfit Brain Cipher in the breach included information used to apply for these services. 
The case was eventually consolidated with several other named plaintiffs into the current class action suit.
While the state is not named as a defendant in the suit, its inclusion as a party released from future litigation is not unusual in a large class action lawsuit. In law, the concept of “global peace” often extends future legal protections to entities beyond the ones being specifically sued.
Meanwhile, both parties are still waiting for updates, and Wasylyk said the court is still reviewing the settlement agreement. The agreement will need a preliminary approval and a final approval. Claims will be due before the judge issues final approval. 
An approximate timeline in the agreement would see the final approval hearing take place “at least 100 days after the motion for preliminary approval” is filed, meaning sometime in Jan. 2026, but that schedule could change with the availability of U.S. District Judge Melissa R. Dubose, who is assigned to the case.
Claims will eventually be open for submission on a website and toll-free line run by Kroll, a firm noted for its settlement administration services. After a judge’s preliminary approval, Kroll will also send out postcard notices to eligible class members, with information on how to submit claims by mail. Those postcards will go out within 30 days of the judge’s preliminary approval. 
Anyone who received an RIBridges breach notice earlier this year is likely eligible to stake a claim. Class members can opt out of the settlement benefits if they so choose. Otherwise, they remain eligible for one of the following:

Reimbursement up to $5,000 with third-party documentation like phone records, receipts, emails, and so on, that show evidence of harm or identity theft from the breach. 
An estimated $100 reimbursement, no documentation needed.

Kroll will also handle opt-out requests, which requires class members to “send a request…or written notice” asking to be excluded from settlement. The deadline to opt out or submit objections is 30 days before the final approval hearing. Class members who do not submit or opt out will not receive any compensation, and they will also lose their ability for future litigation.
The settlement also provides all class members, regardless of which reimbursement they choose, the option to sign up for two years of medical data monitoring from CyEx.
Wasylyk said Friday that the $100 is the baseline both parties agreed to, and that class members could see more money if there aren’t enough claimants to “exhaust” the full $6.3 million.
“In that case a pro-rata increase to more than $100 would go to class members,” Wasylyk explained. 
But the settlement agreement details that these payouts are subject to “pro rata increase or decrease,” meaning they go up or down depending on the final number of claims. The total $6.3 million windfall also includes attorneys’ fees and other litigation costs, as well as the expense of the CyEx medical monitoring.
A draft of the claim submission form clearly delineates the money that could be deducted from the total: “up to one-third of the $6,300,000 Settlement Fund ($2,100,000), plus reimbursement of costs” for the class’ legal team, plus “Service Awards in the amount of $2,500 to each Class Representative,” which are the named plaintiffs in the class suit.
After people choose how to be paid, any residual funds would go toward the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a digital-privacy nonprofit based in Washington, D.C, after 240 days.

Our population is booming, our industries are expanding, and new investments are flowing into communities across the state. As we welcome these opportunities, it’s important to remember that the very qualities that make our state competitive — our landscapes, waterways and quality of life — must be safeguarded.
Economic growth and conservation must go hand in hand if we want progress that is resilient, responsible and sustainable.
That’s where Sustain South Carolina comes in.
As the CEO of Sustain SC, I lead a business-driven organization focused on forging practical, market-based solutions that enhance South Carolina’s competitiveness. We
unite industry leaders, government entities and local stakeholders to strengthen the private sector while preserving the natural resources and agrarian culture that drive our way of life in South Carolina.
To give structure to that vision, we created the “Roadmap to Sustain SC.”
The roadmap outlines high-impact strategies — attracting new industries, modernizing production, fostering a circular economy and boosting resilience against flooding and water scarcity.
These are not abstract ideas — they are economic levers.
Consider this: over the past two years, energy-storage companies have announced nearly $8 billion in capital investment in South Carolina.
That commitment underscores how battery technology and energy resilience are already driving job growth, strengthening the grid and positioning South Carolina as a rising leader in the clean-energy economy.
This October, these conversations will take center stage at our fourth annual Sustainability Symposium, the state’s premier event for business and community leaders working at the intersection of commerce and conservation.
The symposium will highlight South Carolina’s defining challenges and opportunities — from strengthening resiliency through land and water conservation to advancing economic development through clean energy and innovation.
We are proud to welcome James Dozier, founder and board president of Centerline Action, as our keynote speaker.
For nearly 20 years, James has been at the nexus of federal and state advocacy, political strategy and grassroots campaigns. He brings a unique background in Republican politics and business advocacy, offering perspectives that frame South Carolina’s opportunity to lead nationally by pairing economic growth with conservation.

The symposium isn’t just about ideas – it’s about action.
Sustain SC has already delivered results through our Land and Water Action Platform, where corporate investments have helped to conserve critical watersheds and preserved natural landscapes like Waites Island.
This year’s symposium builds on that model of success, showcasing how partnerships between business leaders, conservationists, and policymakers can deliver results that strengthen communities and drive prosperity.
South Carolinians support this vision.
We regularly poll voters to stay grounded in what matters most, and our recent statewide survey of 1,200 likely Republican primary voters — conducted with The Nature Conservancy — revealed compelling support for linking conservation and economic growth:

83% said conserving land and water is essential for both growth and environmental protection.
81% support land conservation to preserve natural and historic resources.
82% believe water management must balance economic use with recreation.
73% favor resilience investments that leverage state dollars to secure federal and private funding for flood prevention and mitigation.
72.9% of respondents support South Carolina adding and using more renewable energy resources such as new nuclear, hydrogen, biomass, solar and wind.

These numbers confirm what we see on the ground every day: economic and environmental resilience are two sides of the same coin.
Our mission is not to saddle businesses with mandates, but to create smart opportunities for investment, efficiency and resilience that benefit both the bottom line and quality of life.
If you care about private-sector growth, job creation, small business opportunities and smart investments in our future, we invite you to join us at our fourth annual Sustainability Symposium on Thursday, Oct. 23, and be part of shaping what comes next.

Karen Lueders, a Democrat from Lincoln and a lawyer who has served on several nonprofit boards in Addison County, will fill the vacant House seat left by Democrat Mari Cordes. 
Gov. Phil Scott announced Lueders’ appointment in a press release on Friday. 
“With many years of public service, I believe she will be an effective legislator and represent her constituents well,” Scott said in the release.
The district, composed of Lincoln, Bristol, Starksboro, and Monkton, was previously represented by Cordes, who resigned her seat earlier this year, spurred by personal and political factors to move to Canada. 
At the time, Cordes told VTDigger she had feared for her safety since President Donald Trump’s first presidential term. A member of the LGBTQ+ community, she said that in her past six years as a representative, she had received two death threats. 
The governor has authority to appoint replacements to fill legislative vacancies and traditionally selects a replacement from the same party as the outgoing representative.
Lueders serves on the board of Addison Housing Works, an affordable housing nonprofit in the county, and previously served on the boards of Addison County Home Health and Hospice as well as Habitat for Humanity, according to the release. She is slated to serve the rest of Cordes’ two-year term. 
Lueders did not immediately respond to phone calls seeking comment Friday afternoon.
“I am grateful to the Governor for the opportunity to represent Addison-4 in the Vermont House of Representatives,” she said in the release. “I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House to find solutions for the complex concerns that affect our communities across the state.”
Lueders’ son, Tim Lueders-Dumont, is executive director of the Vermont Department of State’s Attorneys and Sheriffs.

(Courtesy Duke Rodriguez)New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham crossed out several provisions in a $162 million spending package state lawmakers approved during a special session earlier this month, an act that a prominent cannabis CEO contends in a new lawsuit is unconstitutional. 
Duke Rodriguez, the CEO of Ultra Health Cannabis who is publicly weighing a run for governor as a Republican, filed a lawsuit Thursday asking the New Mexico Supreme Court to undo the governor’s vetoes.
He argued that the governor striking language from House Bill 1, a spending bill lawmakers approved in early October to counteract federal funding cuts, disrupts the balance of power between the Legislature and the executive branch. 
In the Running: Who’s in, who’s out for the 2026 NM governor race

Each of the line-item vetoes “distorts legislative intent and is therefore an unconstitutional attempt by the Executive to substitute her policy-making judgment for that of the people’s elected representatives,” the lawsuit alleges.
The bill awarded $12 million to the state Health Care Authority “to maintain the minimum federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefit for elders and people with disabilities.” But the governor struck the words “minimum federal.”  
Rodriguez’s lawsuit argues that removing that language illegally allows the executive branch to expand SNAP benefits beyond the minimum federal requirements, which was not the state Legislature’s intent. 
“The Governor may attempt to use funds appropriated by the Legislature to provide SNAP benefits that exceed the federal minimum, or to provide SNAP benefits to an expanded class of beneficiaries, in direct contravention of legislative intent,” Rodriguez writes in the lawsuit.
The governor also struck language regarding about $6 million aimed at replenishing funding local public broadcasters lost when Congress cut funding to the Center for Public Broadcasting. She removed requirements that the unexpended funding to the state finance and Indian Affairs departments be returned to the general fund, and she removed language requiring the funding to be spent within the next two fiscal years. 
Michael Coleman, the governor’s communications director,, told Source New Mexico on Friday afternoon that Rodriguez’s attempt to speak on behalf of the Legislature’s behalf is “preposterous.”
“Mr. Rodriguez was not present for discussions with lawmakers about the budget, but he appears to be claiming knowledge of the ‘legislative intent’ of these appropriations,” he said, before noting that the Legislature passed the appropriations with broad bipartisan support. “With this lawsuit, Mr. Rodriguez is advocating to take food off the tables of New Mexican families that need it most.”
Wage boost for chile workers hangs in the balance, though some say the state could make it happen

In an Oct. 3 statement Lujan Grisham published detailing the vetoes, she said they were “minor” but necessary changes to counteract “provisions that unduly constrain the Executive Department’s ability to assist New Mexicans.”
Rodriguez is seeking the court’s immediate intervention to determine the constitutional limits of the governor’s line-item veto power. He argues that he has standing to bring the lawsuit as a private citizen because the “separation of powers is an issue of substantial public importance.”
Jacob Candelaria, a former state senator, is representing Rodriguez in court. Candelaria was a Democrat until his last year in office 2022, when he changed his party designation to “Decline to state.” 
He successfully sued Lujan Grisham in 2021 over a similar allegation of the governor usurping the Legislature’s spending power. He argued that lawmakers, not the governor, should be in charge of distributing hundreds of millions of dollars in federal pandemic funding.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Courtsey-Duke-Rodriguez-720x1024.jpg,,,2025-10-17 17:02:16.801020

[…]","South Central Judicial District Judge Jackson Lofgren presides over a trial Jan. 27, 2025, in Bismarck. (Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)Testimony from kids and parents affected by North Dakota’s ban on gender-affirming care for minors wasn’t central to a judge’s decision last week to uphold the statute.
Instead, the ruling hinged on defining who deserves special legal protections and whether the law discriminates on the basis of sex, according to one state constitutional law expert.
The plaintiffs argued that transgender adolescents affected by the bill should be considered a protected class under the law because they are a small minority being forced to conform with government-imposed sex stereotypes.
Quinn Yeargain, an associate professor of law at Michigan State University, agreed, citing the history of discrimination against transgender people in areas like employment, health care and a host of other areas.
“It’s very difficult for me to conclude that transgender status, gender identity, however we want to label it, is not a protected class,” Yeargain said. “There’s every reason to believe that it is.”
Transgender teen urges judge to legalize gender-affirming care for minors in North Dakota

Had South Central Judicial District Judge Jackson Lofgren agreed, the state may have had to work harder to prove the law is constitutional, Yeargain said. But Lofgren felt differently.
As he notes in his opinion, special legal status is typically granted to groups that are politically powerless and have repeatedly faced legal oppression. Courts have also found that an important characteristic of these protected classes is that they’re based on innate, unchangeable qualities — like race and ethnicity.
He rejected the notion that transgender people are politically powerless, pointing to the fact that many people testified in opposition to the health care ban and that other state legislatures and courts have acted in ways that bolster transgender rights. He also wrote that he didn’t see convincing evidence that the Legislature adopted the law out of animus toward transgender people, or that the authors of North Dakota’s constitution were aware of or supportive of transgender people.
Furthermore, Lofgren said he does not consider being transgender an immutable characteristic because people’s gender identities can change over time.
Lofgren also dismissed another of the plaintiffs’ key arguments: that the health care law discriminates based on transgender status.
The plaintiffs argued the law is a form of sex discrimination because it bars minors with gender dysphoria from accessing medical treatments that are otherwise available to kids to treat other medical conditions.
Lofgren concluded the law discriminates only based on age and the purpose of the medical treatment in question.
The U.S. Supreme Court in June came to a similar conclusion in its decision upholding a ban on gender affirming care for minors in Tennessee, which Lofgren cited frequently in his opinion.
North Dakota’s ban on transgender care for minors life-threatening, doctor testifies

The plaintiffs also said the North Dakota law infringes on North Dakotans’ rights to autonomy and self-determination, though Lofgren found that these rights do not bar the state from prohibiting certain medical procedures.
The lawsuit was brought against the state of North Dakota in 2023 by three families with transgender children and a pediatric endocrinologist. Lofgren later dismissed the families and children from the suit, finding they did not have standing to bring it. That left pediatric endocrinologist Luis Casas as the sole plaintiff.
Attorneys for the state of North Dakota argued that the law is constitutional because the state has an interest in regulating the medical profession and protecting minors.
Two transgender adolescents and their parents testified against the ban at a seven-day court trial earlier this year. They described gender-affirming care as life-saving, and said the health care law had forced them to seek treatment out of state.
Their testimony wasn’t discussed in Lofgren’s 85-page order.
Yeargain said this wasn’t surprising, given how Lofgren structured his analysis of the case.
“If the framework of this is there is no historical support for this, and transgender status is not a protected class, and this is not discrimination based on sex and so on, then a lot of those stories are not legally relevant,” Yeargain said.
Absent a finding that the law affects a protected group or restricts an important right, judges evaluate laws in a way that is “highly deferential” to lawmakers, said James Blumstein, a law professor at Vanderbilt University.
That means state legislatures generally have broad latitude to pass laws like the transgender health care ban. Under this framework, courts will let any law stand so long as that law conceivably furthers a legitimate government interest, Blumstein said.
It doesn’t have to be the most logical or effective policy, it just needs to be plausible that the law helps achieve the legislators’ goal, he added.
“The way I like to say it is, you can burn down the barn to kill the rat,” Blumstein said.
In order to have proven the law unconstitutional, the plaintiffs would have had to present overwhelming evidence that withholding gender-affirming care from transgender kids is harmful, said Blumstein.
Judge rules in favor of North Dakota’s ban on transgender care for minors

Jess Braverman, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said this is exactly what they did.
“The evidence at trial clearly showed how hard this ban has hit North Dakota families and transgender adolescents,” Braverman told the North Dakota Monitor last week. “It’s just really disappointing that these families won’t be able to get the health care they need.”
One parent who was formerly a plaintiff in the suit said in a statement through an attorney their family is “heartbroken and angry” about the decision.
“I am proud to stand up for the rights of my family, my child, and all transgender youth and their families in North Dakota who are impacted by this harmful law,” said the parent, who was
anonymous in the lawsuit.
North Dakota Attorney General Drew Wrigley in a statement last week applauded Lofgren’s ruling.
“The district court’s thorough and thoughtful decision makes clear that our elected legislative body appropriately reached this medical health determination and passed legislation that is constitutionally sound,” Wrigley said.
Legal advocacy group Gender Justice, which is representing the plaintiffs, said Friday they had not yet made a decision about whether to appeal.
The evidence
Attorneys for the plaintiffs repeatedly pointed out that mainstream medical associations in America endorse puberty blockers and hormone therapy as a safe and effective way to treat gender dysphoria.
Their witnesses — which included two transgender adolescents and parents, two pediatric endocrinologists, a psychiatrist and psychologist that have treat adolescents with gender dysphoria and other medical experts — said gender-affirming care can be life-saving.
The state’s expert witnesses included two endocrinologists, a psychologist and a psychiatrist. Only one of the state’s witnesses had experience diagnosing people with gender dysphoria.
They testified that there is no robust long-term research exploring the effects of puberty blockers and hormone therapy on minors with gender dysphoria, so minors and their families cannot meaningfully be informed of the benefits or risks of the treatment.
The plaintiffs’ witnesses did not dispute the lack of research, but noted it is difficult to conduct top-tier studies like randomized control trials on children because it’s unethical and expensive. They said that the existing data on gender-affirming care demonstrates it works. They also argued that many mainstream medications have been accepted as safe for use on children without this level of clinical research.
Advocates against gender-affirming care for minors testify in North Dakota trial

Some witnesses for the state also have had the credibility of their testimony disputed in other lawsuits.
The state’s witnesses did not deny that their views were considered fringe in the United States. However, they argued that leading medical associations only endorse gender-affirming care as safe for minors for political reasons.
It was up to the judge to decide whether the evidence indicated the Legislature had a rational basis for passing the health care ban.
Yeargain said that ordinarily in cases like this, judges will defer to lawmakers and are “not involved in the enterprise of really weighing evidence.”
“I don’t necessarily think just as a flat matter that whatever any medical association says automatically should determine the scope of legislation,” Yeargain noted. “On the other hand, I think there’s something to be said when virtually all of the major medical associations that have expertise in these areas and are qualified to opine on them pretty much articulate the same thing.”
Blumstein said he does not consider it concerning that North Dakota lawmakers adopted a policy that goes against the medical establishment.
He said the United States is in a period of transferring political power from institutional experts to elected officials.
“There was a realization that experts are not politically accountable, and having politics in the decision is not a bad thing, it builds accountability,” he said.

Jerry Moran of Kansas advocates for delivery of cruise missiles to Ukraine and more intense economic sanctions on Russia.,"U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kansas, endorses during a Senate speech on Oct. 16, 2025, intensification of economic pressure on Russia and deployment of cruise missiles to Ukraine in an effort to end the war started by Russia in 2022. (Kansas Reflector screen capture of the U.S. Senate's YouTube channel) TOPEKA — U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran reaffirmed Friday a belief that United States’ interests require delivery of long-range missiles to Ukraine and application of intense economic pressure on Russia to end its unjustified military invasion launched in 2022.
Moran, who has represented Kansas in Congress for more than a quarter century, said in a speech Thursday to Senate colleagues the war between Ukraine and Russia was a threat to stability of the United States.
The Republican senator said there was merit to transferring American-made Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine. Making the cruise missiles available to Ukraine would bring high-impact armaments within range of Moscow.
“This weaponry will strengthen Ukraine’s ability to defend its territory, deter further Russian aggression and help level the battlefield as negotiations hopefully move forward,” Moran said. “By providing advanced, precision-strike systems, America demonstrates that our commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty is backed not only by words, but by legitimate support that can alter the course of this war.”
His remarks came after President Donald Trump spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin and before Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
“As the conflict in Ukraine has surpassed the three-year mark, Putin remains undeterred in his mission to carry out his unjust war on the Ukrainian people,” the senator said. “Each day this war continues, lives are lost and the safety, economic stability and global leadership of the United States are threatened. This war must end.”
He commended the Trump administration for considering transfer of the missiles to Ukraine and for promoting conversations between Russia and Ukraine on finding a “durable and just peace.”
Bipartisan legislation pending in Congress should be adopted to intensify sanctions against Russia’s economy and trade, Moran said.
“By cutting off the resources that allow Putin to fund this war, we can hasten the path to success in finding peace,” he said. “It is imperative that the United States stands firm in its support for Ukraine and, in doing so, places significant pressure on Putin to show our adversaries that democracy will not go undefended.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Jerry-Moran-on-Ukraine-missiles-1024x578.png,,,2025-10-17 17:02:16.801020
,Mississippi Today,2025-10-17 20:02:34+00:00,Mississippi Today,IHL board begins selection of Jackson State president search advisory group,Candice Wilder,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/10/17/ihl-board-begins-selection-of-jackson-state-president-search-advisory-group/,Mississippi's college governing board will seek input from stakeholders to advise them on the Jackson State University's executive search process.,"The Mississippi Institutions of Higher Learning Board indicated Thursday it has heard the clamor for more transparency in the selection of Jackson State University’s next president. 
The board unanimously approved the request by Steve Cunningham, chair of the Jackson State search committee, to begin gathering a proposed list of potential members to serve on a Search Advisory Constituency. 
The advisory group will support the board’s search committee by providing recommendations and insights during the process. 
Cunningham and IHL Commissioner Al Rankins must submit a list of names for review and approval at a future meeting, possibly before IHL’s next board meeting on Nov. 20. 
“This is the first time our board has done this in a long time,” said Gee Ogletree, president of the IHL board. “It’s because we have heard from many people asking us to broaden this process and we’re listening, and you’ve seen the board act.” 
The move marks the first time in recent years the board has used an advisory group to assist with Jackson State’s presidential searches. The last time the board used a group was in 2017 during the university’s executive search that resulted in William Bynum. In 2022, the board’s policies were revised to provide for a Search Advisory Constituency.
Alumni and supporters of the HBCU have repeatedly raised questions about the board’s opaque process, calling for a fair, transparent national leadership search for the university. This includes having multiple supporters’ voices heard and valued. 
The top job at Jackson State has been vacant since May. Marcus Thompson resigned as president less than two years into his tenure without explanation from the IHL board. 
Thompson was the third president to depart in five years — similar to his two predecessors, Thomas Hudson and Bynum. 
Denise Jones-Gregory is serving as the interim president. 
The IHL board can seek additional input from constituents and stakeholders by appointing members to serve on an advisory group for a university’s presidential search, according to board policies. 
The group can have up to 15 members and should represent a diverse range of university stakeholders, such as students, faculty, staff, alumni and community members. The advisory group will not discuss potential candidates, since the process only seeks to gather input. Nor will the board publicly share the group’s input, as stated in board policies. 
The board also heard Thursday from Kim Bobby and Carlton Brown, two consultants with ABG Search, an executive headhunting firm based in Washington. The consultants presented a proposed timeline for Jackson State’s president search as well as best practices. 
In September, the board voted to select ABG Search, to assist with naming the university’s next leader, departing from its usual pick of Academic Search, an executive firm it has used twice in the past. 
It is unclear when the board will announce constituency group members or how long the presidential search will take, but AGB’s proposed timeline said it could be up to five months. The board said it is committed to getting it right. 
“This work will take time and due diligence, and is not locked into a specific timeframe,” John Sewell, director of communications for the IHL board, said in a statement.  
Cunningham, who is also a Jackson State alum, said the board is working to find the best possible candidate. 
“We all know the university has a rich history and bright future,” Cunningham said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/06121027/JSU-Listening-Session1.jpg,,,2025-10-17 17:02:16.801020
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-17 19:57:14+00:00,CT Mirror,Kosta Diamantis defends his acceptance of money from contractors,Andrew Brown,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/17/kosta-diamantis-trial-contractors-money/,Diamantis argued it was completely legal for him to accept tens of thousands of dollars in ‘fees’ from two school construction contractors.,"Konstantinos “Kosta” Diamantis, the former head of Connecticut’s school construction program, argued on Thursday and Friday that it was completely legal for him to accept tens of thousands of dollars in “fees” from a pair of school construction contractors.
But if that is true, prosecutors asked during a contentious cross-examination Friday, why did Diamantis try to keep the money he was accepting from Acranom Masonry and Construction Advocacy Professionals so secret?
During the eighth day of Diamantis’ ongoing federal corruption trial, prosecutors challenged Diamantis on a number of issues, including why he never reported the income he earned from those two companies on his federal tax returns or in his ethics filings with the state of Connecticut.
Diamantis told prosecutors that he didn’t have a “business relationship” with either company and thus didn’t need to report on his state ethics filings. And as for his tax returns, he told the jury that he would be amending his previous filings to account for the additional money he made between 2018 and 2021.
Diamantis’ time on the stand on Friday was far different from his experience testifying on Thursday, when his attorney Norm Pattis asked him questions about how he sought to save taxpayers money.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan Francis, who is leading the case against Diamantis, attempted to pick apart portions of his previous testimony.
With Diamantis willingly admitting that he received money from the two school construction companies, Francis focused on proving that Diamantis helped those two contractors on school construction projects or threatened to cut them out of projects if they didn’t pay up.
Francis was aided in that effort by the overwhelming amount of text messages, financial records and other hard evidence that prosecutors filed in the case.
The prosecutor pressed Diamantis over several hours to explain text messages and emails in which he directly intervened in the Weaver High School project in Hartford on behalf of Acranom. And he grilled Diamantis about one conversation in which he threatened to “find a new mason” on the Birch Grove project in Tolland if Acranom didn’t make payments to him.
“I will wait til Monday for him to give me 40. Or I think Tolland needs a new mason,” the text said.
“He has no idea who I am and my back to the wall,” Diamantis wrote in another message.
Under pressure from Francis, Diamantis agreed that he told Acranom’s leader that he would pull the company from the project.
But he suggested it was a hollow threat because he really didn’t have the power to hire or fire companies on school projects in Connecticut.
Throughout his two days of testimony, Diamantis maintained that he never used his public office for personal gain.
The checks he received from Construction Advocacy Professionals, Diamantis said, were for legal work he performed for the company.
And the cash he received from Acranom, he said, was payment for him to broker a relationship between Acranom and D’Amato construction, one of the largest construction firms in Connecticut.
That defense was challenged after Diamantis left the stand, however.
Pattis called Edward D’Amato Jr. to the stand, as one of Diamantis’ defense witnesses, but D’Amato repeatedly told the jury that Diamantis never brokered a meeting between his company and Acranom. 
“I don’t recall a conversation like that, no,” D’Amato said.
But even before D’Amato testified, prosecutors had placed Diamantis on the defensive as they confronted him with his own text messages.
Francis ran Diamantis through a host of messages in which he discussed Acranom’s school construction contracts in Hartford and Tolland and, in the next breath, reminded the company’s executives of the money they owed him.
In one text message, Diamantis wrote: “I need 5 k desperately tomorrow from him, or anyone. I don’t care who;. I shouldn’t have to beg. He owes me 77 2 months ago.”
When asked about that message, Diamantis said he was referencing $77 that Sal Monarca, the owner of Acranom, owed him for a lunch. 
Prosecutors also asked about a text exchange in which Diamantis instructed John Duffy, the vice president of Acranom, for money and then told him to “erase” their communications.
Diamantis was adamant, however, that he didn’t tell Duffy to delete the conversation because they were discussing his compensation.
“That’s not the context,” Diamantis said.
Throughout his hours of testimony, Diamantis and Francis verbally sparred. Francis tried to pin the defendant down to yes and no answers. And Diamantis sought to dodge some of the questions Francis posed.
The back-and-forth between the two men became so heated that, during a break, Pattis asked for a mistrial because of how Francis was handling the cross examination. He said the prosecutor was being too “theatrical” in his response to Diamantis’ answers.
U.S. District Judge Stefan Underhill denied that request to end the trial, but he asked Francis and Diamantis to “take the temperature down a notch.” And he warned that he didn’t want a “street fight” in his courtroom.
New evidence
As Diamantis’ time on the stand neared its end, prosecutors also dropped brand new evidence into the trial: text messages between Diamantis and his daughter, Anastasia.
Francis unveiled that evidence to the jury as he pressed Diamantis about whether he ever helped negotiate what Construction Advocacy Professionals paid his daughter as an administrative assistant.
Diamantis told the jury on Thursday that he had no role in negotiating what Antonietta DiBenedetto Roy, the owner of CAP, paid his daughter.
But the texts that Francis revealed showed Diamantis had multiple conversations with his daughter about what Roy would pay her. One of the exchanges suggested that compensation would be linked to how much CAP would make from a contract on the Birch Grove Elementary project in Tolland.
“I told (Roy) I expect you get percentage bonus,” Diamantis told his daughter. “I’m told don’t worry. I got Anastasia.”
At another point, Diamantis asked his daughter if she was satisfied after he “negotiated” another $1,500 for her.
“You happy,” he asked.
“Yes of course! I can pay my car taxes and a credit card!” his daughter responded.
“Great and more to come,” Diamantis said.
Diamantis said he couldn’t recall negotiating any compensation with CAP for his daughter.
Some of the other comments in the text messages, Diamantis added, were a “tongue in cheek” remark.
In 2024, Roy pleaded guilty to conspiring to bribe Diamantis on school construction projects.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025_1016_SR_KostaTrial_056-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-17 15:57:44.706869

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)President Donald Trump spoke with Indiana Senate Republicans on a Friday morning phone call in the latest effort to pressure Hoosier GOP legislators to redistrict the state congressional map early.
The call was first reported by The New York Times Friday afternoon.
Molly Swigart, communications director for the Indiana Senate Republicans, confirmed that caucus members were invited to join a call with the president and that Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray participated. She would not say how many other lawmakers joined the call.
A few hours later, Sen. Tyler Johnson, R-Leo, posted a statement in support of redistricting. He also attended a meeting at the White House in August on redistricting and other topics.
He blamed the national political landscape for bringing “a fight to our doorstep that we did not ask for and Hoosiers rightfully scoff at but we must use every legal means at our disposal to counter this with a redistricting effort.”

All states drew new maps in 2021 after the decennial census. Indiana’s breakdown is 7-2 in favor of Republicans. But advocates for redistricting want to eliminate the Democrat districts in Indianapolis and northwest Indiana.
Texas was the first state to pass new maps in August at the behest of the Trump administration, which is trying to ensure it retains controls of the U.S. House in 2026. Missouri then followed in September.
Democrat-led California responded by putting a question on its November ballot to do the same. Other Democrat states could follow. GOP states Nebraska, Kansas and North Carolina are also being targeted for new maps.
“Indiana is a red state through and through, and our congressional districts should mirror that sentiment,” Johnson said. “For too long, maps have diluted the voices of everyday Hoosiers who prioritize fiscal responsibility, strong borders, and traditional values. By redistricting we can improve the likelihood that Indiana’s delegation in Washington fights unequivocally for Hoosier interests-lowering taxes, protecting life, and standing up to federal overreach.”
He said a unified delegation can ensure health care access, economic growth and energy independence.
Indiana’s Senate Republican caucus has been more hesitant than House Republicans and where much of the new pressure has been focused. Vice President JD Vance visited Indiana last week initially to speak to the Senate caucus but added a meeting with House members. It was Vance’s second visit about the topic since August.
The Indiana Capital Chronicle has been tracking public statements on the proposal — four Senate Republicans have come out in support while three are against. The rest of the 40-member caucus is undecided or haven’t been definitive in their statements.

Tony Evers at a 2023 DWD event held at the Plumbers Local 75 training center in Madison. Pechacek held a news conference online Thursday where she spoke about the impact of the federal government shutdown on DWD and the state. (Photo courtesy of DWD)As the federal shutdown drags on, Wisconsin is likely to feel the impact — in employment, in agriculture and in the safety net for workers, according to the state’s labor secretary.
“Right now, we have the ability to continue to operate and our goal is to not disrupt our current workforce programs or state workforce,” said Amy Pechacek, secretary of the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development, during an online news conference Thursday.
Governments in some other states have started to reduce their workforces, Pechacek said. Wisconsin is holding off on filling vacancies and taking other steps “to try and preserve all of the funding we can so that we don’t have programmatic or employment disruptions,” Pechacek said.
Nevertheless, 75% of the DWD’s $500 million annual budget — three out of every four dollars — comes from the federal government, she said.
The remaining 25% that comes from the state isn’t “just one big pot,” Pechacek added, but funds specific programs. For example, the state workers compensation program, which covers treatment costs and lost income for people injured on the job, is entirely state funded. That includes the cost of administering the program.
But job support services — local job centers, career counseling, unemployment insurance administration, state apprenticeship programs, and the division of vocational rehabilitation for people with disabilities — are “all tied to federally funded programs,” Pechacek said.
“We need the federal government to come together, come up with a funding mechanism and continue to support their obligations to all the states and to all the people to ensure that we can move forward with the economic health and prosperity that we have enjoyed without this chaotic massive interruption,” she said. “The longer this goes, the continued adverse and exponentially worse impacts to our workforce will compound.”
Pechacek’s virtual news conference Thursday took the place of DWD’s monthly report on Wisconsin employment data. The usual reports draw on the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics surveys that poll employers on the number of jobs they have and poll households to calculate the unemployment rate.
The data BLS compiles and analyzes is one of the casualties of the shutdown, Pechacek said, hampering employers, job seekers, nonprofits, economic development agencies and governments.
All of them rely on BLS data “to guide fiscal decision making, determine whether to open or expand their businesses, determine if they’re going to hire or lay off, figure out how to allocate resources, and understand really how best to train their current workforce,” Pechacek said. Without that information, “employers are putting off important decisions, essentially fumbling around in the dark until Congress can get around to turning back the lights on.”
Unemployment claims can serve as one indicator, and Scott Hodek, section chief in the DWD Office of Economic Advisors, said the department is looking at other data sources to fill in some of the missing information. Those sources include various private sector organizations as well as the regional federal reserve banks.
“But really it’s pretty difficult to get an accurate picture of what’s happening,” Hodek said. “It will get more difficult as time goes on.”
Another federal report on inflation is expected to be released soon, even with the shutdown, because the findings are used to calculate annual cost-of-living increases for Social Security recipients, Hodek said.
That report will also figure into the deliberations of the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee when it meets at the end of October to decide whether to cut interest rates. The Fed’s dual mission includes keeping inflation as close to 2% as possible while encouraging maximum employment.
“That becomes very difficult to do if you don’t have any of that data to make those decisions,” Hodek said.
Looking at the coming months, Pechacek said, the process of applying for H-2A agriculture visas is on hold. The visas enable about 3,000 migrant workers to come in annually to work in specific seasonal agricultural operations, including planting, harvesting and food processing, she said.
DWD is required to verify that there is a worker shortage in the occupations to be covered, and the U.S. Department of Labor must certify the state’s verification report before the federal government issues the visas, she said, but the federal certification of the state’s report is on hold because of the shutdown.
December and January are the months when the most requests come in for H-2A visas, Pechacek said, so if the shutdown continues for too long, the agricultural employers depending on those workers would be unable to get the needed certification.
Pechacek said the department is also watching to see how many federal employees file for unemployment insurance.
There are about 18,000 federal employees in Wisconsin, and DWD has estimated that 8,000 might be affected by the shutdown. By comparison, she said, one of the largest layoffs in Wisconsin took place in 2018 when a larger retailer shut down, laying off 2,200 employees.
So far, however, there have been just 30 initial claims from federal workers, Pechacek said.
If federal workers who file unemployment claims get back pay when they return to work, however, they’ll have to repay the unemployment insurance fund.
Pechacek noted that President Donald Trump has threatened to permanently fire federal workers in the shutdown as well as to withhold back pay for furloughed federal workers who return to work. Between uncertainty about those threats and court rulings that have blocked some mass federal layoffs, however, “it is really an ongoing situation,” she added.
Pechacek several times criticized Trump and the Republican leaders in Congress for the shutdown.
“The president and congressional Republicans have shut down our nation’s government trying to force massive health care cuts and cost increases to the nation’s working and middle class families and we are in a stalemate,” she said.
“We really need our federal government to return to work so they can restore some predictability and reliability to our economy and continue to be the partner that we need to ensure the economic health and prosperity of Wisconsin workers.”

And officials in Kansas, New Hampshire and New Mexico have warned their residents could miss their food assistance payments for November. More than 42 million Americans rely on the program, which the U.S. Department of Agriculture administers. The federal government funds nearly all the program benefits, with states administering the program.Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins warned Thursday that SNAP will run out of funds in two weeks if Congress fails to strike a deal and end the government shutdown.“You're talking about millions and millions of vulnerable families of hungry families that are not going to have access to these programs because of this shutdown,” she said outside the White House Thursday. USDA could not be reached for comment Friday. USDA has directed regional SNAP directors to stop working on benefits for November, according to an Oct. 10 letter obtained by Politico, written by the program’s acting associate administrator, Ronald Ward. “Considering the operational issues and constraints that exist in automated systems, and in the interest of preserving maximum flexibility, we are forced to direct States to hold their November issuance files and delay transmission to State EBT vendors until further notice,” Ward wrote. “This includes on-going SNAP benefits and daily files.” USDA has already shuffled more than $300 million in tariff revenue into the agency’s Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, or WIC, through the rest of the month. The shutdown started Oct. 1 after Congress failed to find a bipartisan path forward on a stopgap spending bill. Senate Democrats have pushed for negotiations to extend the enhanced tax credits that are set to expire at the end of the year for people who buy their health insurance from the Affordable Care Act marketplace. Republicans have insisted on passing the House’s version of the stopgap funding bill that does not address insurance premiums.",,,,2025-10-17 15:57:44.706869

Gen. Craig Strong at left and Nebraska Department of Correctional Services Director Rob Jeffreys as the state announces a new ICE facility. Aug 19. 2025. (Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The State of Nebraska officially signed a contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Sept. 30 to convert the state prison in McCook into an ICE detention facility, officials announced Friday.
Under the initial two-year, 183-page contract, ICE plans to pay Nebraska $2.5 million each month to house federal detainees, adult males and females, at Nebraska’s Work Ethic Camp — a daily bed rate of $269.17 per detainee. In the second year, ICE payments to Nebraska would rise by 3%.
The Work Ethic Camp previously had an annual operating cost of $10.2 million and a daily bed rate of $199.50 per inmate. It housed only male inmates.
Gov. Jim Pillen’s office said the contract would annually net Nebraska about $14.25 million. ICE agreed to also pay Nebraska a one-time lump sum of $5.9 million for “facility renovations.” 
Projected cost savings
Kenny Zoeller, director of the governor’s Policy Research Office, which is largely Pillen’s main legislative lobbying arm, said in an email to state senators Friday that the arrangement is “designed to maximize fiscal benefit.”
“This new revenue model, when weighed against the current annual facility operating expense from general funds, demonstrates a significant financial advantage for the State of Nebraska,” Zoeller wrote.

Pillen’s office said the facility, which officials have said would be rebranded the “Cornhusker Clink,” will remain state-owned, and the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services will continue to run it. 
Corrections Director Rob Jeffreys signed the contract on behalf of Nebraska. The contract states Nebraska and ICE could agree to use the Work Ethic Camp this way for up to five years.
Pillen’s office now estimates that the state could begin accepting detainees before November. Jeffreys has said he hopes the facility can be a “Midwest hub” for immigration enforcement.
“I’m very grateful to President Trump and Secretary Kristi Noem of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for their strong leadership in securing our nation’s southern border and addressing illegal immigration through initiatives like this,” Pillen said Friday in a statement.
Minors are not supposed to be housed at the repurposed prison. Any young people sent there must be relocated within 72 hours and be housed away from adults during that time, the contract states.
‘Public has a right to know’
State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha blasted the contract Friday as “not just morally wrong, it’s unconstitutional” because of legislative checks and balances. She criticized provisions in the contract that ban videotaping, recording and public access to the state-owned facility, which would be contrary to how other state facilities operate.
“Nebraska taxpayers are funding this prison, and the public has a right to know what’s happening inside,” Hunt said. “When oversight is blocked, abuse thrives.”

Hunt said that if ICE or state officials bar senators from conducting oversight, it would violate the separation of powers and obstruct lawmakers’ constitutional duties.
It wasn’t immediately clear why officials did not release the contract for 17 days after Jeffreys and an unnamed federal official signed it Sept. 30, hours before the ongoing federal shutdown. Pillen’s office and Jeffreys’ agency had denied multiple public records requests over that span, including one from the Examiner requesting a copy of the contract on Oct. 2.
Prison transition specifics
Attorney Jennifer Huxoll in the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office told a Red Willow County District Court judge Thursday that she did not know when the facility would open but that all state inmates had been moved out. A Correctional Services spokesperson could not immediately answer Friday specifically where the inmates had been relocated.
Zoeller said all remaining state inmates were transferred to other facilities last week. There were 186 inmates at the facility on Aug. 19 when Pillen announced the plan.

Huxoll had also indicated Nebraska had entered multiple contracts, though she did not specify with whom. Jeffreys’ agency is currently contracting with a Lincoln-based fencing company for $750,000 to build a razor-wire fence around the Work Ethic Camp, which Huxoll said Thursday was 90% complete. 
Zoeller said internal modifications will continue so Nebraska can house up to 300 detainees, up from about 200, and allow for virtual and in-person attorney visits and court proceedings. Providing additional housing and legal space will involve converting rehabilitative programming space. Zoeller said an intruder detection system had also been installed, and armed staff will constantly patrol the perimeter.
Staffing will increase from 97 full-time employees to 171. Zoeller said the new positions will provide coverage for repurposed spaces, housing units and transportation. Transportation will be reimbursed monthly at $10,816.67, with regular and overtime rates for on-call guards.
Minimum staffing levels required of the state under the contract have been redacted, as has information on handling emergency situations in receiving or discharging detainees.
“NDCS has developed staff training specific to the management of the detainee population and is exploring options to allow for the utilization of electronic translation services to assist non-English speaking detainees,” Zoeller said.
Separation of powers lawsuit
State lawmakers created the Work Ethic Camp in 1997 at the request of then-Gov. Ben Nelson, a McCook native and the state’s last Democratic governor. It opened four years later. The prison is primarily designed to reduce Nebraska prison crowding by moving out low-risk offenders and making space for more violent offenders elsewhere.
Thirteen McCook residents, plus a former state lawmaker, filed a lawsuit Wednesday to try to stop the transition and reopening of the Work Ethic Camp. They argue that because Pillen and Jeffreys did not receive legislative approval first, the transition of the facility violates the separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches.
13 McCook residents, former lawmaker sue to stop Nebraska-ICE detention center

Red Willow District Judge Patrick Heng will hear arguments next Friday on whether to grant a temporary injunction. He declined this week to block further action in the meantime.
State officials did not immediately answer whether they would begin to accept federal detainees before the temporary injunction motion could be heard. A temporary injunction would pause action until the lawsuit can be more holistically argued and evaluated.
In 1958, voters gave the Legislature authority over the “general management, control and government” of all state penal institutions. The latest lawsuit targets that constitutional provision as well as a state law that says state agencies can’t change or divert from the “use or purpose, kind or class” of public buildings in which lawmakers have appropriated tax dollars for.
Pillen has previously argued state law gives him authority through the creation of the Corrections Department, plus a clause in the Nebraska Constitution that “supreme executive power rests with the governor.”
Nick Grandgenett, an attorney on behalf of the McCook residents, told District Judge Heng that state law also does not give Jeffreys’ agency the authority to house federal detainees.
“At its core, this is not about immigration,” Grandgenett said Thursday. “This is about our constitutional republican form of government.”

(Photo courtesy of Iowa DNR) The Iowa Department of Natural Resources is investigating a hog manure spill in Louisa County that has resulted in a small number of dead fish in an unnamed tributary. 
According to a DNR news release, a crew from the manure application business Catnip Ridge was applying manure to a field Thursday when a break in a line caused an unknown amount of manure to spill into a tributary of Roff Creek. 
DNR said the applicator team took “immediate action” to stop pumping and to clamp the line once the tear, which DNR later discovered was from friction against an iron fence post hidden in some vegetation, was discovered.

According to the news release, the spill occurred in a road ditch northeast of Winfield at the intersection of Q Avenue and 65th Street. The Catnip Ridge crew placed dams in several areas along the tributary and plugged a nearby culvert to keep the manure from entering the creek, DNR reported. 
Fresh water was added to the spilled area to help the crew flush the tributary and pump out the spilled manure. When DNR staff assessed the scene Thursday, initial water monitoring tests showed elevated levels of  ammonia, but staff did not observe any dead fish. 
According to the release, when staff returned Friday morning to the site, “a small number of dead fish were observed” in the tributary, but the plugged culvert had prevented further downstream migration of the manure. 
DNR will continue to monitor the cleanup efforts and investigate the incident to determine if further enforcement action is necessary.



When to apply manure
Iowa State University Extension and Outreach holds that farmers should wait to apply manure to fields until soil temperatures drop below 50 degrees Fahrenheit to minimize nitrification in the soil. According to the Iowa Environmental Mesonet, soil temperatures across the state are not expected to drop below that level until the end of October. 
The university extension, however, also notes that it can be difficult for farmers to wait to apply manure as their manure storage tanks grow full at the end of the summer.

June 14, 2025 | Photo by Jon KingMichigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said Friday that President Donald Trump and his supporters were attempting to stir up anxiety, fear and violence ahead of the planned weekend No Kings protests, all under the guise of provoking a federal law enforcement response.
That statement, issued Friday in a news release from Nessel’s office, was evidenced by a bizarre statement made by a local Metro Detroit GOP official, who warned in a vague email that left-wing agitators were planning to infiltrate and derail Saturday’s protests in Michigan.
More than 100 communities from southeast Michigan to the westernmost part of the U.P. are set to hold “No Kings” rallies in support of civil rights, democracy and the rule of law. The protests are expected to attract millions of people nationwide to speak out against the Trump administration and the numerous anti-democratic policies enacted by his office in his second term.
A large turnout on Oct. 18, across the state and nation, would be the biggest litmus test yet for the growing movement against the Trump administration. As such, various far-right pundits, members of the Republican Party and the White House itself have been attempting to blunt that momentum by warning that members of the loosely organized antifascist Antifa movement and other left-wing agitators were planning to cause trouble.
On Thursday evening, Oakland County GOP Chair Vance Patrick joined them in stirring the pot with an email containing unsubstantiated and unsourced claims that an incoming “mobilization” of left-wing trouble makers were headed for Michigan’s protests.
Patrick and the county’s GOP branch said it believed that included “the Communist Party USA, the Freedom Socialist Party, and the Democratic Socialists of America.” Patrick and his office also claimed that those groups have a history of causing unrest in communities.
Again, Patrick did not point to any credible threat issued by law enforcement, nor any credible news source indicating that such a situation was occurring.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Still, Patrick doubled down, claiming that attendees at earlier No Kings rallies held in June called for Trump’s assassination or violence against law enforcement.
“Our county will not be intimidated by organizations whose only aim is to sow chaos and division,” Patrick said. “The Oakland County Republican Party stands for law and order, and we reject the radical and violent tactics that have become the hallmark of the No Kings movement and its extremist sponsors. It is time for everyone, regardless of political affiliation, to denounce violence and work toward a safer, more united community.” 
Patrick also said that conservative activists had expressed an interest in forming a counter-demonstration, but the Oakland GOP was recommending that they avoid the protest due to concerns for their safety.
“Our first priority will always be the safety and well-being of our supporters,” Patrick said. “We strongly urge everyone to stay away from these events and to avoid any confrontations that could put you in harm’s way.”
On Friday, Christine McGillivray, executive director of Voters Not Politicians, one of the organizers of the Michigan protests, reiterated that the movement was peaceful and the demonstrations would remain that way. In a statement to Michigan Advance, McGillivray also responded directly to Patrick’s veiled warning.
“All across our state, your neighbors will be waving flags alongside children and their grandparents. We love this country, but are alarmed at what the Trump Administration is doing – using the military against US citizens, masked agents abducting people off the streets, prosecuting his political opponents,” McGillivray said. “These things are totally un-American. Smearing tens of thousands of Michiganders standing up for our rights is quite sad. But don’t take my word for it – do your own research! Come visit a No Kings demonstration and make up your own mind. There are more than 100 across the state, so there’s certainly one near you.”

Nessel also responded, encouraging people from all walks of life to show up and have their voices heard in the face of growing authoritarianism from Trump and his supporters.
“The No Kings protests happening across Michigan and the country are powerful opportunities for people to make their voices heard,” Nessel said. “I  encourage everyone who wants to participate to make signs, bring your friends, and stand together for what you believe in.”
Nessel also called out officials and pundits, like Patrick and others on social media, for trying to cause a panic that would ultimately give the Trump administration the justification it would need to step in and crack down on the First Amendment rights of millions of protesters.
“At the same time, we have seen a troubling pattern wherein the Trump Administration and his supporters are already attempting to squash the movement’s momentum and scare attendees by predicting violence and labeling this legal protest an act of terrorism,” Nessel said. “We know from this Administration’s actions from coast to coast that they are looking for any reason to invoke the Insurrection Act. We must deny them that justification and protest peacefully and lawfully.”
The attorney general also asked all those who attend to remember the core values of the nonviolent protest movement, as acting otherwise would be antithetical to “responsible civic engagement.”
“When protests turn chaotic, our voices are drowned out, the safety of protestors and public safety officers may be jeopardized, and it hands the White House the excuse they so badly want to abuse and test the limits of their constitutional authority,” Nessel said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_9137-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-17 15:57:44.706869

Wright announced forthcoming furloughs of federal nuclear weapons workers on Oct. 16, 2025.(Photo by Anna Padilla for Source New Mexico)National Nuclear Security Administration employees could face layoffs as soon as Friday if the federal shutdown continues, U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in an Oct. 16 appearance on Bloomberg TV, a message he reiterated to USA Today.
“We have not furloughed anyone yet, but we will be out of funds by tomorrow or early next week. So we will be forced to do that if this shutdown continues,” Wright said on Bloomberg. “We’ve been paying them to date, but starting tomorrow, Monday at the latest, we’re not going to be able to pay those workers, if that continues on for long, they may get other jobs,” Wright, putting the “the sovereignty of the country,” at stake.
The NNSA is a section of DOE that oversees the nation’s nuclear stockpile and development of nuclear weapons and waste, including programs for Sandia National Laboratories, Los Alamos National Laboratory and other programs such as nuclear disposal near Carlsbad.
U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Alabama), who chairs the House Armed Services Committee, underscored the message Friday morning during a U.S. House of Representatives news conference, when he said he had been told the NNSA would furlough most of the staf— about 80% of employees.
“We were just informed last night, the National Nuclear Security Administration, the group that handles the nuclear stockpile, that the carryover funding they’ve been using is about to run out,” he said Friday. “…These are not employees that you want to go home. They are managing and handling a very important strategic asset for us. They need to be at work and being paid,” he said.
He also told CBS News that the NNSA told his office the agency would place roughly 1,400 employees on furlough and 375 would continue to work.
Neither Wright nor other officials have said where furloughs will occur.
A spokesperson for Los Alamos National Laboratory told Source via an emailed statement that LANL “has funds in place to continue operations. We focus on maintaining the safety and security of our employees and facilities.”
An automatic response from Sandia National Laboratories stated that they are “open and employees are reporting for work. The Labs will operate in the short-term using unspent funding.”
In a statement, Sen. Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) said the DOE had not provided any information on site-specific impacts, but called Wright’s comments an “excuse.”
“In New Mexico and across the country, workers at our National Labs or other defense-related facilities are crucial for our national security. At this time, LANL and Sandia continue to operate at full capacity to deliver the cutting-edge research, technologies, and capabilities that keep our nation safe,” Luján said in a statement to Source NM. “Now, Secretary Wright and the Trump administration have used the government shutdown as an excuse to threaten these critical jobs. Secretary Wright and the Trump administration must prioritize this vital workforce to protect our national security.”
Requests for comment from other members of New Mexico’s congressional delegation remained pending Friday. This story will be updated if needed.
Phone lines for media contacts at Sandia National Laboratories and local NNSA offices all had out-of-office messages, and deferred further comments about the shutdown to the U.S. Department of Energy press office.
Voicemails and emails to public affairs at the Department of Energy went unanswered Friday morning.
The lack of information about furloughs and the shutdown is “dispiriting,” Dylan Spaulding, the senior scientist in the Global Security Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit science advocacy group, told Source NM Friday.
“It conveys that the NNSA and Department of Energy are not reliable employers,” he said. “I think the best and greatest scientists in particular will move to opportunities elsewhere. The danger is, once those people are lost, they never come back, so even if the furloughs stop, even if the shutdown ends, funding is resumed, you’ve done some irreparable damage.”
Local anti-nuclear groups said the furlough was contradictory to the administration’s push to develop nuclear power and weapons.
“I think this is mostly theatrical and designed to bring Democrats to the bargaining table,”Greg Mello, the executive director of nuclear nonproliferation nonprofit Los Alamos Study Group, said. ”However, if NNSA’s unspent balances are not in the categories they need, they may well have to furlough people, and they might even furlough people as part of the theater.”
Don Hancock, director of the Nuclear Waste Safety program at the Southwest Research and Information Center, criticized the “lack of transparency” from the federal government about what impacts this may have on nuclear weapons stockpiles and waste work in New Mexico.
“What I don’t understand is why this shutdown is so different from the 35-day one in the first Trump administration when they didn’t get rid of 80% of the NSA folks,” Hancock said.

Verde, 1507 State St., Bettendorf — During an Oct. 2 visit, a Scott County inspector cited this restaurant for 17 risk-factor violations, an exceptionally high number. The inspector found that the establishment was open and operating without a valid food-service license, as the previous license had expired and had not been renewed.
Also, there was no certified food protection manager on staff, and multiple food items — including red salsa dated Aug. 14, bean puree dated Aug. 18, wine sauce dated July 11, and mango habanero dated Sept. 12 — were being held long past the maximum of seven days and had to be discarded.
In addition, raw whole cuts of beef were stored above fresh herbs and cooked rice inside a cooler, risking cross-contamination; several containers in the clean-dish rack were marred by “bits of leftover food debris;” the interior of the large ice bin was marred by an accumulation of grime; the sanitizing dishwashing machine in the bar area was not properly functioning; a container of raw, improperly stored fish had to be discarded, and food was being packaged in reduced-oxygen, or vacuum-sealed, packaging without the required approval.
Also, a bag of onions, a box of tortillas, and a box of eggs were being stored directly on the floor of the walk-in cooler; the stainless steel rolling cart had a buildup of spilled grease and food debris, and the air filters above the cooking equipment contained a buildup of dust and grease.
Brady’s Bar & Grill, 113 N. Washington St., Edgewood – During an Oct. 9 visit, a state inspector cited this establishment for 12 risk-factor violations, an unusually high number. Among the issues: The staff was assembling sandwiches with their bare hands and there was no soap available at either the bar or dish-room handwashing sinks; there was “adulterated” pizza sauce and alfredo sauce in the pizza preparation table that had to be discarded, and various food items — including sausage, ham, shredded cheese, coleslaw and cottage cheese — were being stored at temperatures above the maximum of 41 degrees.
Also, the shredded pork, chicken breasts, in-house ranch dressing, in-house salsa, and in-house bacon jam were not marked with dates to ensure freshness and safety. In addition, the microwave oven “appeared unclean” and the establishment’s current license was not posted.
The Bettplex, 4850 Competition Drive, Bettendorf – During an Oct. 8 visit, a Scott County inspector cited this restaurant for multiple products throughout the main kitchen that had been held for longer than the maximum seven days, including Canadian bacon and lettuce dated Sept. 25, bean sauce dated Oct. 1, ranch dressing dated Sept. 30, beer cheese dated Sept. 26 and brisket dated Sept. 28.
Also, access to the handwashing sink was blocked by trash cans positioned in front of it, and several prepared food products — including bags of cooked noodles, cooked chicken, cheese sauce and deli meat — had been held for more than 24 hours without proper date-markings to ensure freshness and safety.
In addition, several pizzas that had been prepared four days earlier and were stored on an open rack in a cooler had “a small accumulation of mold growth on them.”  The inspector also reported an accumulation of fruit flies around two floor drains behind the main bar.
Cabos Cantina & Grill, 1500 E. LeClaire Road, Eldridge – During an Oct. 1 visit, a Scott County inspector cited this establishment for 10 risk-factor violations, an unusually high number. Among the issues: rice on the main hot-holding line in the kitchen had not been reheated to 165 degrees within two hours as required; raw chicken and raw steak in the refrigerated drawers below the grill were holding at 43 to 45 degrees rather than 41 degrees or colder; several knives stored as clear were marred by food debris, and several cans of Raid insecticide, not approved for use in commercial food establishments, were found in the utility room.
Also, the chlorine dishwashing machine was operating with no detectable levels of sanitizing solution; frozen fish had not been removed from reduced-oxygen packaging before thawing, increasing the risk that any spoilage would go undetected; in-use utensils in the bar area were being stored in standing, room-temperature water, and hot tortillas were being stored in plastic, grocery-style bags rather than in a food-grade container.
Dynasty Buffet (listed in inspection reports as Gog Dynasty Buffet), 5388 Elmore Ave., Davenport – During an Oct. 7 visit, a Scott County inspector cited this restaurant for 11 risk-factor violations, an unusually high number. Among the problems: Employees handled vegetables using their bare hands; raw chicken and seafood were stored above ready-to-eat food items in a cooler, risking cross-contamination; kitchen knives and the ice machines used for customers’ drinks were marred by “debris and gunk;” employees were seen eating food off the cutting board surface rather eating at a table in the dining area; the dishwashing machine was not properly sanitizing dishes; multiple food products were stored on the floor of the walk-in cooler, and multiple food products had been left uncovered in the kitchen.
Also, dented cans of food were found in the establishment, and one cooler was storing food products at temperatures of up to 50 degrees rather than 41 degrees or colder. In addition, frozen fish was left to thaw at room temperature in the kitchen, fly strips were hanging in several areas of the kitchen, and spoons and scoops used for food were “crusty and had debris buildup.”










No foods were date-marked with a production or discard date ... Frozen meat was thawing in large pots of water on the floor in the back of the kitchen.


– State inspector's report for the Colfax Truck Stop 


Colfax Truck Stop, 1405 N. Walnut St., Colfax – During a Sept. 25 visit, a state inspector cited this establishment for nine risk-factor violations. Among the problems: Cartons of raw eggs from an unapproved private flock were offered for sale in a reach-in cooler and had to pulled from sale. Also, the individual in charge could not provide the name of an approved source for the large metal pan of yogurt found inside a walk-in cooler or for “the plastic grocery bags of frozen meat” found inside a walk-in freezer.
In addition, the pastry stored in a hot-holding case was measured at 114 to 120 degrees and had to be discarded. The establishment, the inspector reported, “does not have a date-marking system for time- and temperature-controlled foods that require date-marking. No foods were date-marked with a production or discard date.” The inspector also found that equipment and utensils were not being sanitized after washing, and reported that cutting boards, utensils, and storage containers were marred by “food debris and buildup” on their surfaces.
“Cooked chickpeas and cooked chicken were cooling at room temperature with no temperature monitoring,” the inspector reported. “Frozen meat was thawing in large pots of water on the floor in the back of the kitchen.”
All Pho You, 4120 University Ave., Des Moines – During an Oct. 7 visit, a state inspector noted that meat cooked days before had been left in the cooler and freezer with no date-markings to ensure freshness and safety. The inspector also made note of sausage with “visible contamination and discoloration” and found that the person in charge was not a certified food protection manager as required. During the restaurant’s previous routine inspection, in October 2024, it was cited for 13 risk-factor violations, an exceptionally high number.
Hy-Vee Foods, 1720 Waterfront Drive, Iowa City – During an Oct. 6 visit, a Johnson County inspector noted that the diced tomatoes in the pizza refrigeration unit were being stored at 47 degrees rather than 41 degrees or colder. Also, cooked items, including pork ribs and smoked pulled pork, were stored in a cooler at 44 and 47 degrees and had to be discarded.
In addition, several items in the produce area’s cooler — such as Margaritaville salsa, black bean and corn salsa, and guacamole salsa — were being held at temperatures above 41 degrees and had to be discarded. The store was also using a nonapproved, noncontinuous method of cooking chicken, and the smoked chicken that was stored in a hot-holding unit in the Market Grill area was being held at 129 degrees – too cool to ensure its safety – and had to be discarded.
The inspector also reported that partially cooked chicken stored on a preparation table in the Chinese food area was measured at 90 degrees and had to be discarded, and raw ground beef was being stored above raw pork steaks in a self-service meat cooler, risking cross-contamination. Also, the handwashing sinks in the meat department were found to have no hot water supply.
Olive Tree Café, 2513 53rd Ave., Bettendorf – During an Oct. 6 visit, a Scott County inspector cited this restaurant for food-contact surfaces that had a “buildup of soil and/or food debris” and required additional cleaning.  Also, three cans of food had severe dents along their rims or seams and had to be discarded, one container of quinoa prepared on Sept. 29 had been held for more than the maximum seven days, and there was no certified food protection manager on site each day.
Fas Mart, 1200 Locust St., Glenwood – During a Sept. 30 visit, a state inspector noted that dishes were not being sanitized after washing, and food products were being chilled in an open-air cooler at 58 degrees – too warm to ensure safety. Also, the handwashing sink in the dish room had no hot water supply, and the drain for the handwashing sink was not connected, allowing water to drain directly onto the floor. In addition, the establishment’s most recent inspection report was not posted in a location that allowed consumers to read it. According to state records, the establishment last underwent a routine inspection in October 2020.
Hy-Vee Foods, 1125 N. Dodge St., Iowa City – During a Sept. 30 visit, a Johnson County inspector noted that the interior of the ice machine in the Market Grill area was marred by a buildup of unspecified debris, and numerous items – including diced and sliced tomatoes, cheese, deli sandwiches and wraps, and ready-to-eat salami, diced pancetta, and Columbus pepperoni panini – were being held at temperatures above 41 degrees and had to be discarded.
Also, the veggie wash used in the Market Grill area had no detectable level of cleaning solution; food employees in the meat department and deli sandwich section did not wash their hands before putting on gloves and handling food; and the most recent inspection report had not been posted.
Foundry Food & Tap, 5055 Competition Drive, Bettendorf – During a Sept. 29 visit, a Scott County inspector noted that multiple food-contact surfaces throughout the kitchen were marred by a buildup of soil, food debris and grime. The soiled areas included the food-preparation tables, the shelves of the reach-in freezer, the interior of all the refrigerated drawers of a cook-line cooler, the interior of the hot-holding food cabinets, the onion dicer and storage pan, and the ice scoop.
“All surfaces require additional cleaning and sanitizing,” the inspector reported.
In addition, three pans of food containing pulled pork, rice and vegetables had no date-markings to ensure freshness and safety. Also, one cooler was holding food product at between 46 and 53 degrees, rather than 41 degrees or colder, and so the food was discarded. Another cooler that was being used to store raw chicken, fish, and breading products was holding food at 47 to 50 degrees, and so that food was discarded. The restaurant also had to discard a container of boneless wings that were being held at 53 degrees, as well as improperly thawed vacuum-sealed salmon filets.
Smoke N Firehouse No. 20, 103 W. Maple St., Ringsted — During a Sept. 19 visit, a Siouxland District Health Department inspector cited this restaurant for 13 risk-factor violations, an unusually high number.
Among the problems: A bag of hamburger buns that showed “the presence of mold” and had to be discarded; multiple foods stored in all three of the reach-in coolers had been left uncovered, risking contamination; raw ground beef was left sitting on a counter at room temperature; there was no system in place for date-marking foods that were time- and temperature-controlled; cut tomatoes, cooked pulled pork, taco meat, and cooked ground beef had all been held for more than the maximum of seven days and had to be discarded; and the chemical dishwasher was operating with no detectable levels of sanitizing solution.
In addition, the kitchen utensils were soiled; a handwashing sink was filled with dirty dishes; a can of Hot Shot bug spray, not approved for use in commercial food establishments, was located in the kitchen, and the fryers, flat-top grill and coolers were visibly soiled with a buildup of food debris.
“Kitchen walls and floors are heavily soiled with food debris, especially around kitchen equipment,” the inspector reported. The visit was in response to a non-illness complaint concerning general sanitation. The complaint was deemed verified.
Hy-Vee Foods, 1700 E. Washington St., Mount Pleasant – During a Sept. 18 visit, a Lee County inspector cited this store for 10 risk-factor violations. Among the problems: Raw,  seasoned chicken was stored on top of seasoned ribs on a cart in the walk-in cooler, risking cross-contamination; rotisserie chickens in the hot-holding case ranged from 125 to 130 degrees, which was not hot enough to ensure their safety, and had to be reheated to at least 165 degrees; and various cold items, such as cheese and tomatoes were stored at 48 degrees in the sandwich-prep cooler.
Also, the dishwashing machine in the bakery area was not reaching the minimum of 160 degrees, and the written log documenting sushi preparation was incomplete and missing some of the required information.

Free.,Former Trump aide Bolton pleads not guilty to mishandling classified information,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/former-trump-aide-bolton-pleads-not-guilty-mishandling-classified-information,,"Former National Security Advisor John Bolton pleaded not guilty in Maryland federal court Friday to eight counts of unlawful transmission of national defense information and 10 counts of unlawful retention of national defense information.He was released from custody on personal recognizance bond, meaning he did not have to post bail but did have to surrender his passport and pledge not to leave the country. The next hearing was scheduled for Nov. 21.In a statement shortly after an indictment against him was returned Thursday, Bolton said the prosecution was engineered by President Donald Trump in retaliation for criticism the longtime national security official had leveled against his one-time boss.Bolton said the material he used for his 2020 book on his time as Trump’s national security advisor had been cleared for publication, and that he made the FBI aware of a 2021 hack of his private email.During President Joe Biden’s four years in office, reviews of his case did not result in indictment, he continued. But federal law enforcement during Trump’s second presidency has sought to prosecute individuals opposed to the president, he said.“These charges are not just about his focus on me or my diaries, but his intensive effort to intimidate his opponents, to ensure that he alone determines what is said about his conduct,” the statement said. “Dissent and disagreement are foundational to America’s constitutional system, and vitally important to our freedom. I look forward to the fight to defend my lawful conduct and to expose his abuse of power.”Bolton was formally charged Friday with the 18-count indictment that accused him of transcribing handwritten notes containing classified information onto a word processor and sharing the material in the form of “diary” entries with two family members who were not cleared to receive classified information.Bolton’s is the third indictment federal officials have secured in recent weeks against high-profile Trump critics. Former FBI Director James Comey was charged with lying to Congress following a major fallout in a Virginia federal prosecutor’s office that was widely reported to be over career staff refusing to proceed in the case against Comey.New York Attorney General Leticia James was also indicted for charges related to a mortgage application.Like Bolton, both Comey and James have proclaimed their innocence and said they were being persecuted as Trump critics.",,,,2025-10-17 15:57:44.706869

(Courtesy of Maggie Shama)Maggie Shama thought she and her husband Mohamed Shama had finally cleared their last hurdle. After years of navigating the complex immigration system, they were moments away from securing his legal status.
At the immigration office in Raleigh on Oct. 9, Maggie, who has been married to Shama since 2017, was the first to be interviewed for their marriage-based green card. The officer told her everything looked good, and that unless her husband’s answers drastically differed, their case would be approved, she said.
Relieved, she left the room and walked toward Shama, who was waiting. As he was called in for his turn, she kissed him and said, “We got this,” before taking a seat in the waiting room.
The couple had spent much of their lives together fighting to secure Shama’s legal status, and this was supposed to bring an end to years of uncertainty.
But soon, everything changed.
Despite being told they had passed the interview, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents entered the office and took Shama into custody.
“I was dumbfounded,” Maggie said during a phone interview. “I kept saying, ‘But we were approved. I don’t understand what’s happening.’”
The arrest stems from a prior deportation order dating back years. Though he had followed every legal step to resolve his case, the longtime Durham resident now faces the possibility of being deported to Egypt, the country he left behind years ago.
NC Newsline contacted ICE to confirm Shama’s story. The agency referred us to U.S. Customs and Immigration Services. That agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Shama is among immigrants affected by the Trump administration’s expanded deportation policies. The administration has prioritized the removal of anyone with a prior deportation order, even those married to U.S. citizens or with pending legal cases.
According to the Department of Homeland Security, over 2 million individuals have left the United States in less than 250 days, including an estimated 1.6 million who voluntarily self-deported.
Immigration advocates say the approach has upended families who had been following the legal process for years.
“They just wouldn’t listen,” said Maggie, who suffers from spinal stenosis and depends on Shama for daily care. “Even when our lawyer and the interviewer said he was approved, the ICE agent said, ‘I don’t care. We have an order to deport.’”
Despite her health issues, Maggie has spent the days since the arrest calling lawyers and coordinating with friends to keep Shama’s story visible.
Shama, who has two children from a previous marriage, has lived in North Carolina for more than a decade. He worked his way up to general manager at AMC Theatres in Durham, earning the company’s national 2022 General Manager of the Year award, according to the GoFundMe page, and was recognized by former Durham Mayor Steve Schewel for hiring people with special needs.
“He’s the face of the building,” said Raul Navedo, a close friend and former colleague who met Shama in 2017. “People light up when they see him walking around.”
That same warmth has fueled an outpouring of support since his arrest. Friends and former coworkers quickly rallied around Maggie, launching a GoFundMe that has already surpassed its first goal. The fundraising page outlines Shama’s transfers from the Cary Detention Center to the Alamance County Jail, and then to the Stewart Detention Center in Lumpkin, Georgia — one of the nation’s largest immigration facilities.
Donations are being used to cover legal fees and family expenses. Organizers say the money will help file motions to stay his deportation, prepare a writ of habeas corpus, and, if necessary, pay for airfare should Shama be forced to self-deport and continue his case from abroad.
The legal path remains uncertain. One attorney said that because a removal order is already in place, a motion to stay has only a slim chance of success; another estimated a 50% chance. That leaves the painful possibility that Shama’s best option may be to self-deport — a move that could separate him from his wife and daughters for years.
The family also fears that if ICE carries out its own removal process, Shama could be sent to another country, since deportation flights to Egypt are rare.
Shama also suffers from health issues, including a suspected case of long COVID, and friends fear his health will worsen in detention.
Maggie said she misses the man who has been a caregiver and a companion all the years. The couple bonded over their shared love of movies, especially the comedy series Only Murders in the Building.
“It’s just so quiet in this house, it’s unbearable,” Maggie said through tears. “We crack each other up. It’s just what we do. I miss going to the movies with him, because that’s how we bonded. I miss the smell of his cologne; I miss his smile. I just miss everything.”
“At this point, it’s just, keep fighting,” she added.” We’re just gonna keep fighting and hope for the best.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-17 19:03:47+00:00,CT Mirror,Judge orders release of video of death of J’Allen Jones,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/17/jallen-jones-video-release/,The judge said the public interest in releasing the video of J'Allen Jones' death outweighed concerns raised by the Department of Correction.,"A Superior Court judge on Thursday ordered the Department of Correction to release the video showing the death of J’Allen Jones at Garner Correctional Institute in 2018. 
In her 11-page decision, Superior Court Judge Claudia Baio said that the Department of Correction had not sufficiently proved that the safety concerns that officials raised during a hearing in August were enough to override the public interest in the video’s release. 
Jones died in March 2018 after being pepper sprayed, restrained, struck and forcibly moved by as many as 10 corrections workers. In August 2018, Jones’ mother and girlfriend filed a lawsuit against the Department of Correction. The family has been petitioning the courts for the release of the video, along with the ACLU and the Connecticut Examiner. 
In August, the court heard arguments in favor of and against the release of the video. William Mulligan, the deputy commissioner of operations and rehabilitative services for the Department of Correction, said he was concerned that the release of certain portions of the video would create a security risk, allowing incarcerated individuals to map the facility and possibly plan an escape. 
He said he was also concerned that incarcerated individuals could discover the identities of the staff involved in the incident, which could create negative encounters among those staff members and the incarcerated. 
Mulligan proposed that the department allow the portion of the video in which Jones had been strip-searched, pinned down, pepper sprayed, struck and forcibly moved by corrections officers to be available for members of the public to view, but not distributed widely on the internet. The modified version of the video would not include segments in which Jones was transported from his cell into the inpatient medical area, or when he was transported from the medical area out to an ambulance. 
But Attorney Ron Murphy, who represented Jones’ family, argued that removing any part of the video would not do justice to Jones’ memory and would leave out critical information about Jones’ conduct the day he died. 
In her decision, Baio acknowledged the security concerns that Mulligan raised but maintained that the majority of the video could not be sealed, since it provided direct evidence of the central issue of the case — the actions of both Jones and the correction officers on the day of Jones’ death. 
“The defendants chose to submit the entire video in connection with their motion for summary judgement, rather than only a portion. Therefore, it is not reasonable for the defendants now to advocate that only a certain portion be publicly available,” the decision read. 
Baio ordered that the Department of Correction provide the video to the court within two weeks. The department will be allowed to blur out doors and door numbers, metal detectors and staff members who are not involved in the lawsuit. They are also permitted to erase radio transmissions between corrections officers “if they feel the conversation therein raises legitimate security concerns.” 
Baio noted that the number of people who attended the August hearing — including attorneys, criminal justice reform advocates and Jones’ mother — proved that the issue “had generated substantial public interest.” She also noted that the video was the primary evidence that the Department of Correction had presented in asking the court to dismiss the lawsuit without a trial, and that the public had a right to see that evidence “so that they can evaluate the court’s decision on that motion.” 
Advocates celebrated the video’s release but were mixed on whether the department should be allowed to redact even portions of the video. 
Barbara Fair, executive director of Stop Solitary, CT, said she was “ecstatic” that the department had released the video, and that “J’Allen did not die in vain.” But she said she was concerned that the Department of Correction could use the pretense of security concerns to blur out some of the most brutal actions that happened. 
She said she hoped the video would lead to changes in how the Department of Correction is held accountable. 
Attorney Alex Taubes, who is representing the Connecticut Examiner in a petition to intervene for the release of the video, called the judge’s ruling a “major victory for public accountability and transparency.” He said he disagrees with the need to redact parts of the video but “understands and respects” the judge’s decision. 
Correction ombuds DeVaughn Ward said the judge’s ruling proved that the state’s argument for concealing the video was “indefensible,” particularly since they themselves had presented it as part of their argument against the case going to trial. He said he plans to ask to see an unredacted version of the video and use that to make a recommendation to the Department of Correction on whether they should discipline the officers involved. 
Ward said he understood the need to redact parts of the video for security reasons and said the judge’s ruling struck the right balance. 
Dan Barrett, attorney for the ACLU, which filed a petition in October 2024 for the video’s immediate release and was denied, said he felt the judge was “absolutely correct” in her ruling.
“The court affirmed that documents filed by the government need to be seen by the public so we can evaluate our government institutions,” Barrett said. 
Asked about the redactions, Barrett said he felt the court had “struck the right balance,” since the redactions were intended to be very limited. 
Barrett pointed out that the prison system belongs to the public and said what happens inside “is done in our names.” 
Barrett said the real question now is whether Attorney General William Tong will release the video or attempt to file an appeal. 
“[Tong] really should stop fighting. The public needs to have access to this,” he said. 
Corrie Betts, the criminal justice chair for the Connecticut chapter of the NAACP, who praised the court ruling, said in a statement that representatives from the CT NAACP state conference had recently met with Tong, who reportedly told them that there was “nothing he could do” about releasing the video. 
“The court’s ruling now makes it clear that such a position is inconsistent with the positions of justice and accountability,” Betts said. 
Elizabeth Benton, the spokesperson for the Attorney General’s office, said their office was “reviewing the decision and evaluating next steps.” 
Andrius Banevicius, spokesperson for the Department of Correction, said the department was reviewing Baio’s decision “in order to determine the appropriate course of action.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025_0822_SR_JonesVideo_040-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-17 15:57:44.706869

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)TOPEKA — Kansas won’t release its monthly labor reports as a result of the federal government shutdown, the Kansas Department of Labor announced Friday.
September’s monthly jobs report and unemployment data were scheduled to publish Friday, but a lapse in funding for the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics caused data collection, analysis and distribution activities to cease Oct. 1.
“This report provides the public with important information about the state of the Kansas labor market,” said Derek Helms, a spokesperson for the state labor department. “For example, are job estimates increasing or decreasing? Which industries are adding jobs? How many people are unemployed?”
Delayed data releases have arisen as one symptom of the federal government shutdown as it enters its third week, while state operations largely continue.
The monthly state report typically provides preliminary data on job estimates by industry, unemployment rates and labor estimates, Helms said. It is the state-level equivalent of the monthly U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Employment Situation report. Jobs and labor data, even if preliminary, inform key economic indicators.
“The immediate impact is a delay in access to this important information about the Kansas labor market,” Helms said. “The official statistics used by analysts, economists and policymakers are only available through August 2025. Estimates for more recent time periods won’t be available until federal operations resume.”
Kansas’ unemployment rate has remained steadily around 3.8% in the past year, according to data through August. The state lost 4,700 nonfarm jobs and 1,300 private sector jobs in August. Kansas ranked near last in the nation for percentage gain in nonfarm payroll employment in the past year, according to the data.
Between July and August, the state’s leisure and hospitality services sector was the best performing, gaining around 600 jobs. State and local government and trades, transportation and utilities were the worst performing. The government sector lost around 3,500 jobs and the trades lost around 2,100. 
The government sector has been on the decline for the past year, according to the data. It has remained the worst performing sector with a loss of around 9,200 between August 2024 and August 2025. 
The private education and health services and financial activities sectors were the strongest in the past year, gaining 3,300 and 2,600 jobs respectively.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/capitolsunsetsept302025-1024x769.jpg,,,2025-10-17 15:57:44.706869

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current) Rhode Island’s capital city is one step closer to tightening its rules on how local police interact with U.S Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) personnel.
The Providence City Council on Thursday unanimously granted its first passage of a series of rewrites to the city’s Community-Police Relations Act as a way to further to protect the city’s immigrant community from the Trump administration’s arrest and deportation agenda.
“In Providence, we take pride in being a welcoming city where every neighbor deserves to feel safe,” Councilor Miguel Sanchez, a co-sponsor of the amended ordinance, said in a statement. “Our immigrant neighbors are the backbone of this city, and they deserve safety, dignity, and accountability.” 
The initial approval comes over a week after dozens of residents urged the council’s Ordinance Committee to pass the measure to ensure that Providence police officers do not assist ICE.
Providence officials want to further prohibit police cooperation with ICE

Enacted in 2017 under then-Mayor Jorge Elorza, the Providence Community-Police Relations Act prohibits officers from assisting with federal immigration enforcement regardless of the reason the person is being detained, unless there is a criminal warrant issued for a person in Providence police custody.
But how strictly police adhere to the policy came into question after officers were filmed at the scene of an ICE arrest on Alverson Avenue on July 13 establishing a perimeter at the request of federal agents — an incident the Providence External Review Authority ruled “constituted prohibited assistance.”
The new language in the ordinance would bar Providence police from complying with any federal agency’s request for assistance — such as sharing information or controlling traffic — unless they provide a criminal warrant signed by a judge.
Schools, places of worship, health facilities and courts would be designated safe spaces, meaning federal immigration authorities can’t be granted access unless they have a judicial warrant or are “acting in response to a specific act of terrorism, national security threat or when there is the threat of imminent danger of violence.”
One provision had split some Democratic councilors during a committee hearing earlier in the month: a clause allowing community organizations to challenge potential violations and sue individual officers.
Such a clause drew concerns from Mayor Brett Smiley, who believed the language could open the city up to “frivolous lawsuits.”
That language was updated by the Council Thursday to clarify that organizations may only sue the city as a whole and only for a court to uphold one’s civil rights, not for monetary damages.
“It was already true in the ordinance, but there were requests that we clarify that,” City Council President Rachel Miller said in an interview Friday.
Smiley said in a statement Friday he supports the changes made by the council.
“These changes will help to protect our city from dangerous financial liabilities, continue to protect our immigrant communities and support our officers to continue their nationally recognized community policing practices,” Smiley said.
The council will be required to give second approval of the ordinance before it heads to the mayor’s desk. That next vote is scheduled for Thursday, Nov. 6.

Construction began Oct. 14, 2025 to restore the room. (Courtesy New Mexico General Services Department)Construction began this week to restore a room in the former New Mexico Capitol that served as the state Senate chambers for 60 years.
The “Red Room”—so named because of its old red decorations—housed the Senate beginning when the New Mexico Territorial Capitol was completed in Santa Fe in 1900, 12 years before New Mexico became a state. It remained the Senate chambers until 1966, when lawmakers moved into the Roundhouse. 
Two years later, state leaders renamed the old capitol the Bataan Memorial Building, in honor of 1,800 New Mexico National Guard soldiers who endured the Bataan Death March in World War II.
State officials expect to complete the $2.4 million restoration project late next summer, but many questions remain about what the “Red Room” will look like, including whether it will be red. 
Joe Vigil, spokesperson for the New Mexico General Services Department, told Source New Mexico Friday that state agencies collaborating on the redesign haven’t yet decided which version of the “Red Room” they’ll restore. 
It’s gone through several renovations over the last 125 years, he noted, so architects are still trying to figure out which architectural style they can restore it to the most faithfully. He expects they’ll make that decision soon.
How firefighters spared Fort Stanton from ‘a wildfire 170 years in the making’

“There’s still a lot of questions as to, was it built classical?” Vigil said of the different architectural styles. “Did it change to semi-territorial, Territorial? There’s going to be a recommendation in the next couple weeks as to what period we can actually verify, to go back to, because we don’t want to guess on it.”
To help them make that choice, state officials pored through photographs and documents to find details of the old designs. In July, the state Department of Cultural Affairs asked the public to submit any photos they might have of the room throughout its history. 
In its research, Vigil said the team found 1951 renovation plans, so using those plans is an option.
In the meantime, the room is closed to the public, deemed “uninhabitable“ due to falling ceiling tiles and other issues, Vigil said. Crews this week began removing balcony risers, doors, shutters, tiles and other fixtures in preparation for the room’s eventual rehabilitation. 
State officials announced in April the Bataan Memorial Building’s inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places. Officials approved it for the State Register of Cultural Properties in December. 
In a statement the GSD released ahead of the renovation, project manager Marilyn Martinez said she hopes the restoration honors the building’s history and its namesake.
“Ultimately, we want to make this renovation worthy of what this building stands for,” she said. “We want it to be part of the memorial that represents those service members who served in Bataan. We want to match that energy and make it something worthy for them.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Red-Room-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-17 15:57:44.706869

(Photo by Lori Kersey/West Virginia Watch)A Kanawha County circuit judge on Friday ruled against a mother seeking a religious exemption to the state’s school compulsory vaccination law on behalf of her son.
Judge Richard Lindsay dismissed the lawsuit against the Kanawha County Board of Education, saying that the state’s school vaccination law — with no religious exemptions — passes the strict scrutiny legal standard that the government must meet when determining if its action is constitutional. 
“Vaccination of our children is a compelling state interest and it is pursuing the least restrictive means in order to satisfy that compelling interest and it is narrowly tailored to the extent that it is the only way possible to keep outbreaks of measles and other diseases and viruses… at bay,” Lindsay said. 
Nakesha Watson filed the complaint against the Kanawha County school board on behalf of KJ, III, her child. The state Bureau for Public Health granted KJ a religious exemption to the school vaccine requirements, but the school board is not letting him attend school without being vaccinated, according to the complaint. 
Watson, who’s acting as her own attorney, did not show up to a hearing originally planned for Wednesday nor to a rescheduled hearing Friday morning. 
The case is one of a handful filed against school officials on the basis of Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s executive order in January requiring the state to offer religious and philosophical exemptions for school vaccination requirements. The executive order is based on the state’s 2023 Equal Protection for Religion Act. Morrisey has argued that the school vaccination law should be read alongside EPRA to allow religious exemptions.
All states require students to be vaccinated against a series of infectious diseases including measles, chicken pox and polio. West Virginia has been one of only five to allow only medical exemptions to those requirements. Morrisey has not rescinded his executive order even though the Legislature this year rejected a bill that would have codified the exemptions. 
Lindsay on Friday further ruled that Morrisey’s executive order does not have authority in the matter. 
“The court also finds that the governor through his executive order is not empowered to make law,” Lindsay said. “That is empowered and entrusted by our state Legislature. And on three occasions since [Equal Protection for Religion Act] has become law, the Legislature has refused the amendment of the [Compulsory Vaccination Law] for religious and or philosophical exemptions. 
“It is the Legislature’s authority to make and or amend law and to pursue those and pass those exemptions, should they arise,” Lindsay said.
The ruling Friday comes just after a Raleigh County Circuit judge entered a ruling certifying that families across the state who have asked the state for a religious or philosophical exemption can be part of a class. Judge Michael Froble said he would enter a final ruling by the end of November on behalf of all the approximately 575 families who have asked the state Department of Health for religious or philosophical exemption.
In his order Thursday certifying the class, Froble defined the class as anyone who has sought, will in the future seek or has obtained a religious exemption to the state’s compulsory school vaccination law under the Equal Protection for Religion Act and those been denied access to school because of enforcement of the state’s school vaccination law. 
The class excludes those that have received final judgement for a similar lawsuit in another court. Parties who have filed lawsuits in other counties may join the Raleigh County class when they withdraw their pending claims with permission from the other court.
Froble in July granted a preliminary injunction allowing students in the Raleigh case to attend class with a religious exemption.
During that hearing, Froble ruled said the state’s mandatory school vaccine law is invalid without a religious exemption to the law. If there were any question, he said, the state’s Equal Protection for Religion Act makes it clear the law should make exceptions for religious beliefs. 
The issue seems destined to be decided by the state Supreme Court. The state Board of Education has already filed notice that it would appeal Froble’s July preliminary injunction ruling.
Speaking to reporters after the hearing, Corey Palumbo, an attorney representing the Kanawha County Board of Education, said Lindsay’s ruling was good. 
“I think he understands the clear language of the [compulsory vaccination law] does not provide for a religious exemption,” he said. “I think he understands the separation of powers argument. I think even if the EPRA does apply to the CVL, it passes strict scrutiny. So I think it’s a good ruling.”

(Jim Neuger/Maine Morning Star)Thousands of state employees and programs relied on by tens of thousands of Mainers are at risk if the federal government shutdown continues into November. 
Kirsten Figueroa, commissioner of the Maine Department of Administrative and Financial Services, gave the Legislature’s Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee an update on the impact of the shutdown on state finances and operations on Friday afternoon. 
“I’m not going to caveat it,” she said. “Just the fact of the matter is: the daily evaluation and also the daily information that comes in and then changes, it sometimes frustrates people because it doesn’t feel like they’re getting information fast enough.”
“But the fact of the matter is, we’re hearing something and we make a plan for that, and the next day we hear something that’s different, and so we are, right now, adjusting to all of that and doing the best that we can.”
Employees 
There are approximately 2,500 state of Maine employees whose jobs are funded, either entirely or in part by federal funds. According to DAFS’s evaluation, there is enough funding to cover employee pay through the end of October, though that’s being reevaluated daily. 
“After that, we will definitely be in a position in a number of our programs where we’ll have to start issuing layoff notices,” Figueroa said. 
One of the largest entities that the state would have to start considering layoffs for if the federal shutdown goes into November is the Maine Department of Defense, Veterans and Emergency Management, which has approximately 106 state employee positions that are fully or partially funded by the federal government.
Changes with federal employees outside of Maine would also have impacts on the state 
For example, earlier on Friday lawmakers discussed plans for how the state will conform with federal tax changes made in the GOP spending bill passed this summer.
“There was a lot of promise of technical assistance, guidance, updated forms, for instance, tax forms at the federal level that need to be changed as a result,” Figueroa said. “But as I’m sure that you all know, half — over 36,000 IRS employees — were furloughed.” 
Without that support, Figueroa expects implementation delays which, she said, “will only cause more confusion and probably mistakes as those things start to move.”
Grants
How long the state of Maine will be able to continue work funded by federal grants will be specific to each individual grant. 
“Which is, I know, an answer that sometimes frustrates,” Figueroa said, “but it really is dependent on what grant we’re talking about.”
And, she said, “when the funding runs out, the authority runs out.” The state won’t be able to move money that had been dedicated for a different purpose to help cover a grant serving another purpose. 
If the shutdown continues, some pauses are already expected. On October 10, the Maine Department of Health and Human Services was notified by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service to pause or delay their November issuance of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, SNAP.
“If the current lapse in appropriations continues, there will be insufficient funds to pay full November food SNAP benefits for approximately 42 million individuals across the nation,” the notice read. 
With funding for courts in question, Congress stuck in shutdown gridlock for day 16

An estimated 172,000 Mainers receive SNAP benefits.
While the state has the authority and funding, agencies can try to alleviate the impact of the shutdown and postpone the impacts, Figueroa said.  
She used an example of a program that relies on federal match. If it has a $100 federal component and a $100 state general fund match and $2 is spent every day — $1 in federal money and $1 in state money —  then normally the program could last for 100 days.
Figueroa explained that without the federal component the state could “make the decision to spend $2 out of the match, because it’s the same authority, the same purpose, with the expectation that when this settles out then the feds will reimburse and then we go back to being able to replenish our match and move forward.”
However, that’s with the expectation that the federal government will eventually pass a budget that provides that reimbursement. 
Figueroa also said that if the state is put in the position where it has to cover a federal match or other federal expenses for a period of time, the administration would have to grant permission through financial orders, which require a 30-day wait. 
“Because we really wouldn’t have the opportunity to wait, it’s possible we would be coming to this committee with financial orders the longer this goes on,” she said. 
Long vs. short term solution 
How lawmakers in Washington, D.C., ultimately choose to end the shutdown will also have implications for Maine. 
For example, the Maine Department of Transportation has to pay certain obligations first, so if Congress passes an annual appropriation, it would provide the agency some flexibility. However, if there is only a short-term stopgap measure, funding would need to go toward those obligations.  
Figueroa said that would mean MDOT’s funding “could be significantly impacted if there isn’t a longer-term solution that comes out of this shutdown.”  
Currently, MDOT is paying about $27 million per week with its existing cash. That should get them through the next three weeks, Figueroa said, and with some financial orders likely three more weeks after that.
“After that, without a longer term appropriation from the federal government, DOT’s ability to contract and pay its contractors significantly reduces,” Figueroa said.

(Photo by Laura Paton/Rhode Island Current)Providence Place mall’s penthouse movie theater is poised for a remake under a new lease agreement that could start as soon as Nov. 1, pending court approval.
Mark Russo, the court-appointed receiver for the downtown shopping center, announced plans to bring in Apple Cinemas to operate the movie theater in a press release Thursday. Russo also filed a petition in Providence County Superior Court the same day, seeking permission from Judge Brian Stern to finalize the new lease agreement with the regional movie theater operator.
“This represents an important step forward for Providence Place and its future,” Russo said in a statement. “We’re pleased to have reached an agreement with Apple Cinemas — an experienced and growing regional operator — and we’re confident this will bring new energy and an enhanced movie-going experience to the mall.”
The proposed lease, which has already been signed by Russo and by Apple, according to court documents, comes just before the departure of the existing movie theater operator, Showcase Cinemas, owned by National Amusements. Showcase was set to end its 23-year run in Providence on Jan. 31, but Russo sought to cut ties early and find a new movie theater operator.
Stern approved Russo’s request to end the existing contract with Showcase on Thursday, according to court documents.
Showcase did not respond to inquiries for comment Friday. However, its website notes that it will cease operations at Providence Place on Oct. 26 “due to a business decision.”
The 128,000-square-foot cinema contributed nearly 10% of the mall’s annual rent in 2024 — the second-largest source of income after Boscov’s — making its occupancy critical to the mall’s financial future. The shopping center has struggled to stay afloat amid shifts in shopping habits and the loss of flagship stores, culminating in receivership — the state-level equivalent of bankruptcy — in October 2024. The receivership was prompted by a lawsuit from a group of private lenders who alleged they were owed $259 million from a 2011 mortgage loan taken out by the mall owner, Brookfield Properties.
Since taking over the operations and finances, Russo has brought in a new management company, added security and authorized major infrastructure repairs, while also securing court permission to list the property for sale. A listing was slated to hit the market in September, but as of Friday, the property has not been publicly advertised online.
Sarah Dell, a spokesperson for Russo, said in an email Friday that the process to prepare the property for sale has begun, but that a few “procedural and operational matters” still needed to be completed.
“These steps are typical in a court-supervised process, and reflects the commitment to maximizing the property’s value and ensuring a smooth sale process,” Dell said.
Russo also touted the new lease with Apple Cinemas as part of larger efforts to rejuvenate the mall.
“This is part of our broader effort to position Providence Place for long-term success by taking advantage of opportunities that add appeal and value for visitors, other tenants, and the community,” Russo said. 
According to court filings, Apple Cinemas was one of several movie theater operators that expressed interest in taking over the Providence Place movie theater. The number of other offers, and the identities of the companies, was not disclosed.
However, Russo wrote in the court petition that Apple Cinemas’ offer had the best terms and conditions, and that he was “impressed” by the company’s operations at the 10-screen theater next to the Warwick Mall.
Apple Cinemas did not immediately respond to requests for comment Friday. A copy of the lease was submitted to Stern for review, but not available for public view.
A court hearing on Russo’s motion for the new lease with Apple Cinemas has been scheduled for Monday, Oct. 20, at 10 a.m., according to the public docket. If approved, Apple could take over operations on Nov. 1, with plans for an “upgraded movie-going experience” in its “signature format,” according to the press release. Details will not be shared until after court approval.
The 1.4-million-square-foot shopping center opened in 1999 after a series of delays and changes to financing and development terms. The final funding package for the $460 million project featured a state bond and a tax treaty with the city of Providence. The state deal used mall sales tax revenue to repay the debt on the bond that paid for construction. The state made its final $73 million payment on the bond in 2019.
The 30-year tax treaty with the city of Providence is set to end in 2028. Under the current agreement, the mall pays $500,000 a year in city property taxes. If taxed at fiscal 2026 city commercial rates, the property would be paying nearly $21.4 million in taxes based on its 2025 assessed value of $730.8 million.
A change in movie theater tenant does not affect the property’s tax payment to the city.

(Photo by Steve Hockstein/HarvardStudio.com)A man whose criminal case helped redefine juvenile justice in New Jersey left prison Friday after nearly 26 years behind bars, a release civil rights advocates celebrated as an affirmation of their decade-long fight against extreme prison sentences for minors.
James Comer was 17 when he was sentenced in 2003 to 75 years behind bars — with no possibility of parole for 68 years — for a deadly 2000 robbery spree in Newark in which he was an accomplice but not the triggerman.
He successfully appealed, with the state Supreme Court decreeing in 2022 that juveniles shouldn’t face the same mandatory sentences adults face, that judges must weigh immaturity and other “hallmark features” of youth in setting punishment, and that minors condemned to lengthy sentences can petition for sentencing review after 20 years.
Since then, such sentencing reviews have become known as “Comer hearings,” and Comer had his own Comer hearing not long after his 2022 landmark win, with a judge reducing his sentence to 25 1/2 years.
Under his original sentence, he wouldn’t have been eligible for parole until 2069, at 86 years old. Instead, at age 42, he walked out of Northern State Prison in Newark Friday, meeting a joyful group of attorneys and other supporters who waited for him outside.
“It means the world to me to have the opportunity to rejoin my loved ones,” he said. “I am forever grateful for this second chance and relieved that no child will face the hopelessness that I endured when I was effectively sentenced to die in prison.”

Attorney Alexander Shalom, who represented Comer for years, said his case demonstrates the importance of second chances, especially for young people.
“James’ resilience and unwavering belief in positive change have forever advanced youth justice in New Jersey,” Shalom said.
Nationally, the U.S. Supreme Court has drastically limited extreme sentences for law-breaking minors in a series of rulings dating back to 2005, in which they barred judges from sentencing people under 18 to the death penalty, life without parole in non-homicide cases, and mandatory life terms in homicide cases, with exceptions for “permanent incorrigibility.”
In New Jersey, the state Supreme Court’s Comer ruling came after years of court fights and legislative advocacy. Since 2022, nearly 100 people condemned to lengthy terms behind bars for offenses they committed as children have successfully petitioned New Jersey courts for Comer hearings, according to the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey.
Amol Sinha, the group’s executive director, said Comer’s case is “part of a bigger story of decarceration in New Jersey” and a racial justice victory in a state with some of the highest racial disparities in its prisons in the nation.
His release comes after the Christie administration ended cash bail in 2014 and the Murphy administration signed a law in 2020 allowing early releases during public health emergencies. It also comes after Gov. Phil Murphy launched a clemency effort in 2024 that has seen him pardon or commute the sentences of 170 people — more clemencies than New Jersey governors have done in the past 30 years combined. Such efforts have cut New Jersey’s prison population, now about 13,000, by about half since 2011.
“James’ story is yet another story where New Jersey can claim leadership of being one of the most forward-thinking states when it comes to decarceration and justice,” Sinha said. “He was effectively sentenced to die in prison. Because of his persistence and his fight, now dozens of people across New Jersey are able to face a more just juvenile justice system.”

(File/Mint Images/Getty Images)COLUMBIA — A transgender student in Berkeley County dropped his appeals in a lawsuit over public school bathrooms after switching to virtual learning, one of his attorneys said Friday.
The high school freshman, who is unnamed in court filings, filed suit in November 2024, claiming a clause in the state budget violates the Constitution’s equal protection clause and federal law prohibiting discrimination. The budget rule puts school districts at risk of losing 25% of their state aid if they let transgender students use multi-occupancy bathrooms and locker rooms that align with their gender identity.
The underlying case will continue, the student’s attorney said.
However, the case is on pause until the U.S. Supreme Court hands down a decision in a lawsuit challenging a 2021 West Virginia law that bans transgender students from playing on girls’ and women’s teams in public K-12 schools and colleges. South Carolina passed a similar law in 2022. The nation’s high court agreed July 3 to hear the West Virginia case.
Transgender student can continue using boys’ bathroom, US Supreme Court says

Part of the Berkeley County student’s appeal challenged that pause. The appeal also asked the court to suspend the law while the case proceeds.
The student, referred to in court documents as John Doe, was allowed to use the bathroom of his choice while the appeal made its way through the courts following a U.S. Supreme Court order last month. That decision applied only to that student and acted as a temporary stopgap until judges handed down a decision on the appeal itself.
The student no longer needed that decision made after switching to virtual learning this month “because of discrimination based on his gender identity, including harassment from school staff and peers,” said Alexandra Brodsky, an attorney for Public Justice, which is representing the student.
“Our client’s experience at school is, unfortunately, not unique,” Brodsky said in a statement. “Transphobic harassment is rampant in many South Carolina public schools. And it is spurred by discriminatory laws like the proviso, which feed baseless stereotypes about, and hostility toward, transgender people.”
Directives in the state budget are technically called provisos, and they carry the same legal weight as permanent state law.
A spokeswoman for Berkeley County School District did not respond to a call or email requesting comment.
Attorney General Alan Wilson declared victory, emphasizing that the law remains in effect.
“This is a major win for common sense and for South Carolina families,” Wilson said in a statement.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/bathroom-stalls-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-17 14:57:59.771360

The program began this week with the first in a series of collaborative workshop sessions.
The fellowship seeks to support whole newsrooms — rather than focusing on individual reporters — in reporting on the science of climate and environmental change. It will provide training and resources for producing “long-term, accurate, equitable, and impactful coverage” for the communities served by each newsroom, according to an announcement. 
“The communities we cover have already experienced climate-related events, and that’s not going away. This fellowship is an excellent opportunity to better understand what our audience needs and make that information accessible,” said CT Mirror Executive Editor Elizabeth Hamilton.
The institute, based in the URI College of the Environment and Life Sciences, is a collaborative endeavor between higher education, government, nonprofit, business and community leaders and newsrooms to “improve and expand news coverage of environmental topics.”
This year’s cohort is the Metcalf Institute’s second, and includes newsrooms ranging in size, representing all six states in New England. The participating newsrooms are:

Beacon Media 
Connecticut Mirror
Daily Hampshire Gazette 
The New Bedford Light 
New Hampshire Public Radio 
The Providence Eye 
Vermont Community Newspaper Group
WBZ | CBS Boston
WERU Community Radio
The West End News

This fall, participating journalists will engage in training sessions. Early next year, Metcalf Institute leaders will coach the newsrooms through a project they develop and implement. 
John Moritz, CT Mirror’s energy and environment reporter, led the effort to apply for the fellowship. “This is an opportunity for everyone at the CT Mirror — regardless of our individual beats — to explore how climate is impacting the people and topics we cover,” he said. “In addition, Metcalf’s collaborative sessions will allow us to meet with skilled reporters in other newsrooms to learn how they are approaching climate-related stories around New England.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Climate-Ready-Newsrooms-2026.png,,,2025-10-17 14:57:59.771360

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – A state agency that regulates the ethical behavior of candidates and politicians filed suit Thursday against Rep. Ajay Pittman.
The suit was filed by the Oklahoma Ethics Commission in Oklahoma County District Court. The Attorney General’s Office confirmed it is also investigating Pittman, D-Oklahoma City.
The Ethics Commission lawsuit alleges Pittman committed fraud and breach of contract by filing fake documents to settle a previous ethics investigation. It seeks actual and punitive damages, costs and attorney fees.
In 2024, Pittman entered a settlement agreement with the Ethics Commission. She admitted using her campaign account to pay expenses not related to her office or campaign.
She admitted to inaccurate reporting of $30,000 in contributions in 2020 and another $20,000 in 2022, in violation of ethics rules.
She also failed to maintain 2020 and 2022 campaign records, also in violation of ethics rules.
She agreed to pay $35,000, which included reimbursements to her campaign and a civil penalty.
Prior to the agreement, she submitted a falsified letter from a building manager indicating her campaign records had been destroyed due to water damage, the Ethics Commission lawsuit alleged.
The suit alleges the letter was written by her mother, former lawmaker Anastasia Pittman, not the building manager, two minutes before it was submitted to the Ethics Commission to induce it to accept her settlement offer.
In addition, the suit alleges Pittman submitted a falsified check to the agency as proof she had made a payment from her personal funds as outlined in the settlement agreement.
Pittman’s “submission of falsified documents to the Ethics Commission was intentional, malicious, and in reckless disregard of the Commission’s enforcement authority and statutory duties,” the suit said.
As a result, the agency suffered damages in the form of the unpaid settlement amount, administrative costs and attorney fees.
The suit alleges she is in breach of the settlement agreement.
Pittman, who was elected to her fourth term in 2024, did not return phone calls seeking comment.
“The Ethics Commission has conducted a thorough review of the scenario surrounding Campaign Finance violations and Breach of Settlement by Representative Pittman and are ensuring the appropriate steps are taken to hold an elected official responsible and provide transparency to the citizens of Oklahoma,” said Executive Director Lee Anne Bruce Boone.
House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, said it was inappropriate, in light of the Ethics Commission’s actions, for Pittman to continue to serve in a role overseeing state-tribal relations and removed her from a related committee where she served as vice chairman. She remains a member of other committees.
The Oklahoma Attorney General’s office on Thursday served a search warrant on her Capitol office, as reported by NonDoc. 
The agency operates the multi-county grand jury.
A spokeswoman confirmed an ongoing investigation, adding that that search warrant was filed under seal.

(Photo courtesy of Getty Images)Allegations that Centreville High School staff coerced minors into getting abortions and assisted them in undergoing the procedure without their parents’ knowledge are “likely untrue,” Oct. 16 findings from Fairfax County Public School’s legal probe surmised. 
The legal probe runs parallel to a separate, ongoing Virginia State Police investigation launched at the request of Gov. Glenn Youngkin after a conservative blogger reported in August that a FCPS teacher named Zaneida Perez alleged another staff member had helped students obtain abortions in 2021. The blogger has family ties to Youngkin but he said it didn’t influence his investigation.
Fairfax abortion allegations fuel new political firestorm in Virginia governor’s race

Under Virginia law, it is illegal for minors to get surgeries, like abortions, unless they have parental consent or a successful petition to a court. Such court records are also exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. 
In the FCPS allegations case, emails between the accused staffer, a social worker, and Centreville’s former principal purport that “proper protocol” was followed concerning pregnant students, who were referred to a school nurse. The school nurse was employed by the local health department rather than the school division, and was legally allowed to discuss reproductive health care options with students. 
The documents released by King & Spaulding, the law firm FCPS hired, stem from their investigation into the abortion allegations and are part of a U.S. Department of Education request that required documentation regarding the matter. 
While the school division’s law firm said they have been unable to locate the former student who allegedly obtained an abortion, a letter purportedly written by the student that was referenced in the blogger’s report may have actually been written by Perez. That’s due to a “high similarity” in the handwriting of the supposed student letter and other complaints filed by Perez, the legal counsel said. 
The lawyers also recently spoke with a student that Perez claimed had been pressured to have an abortion, but the student said as recently as Oct. 9 this year that it was the school nurse she consulted, not the accused social worker, and that high school staff have been supportive of her decision to continue her pregnancy and give birth. 
The newly-released documents also suggest that Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares and Youngkin may have known about the allegations for more than a year, but have only spoken out about them in recent months, ahead of this fall’s pivotal statewide elections. 
The documents include a complaint about the abortion allegations from March 2023 that Perez filed with the attorney general’s office, which FCPS claims they were never contacted about. 
While the state attorney general office doesn’t have the local jurisdiction to prosecute the local complaint from Perez, the filing noted how a referral to state police could have been made in 2023. 
“OAG’s Office of Civil Rights has no record of a complaint filed by Ms. Perez,” a spokesperson for Miayres’ office said in a Oct. 17 email. 
A spokesman for Youngkin said in an October email that the governor learned of the allegations following the August report, after which he had directed state police to launch a criminal investigation. 
The filing from FCPS’ lawyers’ probe also pointed to social media posts by a Northern Virginia parental rights activist that claim the Youngkin administration knew about the allegations “a year ago.”
In the new filings from their law firm, FCPS collectively shared that it finds it “very disturbing that so many of the individuals who are now (in the weeks leading up to a hotly contested election) shining a spotlight on these dated (and, our investigation shows, likely false) allegations have known about these same allegations for years.”
Walter Curt, the investigative reporter who published the August report about the abortion allegations, cast doubt on the law firm’s findings and took to social media to emphasize that a state police investigation is still underway.  
“We don’t have to give even a remote bit of credibility to the ‘findings’ of multimillion dollar law firms hired to try and get FCPS and Michelle Reid out of hot water,” he wrote on Oct. 17. 
FCPS Superintendent Michelle Reid has been under fire from parents along with state and federal leaders much of the year for various decisions, including overhauling admissions  at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology to promote greater diversity, and resisting statewide transgender policies that advocates said infringe on trans students’ rights. By mid-August, the district had begun arranging a security detail for Reid.
Fairfax will hire security for its superintendent. Could Va. see this elsewhere?

Reid is also not the only local official to draw ire from Virginia’s executive branch. Steve Descano, Fairfax County’s Commonwealth Attorney, has been frequently portrayed by Miyares as too lenient a prosecutor. As attorney general, Miyares has long pushed for changes in state law that could allow the state to intervene in local prosecutions. 
The abortion allegations have percolated ahead of this year’s elections for the state’s executive branch —  Miyares is seeking a second term — and as the entire House of Delegates is also up for election. An in-progress constitutional amendment could enshrine reproductive rights including abortion access, but its potential to advance to voters on statewide ballots next year hinges on Democrats retaining their majority in the House this year. 
Reid issued a statement to Centreville families and staff on Oct. 16, echoing the attorney’s findings that so far indicate the abortion allegations are “likely untrue.”
“As I stated in a letter to the school community two days following these allegations, such behavior would never be acceptable in Fairfax County Public Schools,” Reid wrote.

The U.S. Courts said at the time they would be able to use “court fee balances and other funds not dependent on a new appropriation” to keep up and running through Friday.The new announcement from the courts said that several activities are excepted and can legally continue during the funding lapse. Those include anything necessary “for the safety of human life and protection of property, and activities otherwise authorized by federal law. “Excepted work will be performed without pay during the funding lapse. Staff members not performing excepted work will be placed on furlough.”The statement said that each individual court throughout the federal system will make its own decision about how active cases will proceed during the shutdown. “Anyone with Judiciary business should direct questions to the appropriate clerk of court’s office, probation and pretrial supervision office, or federal defender organization, or consult their websites,” the announcement read. People summoned for federal jury duty will still need to report as instructed, since that program “is funded by money not affected by the appropriations lapse and will continue to operate.”The online case management and electronic filing system, known as PACER, will keep operating despite the shutdown’s impact on the courts.",,,,2025-10-17 15:57:44.706869

Those include anything necessary “for the safety of human life and protection of property, and activities otherwise authorized by federal law. “Excepted work will be performed without pay during the funding lapse. Staff members not performing excepted work will be placed on furlough.”The statement said that each individual court throughout the federal system will make its own decision about how active cases will proceed during the shutdown. “Anyone with Judiciary business should direct questions to the appropriate clerk of court’s office, probation and pretrial supervision office, or federal defender organization, or consult their websites,” the announcement read. People summoned for federal jury duty will still need to report as instructed, since that program “is funded by money not affected by the appropriations lapse and will continue to operate.”The online case management and electronic filing system, known as PACER, will keep operating despite the shutdown’s impact on the courts. A spokesperson for the U.S. Supreme Court did not immediately return a request for information about its funding situation. But a spokesperson for that court told States Newsroom in late September that it “will rely on permanent funds not subject to annual approval, as it has in the past, to maintain operations through the duration of short-term lapses of annual appropriations.”",,,,2025-10-17 14:57:59.771360

Jeanne Shaheen speaks at a roundtable discussion in Concord on Oct. 17, 2025. In early October, the federal government shut down after senators were unable to pass a spending plan. (Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said official negotiations with Republicans to end the federal government shutdown aren’t occurring in Washington right now, only backdoor communications.
“There are a lot of people on both sides of the aisle who are talking about how can we end this and get government operating again and how do we address the health care issue,” she said in an interview with the Bulletin after a roundtable event in Concord. “But nothing official is happening, and again, that’s the problem. We need leadership on both sides of the aisle in both houses and the president to come to the table and help do official negotiations so we can end this.”
The federal government ceased nonessential operations earlier this month after the Senate failed to pass a spending plan. Senate Republicans proposed keeping funding largely at current levels, but Democrats refused to vote for any package that didn’t extend a set of soon-to-expire tax credits used by Americans to purchase health coverage on the Affordable Care Act Marketplace. The Democrats countered with a spending plan that spent roughly $1 trillion more to extend the subsidies and reverse many of the health spending cuts made by Republicans in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in July. The sides failed to reach an agreement by Oct. 1, prompting the government shutdown. Both parties have blamed one another for the shutdown.
“The impasse is that, on the one hand, we’re hearing from the majority (Republicans) in both houses and the president saying, ‘We’re not going to talk about the Affordable Care Act premium tax credits as long as the government is shut down,’” Shaheen, a Democrat, said. “And on the other side, we’re saying, ‘Look, we think this needs to be done. There’s urgency. We need to get it done, so let’s do it as part of opening the government.’”
If the shutdown doesn’t end by Oct. 31, the federal government won’t provide New Hampshire with the funding to operate the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which provides low-income families with help purchasing food. Shaheen wouldn’t say whether she’d vote to end the shutdown if Republicans haven’t agreed to extend the tax credits by then. She pointed the finger at Republicans.
“I think you need to ask Republicans why they continue to shut down the government,” Shaheen said. “Why they’re not willing to address the people who are going to lose their health insurance because of losing their premium tax credits. There’s an easy fix here, and people ought to be willing to come to the table and do both.”
As part of that government shutdown, many federal workers have been furloughed or are being asked to work without pay. Asked how she squares the pain of those federal workers with the pain she’s trying to prevent among Americans who will lose their tax credits, Shaheen said “I think we can do both (end the shutdown and renew the tax credits).”
“Listen, we’re spending $20 billion to bail out Argentina,” she said, referring to the Trump administration’s decision to send aid to the South American country amid increasing inflation under libertarian President Javier Milei. “This administration is willing to bail out Argentina, but they’re going to let 20 million people’s premiums rise so that they can’t afford their health insurance.”
Shaheen emphasized her desire to renew the tax credits. In New Hampshire, just under 50,000 people used the tax credit in 2025, according to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services data. If the credits expire, premiums are set to spike. A single person in their mid-40s earning $31,300 in New Hampshire annually could see their total annual premiums increase $1,344, according to analysis from New Futures, which hosted the roundtable Friday, and Families USA; additionally, a couple in their 60s earning $90,000 annually could see their premiums increase $14,712.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/shaheenshutdown-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-17 14:03:29.301808

The Lafayette County Board of Supervisors will decide whether to approve the change on Monday. The county’s planning commission voted 3-1 last month to move forward with the proposal. 
Residents have come together over concerns about the precedent the rezoning would set, potential air emissions and water run off, and how the plant would affect the bucolic nature of the town of about 300 people.
“We’re worried about pollution and how it’ll affect our health,” said Melissa Roberson, a Taylor resident.
The September planning commission meeting saw a large turnout, with most voicing objections to the plant proposal. Many came in support of Falkner Farms, a grass-fed beef and egg producer that supplies markets in the area. 
The family-owned farm sits across a two-lane highway from the proposed asphalt site. Reed Falkner, whose parents bought the land in 1996 to raise their family, is worried the plant would disturb their business. Too much noise, for instance, could cause chickens to produce fewer eggs, he said.

“There’s the potential to put us out of business,” Falkner said. “ This decision (from the county) has a lot of weight. It’s sending a much larger message than asphalt over agriculture. It’s the precedent they’re setting.”
J.W. McCurdy, the developer and owner of the land where the asphalt plant will be built, has lived in Lafayette County since he was 3 years old. 
“I’ve lived here virtually my entire life,” McCurdy said. “I care about the success of Lafayette County as much as anybody in the world. I mean, I’m probably going to die here.”
Between new subdivisions and paving roads, the county has a high demand for asphalt, Joel Hollowell, the county’s director of development services, said. He also pointed to an upcoming project, starting in March, to add new lanes to parts of Mississippi Highway 7.
“We’ve survived a lot of years without competition (in the asphalt market),” Hollowell said. “Could we survive longer? Probably so, but competition tends to create a more affordable product.”
McCurdy and other local developers said the area has only one asphalt provider, which has long lines and isn’t always open when it’s needed. That’s why a new plant could help make it easier and cheaper to build around Oxford, McCurdy said. 
“ I’m trying to better our community and make things more affordable for people to be able to buy houses, rent houses, build restaurants or whatever it may be,” McCurdy said.
Regarding concerns over emissions and runoff, such as into the nearby Yocona River, Hollowell said the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality would have to approve any water runoff or air emissions before the plant could open. 
In 2022, MDEQ cited McCurdy for violating rules around sediment runoff at a construction site in Oxford. The developer told Mississippi Today the error was quickly fixed, describing it as a “misperformance by a subcontractor.”
For nearby residents, though, the decision before the county isn’t just about the asphalt plant. It’s about preserving the area’s identity in the face of growing development and constant expansion around Oxford. Especially amid local struggles with rising housing costs, as The Daily Mississippian wrote about a year ago.
“This kind of fight is a familiar growing pain in counties that are transitioning from rural to suburban,” said Ellen Meacham, a longtime resident of Taylor who saw similar fights in DeSoto County during the late 1990s.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/16123324/IMG_1690.jpg,,,2025-10-17 14:03:29.301808

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)New reporting on controversial comments made by Graham Platner in years past is drawing scrutiny to the Democratic U.S. Senate candidate, who has generated significant grassroots excitement since his campaign launch in August.
While the oyster farmer and veteran has been gaining support with his frank speech, the posts reveal a potential vulnerability for the political newcomer as he goes up against seasoned campaigners with national backing.
The comments were reported by national outlets days after Maine Gov. Janet Mills, the favorite of Democratic Party leaders, entered the race to challenge Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins.
On Wednesday, CNN reported on several now-deleted Reddit posts made by Platner in 2020. In one, the Hancock County native responded to a thread titled “white people aren’t as racist or stupid as Trump thinks.” He wrote, “Living in white rural America, I’m afraid to tell you they actually are.”
In another, he described himself as “a vegetable growing, psychedelics taking socialist these days.” 
Platner, who served in Iraq and Afghanistan and has been open about his depression after returning home in 2018, wrote, “After the war, I’ve pretty much stopped believing in any of the patriotic nonsense that got me there in the first place, and am a firm believer that the best thing a person can do is help their neighbors and live a loving life.”
His campaign did not respond to a request for comment, but told other outlets he largely regretted the remarks.
“I didn’t feel connected. I didn’t feel like I understood my place in the world, my place in our society. And that of course resulted in a lot of feelings of alienation and loneliness,” he told Maine Public in response to the reporting. “And that’s when all this happened.” 
Politico followed Thursday with reporting on several 2018 posts made by Platner also on Reddit forums highlighting his belief that violence may be necessary to counter facism. 
Responding to another user concerned about what their roommate would say if they purchased their first AR-15, Platner reportedly replied: “Tell them that if they expect to fight fascism without a good semi-automatic rifle, they ought to do some reading of history.”
In another post, Platner said he agreed with the views of former socialist presidential candidate Eugene V. Debs, writing, “An armed working class is a requirement for economic justice.”
A primary focus of Platner’s campaign has been to return the Democratic Party to one of and for working people, while building a lasting structure in Maine for grassroots organizing. He has also been a vocal critic of establishment politicians, including Mills and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who reportedly recruited the Maine governor to enter the race.
“I made dumb jokes and picked fights,” Platner told Politico. “But of course I’m not a socialist. I’m a small business owner, a Marine Corps veteran, and a retired shitposter.”
Before the revelations, political scientist and writer Amy Fried made the argument that a contested primary would be helpful to sharpen Platner’s skills “in a real campaign environment.”
“If there’s anything we know about how Susan Collins runs for the Senate, it’s that her staff is aggressive and tenacious,” Fried wrote on her Substack. “One of its core strategies is to find a weakness in her opponent and hammer them persistently so it sticks in the minds of Maine voters.”

(Photo courtesy of Idaho Education News)This story was originally posted on IdahoEdNews.org on Oct. 15, 2025.
Jerome Joint School District trustees this month will consider adopting a policy that removes a long-standing prohibition on audio and visual recordings during public school board meetings.
School district staff on Aug. 26 told a local television reporter and newspaper reporter that it is against district policy to record a school board meeting. Superintendent Brent Johnson said he consulted with legal counsel the next morning, then called KMVT and the Twin Falls Times-News to say that policy needs to be amended. Trustees took a first reading of the updated policy on Sept. 23 and are expected to adopt the policy on Oct. 28.
“We needed to update that,” Johnson told EdNews on Monday. “That hadn’t been our practice and certainly isn’t our practice moving forward. So we want it to be open.”
While the new policy will allow attendees to record meetings, the district is not following a growing trend of other districts that provide patrons the opportunity to watch meetings from home as they happen, or days later. Jerome provides live audio via a Zoom link in meeting agendas, but does not record that audio for later listening.
About 30% of Idaho school districts and charters provide livestreams of meetings, an EdNews review found this week, a 10% increase from two years ago. More districts started livestreaming meetings during the COVID-19 pandemic when social distancing was necessary.
Jerome has had a policy on the books since 2006 that regulates conduct at open meetings. The policy broadly prohibits the public from using audio recording devices, cameras and video equipment during school board meetings. The board may allow the public to take photos and videos, however, when it “would be desirable” for the board, such as when the district presents awards or swears in new trustees.
A blanket ban on video and audio recording is beyond unreasonable, according to the Idaho Press Club, and violates the media’s constitutionally protected rights to cover government entities.
“We believe that your policy regarding video and audio recording violates Idaho’s open government laws, previous court rulings, and the First Amendment,” President Melissa Davlin wrote in a Sept. 2 letter to Jerome trustees.
READ: Idaho Press Club letter
The 19-year-old policy provides several explanations for the prohibition. It states audio recorders are “easily tampered with” and those tampered recordings might embarrass trustees. If the public is allowed to record meetings, then there must be an official recording prepared by the district “to secure the sanctity of the record.” High quality recording equipment is expensive, the policy adds.
“Fears of embarrassment or saying something inarticulate, as cited in section 5-a of your policy, do not trump the First Amendment,” Davlin wrote in the Sept. 2 letter.
The new policy simply crosses out the entire old policy and adds a section called, “Board Meeting News Coverage.”
“One of the paramount responsibilities of the Board of Trustees is to keep the public informed of its actions,” the new policy states. “Consequently, local news media representatives shall be welcome and encouraged to attend all regular and special meetings of the Board.”
READ: Jerome revised media policy
Audio, photo and video recordings are allowed at all meetings open to the public under the new policy. Camera operators must limit disruption and cannot obstruct the view between the audience and trustees.
Johnson, who was hired in July 2024, said the district consulted with the Idaho School Boards Association and used its model policy.
“We try and stay within their model policies as they’ve been legally approved and consulted with a team of attorneys,” he said.
In a written statement to EdNews on Tuesday, Davlin said she is pleased to see the proposed policy welcomes recording of public meetings.
“I hope the board officially adopts it, and that both the public and local media continue to attend these meetings,” Davlin wrote.
 How other school districts handle recordings

Idaho law does not require school districts to livestream or record meetings, but does require written minutes within a “reasonable time.” There is a wide variety in how Idaho school districts allow the public to follow along if they can’t attend a meeting in person.
An EdNews review this week of school district and charter school websites found 57 of 192, about 30%, livestream board meetings. That’s a 10% increase over the past two years. An EdNews review in 2023 found 39 of 186 districts and charters livestream meetings.
The review this week also found four districts post video recordings after meetings, but do not livestream, and three provide audio only.
Currently, the five largest districts in Idaho livestream and archive school board meetings on YouTube. West Ada and Boise school districts have catalogs of recordings going back to 2020. For most meetings in West Ada, many more people watch the videos than attend in person. The videos have hundreds, or sometimes thousands, of views.

Let Idaho Education News know how you follow your local school board meetings when you can’t attend in person. Do you have any concerns with how your district records, or doesn’t record, meetings? Contact reporter Sean Dolan at sean@idahoednews.org.

Vallivue, the sixth largest district, provides a call-in option that provides live audio during meetings. The district does not record meetings, deputy board clerk Jenny Titus confirmed. She said there haven’t been a lot requests for video recordings from patrons who can’t attend. The number of people who call during the meetings varies from month to month.
“Sometimes we have as little as five callers, sometimes we have up to 25 or 30,” Titus said. “It kind of depends on what’s going on and what’s on the agenda.”
Twin Falls School District livestreams meetings on YouTube, but does not record or archive them for later. The livestreams are provided as a courtesy, according to district spokesperson Eva Craner. If the district recorded meetings, those recordings would become an official record and the meetings would have to stop if the recording fails. Those records would also have to be maintained permanently, Craner said, and the district would likely have to purchase more servers and cloud storage solutions.
“With roughly 42 hours of meetings a year, conservatively, that storage could become costly quickly,” Craner wrote in an email to EdNews.
YouTube will store videos, Craner added, but that is part of the overall storage the district has available through Google that the district uses to store other documents in the cloud.
In Boise School District, spokesperson Dan Hollar said the district does not pay for storage on YouTube and the meetings would continue if the recording fails. But there are several hours of staffing costs to run the livestreams as well as costs to purchase and maintain equipment. Agendas include a disclaimer:
“As a courtesy, the meeting will be live-streamed and the link will be provided immediately prior to the meeting,” the agendas state. “Please note, if there are technical difficulties, the meeting will continue as scheduled.”

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)A preview of one of the debates anticipated next session came Friday when Maine’s Office of Tax Policy provided state lawmakers with an overview of Gov. Janet Mills’ temporary plan for conforming to federal changes to the tax code.  
On Oct. 1, Mills issued preliminary instructions for how the State Tax Assessor will administer Maine’s 2025 tax returns in light of changes made in the federal GOP spending bill passed this summer. But that’s not the final word on the topic. 
A state law passed last session allows the governor to make temporary adjustments to state tax administration in the case of nonconformity, or a lag between federal tax changes and state rules, which is common. But under that law, any temporary changes must be consistent with legislative intent as reflected in already enacted Maine tax laws.
The governor suggested not adopting a few provisions from the GOP bill: no tax on tips and overtime, allowing business owners to claim a tax deduction equal to 100% of the cost of a qualified property, and an immediate tax deduction for businesses based on qualifying research expenditures. 
This means that Mainers would still pay state taxes on these earnings, but not federal taxes. 
Dan Pittman, associate tax policy council for Maine’s Office of Tax Policy, walked through the specifics during a joint meeting of the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee and Taxation Committee Friday morning. He explained that the governor didn’t feel she had the authority to make a decision on those provisions based on the state law. 
“As the governor has made quite clear, this is not the end of the discussions of any of these topics,” Pittman said. 
Temporary determinations are ultimately contingent on lawmakers enacting  legislation that addresses the federal income tax law changes. 
Kirsten Figueroa, commissioner of the Maine Department of Administrative and Financial Services, said permanent changes also must be considered as a part of the larger fiscal conversation. 
“It’s just not as easy as, we see that something’s happening at the federal level — should we apply it?” Figueroa said.
Lawmakers are meeting later Friday to discuss state impacts from the ongoing federal government shutdown, as well as changes and cuts to programs and responsibilities shifted from the federal to state government. In light of that, Figueroa said, “We won’t be able to take just the tax implications and tax conformity piece because of the fiscal impact it will have in concert with what are the decisions that we’re going to make about those components as well, again all in spirit of needing to balance our budget.” 
The administration also discussed the need to wait for updated revenue projections expected in December. 
Rep. Kenneth Fredette (R-Newport) questioned why the governor didn’t call a special session to address conformity earlier. 
Those present from the tax office said it was above their pay grade but Appropriations Committee co-chair Sen. Peggy Rotundo (D-Lewiston) responded, “I would suspect that, given the amount of work that’s going to have to go into making these decisions, a special session one day would not have solved these issues.”
But Rep. Amy Arata (R-New Gloucester) called for a public hearing the first week of November to consider adopting federal tax changes, before the Legislature is slated to start its next session in January. 
Legislative Republicans have already been sharply criticizing the Mills administration for not fully conforming with the federal changes.
“It’s never enough for Maine Democrats. Instead of taking this opportunity to provide much-needed relief to Maine citizens, our Governor has chosen to continue with her unsustainable tax-and-spend mentality,” Senate Minority Leader Trey Stewart (R-Aroostook) said in a statement on Oct. 3. “Democrats’ angry obsession with opposing anything President Trump touches is going to continue to hurt Maine people.”
Fredette also questioned Friday that, if Maine doesn’t ultimately comply fully with federal tax changes, if it would essentially amount to tax increases for Mainers. 
Pittman said no. “If the state doesn’t conform or choose to piggyback off of a federal tax cut, your federal state tax isn’t changing. You just don’t get that benefit. There are parts of the Maine tax law that provide tax benefits that the federal government doesn’t provide.” An example: the federal government taxes Social Security benefits. But Maine doesn’t. 
Looking at federal changes holistically, the tax deductions may not be enough to offset the negative effects of other aspects of the Republicans’ spending bill.

(Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)LAWRENCE — University of Kansas Chancellor Doug Girod says dismantling of federal funding of university research, lukewarm state budgets, a precipitous drop in college-age students, rise of artificial intelligence and inflationary pressure on operating costs threaten the future of higher education.
These headwinds exist amid dwindling enthusiasm, regardless of political affiliation, in the public’s view of the value of investment in a college degree, the chancellor said. Positive sentiment among Americans for higher education has eroded from 70% to 40% in less than a decade, he said.
“The question of, is the investment worth it, is really the question that’s being asked a lot of our society,” Girod said. “It’s creating a time of fairly significant uncertainty across the country right now.”
Girod said computing power of artificial intelligence would transform KU and other higher education institutions. AI must be viewed as a “disruptor,” he said, but also an opportunity to evolve.
“It’s going to completely change how we educate. It’s going to completely change how we conduct research. It certainly is going to completely change how we conduct our business of higher education,” he said.
Girod shared the report Thursday during his annual “State of the University Address,” which featured a broad analysis of U.S. higher education as well as distinct challenges facing KU and a summary of the university’s enrollment, research and fundraising trends.

Positive trends
Girod said KU this fall achieved record student enrollment for the second consecutive year. The current freshman class at KU is the third largest in university history, he said. At the same time, the chancellor said, KU improved student retention and its graduation rate. The decline in 18-year-olds in the United States will make continuation of that track record increasingly difficult, he said.
“We have the most Kansas kids we’ve ever had. We have the most out-of-state kids we’ve ever had. That’s a great place to be at this moment in time,” he said.
The chancellor said KU documented nine consecutive years of growth in research funding as the total climbed from $337 million in 2017 to $611 million in 2024. The pipeline of research grants in the current year has “slowed down profoundly” as the administration of President Donald Trump rolled back federal research and development funding available to colleges and universities.
He said progress has been made with the “One KU” project to realign and unify administrative leadership of KU campuses in Lawrence, Wichita and Kansas City, Kansas. The idea is to create efficiencies by moving away from a decentralized campus-based administrative structure, he said.
“The goal of that is obviously to help us streamline and be far more strategic, but also far more nimble in leveraging our assets across all our campuses,” Girod said.
Girod told about 200 people during the speech that KU endowment’s fundraising campaign eclipsed the $2 billion mark with two years remaining in a 10-year quest to secure commitments of $2.5 billion. He said half the contributions were destined for KU’s Lawrence campus, 30% would be dedicated to KUMC and 20% was earmarked for athletics.
“I’m happy to stand up here and say the state of our university is actually quite strong,” Girod said. “Probably the strongest it’s ever been. I also know I say that in a moment when we probably have the highest degree of uncertainty that we’ve had … in the history of the university.”
 
Kansas headwinds
Girod said the 2025 Kansas Legislature adopted a flat budget in terms of base support for KU, which could be viewed as a step backward due to inflation. He said a 30% surge in operating costs in the past five years and combined challenges with state and federal funding prompted decisions to cut spending by $32 million on the Lawrence campus and to reduce spending by $39 million on the KU Medical Center campus in Kansas City, Kansas.
“I’ll tell you on the Lawrence campus about half of that cut will go to market pay for faculty and staff, but that really just gets us started on that journey,” Girod said.
David Smith, a professor of sociology, was among faculty and staff in the audience holding small signs during the chancellor’s speech that said “Contract now! Stop the delay” or “Fair contract now!” KU faculty and academic staff in April 2024 approved formation of a union by capturing 86% of the vote among nearly 1,000 participants in the election. The bargaining unit, United Academics of KU, represents employees with educational or research roles on campus.
“We have been in contract negotiations for well over a year now,” Smith said. “It’s been something like 450 days since those contract negotiations began.”
Smith said union negotiators were working to improve compensation, especially for adjunct faculty or people on short-term contracts. He said negotiations included an effort to enshrine in the first contract guarantees the administration formally shared governance with faculty and staff. For example, he said, union membership should have had a concrete role in discussing with KU administrators the 42 academic programs that were unilaterally discontinued in 2022.
Girod said the 2026 session of the Legislature would be important to KU, and early indications were that it would be another tight budget year for higher education. He anticipated legislators would renew a push to redefine university tenure so it no longer could be recognized as an “entitlement, right or property interest.” The 2025 version of that legislation was blocked by opponents, including Girod, from emerging from a House committee.
“We’ve already been told its coming back again. We know that’s something we’re going to have to pay attention to because it’s so critical to what we do and who we are as an institution,” the chancellor said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Doug-Girod-speech-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-17 14:03:29.301808

(Photo from Canva)Louisiana officials increased the construction budget this week for a new 80-bed regional jail dedicated exclusively to 17-year-olds. 
The facility is being built after state lawmakers approved a law in 2024 that requires 17-year-olds to be treated as adults, rather than minors, in the criminal justice system. The change Gov. Jeff Landry pushed has created a space crunch in some local jails. 

The state Criminal Justice Priority Commission originally awarded Concordia Parish Sheriff David Hedrick $3 million earlier this year to convert an old community center into a jail for 17-year-olds. The commission upped the project budget to $3.5 million Thursday after Hedrick’s office said project bids came in higher than expected. 
The facility will accommodate 17-year-olds from East Baton Rouge, Lafayette, LaSalle, Livingston, Madison, Tensas, West Carroll, West Feliciana, Winn and possibly other parishes, according to the project application submitted last year. 

State budget officials had not initially recommended the Concordia facility receive funding, but legislators and the governor’s staff inserted it into the list of approved projects earlier this year to address concerns from sheriffs about needing space to house more 17-year-olds.

The decision to treat 17 year-olds as adults conflicts with federal law and has created logistical problems for Louisiana sheriffs at their local jails. The federal government prohibits 17-year-olds from being housed with adults and requires sheriffs to provide the teens with educational resources while they are jailed. 
Sheriffs have complained they don’t have the space or funding for these accommodations. This Concordia facility devoted exclusively to 17-year-olds is supposed to help alleviate that pressure.
Work on the Concordia jail is expected to start Nov. 17 and take about 10 months to complete.
The state is also building a brand new juvenile detention center in Lafourche Parish, expanding a juvenile detention center in Rapides Parish and constructing a new youth prison on the site of the Jetson Center for Youth in East Baton Rouge Parish.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/prison-barbwire-1024x577.jpg,,,2025-10-17 14:03:29.301808

From maintaining funds for free school meals and continued financial support for innovative programs like RxKids, it is easy to find successes in this year’s budget negotiations.
Yet, as the CEO of a provider of services for survivors of violence, I am deeply troubled by this budget’s failure to meet the needs of victims of violence and some of our most vulnerable neighbors. For decades, federal and state funds have been the primary source of funding for victim services across the country, including in Michigan. Funding these services has been part of the government’s commitment to public safety.
Recently, this definition of “public safety” has narrowly shifted to policing and law enforcement, leaving behind the actual victims who depend on emergency shelter, legal support, housing, forensic exams, and other services necessary to escape violence and engage with law enforcement in the first place.
Since 2018, federal funding streams for survivors of violence have decreased dramatically, with another projected decrease in 2026. In addition to this downward trend, the swift policy and funding changes of the new federal administration have decimated funds for victims, particularly survivors of human trafficking.
So we, and many advocates, turned to the state for support. We engaged with many supportive legislators and completed all required steps in alignment with a newly announced “transparent” budget process. We, and many advocates, drafted testimonies. We came prepared with stories to tell and data to highlight client successes, program efficiencies, and even how our programs save state funds. Yet, no committee hearing was held. Few updates were shared. And we, like many others, found that the budget had been decided overnight.
Just hours into Domestic Violence Awareness Month, we saw deep cuts to MDHHS, few state funding supports, and a 2026 allocation for programs, organizations, and Crime Victims Sustaining Grants covering less than half of the total gap in federal funding loss.
This year’s budget failed to backfill increasing federal declines in funding for victim services – to the tune of $45 million – allowing this loss to hit communities statewide. Reductions in victim services mean reductions in survival. The loss means more violent deaths, particularly of children.
As did our federal leaders, now our own state government has turned its back on the Michiganders at greatest risk for homicide. Public safety does not just mean holding perpetrators accountable. It also means stopping homicide before it happens by giving victims and their children a place to flee and organizations to protect them – and these are the services slashed in communities across the state.
After the passing of this state budget, YWCA Kalamazoo is facing deep budget cuts, severely reducing comprehensive and life-saving interventions. We know hundreds of survivors will now go unserved within the next year in our area, just as the lethality of violence rises. Across Michigan, domestic and sexual violence organizations are facing much the same, if not closing their doors entirely.
Budgets are more than how and where a state spends its money. They are a reflection of the guiding principles and priorities for the state and its elected officials. While there are pieces of this budget that respond to the growing needs and concerns of some Michiganders, it is also true that many needs – many people – remained negotiable.
Expendable.
With Michigan’s 2026 budget decided and no end to the federal government turmoil in sight, community members positioned at the margins will continue to carry the burden. Lawmakers must see our neighbors, particularly women and children, as worthy of protection.
Until then, organizations like YWCA Kalamazoo statewide will host more and more vigils for victims whose lives are needlessly, violently, lost. We hope you’ll attend and light candles for the lives written out of the budget.

Steven Jackson, D-Shreveport,  has asked the Louisiana Board of Ethics to dismiss more than $10,700 in fines he faces for failing to properly submit public disclosure and campaign finance forms over the past two years.","Rep. Steven Jackson sponsored a new law that requires the Louisiana Board of Ethics to broadcast its public meetings. (Allison Allsop/Illuminator)State Rep. Steven Jackson, D-Shreveport,  has asked the Louisiana Board of Ethics to dismiss more than $10,700 in fines he faces for failing to properly submit public disclosure and campaign finance forms over the past two years. 

Jackson, who has also held a local elected seat, has a decade-long history of not filing his election and government transparency paperwork on time and appropriately. 

Since he first ran for the Caddo Parish Commission in 2015, Jackson has been fined by the ethics board 22 times, including the seven existing penalties he is asking to be waived, according to the ethics board staff. 
Jackson told the ethics board in an August email he had recently hired an accountant to handle his campaign finance paperwork and his failure to submit the forms properly was not malicious. 

“In most instances, the reports were submitted, though some contained errors. In the limited cases where a report was not filed, it was due to duplication of information rather than any intent to violate the law,” Jackson wrote to state Ethics Administrator David Bordelon. 
The board staff has recommended the board deny Jackson’s appeal of the penalties and require the legislator to pay the fines. 
Campaign finance reports and personal financial disclosure paperwork are the primary way the public knows who donates to a political campaign and what conflict of interest elected officials might have. When those forms aren’t submitted properly, members of the public are denied the ability to learn about a politician’s donors and personal financial interests. 

The bulk of Jackson’s current round of the ethics penalties, around $7,200, comes from missing deadlines or leaving information off of five reports related to the 2023 election, when he first won his state representative seat. 

Jackson also faces a $2,500 penalty for not including all of his income streams on a personal financial disclosure form he was required to fill out in 2023 as a Caddo Parish commissioner and a member of the Louisiana Housing Corporation Board of Directors. He served in both roles before he became a legislator.  
He has also failed to turn in another campaign finance report listing who gave him political donations and how he spent money from his campaign account for the year of 2024. The report was due Feb. 15 of this year, but Jackson has never submitted it, according to the ethics board staff. 

The state representative has often complained the board is too aggressive about enforcing deadlines.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 

He declined to talk to a reporter about his waiver request when reached by telephone this month and instead asked for questions to be sent to an “Elect Steven Jackson” email account. He said questions sent to the email address would be answered by campaign workers, who he refused to identify by name and didn’t sign an emailed statement. 
“Late filings shouldn’t result in excessive fines or aggressive penalties. Rep. Jackson remains committed to fixing a system that punishes paperwork delays more harshly than serious offenses,” reads a statement sent from the email account. 
The state had to resort to extreme measures to collect previous fines from Jackson for forms that weren’t submitted properly during his 2015 and 2018 races for the Caddo Parish Commission.
It filed a short-lived lawsuit on Aug. 15, 2019, to block Jackson from qualifying to run for his second term on the commission over $3,600 in late fees for his 2015 race. State law requires candidates for public office to have paid their penalties in full before they enter a new election cycle. The suit was withdrawn a day later after Jackson hastily met with the board and paid some of the fines he owed. 
Over a separate group of fines, the attorney general’s office garnished more than $1,000 monthly from Jackson’s paychecks for three months in 2022. It covered fines he accrued when he didn’t file paperwork properly during the 2018 election cycle. 
If Jackson doesn’t pay or resolve his latest set of penalties soon, he could face similarly aggressive enforcement methods. Bordelon said in an interview that two of the seven fines Jackson currently owes have already been referred to the attorney general’s office. 
In an email with Bordelon, Jackson argued he should not have to pay at least one of the fines that has already gone to the attorney general, worth $2,500, because of a 2024 law he authored.
Jackson was assessed this particular fine in 2023 because he never filed the required personal financial disclosure form when he ran for state representative. The report, which is due a few days after candidates sign up to run for office, includes information about a candidate’s income, property ownership and business interests for the public to inspect. 
Jackson said that he didn’t think he had to turn it in because he had submitted similar information to the ethics board as a Caddo Parish commissioner a few months earlier. 

The 2024 law Jackson authored, which the Louisiana Legislature approved unanimously, now exempts candidates who are already in elected office, like Jackson, from having to file a second personal financial disclosure form if they have already done so.
But the law isn’t retroactive, and Jackson will still be responsible for the fine unless the board agrees to waive it. 
In previous years, Jackson’s mounting penalties led the state representative to lash out at the ethics staff. Over several email exchanges from 2019-23, Jackson accused the ethics staff of harassing him and treating him unfairly. 
“You all are nothing more than a debt collection agency that harasses and bullies elected officials who don’t have the means to defend themselves,” Jackson wrote as Caddo Parish commissioner in an October 2022 email to former Ethics Administrator Kathleen Allen. 
The board has also struggled to deliver notice of late fees to Jackson via certified mail. Four attempts to get penalty notices to Jackson went unsigned from August of 2024 to March of 2025  alone, according to information provided by the board staff. 

As a result, Bordelon, as the state ethics administrator, decided to personally hand deliver Jackson’s most recent late notices directly to the state representative while Jackson was at the State Capitol on April 23. At the time, Jackson was in Baton Rouge for the state legislative session. 
The ethics board will consider Jackson’s request for fine waivers at its Dec. 5 meeting. The matter was pushed from its October meeting two weeks ago until December in order to accommodate Jackson’s schedule, according to information the board provided.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/LaIllum-01-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-10-17 13:02:51.570385

(Photo by Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)RAPID CITY — A national leader in monetary policy said during a visit to South Dakota that the Federal Reserve was “making good progress” bringing down inflation until “tariffs threw a curveball at us.”
Neel Kashkari, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, addressed dozens of people during a question-and-answer session Thursday at the Hyatt Place in downtown Rapid City. A local economic development group, Elevate Rapid City, hosted the event.
A tariff is a tax on imported goods. Kashkari said the duration and severity of tariff-caused price increases is still unknown.
“The impact of tariffs on the economy is taking longer to be felt than I would have guessed when they were announced,” he said.


That’s partly because some businesses have used their inventories to avoid buying imported goods, which has allowed them to avoid passing the cost of tariffs on to their customers.
“But as that inventory gets worked down, they have to replenish it,” Kashkari said. “They’re telling us, ‘Hey, at the beginning of the year, we might start to see more of a tariff impact on prices.’”
Effects on farmers
Farmers are already feeling the effects of higher tariffs. Responding to a question about China’s retaliatory boycott of U.S. soybean purchases, Kashkari said the situation is changing the global marketplace.
“What’s happening is you’re seeing other countries respond by growing more beans,” he said. “And so more supply is coming online, and that is going to have a permanent effect on the price of soybeans, and it really disrupts our markets.”
He added that “when our whole supply lines are set up to ship to China, it’s not so easy to now turn it around and ship it someplace else.”
Yet he said there’s little the Fed can do for affected farmers: “All we can do is try to keep inflation in check, and it really is a question for our elected leaders and for fiscal policy to try to address.”
Interest rates
Kashkari is a member of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets the target for the influential federal funds interest rate. The Fed has kept the rate higher in recent years while trying to bring inflation down to 2% over the long term.
The Trump administration has publicly pressured the Fed to lower the key interest rate faster. At the same time, the administration has been imposing and threatening higher tariffs on an array of imports from numerous countries.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The measure of annual inflation used by the Fed, the personal consumption expenditures price index, peaked above 7% three years ago and was down to 2.3% this April, but has since risen to 2.7%. Last month, the Fed reduced its key interest rate for the first time this year, lowering its short-term rate from about 4.3% to about 4.1%. Kashkari supported the move and said at the time that two more reductions could be warranted by the end of the year.
On Thursday, he said “I don’t think it’s likely that we’re going to wake up to 4 or 5% inflation,” because the Fed can “do the math” to determine how tariff rates will impact inflation.
“So, I think the risk of inflation is more one of persistence, that it’s not so much of a one-time event, but it stays at 3% for an extended period of time,” Kashkari said.
Other topics
Kashkari spoke about numerous other topics raised by audience members Thursday, including the following.
Politics: Regarding pressure from the Trump administration, Kashkari said that “the best thing we can do when we face political uncertainty is to do our jobs to the best of our ability, leaving politics at the door. And the more we do that and the more we are seen and acknowledged to be doing that, the more credibility I believe we will have with the American people.”
Artificial intelligence: Kashkari said he’s “long-term bullish” on the technology’s potential but “short-term skeptical” about predictions it will cause mass layoffs, because most major new technologies take decades to “get woven into the fabric of society.”
Immigration: The two sources of economic growth are productivity and population growth, Kashkari said, and without the latter, “you’re going to have slower growth unless you decide to embrace immigration. And that’s just math.”
Housing affordability: Home prices will go up if interest rates are cut without more homes being built, Kashkari said, so “localities need to look at what can you do locally to try to remove some of the barriers that are preventing more supply from coming in.”
Consumer outlook: “Consumers keep getting asked questions: ‘How are you feeling about the economy?’” Kashkari said. “And for the last three years, consumers have said, ‘The economy stinks. I’m gloomy as heck.’ And then they go spend thousands of dollars on Taylor Swift tickets, and they get on planes, and they go out to restaurants, and people are spending money like crazy. And so there’s a disconnect between how people are feeling and what they are actually doing.”",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_3072-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-17 13:02:51.570385

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — While the U.S. Department of Education proposes mass layoffs in its special education office, an Oklahoma lawmaker said he intends to bolster state-level support for students with disabilities. 
Sen. Adam Pugh, R-Edmond, said he plans to file legislation to give families of special education students an outlet at the state level to seek recourse when their children aren’t receiving the proper services guaranteed to them by law.
Although funding for special education is secure, the federal employees whose jobs could be eliminated are responsible for holding states accountable to upholding the rights of students with disabilities.
“I was hearing from a lot of parents with children with special needs,” said Pugh, who leads two committees on K-12 schools. “I felt like there was a need for us to act on their behalf because what you don’t want is a parent in a situation where they don’t feel like the system is working for them and there’s no recourse when that occurs.”
A key part of his legislation would be to ensure families don’t have to hire an attorney when pursuing complaints through the state, Pugh said. He also aims to set clear timelines to address each case, so parents aren’t dragged into a lengthy “bureaucratic nightmare,” he said.
“I think there’s the assurance from the state to parents that, ‘Hey, we’re not going to let your child’s rights be violated here and then force you to foot the bill to fight that through the legal system,’” Pugh said.
The deadline for lawmakers to file bills before the 2026 legislative session is Jan. 15. 
Lawmakers convene their legislative session Feb. 2. Meanwhile, Pugh also is running as a Republican candidate in the 2026 election for state superintendent.
Last month, the U.S. Department of Education distributed $181 million to Oklahoma for special education through the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). That amount covers 14% to 15% of the cost to educate children with disabilities in Oklahoma public schools, Pugh said.

Amid an ongoing government shutdown, the Trump administration attempted sweeping layoffs at multiple federal agencies, including cutting 466 jobs at the U.S. Department of Education. That reduction in force would eliminate almost the entire Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services.
A California federal judge on Wednesday temporarily blocked the layoffs from moving forward. 
The Oklahoma State Department of Education assured families that federal cuts wouldn’t mean oversight of special education programs would disappear. 
The state agency also monitors these services to make sure local school districts comply with IDEA and state standards, Deputy Superintendent Romel Muex-Pullen wrote in a statewide letter this week.
The state Education Department also offers assistance with dispute resolution, she wrote.
“Despite changes at the federal level, our mission, responsibility, and dedication remain unchanged,” Muex-Pullen wrote. “Oklahoma will continue to ensure that all students with disabilities receive the educational services, protections, and opportunities guaranteed under IDEA.”
One of the primary functions of the U.S. Department of Education is investigating and remediating violations of federal laws like IDEA, often threatening the withholding of federal funds to do so.
During an Aug. 19 visit to Oklahoma, U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon said the federal government still would defend students’ civil rights, though she continues to advocate for closing the U.S. Department of Education and limiting federal influence in public schooling.

“If you were a school that receives federal funding and you are not abiding by the law, then clearly we have the authority and we will take that action,” she told Oklahoma Voice during a bill signing ceremony at the state Capitol.
Despite the government shutdown, students are still going to school, teachers are still being paid and schools are still operating as normal, McMahon wrote in a social media post Wednesday. She said that’s evidence the federal Department of Education is “unnecessary.”

Seasonal migration raises concerns for continued infections of a virulent strain of bird flu. (Danielle Prokop / Source NM)As hundreds of millions of birds flock south during seasonal autumn migration, so too does a particularly virulent strain of bird flu. New Mexico state officials said they’re keeping an eye on wild bird and mammal deaths as the season progresses, but noted that some tracking efforts have been hampered by the ongoing federal shutdown.
The H5N1 strain of avian influenza has killed millions of birds and mammals worldwide. And while the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say the current risk to human health is low, experts contend the virus’ propensity to spread from birds to other animals and mutate further raises the prospect for a new pandemic. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture Sept. 30 plan for the shutdown requires the agency to track avian influenza, calling it “essential to protecting public health and safety.” According to an Oct. 14 spreadsheet tracking, dozens of H5N1 cases were documented in the past two weeks across seven states, including wild waterfowl in New Hampshire, Wisconsin and Washington and vultures in Indiana, Kentucky, Utah, West Virginia.
USDA last confirmed a wild bird avian influenza case in New Mexico in March 2025, from a great horned owl in Chaves County. The USDA reported 339 domestic bird H5N1 deaths this year in February through April from flocks in Roosevelt, Curry, Valencia and Bernalillo counties.
Elin Crockett, a wildlife veterinarian for the New Mexico Department of Game and Fish, said in a statement provided to Source NM that state officials are collecting samples during investigations of wild bird deaths.
“Our current focus is on monitoring for unusual mortality events, particularly among waterfowl, raptors and scavengers, as fall migration progresses,” Crockett said.
Crockett said interruptions to work at the federal National Wildlife Health Center, Fish and Wildlife Service and the U.S. Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services during the shutdown have impacted tracking birds in the field and diagnostic tests for the virus.
“Many routine surveillance and response activities are currently limited. Active surveillance on healthy migrating waterfowl that is normally coordinated through federal partners has been paused,” Crockett said.
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Sept. 30 plan for the shutdown states the agency will limit the number of staff in laboratories, hatcheries and other facilities, reduce field work or suspend work altogether.
Experts’ concerns extend beyond wild birds or backyard flocks. In 2024, the flu spread to dairy cattle in New Mexico and other states. Sick dairy cows and increased cases in poultry farms facilitated 70 human cases and one death across the U.S., though none reported in New Mexico.
The outbreak in cows has slowed, but ultimately impacted more than 1,000 herds in 18 states. Cases were confirmed in Idaho this month.
New Mexico hasn’t reported a livestock case since May, Samantha Holeck, the state veterinarian with the New Mexico Livestock Board, told Source NM, but officials remain on the lookout.
“I don’t think we’re gonna know about the impact on dairy populations until we get through this migratory season and can see what happens,” Holeck said.
Since 2023, more than 90 New Mexico mammals have contracted the virus, mostly mice collected from infected dairies last year. In 2025, cases included three skunks, all in March, two  in Curry County and one in Valencia County; and one domestic cat in February, in Curry County.
Holeck cautioned that anyone with pet cats or other animals should minimize water sharing outdoors and prevent sickness from exposure to infected birds or carcasses.
“An exposure to that virus is potentially a fatal exposure,” Holeck said. “We want to make sure that people keep close tabs on their animals and maintain a barrier or a safe distance from wild animals.”

Stephen Bryant, 44, is slated to be the fifth person in the state put to death this year and the seventh total since executions resumed last September following an unintended 13-year hiatus.

Bryant pleaded guilty in 2008 to a number of crimes, including three Sumter County murders, four years prior.
He was sentenced to death for the third murder.
“Victim number four in two weeks, catch me if you can,” he wrote on the wall for police to find, with some of the letters in blood, according to court filings.
Unless a court steps in or the governor grants him clemency, which Gov. Henry McMaster has not done for any other inmate, Bryant will die by his choice of lethal injection, firing squad or electrocution.
The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday turned down his final pending appeal, claiming his mother’s alcohol use while pregnant made him incompetent for execution.
Bryant’s attorneys made a last-ditch attempt to halt his coming death warrant, claiming the shutdown of the U.S. government requires his federal public defenders to work without pay, hindering their ability to file any necessary appeals on his behalf. The state Supreme Court unanimously denied his request in a two-sentence order Friday.
Bryant’s crime spree began with a burglary Oct. 5, according to court records. He committed a second burglary three days later, then shot a fisherman, Clinton Brown, in the back in Richland County. Brown survived the shooting.
On Oct. 9, Bryant picked up his coworker, Cliff Gainey, at his home and took him to a convenience store, then out on a drive. Bryant shot Gainey three times, then left his body on the side of the road and returned to Gainey’s home, which he robbed.
Two days later, Bryant killed 62-year-old Willard Tietjen in his Sumter home. After shooting Tietjen nine times, Bryant ransacked his house looking for items to steal, then smoked cigarettes and a cigar and used Tietjen’s computer.
Bryant answered calls to Tietjen’s phone from his wife and daughter by telling them he had killed Tietjen.
When police arrived at the scene, after Bryant had left, they found cigarette burns on Tietjen’s eyes and several notes left behind, including the bloody message on the wall.
Two days after that, Bryant greeted 35-year-old Chris Burgess at a convenience store. Burgess put his motorcycle in the back of Bryant’s truck and drove off with him, the clerk later recounted. Similar to how he killed Gaines, Bryant shot Burgess twice and left his body on the side of the road, according to court records.
SC death row inmate who killed 3 reaches end of appeals, can receive death warrant

Police caught Bryant, who witnesses had identified, that same day. Bryant confessed to the crimes, according to court filings.
While in jail the following year, Bryant attacked a detention officer, punching him multiple times and continuing to beat him after he collapsed, according to court records. Bryant pleaded guilty to that attack along with the other crimes in 2008.
Bryant received a death sentence for killing Tietjen and life sentences for the other two slayings, plus 100 years combined for his other crimes, according to court records.
Bryant’s defense attorneys said he was high on methamphetamine when he killed Tietjen and that a history of drug abuse to cope with childhood sexual abuse.
In an appeal, his attorneys claimed prosecutors failed to mention that Bryant’s aunt had sexually abused him as a child during the sentencing phase of the trial, which might have affected the judge’s decision to give him the death penalty.
Courts rejected that appeal, alongside all others Bryant has filed.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_0542-1024x681.jpeg,,,2025-10-17 13:02:51.570385

He was also endorsed by the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, and the Michigan Democratic Party’s LGBT&A Caucus, Progressive Caucus and Grassroots Caucus.

 
Announcements

Republican gubernatorial candidate Tom Leonard, a former speaker of the Michigan House of Representatives, on Wednesday announced that Nikki Snyder, one of only two GOP members on the Michigan State Board of Education, will serve as chair of his Leonard for Michigan Education Coalition, which would advise the campaign on education priorities.
Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Dr. Abdul El-Sayed‘s campaign announced it was launching a statewide “Open Our Healthcare” tour, starting in Houghton in the Upper Peninsula, on Oct. 22, with later stops in Pontiac, Detroit and Downriver. The events will “convene providers, patients, and community advocates”.

 
Fundraising

State Senator Sean McCann (D-Kalamazoo) announced Tuesday that his campaign has raised more than $300,000 in the first full quarter of his campaign to win the Democratic nomination for Michigan’s 4th Congressional District, currently occupied by Republican U.S. Rep. Bill Huizenga of Holland Township.
Speaking of which, Huizenga reported having raised just $325,000 in the third quarter, nearly half of which were $158,000 in transfers from House Speaker Mike Johnson’s “Grow the Majority”  joint fundraising committee. However, he ended the quarter with $1.6 million in cash on hand.
Also seeking to replace Huizenga is Kalamazoo attorney Jessica Swartz. The Democrat raised $92,000 in the third quarter with approximately $171,000 in the bank.

 

7th Congressional District candidate Bridget Brink announced Thursday that her campaign for the Democratic nomination had raised $611,179 in the third quarter, leaving her with more than $738,000 cash on hand, “nearly double any other Democratic candidate.”
Meanwhile, her main opponent for the nomination, Matt Maasdam, said on Thursday he had raised more than $615,000 in the third quarter, making him “the top-raising Democratic challenger in Michigan this quarter.”

 

Don Ufford, a former Ford Motor Co. engineer, announced Thursday that his campaign for the Democratic nomination to Michigan’s 11th Congressional District seat had raised “more than $350,000 in just 34 days during the 3rd Quarter, more than any other candidate in the race.”
Meanwhile, state Sen. Jeremy Moss (D-Bloomfield Township), who is also seeking the 11th District Democratic nomination, raised approximately $205,000 for the quarter, ending with almost $472,000 in cash on hand.
The third Democrat seeking that nomination is Sterling Heights attorney Aisha Farooqi, who raised $114,351 and finished with just over $72,000 in cash on hand.

 

The campaign of U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham) seeking the Democratic nomination to run in 2026 for Michigan’s U.S. Senate seat noted on Thursday that the $1.9 million it previously reported she raised in the third quarter allowed it to end the period with $2.6 million in the bank, “far outpacing her opponents.”
One of those opponents, Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Dr. Abdul El-Sayed, announced on Monday his campaign had raised $1.77 million in the third quarter of 2025, and ended the third quarter with more than $1.8 million cash on hand.
The other Dem U.S. Senate candidate, state Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak), previously reported raising more than $1.65 million in the third quarter, with records showing she had just under $1.5 million in cash on hand.
On the GOP side, former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers (R-White Lake) reported having in excess of $2.7 million in cash on hand in his campaign for the Republican nomination. But as The Detroit News reported, only $1.6 million of that total was raised in the third quarter, while the $2.2 million reported being raised in that span “reflects two transfers on Sept. 19 from his joint-fundraising entity, Team Rogers, of about $626,587 that was raised in the second quarter” as well as “$62,000 from the National Republican Senatorial Committee”.

 



Also of note
Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald, who is running as a Democrat for Michigan Attorney General, on Tuesday called on fellow AG candidates to “uphold the law faithfully and not weaponize it for political gain.”
The challenge came after President Trump‘s Department of Justice filed charges against former FBI Director James Comey following pressure from the White House to prosecute the president’s political rivals, and after Trump, in a social media post, called for both the Mayor of Chicago and Governor of Illinois to be jailed.
McDonald is among four Democrats seeking the AG nomination of their party. The others are: Washtenaw County Prosecutor Eli Savit, former U.S. Attorney Mark Totten, and public defender William Noakes. On the GOP side, there are two announced candidates; Eaton County Prosecutor Doug Lloyd and attorney Kevin Kijewski.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Advance-at-a-glance-political-roundup-v2-1024x662.png,,,2025-10-17 12:04:48.625493

What’s happening in your town?,Sasha Allen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/17/violent-crime-is-down-across-ct-whats-happening-in-your-town/,"Murders in the state declined nearly 35%, and cases of criminal sexual contact declined nearly 18% from 2023 to 2024.","Serious violent crimes in Connecticut, including murder, manslaughter, assault and rape, dropped from 2023 to 2024 and are at their lowest level since at least 2021, according to the latest data from the state Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection.
Murders in the state declined nearly 35%, and cases of criminal sexual contact declined nearly 18% from 2023 to 2024, according to an Oct. 7 press release from the CT Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection, based on data collected by the National Incident-Based Reporting System.
“This police data confirms that public safety trends are continuing to move in the right direction, that Connecticut remains one of the safest states in the country, and that we should keep implementing policies that will reduce the rates of crime even further,’’ said Gov. Ned Lamont in the press release.
This trend continued into the first two quarters of 2025, and when comparing the number of crimes classified as “crimes against persons” this year to the first two quarters of 2024, there was an overall drop in cases.
There was even more of a decline in incidents of theft, robberies and burglaries, shoplifting and larceny, vandalism and all other incidents classified under the National Incident-Based Reporting System as “crimes against property.” Compared to the first two quarters of 2024, there were 19.1% fewer incidents of property crimes, with drops in nearly every category.
This decline follows a spike in property crimes in 2023, where property crimes hit the highest rates seen from 2021 to 2025.
However, from 2024 to 2025, crimes against society, which include drug and weapons violations, increased. This was largely due to an overall increase in drug violations. Weapons violations and pornography and obscene material violations both dropped.
“Group B offenses” include less serious crimes that lead to arrests, including disorderly conduct, trespassing and driving under the influence. These offenses rose 4.3% from 2024 to 2025, with increases in arrests for trespassing incidents and disorderly conduct.
Across the nation, as in Connecticut, violent and property crimes were on the decline in 2024 compared to 2023. According to the Councils of State Governments Justice Center, there was a decrease in violent crime rates in 39 states and D.C. from 2019 to 2024.
While the majority of Connecticut towns saw major drops in crime rates from 2023 to 2024, a few towns saw increases.
Col. Daniel Loughman of the Connecticut State Police attributed the fall in violent crimes to the work of police.
“Our troopers are on the front lines every day, and the progress in these reports belongs to them,’’ Loughman said. “Their hard work and dedication, combined with collaboration with our municipal and federal partners, is what keeps Connecticut moving in the right direction.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/JwkiN-how-did-the-crime-rate-change-in-each-ct-town-2023-to-2024--1024x872.png,,,2025-10-17 12:04:48.625493

(Photo courtesy of Sanford Health)SIOUX FALLS — The key to improving rural health care in the Dakotas is more than telehealth, according to health and innovation experts.
It’ll require providing rural residents with tools to monitor their own health, and nearby hubs or health care access to conduct basic tests ahead of telehealth visits with specialists.
“How do we have both the tools and the training to tell you how to use them so that the care can start even before the ambulance gets there?” said Nworah Ayogu, a physician and investor in health care technology. 
Ayogu, who is also a member of the Sanford Health Plan board, was one panelist to speak about efforts to improve rural access to affordable and quality health care at the fourth annual Summit on the Future of Rural Health Care hosted by Sanford Health in Sioux Falls on Tuesday. 
Investments in tech aim to relieve some challenges, panelists say
Ateev Mehrotra, a physician and professor at Brown University School of Public Health, urged caution in the health care industry’s rush to invest in artificial intelligence.
As a panelist alongside Ayogu, Mehrotra added that the investment shouldn’t be made to the detriment of patient care and that health systems should ensure there is evidence supporting the technology is a good investment of their money.
Mehrotra highlighted the gap in telehealth use nationwide for rural and urban patients. Even though telehealth was created in large part to address rural needs, he said, urban patients tend to use the technology more consistently. Rural patients nationwide will also sometimes bypass their local, smaller hospitals to get care from larger hospital systems hundreds of miles away.
“It’s not the technology; the technology can fix this problem. It’s rather how we’re deploying it right now in the United States,” Mehrotra said. “And so that’s really what I’m focused on, which is how do we change the way that we’re using telehealth in the United States so that we can finally address that big gap.”

The gap could also be due to a lack of adequate technology access, Mehrotra said.
Most patients Dave Newman sees have access to broadband, said the Fargo, North Dakota-based endocrinologist and chief medical officer of virtual care at Sanford. But he has had telehealth visits with farmers on their phones during harvest season or with a patient still with a rotary phone.
Telehealth does not require complex technology, but simply meeting the patients where they’re at, Newman said. The virtual care center has more than 75 specialties now, he added.
Health systems like Sanford are working to improve virtual care, including training providers on “webside manners” and establishing a network of clinics and access points close to rural residents, Newman said. 
“We consider ourselves a hub and we support multiple different spokes,” Newman said. “What the spokes are is dependent on what patients need.”
As an example, he said a clinic in Williston, North Dakota, with a nurse, lab and imaging facilities can run tests a patient needs before a telehealth visit with a subspecialist in Fargo or Sioux Falls “without having to travel the huge distance.”
Avera Health, another major health system in South Dakota, was awarded a three-year federal grant to invest in its virtual nursing program, which connects virtual nurses to patients in hospital rooms. The program also uses AI to monitor patient falls in hospitals, which Avera Virtual Health Director Kristine Becker told South Dakota Searchlight after the award announcement will “shape the way” hospital systems deliver care.
Further investment in remote patient monitoring, equipment at home and other technology can improve rural care even further, participants at the conference said.
Although AI could potentially increase efficiencies, nurses and clinicians are still needed to care for South Dakota’s growing and aging population, panelists said. 
$50 billion for rural health
State governments can further help address rural health needs by bringing partners together, Ayogu and Newman said, and ensuring medical students and doctors receive training pertinent to practicing in a “new world.”
Mehrotra added that the state could facilitate e-consults across the state and across health care systems to improve care, and it could provide licensure reciprocity with nearby states so South Dakotans could receive virtual care from out-of-state providers rather than traveling hundreds of miles to Minneapolis or other larger health care systems.
Adequately reimbursing telehealth services for patients on Medicare or Medicaid, which brings together state and federal players, was top of mind for Newman and other panelists.
“We know it’s effective, and there have been temporary fixes,” Newman said. “We have had kind of a Band-Aid instead of an actual fix to the problem. The funding bills now have a longer fix, but nothing has been done to reassure the health care systems or the providers that are doing this care that they will continue to see reimbursement.”
Republican South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden highlighted the state’s efforts in recent years at the conference, including a “game changer” telemedicine program meant to bolster rural ambulance services. The program was launched with pandemic relief funds during former Gov. Kristi Noem’s administration.

He added that the $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program will be a new opportunity, with over $500 million of those funds expected to reach South Dakotans in the next five years. The fund was created to offset the impact of Medicaid changes on rural hospitals created by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed by President Donald Trump in July.
“I think that there’s going to be a sizable investment in rural health care in South Dakota,” Rhoden said.
American Hospital Association President and CEO Rick Pollack called the $50 billion five-year investment “modest” compared to the $1 trillion in funding hospitals nationwide are expected to lose in the next decade.
“They’re going to look for transformation in terms of different approaches,” Pollack said during a panel discussion, “whether it’s expanding access to behavioral health services, whether it’s telehealth, whether it’s using different technologies in terms of virtual care, whether it’s how you can retain and grow a workforce in rural areas.”

Connecticut has the highest percentage of residents with Italian ancestry in the United States, with about 15% of its population, or roughly 562,000 people, identifying as Italian American, according to 2023 data from World Population Review. Rhode Island follows closely with 14.6%, and New Jersey ranks third at 13%.
New York had the highest total population of Italian Americans at 2.2 million, which make up 11% of the state’s population. Connecticut ranks 10th in total population.
Italian immigration to Connecticut surged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as thousands arrived from southern Italy and Sicily seeking industrial jobs. They settled in cities like New Haven, Waterbury, Bridgeport, Hartford and New Britain, working in factories, on railroads and in construction. Over generations, Italian Americans helped shape the state’s economy, neighborhoods and culture.
Each October, the state celebrates that lasting legacy during Italian American Heritage and Culture Month.

To read more about the project, click here.

I didn’t leave.
That simple phrase carries more weight than most people realize. As a millennial born and raised in Mississippi, I’ve heard all the reasons to go, and I’ve watched many of my peers follow through.
But I stayed. Not because it was easy, but because I believe in the soil here. Mississippi is not just where I’m from. It’s where I’m building something that reflects the best of who we are and what we can become.
I’m Dyamone L. White, a daughter of western Hinds County – Edwards to be exact. I am a banker and housing strategist by training and a community developer at heart. But in this season of my life, I’m something more: a hospitality entrepreneur, a creative economy advocate and the founder of The High Horse: Bite & Beverage Barn of Bolton – a modern-day juke joint and cultural venue rooted in Mississippi pride.  
The High Horse isn’t just a bar or music spot. It’s a bet – a bet that Mississippi’s culture, stories and soul are not only worth preserving but worth investing in. It’s my answer to the question: What if we stopped exporting our best and brightest, and instead created the kind of spaces that made them want to stay?

The idea came to life during a drive through Louisiana when I stumbled upon the concept of beer barns — informal, deeply local gathering spots that once populated the rural South. Curious, I dug deeper and discovered these spaces weren’t just a Louisiana thing. Mississippi had them too. Changing times wiped them out.
Around that same time, I visited Ground Zero Blues Club in Clarksdale. I saw how music, memory and place could intersect to create something magnetic. The vision started to form.
At first, I called the project Beer Run: The Beer Barn of Bolton. But as the idea matured, I partnered with Crema, a marketing and branding agency in Ridgeland.
After hearing my story, they quickly landed on a name that captured the spirit of what I was building: The High Horse. It is not just a brand, but a statement that we, as a people, deserve to feel elevated.
But as I brought the project to life, I saw more clearly than ever how poverty, displacement and disinvestment continue to choke not only our neighborhoods, but our hope. That’s when it clicked. Mississippi’s economic revival must be tied to its cultural revival.
And I still believe Mississippi already has everything it needs. It just takes someone bold enough to light the fire.
The High Horse is that fire. It’s a place where the blues isn’t background noise – it’s the heartbeat. It is where Black Southern foodways, music, storytelling and style converge under one roof. It is where tradition and progress don’t compete; they dance together.
On any given weekend, The High Horse transforms into something bigger than its square footage, hosting everything from blues jams and cultural parades to health fairs and voter registration drives. But the vision stretches beyond events or entertainment. It’s a blueprint that merges culture and commerce, storytelling and strategy, tourism and talent retention.
That’s why the recent Mississippi Today essay by Danielle Morgan of the Mississippi Tourism Association about the importance of tourism in the state moved me so deeply. It gave language to something I’ve lived: the tension of loving this place while working every day to transform it. Her writing made me feel seen. In return, I want this essay to make others feel possible.
We hear so much about those who left. I want to speak to, and for, the ones who stayed. The ones who are building something from scratch. The ones who see potential in the overlooked. The ones who know that investing in Mississippi isn’t foolish. It’s forward-thinking.
This journey hasn’t been easy. I’ve had to teach myself tax law, sift through local ordinances and figure out marketing and operations in real time. But every time someone walks through the doors and says, “This feels like home,” it reaffirms why I do it.
And I’m not alone. All across Mississippi, people like me are quietly – and boldly – building. We deserve a seat at the table in the tourism conversation. We are creating the next Mississippi.
So, no, I didn’t leave. I chose to stay. And every song sung, every meal served, every story shared at The High Horse is a love letter to the place I’m still betting on.

Detroit’s mayoral candidates may be far apart about how they should solve many of the city’s challenges, but their views on improving education in the city sound similar.
Rev. Solomon Kinloch, Jr., the pastor at Triumph Church in Detroit, and Mary Sheffield, the president of the Detroit City Council, faced off Wednesday night during a televised debate on WXYZ-TV. Moderators asked one question about education, but related topics such as child poverty, transportation, and safety also came up.
Education has been an issue throughout the campaign because of the depth of Detroit’s school challenges. Low academic achievement and high rates of chronic absenteeism are big problems in district and charter schools. While the mayor doesn’t have control over how schools are operated, the person elected can play a role in addressing many of the barriers that make it difficult for children to learn, including housing instability, a lack of transportation, and extreme poverty.
Here’s what they had to say at Wednesday night’s debate.
 How will the candidates help improve education in Detroit?

Moderator Carolyn Clifford noted the city’s high rate of illiteracy and the most recent results for the Detroit Public Schools Community District on the National Assessment of Educational Progress, in which just 5% of district students were proficient or above in reading. Noting that the mayor has no control over district and charter schools in the city, she asked the candidates, “What can a mayor do to help ensure Detroit kids can read, can learn, and succeed?
Kinloch repeated what he’s said throughout the campaign: that he would “be an educational mayor” and would create a cabinet-level position that would partner with the school district. Though the city has dozens of charter schools, Kinloch only mentioned partnering with the district. Kinloch said that while “the school district is not the mayor’s job, it’s still the mayor’s responsibility.”
“What we will do is partner with the district to make sure that we’re removing the social ills that keep the children from showing up in class in a productive way, not to just to survive, but to thrive. There are a whole lot of things that take place before those children get to class. And so we got to make sure that they have access to mental health professionals, that they have access to affordable housing, that they have access to food and grocery stores and healthy eating, that they have access to extra curriculum activities to keep them off the street and give them a sanctuary to be safe.”
Sheffield said she believes the mayor “can be a greater partner to drive better outcomes for our youth” and that every child deserves access to a quality education.
“My administration will have a liaison working directly with our DPSCD and charter schools on a consistent basis. We will ensure that we have robust after school programming within a two mile radius of every school, focusing in on literacy. We will provide the wraparound service and address the social deterrents that prevent and impact our families and our students, like mental health and housing and having support in the schools and on the grounds to support our families and students. And lastly, as a mayor, I can ensure that we have safe routes to school and fixing the infrastructure around our schools and providing more coordinated transportation to reduce absenteeism and get our students back in school.”
 Setting students up for post-high school success

At various points during the debate, Sheffield and Kinloch talked about ensuring that children are set up for success once they leave high school.
Sheffield noted that the Detroit Promise, a scholarship program that gives eligible Detroit residents a tuition-free path to an associate degree, bachelor’s degree, or technical certificate, already provides opportunities for Detroit youth.
“We want to enhance that program and ensure that we’re creating pathways so that everyone who wants to receive secondary education has a pathway to do so,” Sheffield said.
Kinloch made a similar statement.
“I’ll make sure that every child has access to a quality education, giving them a pathway to college and giving them a pathway to a career,” Kinloch said.
 Crime may be down, but safety is still an issue

Chalkbeat heard from a number of students earlier this year who said they often feel unsafe in the city, avoid being out in large groups because they fear what could happen, and worry about violence as they travel to and from school. That’s despite crime being down in the city.
At Wednesday night’s debate, candidates were asked how they explain the disconnect between the statistics and what people say in their neighborhoods and what they would do if elected mayor to solve this problem.
Kinloch noted that as a pastor, he has had to “give children dignity in death that they didn’t get in life because their life was taken too soon.”
He said one of the reasons there is a disconnect is “because Detroiters deserve two things. They deserve safety and they deserve justice.” He also suggested that the city is “fudging” crime statistics. BridgeDetroit and the Detroit Free Press reported that after the debate, Kinloch explained his comments, saying there should be additional oversight into how crimes are tracked.
Sheffield noted the reduction in crime stats, but also said “one life lost is still far too many.”
“I believe in a comprehensive and holistic approach to public safety that is rooted in strong partnerships with our law enforcement agencies in our community. I will ensure as mayor that we are investing in prevention, more year round, youth employment for our young people, ensure that we’re expanding our community violence intervention work.”
Her plan also includes launching the city’s first ever office of gun violence prevention and expanding community policing efforts.
 Improving public transportation is important

The candidates were asked to explain how they would improve public transit in the city. While the question wasn’t specific to education or students, the city’s transportation woes affect school attendance. Many students take city buses to and from school, and Chalkbeat has heard from students who say the buses frequently arrive late, making them late for school, or don’t show up at all.
Transportation barriers are one of the reasons the DPSCD chronic absenteeism rate is high. The rate is improving, but 60% of students were chronically absent in the 2024-25 school year. At least one DPSCD school is experimenting with distributing bikes to students to make it easier for their children to get to school.
Sheffield said the most pressing issue is addressing public transportation wait times.
“We have to ensure that no one is waiting 30, 40, 50 minutes to catch a bus. And so as mayor, my number one priority is to reduce wait times, increase frequency and reliability of our system, make sure that our drivers are paid the wages that they deserve, and make sure that the system is safe.”
Kinloch said the city needs to ensure it is offering competitive pay to transit workers, has reliable vehicles, and has trained mechanics.
“I remember growing up in the city of Detroit, and the only way I can get from point A to point B is I had to depend on public transportation,” said Kinloch, who said improving the transit system is a necessity. “A lot of our school children are dependent on public transportation. Our family, our community is dependent on public transportation.”

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)It really doesn’t matter if you’re lost in a MAGA fog trying to be a warrior for a deluded president, when Montana’s senators are on national news, they represent all Montanans to the world.  And this week, Montana’s freshman senator, Tim Sheehy, embarrassed all Montanans with his rude, evasive, and uninformed interview with CNN’s Kaitlin Collins, one of the most professional and respected reporters in the world.
It’s hard to figure out just what Sheehy was doing when given an opportunity to discuss the effects of the fiscal impacts of the Trump administration’s budget cuts.  What he did instead was pull a bully act and repeatedly interrupt, talk over, and ignore Collins’ questions.
The zinger happened when Collin, who had done her homework, reminded Sheehy that a billion dollar Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub project that included Montana had been cancelled by Trump’s Energy Department — and did not exist in the GOP’s short-term funding bill sitting in the Senate.
Apparently Sheehy, for all his bluster and macho man attempts at dominating Collins, did not do his homework — and had no idea the project’s funding had been cancelled.  Instead, he sat in stunned silence for several seconds, then once again ignored the facts to falsely claim that’s why the government shutdown should end.  You can see the interview Collins posted on X here. 
Fact is, Sheehy’s lack of policy experience — and apparent lack of knowledge on what’s going on with the impacts of the administration’s budgets on Montana and Montanans — was on full display for the nation and world.  Although his job is to understand where, how, and why the federal government spends or doesn’t spend money Congress has appropriated, Sheehy was too busy playing-acting as an important senator to actually do the job of being a senator.
Adding to Sheehy’s obvious ignorance of the issue, Collins pointed out that Montana’s Gov. Greg Gianforte had previously praised the hydrogen hub project as providing “good-paying Montana jobs.”
While it’s bad enough Sheehy didn’t know what he was talking about, the image he presented of how Montanans treat other people was downright disgusting.  Maybe it’s because he’s not lived in Montana for very long and doesn’t appear to understand that mutual respect is not only cherished in this state, but essential in the political and policy arena.  He also appears not to know that Montanans have a national and international reputation for being considerate and helpful to those who visit our state — we’re not a bunch of MAGA’s mad dogs.
Nor would Sheehy address the fact that the GOP’s funding bill leaves 67,000 Montanans on the hook for vast increases in the cost of health insurance — from $145 per month with the tax credits to a whopping $645 without.  While those very real impacts are the reason the bill is not moving in the Senate, all he wanted to do was bash Democrats for the shutdown, despite the fact they are in the minority in both chambers of Congress.
Ironically, while Montana’s very junior senator was busy ignoring the impacts to his constituents, Washington’s Sen. Patty Murray did address that enormous impact in a video forum with the head of the Montana Nurses Association and state Sen. Cora Neuman.  Succinctly, Murray noted that Republican senators are “dodging the issue.” Indeed, Sheehy’s embarrassing performance completely validates that point.
Apparently being a U.S. senator has gone to Sheehy’s young and inexperienced head.  But he’d best remember he’s representing Montanans on the national and world stage — and that we treat others with respect and expect the same from our senators.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sheehysept192025-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-17 12:04:48.625493

When no one in your family has gone to college, applying to a higher education institution and choosing a career can feel confusing and intimidating. 
Some students also struggle with additional barriers, like those that come from low-income families and might not know how they’ll pay for going to college or university. In Hartford, for example, 76% of students are from low-income families, according to data from the School and State Finance Project.
But many places, including Hartford, have mentors, programs and organizations dedicated to helping high school students navigate the path toward becoming first-generation college students.
Here are some of the resources students can talk to their school guidance counselors about or reach out to directly for more information.
Are there resources targeted to first-generation students?
Some national resources exist for first-generation students across the U.S. These include:

Rise First has an online platform with a curated resource center for first generation students. It has a specific directory for Connecticut first gen students.


First Gen Forward is home to the “first academic peer-reviewed journal dedicated to first-generation student success.” You can read free articles about the latest issues.

Other national resources include The Dream.US, which is targeted at DREAMers, but offers some scholarships specifically geared toward helping first-generation DREAMers. The Dream.US offers scholarship opportunities based on the state you live in, a guide to apply to them and a list of partner colleges.
What about resources closer to home?
Hartford has a strong network of organizations that support high school students in every step, from financial college access to career mentorship to parental guides and more.
Hartford Promise is a college scholarship and mentoring program for Hartford Public School students. There are a couple of requirements, such as maintaining a certain GPA and school attendance, to become a Promise Scholar and be eligible for scholarships. Every new Hartford Promise Scholar is now eligible for up to $100,000 over four years toward any accredited four-year college. Hartford Promise also has a list of colleges that provide a scholarship match to Promise Scholars who are admitted to their school.
Hartford Public School’s College and Career Readiness Programs offer a range of resources, including a list of school counselors, essay writing tips, financial aid resources and more.
For Hartford youth starting their college preparedness plans before middle school, Hartford Youth Scholars offers support from middle school through the college years for youth. To apply, the student first needs to be nominated by a teacher, mentor, parent/guardian or through self-nomination.
The Legacy Foundation of Hartford provides an academic enhancement program for students and families who enroll in their Legacy Saturday Academy. It offers academic support and college coaching to the admitted scholars at University of Hartford campus. There is no GPA requirement nor cost to enroll.
ECMC, which has an office in Hartford, works to lower student loan default rates, sponsor college access and success initiatives, and financial literacy programs. You can set Zoom and phone appointments to discuss any college or financial aid-related questions or concerns, including FAFSA assistance. Students can register to receive personalized emails and texts. 
ReadyCT designs and delivers work-based learning experiences in line with career opportunities across the state like work-site tours, resume reviews and paid internships. Hartford students can apply to Student 5.0, a free mentorship career launch program for high school graduates.
There are also resources available for parents as well. Hartford Parent University offers learning sessions where parents can learn how to support their child’s college readiness.
And the state of Connecticut’s higher education website shares general programs and resources to help students pick a school, pay for it and more.
Is there specific support for immigrant families?
CT Students for a Dream supports families with mixed immigration statuses. They have junior and senior high school calendar plans to get to college, a list of private colleges that accept undocumented students as domestic students and not international students, contact information for the college access program coordinator, a parent guide to understand the college process in Spanish, and a video on how to apply to FAFSA and Common App for Undocumented Students. The organization accompanies students to financial aid office meetings in case there are questions about tax filings or parental immigration status.
Make the Road, an immigrant advocacy organization, hosts biweekly virtual parent meetings, where they discuss education campaigns and explain educational systems including the path to college.
ECMC has a guide in English and in Spanish of resources to help get through the process of accessing and succeeding in college as an undocumented student among other guides.
Do any colleges offer pre-college programs? 
University of Connecticut offers college access programs such as the Collegiate Awareness Preparation program and the Upward Bound Program. They prepare Connecticut students from underserved communities in grades 9-12 and at the post-secondary level with tutoring, mentoring, financial advising, and even mental and physical health activities. UConn also is home to the First Gen Families portal as a landing point for first-generation students.
Connecticut State Community Colleges, including the Hartford campus, have the Early College and Dual Enrollment program, which allows high school students to take classes online, or even at their own high school. Credits earned may count towards both the high school diploma and college degree.
Trinity College has the HMTCA-Trinity Partnership. This is an early college experience that partners Hartford Magnet Trinity College Academy with Trinity College. HMTCA is an interdistrict magnet school. From its start in 2011, the partnership created opportunities for students and faculty at Trinity and the academy to build connections through Trinity mentors, summer writing programs and opportunities to take college courses.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FB_IMG_1760552946087-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-17 14:57:59.771360

The contract includes a noncompete clause, which bars physicians from working at a competing hospital after leaving. An author of Minnesota’s 2023 ban on noncompete agreements says the contract likely violates the law, though labor law experts say it’s unclear how a court might rule.
Aspirus, a health system based out of Wausau, Wis., merged with St. Luke’s Duluth in 2023 and operates 19 hospitals and over 100 outpatient clinics across Wisconsin, Michigan and Minnesota.
The Minnesota Attorney General’s office is now investigating physicians’ complaints and served Aspirus a subpoena Thursday, said Elizabeth Odette, the assistant attorney general who manages the office’s antitrust division.
The office has “enough information for a reasonable basis to investigate” whether Aspirus is violating Minnesota’s noncompete law, Odette said. “Now we just need to gather the information to determine whether there is a violation of law.”
The investigation is still in its preliminary stages, and Thursday was the first time the office reached out to Aspirus.
An Aspirus spokesperson declined to comment in an email.
This is not the first time the health system has faced scrutiny for its labor practices — in 2021, Aspirus paid $1.5 million to settle a class action lawsuit around employees’ retirement plans. Aspirus St. Luke’s is also currently being sued by a Duluth physician in a class action suit alleging wage theft.
The 2023 hospital merger between Aspirus and St. Luke’s is part of a broader trend of health care consolidation. A wide body of research, reviewed by health policy research organization KFF, has shown that health care consolidation has depressed employee wages and led to higher prices but not necessarily better care.
In Minnesota, the “factory style” of modern medicine, a consequence of sweeping health care consolidation, has led doctors at Allina to unionize in 2023. Aspirus physicians have yet to unionize.
‘Very physician-unfriendly and very administration-friendly’
The Reformer reviewed the contracts and drafts of new amendments for two Aspirus physicians, who were granted anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak to the media and fear retaliation. The amendment includes significant changes to sections on compensation, physician’s duties and termination.
Several physicians were told that failure to sign would be taken as a resignation, according to both physicians who spoke to the Reformer.
“I wouldn’t have signed this if I was looking for a job,” said one physician. She described the amended contract as “very physician-unfriendly and very administration-friendly.” The administration has new power to change work hours and location and how many patients doctors see.
Some physicians are seeing significant pay cuts as part of the process, said another physician.
Minnesota-based physicians are also “upset that they’re going to be shackled to the noncompete,” despite the 2023 state law banning them in new agreements, said the second physician. The contract amendments retained an existing noncompete from the physicians’ previous contract, which was renewed on a yearly basis — and thus also arguably unenforceable because a renewed contract is considered a new agreement, employment lawyers say.

Noncompetes: From Jimmy John’s to hospitals
Noncompetes bar workers from leaving a company and working at a competing company nearby for a period of time; the goal is ostensibly to prevent workers from taking trade secrets and client lists — in this case, patient lists — after leaving.
Noncompetes have emerged as an intensely debated legal and political issue in recent years, especially since Jimmy John’s got sued in 2014 for forcing sandwich makers to sign them. Since then, some legal scholars have defended noncompetes, seeking to rebut research that’s shown how they can suppress wages and innovation.
Workers with noncompetes are partially hamstrung in any pay negotiation — and likely to stay put — because they can’t seek out more lucrative work elsewhere or found a competing company. To help workers and spur innovation, the Biden-era Federal Trade Commission moved to ban noncompetes in 2024, though the ban was immediately blocked in federal courts. In September, the commission dropped the effort for an across-the-board ban and instead is now focusing on targeting specific companies that use noncompetes improperly.
The federal pullback makes Minnesota’s legislation more important for Minnesota workers.
When is a noncompete unenforceable?
Employment lawyers interviewed by the Reformer said that the heavily amended contract makes it a new agreement, voiding the noncompete. Rep. Emma Greenman, DFL-Minneapolis, who co-authored the 2023 legislation, said that she couldn’t think of a way that the Duluth hospital’s noncompete “could be enforceable and legal.”
“Once you change the contract or renew the contract, or once the parties are different, that’s a new contract to need consideration, and this ban would apply to that,” said Greenman, who is an attorney, in an interview.
Even when a noncompete is unenforceable, however, it can spook employees into not seeking new jobs, according to a study from the University of Michigan Law School. Employers will sometimes include unenforceable noncompetes in their contracts because of the chilling effect when workers don’t know their rights.
Bert Black, an attorney who has previously written about Minnesota noncompetes, said the physician noncompete sounds unenforceable, though he cautioned that “you can’t say unequivocally, this is the law,” because Minnesota courts have said little if anything on the subject after 2023.
Regardless of the state’s noncompete ban, noncompete clauses have always been subject to limitations based on factors like reasonableness and impact on consumers.
“That’s especially true with physician noncompetes,” said Rachel Arnow-Richman, a professor of labor law in Florida. “The concern of patient choice and access to health care adds another dimension.”
One of the Northland doctors said they are concerned about their patients. “There’s not enough doctors here to take care of everybody that needs care,” said the physician. “But again, I’m also not sure I want to sign this.”
The effect of banning noncompetes, the physician said, should be that “providers at least have some freedom to quit a lousy job, stay in the community where they live and keep providing care.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/GettyImages-91540120-1024x767.jpg,,,2025-10-17 12:04:48.625493

This one would bring 156 condominiums — a quarter of which would be set aside as affordable housing — to a neighborhood in the central part of the island. Opposition to new housing on Nantucket puts the island squarely in company with lots of affluent communities in Massachusetts, where efforts to address a dire housing shortage often run into stiff resistance.  
But in the latest chapter of the battle on Nantucket, which has stretched on for seven years, opponents have seized on an issue often championed by communities of color and progressive activists to fight industrial pollution in low-income communities as part of their campaign to block affordable housing in a high-cost enclave where it is desperately needed.  
Based on the 2020 Census, the section of Nantucket where developers hope to build their 40B affordable housing project known as Surfside Crossing is now recognized as an environmental justice community under state rules.  
To qualify, an area’s population must have below-average median household income or high percentages of minority individuals or households with limited English proficiency. This part of Nantucket, home to a large Hispanic community, qualifies an environmental justice community because minorities make up 40 percent or more of the population.  
Citing the new environmental justice designation, residents opposed to the project filed a “fail-safe review” petition with the state’s top environmental official on August 25 — a direct appeal to Energy and Environmental Affairs Secretary Rebecca Tepper to order the developer to release additional environmental information before the project can advance, a move that would further stall the proposal.  
Whether it’s just a calculated bid to pull any available lever in the NIMBY arsenal or the legitimate invocation of a serious environmental threat, or perhaps both, is now in the hands of the Healey administration. 
It’s the exact kind of bureaucratic wrangling Gov. Maura Healey has sought to reduce, and it cuts right at the heart of the tensions surrounding her push to build 220,000 new homes by 2035. And while Healey has also voiced strong support for environmental justice issues, she has proposed changes to regulations under the Massachusetts Environmental Policy Act, the main law governing state environmental review of development projects, that her administration say are aimed at promoting more affordable housing.  
The project is filed under the state’s 40B affordable housing law, which lets developers bypass local zoning approval in communities where less than 10 percent of existing housing stock is deemed affordable if they set aside 20 to 25 percent of units as affordable housing. 
Like all development proposals, however, 40B projects are still subject to environmental regulation.  
The Surfside project would be located within the public water supply zone for an EPA-designated sole source aquifer that “if contaminated, would create a significant hazard to public health,” according to the agency. A 2018 hydrogeologic assessment of the project found that there is “increased potential” for contamination that could “impair the Town’s water supply,” though the report ultimately concluded that the proposal does not present a significant threat to Nantucket’s water. 
Opponents have cited the threat to the local water supply in their petition to the state for further review under the environmental justice designation. They also argue that the presence of five other affordable housing projects within a 1-mile radius of the proposed site creates “an overwhelming and disproportionate burden on one section of the island” — overdevelopment concerns that town officials have shared from the beginning.   
“I think that rules are in place to safeguard communities are important, and I think when politicians or developers try to streamline those or circumvent them, or look for a waiver from them, that’s the only reason to do it: because you’re trying to do something outside of what should be allowed,” said Meghan Perry, who serves on the board of Nantucket Tipping Point, a local group that has fought the housing proposal. “If you don’t have clean water, it doesn’t matter how many housing units you have.” 
The Healey administration wouldn’t comment on the pending petition, but it is sticking by its view that the state can unlock more housing production by streamlining permitting and speeding up approvals. 
“The same communities that face some of the biggest environmental issues also struggle to find affordable, energy efficient homes,” Maria Hardiman, a spokesperson for the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs, said in a statement. “Gov. Healey’s proposed changes to [Massachusetts Environmental Policy Act] regulations will help us ensure that we’re incentivizing the kinds of housing we need the most – dense, affordable, and resilient projects with low energy bills. This kind of balanced approach can help us build healthier, more affordable neighborhoods.”

The developers of the Surfside project took aim at the use of the environmental justice designation as little more than a cynical attempt to find any excuse to block affordable housing on the island.   
“In my 40-plus years developing affordable housing I have seen so many fake claims from the NIMBY crowd aimed at stopping much-needed housing, but this might take the cake as the most hypocritical and disingenuous move ever,” said Josh Posner, Surfside Crossing’s co-developer. “We hope [the state environmental policy office] can see through this upside-down perversion of the environmental justice guidelines and not inadvertently establish yet another tool for opponents trying to kill this high quality, well-located development.”   
Nantucket is rightly regarded as the ultimate New England address of the ultra-rich, with a median home sale price last year of $2.8 million. A waterfront compound sold for more than $38 million in 2023, shattering the record for the most paid for a single residence on Nantucket, and more than half of the island’s housing units are owned by seasonal residents.  
Elsewhere on the island, though, the first overnight housing shelter on Nantucket opened two years ago to accommodate a growing population of year-round residents that can’t make ends meet. The median home sale price has risen nearly 90 percent over the last five years ago as wealthy buyers snatch up vacation homes, compounding the island’s permanent affordable housing challenges tied to its limited land availability and high costs of shipping in construction materials. 
Housing advocates are urging Healey to keep the focus on the need to reduce the state’s cost of living. Jesse Kanson-Benavav, executive director of Abundant Housing Massachusetts, said that protracted reviews like the one sought by the Surfside opponents can ultimately hurt the community that the reviews are intended to protect. 
“This is a tension point for us in Massachusetts,” said Kanson-Benavav, who also served on Healey’s Commission on Unlocking Housing Production. “We want to protect environmental justice communities. At the same time, what are we giving up when we’re making it incredibly costly to build homes around those communities? When it takes a year or more for an environmental review to be completed, that increases costs. Those costs are borne somewhere, and where they are borne is in the ultimate rental or sale prices of the homes that are built in that project if it is finally completed.” 
But Tristan Thomas, director of policy at the Roxbury-based Alternatives for Community & Environment, a nonprofit focused on environmental justice, or EJ, issues, said it’s important to separate whatever motives one thinks might be driving opponents from the facts on the ground or, in this case, underground.  
“I wouldn’t be surprised if it was just some NIMBY community trying to use whatever law in the books to keep their neighborhood quiet or keep their neighborhood how they want it to be,” Thomas said. “But if the aquifer needs to be protected, and there are legitimate EJ concerns, I’m glad that there’s a law to work it through a process to make a determination.” 
Marcos Luna, professor of geography and sustainability at Salem State University and a member of the state’s Environmental Justice Council, said he fully recognizes the dire conditions of a lack of affordable housing in Massachusetts as a whole — which itself disproportionately hurts those that environmental justice laws are aimed at protecting. At the same time, Luna said he’s skeptical of efforts to get rid of red tape for the sake of it, since those rules were put in place to correct past mistakes of overdevelopment without due consideration. 
That’s precisely what makes projects like Surfside Crossing so difficult for state and local officials to navigate.  
“On the Cape and Islands, housing affordability is a real crisis, and a significant amount of folks who are crucial to the workforce and are themselves residents and deserve access to housing,” he said. “That’s a real thing – as real as water. It should be evaluated in that context.” 
State officials already reviewed the project five years ago and declined to require the additional environmental scrutiny now sought through the environmental justice petition. That endorsement of the project came after the developer in 2020 changed its proposal from a mix of multi-unit buildings and single-family homes to only multi-unit buildings with fewer overall bedrooms. 
The state-level Housing Appeals Committee, which has oversight on 40B projects, approved that new plan. But opponents went to court, arguing that the 2020 changes were substantial enough that the review process should start over. A Superior Court ruling found in their favor, ordering the project to go back through the bureaucratic wheel by remanding it to the local zoning board.  
The Nantucket Zoning Board of Appeals rejected the proposal in a unanimous 5-0 decision earlier this year. Surfside Crossing promptly took the case for a second time to the state Housing Appeals Committee, which held a hearing last month on the proposal.  
But opponents have now thrown their environmental justice curveball, hoping Tepper, the environmental affairs secretary, will order further review of the project, while the developers are banking on the state Housing Appeals Committee to again green light it.  
All of that leaves the Healey administration walking something of a political and policy tightrope, trying to balance its commitment to environmental justice issues and its stated determination to see more housing built, even when it ruffles local feathers.  
“It’s true that these things have been used by people who are just opponents of housing,” said Mark Martinez, housing staff attorney at the Massachusetts Law Reform Institute. “So there’s a big tension there. I don’t think there’s an easy bright red line that says here’s how you fix that to perfectly balance those tensions.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6557-scaled.jpeg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-17 10:58:52.818079

(Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana Conservation Voters has added $100,000 to a statewide media campaign urging Hoosiers to tell their lawmakers to reject a mid-decade congressional redistricting push.
The added money will ensure the television ads are seen during this weekend’s Colts, IU and Notre Dame games, according to a news release.
“Hoosiers aren’t asking for this. Washington outsiders just won’t take ‘no’ for an answer,” ICV Executive Director Megan Robertson said. “They want us to cheat, and we’re not cheaters. Indiana lawmakers should be commended for resisting the pressure campaign. We hope they’ll stay focused on lowering costs and improving quality of life instead of embracing this political nonsense.”

Vice President JD Vance visited Indiana for a second time last week to urge Republican lawmakers and GOP Gov. Mike Braun to redo the state’s U.S. House maps. He and Hoosier officials also met in D.C.
Currently, Republicans control seven districts and Democrats have two in Indianapolis and northwest Indiana. The maps were drawn by Republicans in 2021 after the decennial census.
At the time, Senate President Pro Tempore Rodric Bray said, “We prioritized keeping communities of interest together and drawing districts that make sense for the Hoosiers who live there, while maintaining nearly equal populations in each district. I believe these maps reflect feedback from the public and will serve Hoosiers well for the next decade.”
Supporters, though, want to draw a 9-0 map midway through the decade — and without new census data — to help ensure Republicans retain the majority in the U.S. House in the 2026 elections.
The media buy includes digital, radio and over-the-top streaming platforms. Multiple polls have found opposition to mid-decade redistricting.
Indiana Conservation Voters is encouraging residents to visit PlayFairIndiana.com to contact Braun and their state lawmakers.
“Every call and every message sends a clear signal: Hoosiers are not interested in political games from Washington,” Robertson said. “We want our leaders focused on Indiana’s future, not D.C.’s agenda.”",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PA105180-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-17 10:58:52.818079
