(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — The Nebraska Medicine board announced Sunday that it had launched an “informational website” aimed at shaping public opinion against letting one of the nonprofit’s owners sell its 50% leadership stake to the other, the University of Nebraska.
The ramping up of the now-public dispute over the group’s future governance comes as the NU Board of Regents prepares for a hearing and possible vote Friday about whether to pay Clarkson Regional Health $500 million for full control.
The regents also will consider a related $300 million transaction for several Clarkson properties in and around the University of Nebraska Medical Center’s midtown Omaha campus, bringing the total price of the buyout to $800 million.
Board argues risks
Nebraska Medicine’s board, steered by people who have led some of the state’s major businesses, appears focused on peeling regents’ support from the proposal. The new website making the group’s argument is www.protectnebraskahealthcare.org.
The site argues, among other things, that compensation for specialists, doctors, nurses and staff could be compromised by state involvement. It seeks more time to find a new private partner for NU to take Clarkson’s place.
Lance Fritz, the former Union Pacific CEO who chairs the Nebraska Medicine Board of Directors, warned in a statement Sunday that ceding control over Nebraska Medicine to the government might put patients and health care providers at risk.
“It’s important that Nebraskans have access to clear and accurate information on this issue,” Fritz said. “We hope this website helps people understand what is being considered and why it is a serious concern.”
NU leaders argue opportunity
NU leaders have argued that patients will see no difference in the quality of care provided or the costs of that care. They argue NU is simply adapting to an ownership structure that reflects most modern academic medical centers.
University leaders, including NU President Dr. Jeffrey Gold, have said they do not yet know how much of the $800 million would come from private donors versus public funds. Gold also acknowledged the difficult timing.
The broader NU system also faces the likelihood of additional budget cutting with the State of Nebraska confronting a projected budget shortfall and Gov. Jim Pillen’s push to cut at least $500 million in state spending.
Pillen, a former NU regent whose family runs a hog operation based in Columbus, supports the NU purchase and potential shift in ownership structure. He has said it will protect a vital asset for Nebraskans and their needs.
If the purchase happens, NU would be the sole owner of Nebraska Medicine, which offers hospitals and medical care primarily in eastern Nebraska. Nebraska Medicine’s board has described the push as akin to government healthcare.
Leadership structure questions emerge
Today, NU and Clarkson split leadership on the Nebraska Medicine board. NU says the independent board would still lead UNMC’s medical partner, but it was not immediately clear who would appoint the directors after Clarkson departs.
Following the sale, Clarkson, which helped the university build the core hospital building at 42nd and Dewey Streets, has pledged a $200 million gift to help replace it. Gold said none of the project’s public funding would pull from the budgets of other NU campuses. The campuses together finalized cuts last fall totaling $43 million. 
Clarkson offers NU its half of Nebraska Medicine, properties for $800 million

Clarkson has said it plans to use the purchase-related funds from NU to grow a local private foundation focused on providing grants aimed at making Nebraska the healthiest state in the U.S. and improving how health care is delivered and carried out.
NU leadership is facing questions of its own internally, Gold wrote in an email to UNMC faculty, staff and students on Sunday afternoon. Gold announced a campus forum set for noon Tuesday at UNMC’s Truhlsen Events Center.
Gold shared a frequently asked questions document that seeks to emphasize the university does not intend to change how Nebraska Medicine is managed. The document argues Nebraska Medicine was already run by its owners. It says Nebraska Medicine employees will not become state employees.
“When [Clarkson] began to consider resigning its position in Nebraska Medicine, it approached the Board of Regents to see if the University of Nebraska would be interested in sole-member governance,” Gold wrote. “This is a tremendous opportunity for the University of Nebraska Medical Center.”

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)Members of Montana’s Congressional delegation quickly praised President Donald Trump and the military for the capture Saturday of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, characterized by the administration as head of a drug cartel.
U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke, one of three military veterans who are members of the all-Republican delegation, said on social media that Trump acted within his powers to take “decisive military action” against an illegitimate “narco-terrorist dictator.”
“America should not be viewed as conquerer, but rather as a liberator of freedom for the (Venezuelan) people,” Zinke said in a social media post. “With the help of the United States, I am confident they will now be able to use their resources to build a better and more prosperous future.”
Trump announced on Saturday the United States would “run the country” until “a proper transition can take place.”
Maduro’s wife, Cilia Flores, also was captured, and they both will face a U.S. indictment on narco-terrorism and conspiracy charges levied in 2020, States Newsroom’s Washington, D.C., bureau reported.
Many elected Democrats condemned the strike and said it superseded Congress’ authority to declare war, but in posts on social media, Montana’s delegation defended the action.
“Maduro was an illegitimate dictator and narco-terror kingpin with American blood on his hands,” said U.S. Sen. Tim Sheehy, who, like Zinke, also served as a U.S. Navy SEAL. “The American people and the Western hemisphere are safer as a result of this operation. Thank you to our brave military and @potus.”
U.S. Air Force veteran and Rep. Troy Downing said the action shows the United States will protect its people.
“Venezuela is a fake narco-state and Nicolas Maduro was a complicit narco operator, both of which posed a direct threat to the health and safety of the American people,” Downing said. “This morning’s targeted operation put the world on notice that the United States will respond with force to criminals and adversaries threatening the safety and welfare of Americans. Peace through strength is the mission.”
States Newsroom’s D.C. bureau said the U.S. and many other countries determined Maduro’s reelection in 2024 was illegitimate.
Trump also has said the operation related to securing oil.
U.S. Sen Steve Daines, the most senior member of the Montana delegation, praised the effort.
“I commend @POTUS and our brave military and law enforcement for helping bring indicted narco-terrorist Maduro to justice today,” Daines said in a post Saturday. “The world is safer thanks to peace through strength.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_1174-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-04 17:57:47.873601

(Photo courtesy of office of U.S Rep Gab Amo)The year is new, but the argument is the same: The Trump administration has no constitutional authority to halt work on a major offshore wind project nearing completion south of Rhode Island’s coastline.
Hundreds of pages of legal filings submitted in federal court on Jan. 1 and 2 by the Revolution Wind developers reprise many of the same arguments already invoked in its August lawsuit against federal regulators. 
The 65-turbine project was already 80% complete when the Trump administration unexpectedly ordered work to stop on Aug. 22, citing national security issues. A month of anguish ensued, with local officials, labor leaders and environmental advocates, along with the companies behind the $5 billion project, decrying the unconstitutional overstep by federal regulators. A federal judge in D.C. stepped in, forcing the Trump administration to back off in a Sept. 22 order. Unlike other litigation between states and companies and the federal government, the order was never appealed.
The rocky seas seemed to calm. Laborers resumed work, and the developers said they were still on schedule to begin providing power to Rhode Island and Connecticut by mid-2026. Offshore installation was scheduled to be completed in mid-February, according to an affidavit from Paul Murphy, senior engineering procurement and construction director for the project. 
Then, three days before Christmas, a new edict from the Trump administration ordered work to stop again on Revolution Wind and four other offshore wind projects along the Atlantic coast. The second, 90-day pause again rested on national security concerns, despite the rigorous review already dubbed complete by the same federal energy agencies years before.
Orsted A/S, the Danish renewable energy giant co-developing Revolution Wind, initially offered a veiled response to the second stop work order. But the hundreds of pages filed in D.C. federal court in the first two days of the year reveal a more forceful fight.
“The Second Stop Work Order is arbitrary and capricious: It is wholly conclusory, internally inconsistent, and overbroad,” states one of the new legal filings, submitted on Jan. 1. “The Second Stop Work Order ignores that the [Department of] Interior has stated plainly that the Project does not interfere with national security. It also ignores Revolution Wind’s obvious and substantial actions and billions of dollars of investment made in reliance.”
Since work resumed in mid-September, developers have finished installing the foundations that anchor the turbines to the sea floor, along with 58 of the 65 turbines, and “substantial completion” of the underwater cables that will connect the wind-powered electricity to the regional grid, according to court filings. Developers now estimate the project is 87% completed — up from 80% in mid-August.
With every day the pause continues, the losses pile up. The companies estimate they are losing $1.44 million a day on already inked contracts with specialty vessels meant to carry heavy equipment and workers out to sea. If the pause is not lifted by Jan. 12, there is a “very high risk” the vessels will no longer be available and the remaining turbines will not be installed by the mandated Jan. 15, 2027 deadline to supply power to Rhode Island, the court filings state.
The development companies are seeking a second preliminary injunction to stop the Trump administration from suspending work on the project, and have also asked to speed up the deliberations.
Royce C. Lamberth, senior judge for the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, agreed to the second request. His Jan. 2 order gives the Department of Justice attorneys representing the federal administration until Thursday, Jan. 8, to submit a response. An in-person hearing in Lamberth’s D.C. courtroom is scheduled for 11 a.m. on Monday, Jan. 12, according to the court docket.

What’s at stake in R.I.
Beyond the $6 billion loss projected by project developers if the project is canceled or left incomplete are the consequences for Rhode Island and Connecticut. On Friday, state and congressional leaders, labor organizers and environmental advocates organized a press conference and rally in downtown Providence to demonstrate their support for the project.
“Rhode Island has built national leadership in offshore wind by doing the hard work and delivering real results,” Gov. Dan McKee said in a statement following the event. “These projects are essential to keeping energy affordable, creating long-term jobs, strengthening our economy, and meeting our climate goals. We remain committed to an energy future that works for Rhode Island’s workers, families, and businesses.”
More than 2,000 workers, many of them union laborers, have staked their careers on the burgeoning offshore wind industry, aided by specialty training programs including at the Community College of Rhode Island. Since the second stop work order was issued, 200 workers were put on standby for off- and onshore work, according to an affidavit from Melanie Gearon, head of permitting for the project. 
“Just days before the holidays, this administration chose to put thousands of skilled construction workers in limbo – again,” said Michael F. Sabitoni, general secretary-treasurer of the local chapter of the Laborers’ International Union of North America and president of the Rhode Island Building and Construction Trades Council. “These are men and women who were counting on this work to support their families and keep food on the table. Offshore wind means union jobs, strong wages, and real economic security. Pulling the plug at the end of the year is reckless and deeply unfair to working families.”

The Ocean State’s ambitious decarbonization mandate, reaching net-zero by 2050, also hinges upon the project’s completion and power for up to 350,000 homes across Rhode Island and Connecticut. Even states without direct contracts to buy power from the project stand to benefit from a regional electric grid better shielded from the seasonal fluctuations in natural gas prices and availability.
“Stopping these projects ignores both climate science and public support for these projects, and it delays the clean energy transition our communities are counting on,” said Jeff Migneault, executive director of Climate Action Rhode Island. 
The press conference and rally also featured remarks from U.S. Senators Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse, and U.S. Rep. Gabe Amo.
The states’ stakes in the project were the focus of a second federal lawsuit filed by Rhode Island and Connecticut attorneys general in August. The AGs case was originally filed in Rhode Island federal court, but transferred to D.C. in December, less than two weeks before the second stop work order. No new submissions have been filed in the AGs court case since the latest move by the Trump administration to halt the project, though Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said previously that his office was reviewing the suspension order.
A second Orsted project, Sunrise Wind, under construction off the coast of Long Island, New York, was also subject to the December stop work order. Orsted said in a statement on Jan. 1 that it is still evaluating options for this project, including possible legal proceedings. 
Also affected: Vineyard Wind 1, south of Martha’s Vineyard, Empire Wind 1 off New York’s coastline and Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind. Developers for Empire Wind and the Virginia project have also filed separate federal lawsuits against the Trump administration for their projects.

Vermont’s congressional delegation condemned the U.S. military’s attack on Venezuela over the weekend that led to the capture of the country’s leader, Nicolás Maduro.
U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt, and Vermont Democrats U.S. Sen. Peter Welch and U.S. Rep Becca Balint, all labeled Maduro a brutal authoritarian but said President Donald Trump’s attacks on the South American county exceeded his constitutional authority. 
“Trump’s attack on Venezuela will make the United States and the world less safe. This brazen violation of international law gives a green light to any nation on earth that may wish to attack another country to seize their resources or change their governments,” Sanders said in a statement. 
U.S. forces entered the Venezuelan capital of Caracas overnight Friday into Saturday, and more than 100 U.S. aircraft helped neutralize the country’s air defenses, the New York Times reported. More than 40 people were killed, according to Venezuelan authorities, though Trump said there were no Americans killed in the attack. 
American troops captured both Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, later transporting them out of the country, according to news reports. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said Maduro would face charges in the U.S. of narco-terrorism conspiracy and cocaine importation conspiracy, among other charges. 
Trump said Saturday that the U.S. would “run” Venezuela while a transfer of power took place. The details of that plan were not immediately clear, though many of Trump’s comments focused on growing the Venezuelan oil industry.  
Vermont’s top federal lawmakers wasted little time in condemning the military escalation. They had similarly criticized the staging of Vermont Air National Guard members in the Caribbean to support the military buildup against Venezuela. 
“President Trump’s hunger for a regime change war makes it clear he doesn’t care about how this unauthorized and illegal action could cause further chaos and suffering in Venezuela. Has he learned nothing from Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya?” Welch said in a statement Saturday. “This could lead us into another forever war, risking the lives of U.S. service members and hurting the economy.”
Balint, in her own statement, said the U.S. had made “these horrible mistakes before.”
“Americans do not want another war,” she said.

Nancy Hunt arrived at an emergency room from a Genesis HealthCare nursing home in Pennsylvania in such dreadful shape, including maggots infesting her gangrened foot, that the hospital called an elder abuse hotline and then the police, her son alleged in a lawsuit.
Hunt died five days later. Her death certificate said the foot injury was a “significant” factor. Genesis denied wrongdoing but agreed to pay $3.5 million in a settlement Hunt’s son signed in August 2024.
Yet Genesis hasn’t paid most of that debt, court records show. It may never have to.

Once the nation’s largest nursing home chain, Genesis says it was spending $8 million a month defending and settling lawsuits over resident injuries and deaths in recent years. But the company is now poised to wipe the liability slate clean by seeking refuge in the most protective corner of the legal system for the nursing home industry: bankruptcy court.
The Genesis case, one of 11 large senior care bankruptcies this year, illustrates how health care companies can dodge public and financial accountability for alleged negligence through delays, confidentiality clauses, and bankruptcy maneuvers, a KFF Health News investigation found.
When it filed for bankruptcy in Dallas in July, Genesis estimated its total liability for nearly a thousand settled and pending lawsuits at $259 million. A KFF Health News review of the terms of 155 settlement agreements and corporate financial statements shows Genesis officials knew insolvency was possible yet included provisions in its settlement agreements allowing it to defer payment, often for a year or more.
As a result, Genesis paid nothing in 85 cases and only a portion in the other 70, according to civil court records and bankruptcy claims made available through people with access to them. It still owes $41 million of the $58 million it had agreed to pay in those cases, the records show.
Nellie Betancourt, shown in a photo with her husband, Gabe, had planned a trip to Las Vegas before she fractured her hip at a Genesis HealthCare rehabilitation center — an injury the medical examiner’s report said led to her death. “When she went into that place, I said, ‘Well, she’s going to be taken care of for a few more days and I’ll take her home,’” Gabe says. (Adria Malcolm for KFF Health News)
“It just feels like they killed my mom and got away with it,” said Vanessa Betancourt, whose mother, Nellie Betancourt, a retired nurse, fractured her hip at a Genesis home in Albuquerque, New Mexico — an injury the medical examiner’s report said led to her death. Genesis agreed to a $650,000 settlement with Betancourt’s family in April under the condition it would not need to pay the first of seven installments for another year, according to the settlement document.
Gabe Betancourt holds an old photograph of his wife, Nellie, that he keeps in his wallet. “I carry her with me everywhere I go,” he says. (Adria Malcolm for KFF Health News)
Genesis denied wrongdoing in all lawsuits and settlements. In a written statement, the company did not answer questions about individual personal injury cases. The statement said Genesis remained “focused on delivering high-quality, compassionate care to our patients and residents without disruption” during bankruptcy.
One lawsuit Genesis settled for nearly $1 million alleged nursing home managers ignored repeated warnings about a male resident’s behavior before he sexually assaulted a female Alzheimer’s patient, according to court records. In a case the company resolved for $500,000, a Genesis nursing home was accused of delaying the hospitalization of a resident who had vomited brown mucus. He died of a bowel obstruction. Genesis has paid nothing for either settlement, according to bankruptcy claims.
Creditors, including families of the deceased, are expected to salvage a fraction of what they were promised, if anything. On Dec. 10, the company’s owners were scheduled to seek approval by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas to sell its nursing homes and other assets to its largest investor, a private equity firm. In court papers, lawyers for residents and other creditors say the complex plan will prevent them from pursuing Genesis’ new ownership and other companies they blame for the company’s collapse.
John Anthony, a bankruptcy attorney representing 340 personal injury claims against Genesis, said, “They never had any intention to honor these deals.”

Low ratings and fines

During years of financial turmoil, Genesis has frequently struggled to provide top-notch care, federal records show. Using its five-star system, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services rated 58% of homes affiliated with Genesis as below average or much below average. CMS has fined Genesis homes $10 million for violating federal health standards over the past three years.
In 2022, Connecticut health regulators shuttered a Genesis home after two deaths and multiple violations. The company closed another Connecticut nursing home this year after residents twice were evacuated over safety concerns.
In its Chapter 11 filing, Genesis said it cared for about 15,000 residents in 165 nursing homes and 10 assisted living facilities in 18 states. They are centered in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, New Mexico, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Maine, Alabama, Maryland, and North Carolina, according to the bankruptcy filing.

The company said it owed $709 million in secured debt to lenders and the IRS. Under bankruptcy rules, those debts, backed by Genesis collateral, take precedence over the $1.6 billion in unsecured debt Genesis said it owes. Unsecured creditors include a pension fund; contractors that provided health services and equipment; Pennsylvania, New Mexico, and West Virginia for unpaid provider taxes; and former residents and their families who sued.

Dangers in memory care

Sandia Ridge Center, a Genesis home in Albuquerque, was repeatedly faulted by health regulators for not preventing sexual misbehavior in its memory care unit. In November 2021, CMS cited the home for lacking enough nurses to prevent sexual abuse among residents. An inspection report the following August identified more inappropriate sexual contact. Police were called to investigate sexual assault allegations in February and March of 2023, police reports show; neither resulted in criminal charges.
Then in April 2023, a 61-year-old male resident with alcohol-related dementia sexually assaulted a female resident with Alzheimer’s in the dining room, according to a police report and an inspection report. When the resident screamed for him to stop and that he was hurting her, he responded “shut up bitch I know you like this,” according to a lawsuit brought on behalf of the woman, identified in court papers as R.S.
Sandia Ridge management had been aware of the male resident’s behavioral issues for months, according to employee depositions in the case. Police had investigated a prior sexual assault allegation against him the previous year without bringing charges. In one deposition, a former activities assistant testified he hit her and twice pushed her into a bathroom while announcing, “I want to have sex with you.” When she reported him to a senior Genesis manager, she said in the deposition, the manager put his finger over his lips and said, “Shhh.”
The activities worker testified that R.S. used to happily sing along with Elvis Presley songs. After the assault, the worker said, R.S. “don’t sing anymore.”
Inspectors cited the home for failing to protect R.S. The same report said the home didn’t provide a therapist for another female resident who was being sexually harassed. Medicare fined Sandia Ridge Center $91,247. Genesis denied liability but settled R.S.’ lawsuit for $925,000 in May, according to the bankruptcy claim.
“We just felt we have to hold them accountable,” R.S.’ daughter said in an interview, speaking on the condition that she and her mother not be identified, because of the nature of the assault. “Maybe I’m wrong, maybe I’m naive, but the only way to do that is to sue someone, right?”
Genesis has not paid any of the settlement, according to the family’s claim filing.

Growth and debt

Genesis’ downfall can be traced to 2007, when affiliates of two private equity firms acquired the company in a $1.5 billion leveraged buyout, taking on substantial debt, according to its bankruptcy filing. Private equity also has been involved in other health care bankruptcies, including those of the HCR ManorCare nursing home chain, the prison health care contractor Corizon Health, and two for-profit hospital systems, Steward Health Care and Prospect Medical Holdings.
In 2011, Genesis raised $2.4 billion by transferring substantially all its nursing home buildings and other real estate to Welltower, a publicly traded real estate investment trust, according to Genesis’ bankruptcy filing. Genesis then rented the buildings back from Welltower, which made leasing costs a significant expense.
Genesis went on a nationwide buying spree. At its peak in 2016, it had grown to more than 500 nursing homes. In a court declaration, Louis Robichaux IV, a consultant overseeing Genesis’ bankruptcy restructuring, wrote that as the company expanded, it became harder to manage and “mired in corporate inefficiencies.” Robichaux wrote that Genesis’ financial woes were exacerbated by rapidly increasing labor costs and lawsuits, including some predating the covid pandemic.
Starting in 2021, Genesis avoided bankruptcy after receiving $100 million in loans from a private equity firm founded by Joel Landau, the owner of a Brooklyn-based nursing home chain, according to Robichaux’s filing.
But Genesis continued to teeter on the edge of insolvency. In audited financial statements for 2022 and 2023 submitted to a California oversight agency, management and auditors said rent and debt obligations raised “substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern.”
In a court filing, a committee appointed by the U.S. Trustee’s Office to represent the unsecured creditors in the bankruptcy accused Landau and Welltower of orchestrating a covert plan that allowed Welltower to keep getting its rents while Landau could run the company and “siphon value to himself.” The committee alleged their efforts forced the company into insolvency while “staffing levels and patient care declined precipitously.” Landau and Welltower did not respond to requests for comment.

Drawn-out lawsuits

Erin Pearson sued Genesis over the death of her father, James Sanderson, a retired mining company executive who died in 2018 after spending less than a month at Bear Canyon Rehabilitation Center in Albuquerque. In the memory care unit, Sanderson fell repeatedly, suffered medication errors made by nursing home staff, and developed a bowel obstruction and sepsis, according to the lawsuit, filed in 2019. Pearson’s lawyers said he was not hospitalized until eight days after nurses noticed he was vomiting brown mucus.

After the judge rejected Genesis’ request to force Pearson into arbitration, Genesis appealed. It took 2½ years before an appeals court affirmed the original decision to let the case go forward in court, records show.
This past May, more than five years after suing, Pearson reached a $500,000 settlement, with the first payment required by November, according to a copy of the agreement. Nothing was paid, according to the bankruptcy claim.
“It was so drawn out and for so long,” Pearson said in an interview, calling Genesis’ bankruptcy “despicable.”

Payouts postponed

Jennifer Foote, an Albuquerque attorney who represents clients in multiple lawsuits against Genesis, including Pearson’s, said the company frequently filed appeals. “They did not usually win them on these issues,” she said, “and our sense was that they were doing it as a delay tactic.”
Genesis started using installment payments around 2018, said Dusti Harvey, Foote’s law partner. “The payments wouldn’t start for several months out,” Harvey said. Foote said Genesis’ lawyers often wanted to time the payments to start the month the trial in the case was scheduled to occur.
Genesis HealthCare settlements included periodic payment plans, like this one from a $600,000 settlement in February 2025, included in a court record, that allowed the company to delay paying for a year or more. (KFF Health News screengrab)
Families had to wait even when comparatively small amounts of money were involved, settlement agreements show. Genesis’ settlement agreements also included a confidentiality clause prohibiting discussion of the incidents.
Genesis agreed to pay $42,000 in a November 2024 settlement, but the first payment was not due until nine months later. It was not paid, according to the bankruptcy claim.
A $250,000 settlement signed in October 2023 did not start paying out until the following September. When Genesis declared bankruptcy — 21 months after the case was resolved — it still owed $100,000, according to the family’s claim.

‘We never found out the truth’

Settling cases allowed Genesis to avoid the expense and publicity of a trial, at which details of how its nursing homes functioned might have been revealed. In October 2020, Margarett Johnson, a retired school bus driver, fell out of her wheelchair at a Genesis nursing home in Waldorf, Maryland, fracturing her jawbone, nose, and neck, according to a lawsuit brought by her family. Johnson was sent to a trauma center and placed on a ventilator. She died three months later, at age 76, from ventilator-associated pneumonia, the lawsuit said.
“It looked like she was hit by a truck,” Angelina Harley, one of her daughters, said in an interview. “I knew my mom was not going to come home. I knew the Lord was not going to punish her more.”
Genesis HealthCare still owes $112,500 from a $950,000 settlement over the death of Margarett Johnson after an accident in a Maryland nursing home, according to a bankruptcy claim. She is seen here with her brother William Tolson. (Angela Swann)
The company denied negligence and blamed the accident on Johnson’s jacket getting tangled in the wheel of her wheelchair, according to the lawsuit. Harley and her sister Angela Swann were dubious.
“We never found out the truth,” Harley said. “They wanted to settle out of court.”
The company denied liability but agreed to a $950,000 settlement in October 2024. It never paid the final $112,500 installment, according to a letter Johnson’s five children sent to the bankruptcy judge.
“If you settle out of court, you know doggone well you did something wrong,” Harley said.

Maddening judges

By summer 2025, judges in some civil cases had run out of patience.
Alma Brown, a retired day care manager and accordion teacher living in a Genesis nursing home in Clovis, New Mexico, suffered falls, infections, bedsores, and other neglect that hastened her death in 2023, according to her estate’s lawsuit. In Santa Fe District Court, Judge Kathleen McGarry Ellenwood castigated Genesis after it failed to pay $2 million of the $3 million settlement to Brown’s estate or explain the delay.
Genesis “obviously benefited by not having to go to trial,” McGarry Ellenwood said in one hearing, according to a court transcript. “They assure me that they’re not trying to renege on their contract, but it certainly seems like they haven’t lived up to what the bargain was.”
Genesis declared bankruptcy the day McGarry Ellenwood announced she would impose more than $100,000 in fines, plus $10,000 more each day until the settlement was paid.
In Pennsylvania, Greg Hunt petitioned a judge to punish Genesis after it stopped payments of the $3.5 million settlement after the death of his mother, Nancy, the resident with the gangrenous foot. She had spent eight months in 2019 at Brandywine Hall, a Genesis facility in West Chester that was later sold and renamed.
In a filing with the Common Pleas Court of Montgomery County, Genesis admitted it was in arrears but asked the judge for more time, citing “unforeseen and exigent financial challenges.” Genesis said care for patients at its nursing homes would suffer if it had to pay immediately.
Unswayed, Judge Richard Haaz in June ordered Genesis to pay up, along with punitive interest. But the bankruptcy court stayed that order. Genesis still owes $1.4 million of the $2 million it was supposed to pay, according to Hunt’s claim. (The rest of the $3.5 million settlement is supposed to be paid by an insurer in January 2026.) Ian Norris, Hunt’s lawyer, declined to comment, citing confidentiality provisions in the settlement.
Court records indicate Genesis lawyers never disclosed in either case that it was preparing to declare bankruptcy.

‘Bankruptcy as a tool’

In the first nine months of 2025, 10 other senior living companies with liabilities over $10 million entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy, according to Gibbins Advisors, a consulting firm.
Hamid Rafatjoo, a bankruptcy lawyer representing nursing homes who is not involved in the Genesis bankruptcy case, said filings may increase as the industry has become costlier to run and class action lawsuits have become a fixture.
“Nursing homes get sued all the time for everything,” Rafatjoo said. “A lot of operators wait too long to use bankruptcy as a tool.”
On Dec. 1, Genesis announced the results of its auction, saying it had elected to sell its assets to a private equity firm controlled by Landau. In a court filing, Anthony, the attorney for the personal injury claimants, alleged the auction was stacked in Landau’s favor despite an “objectively better and higher competing bid” from another private equity investor that would have provided more money to creditors. Genesis said in its statement that Landau’s group had increased its bid during the auction.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and two other senators last month asked the U.S. Trustee’s Office to intervene in the case, out of concern that “individuals who already own or control Genesis are trying to sell it to themselves, wiping away legal and other creditor debts in the process.” Lawyers representing those in charge of the auction did not respond to a request for comment.
Families of former Genesis residents said they fear the capacity to purge lawsuits through bankruptcy emboldens nursing home owners who provide deficient care.
“They can file bankruptcy again,” said Gabe Betancourt, whose wife, Nellie, died after her stay at Uptown Rehabilitation Center in Albuquerque. “And we’re the ones that will pay for it, with our memories, our lives.”
“It’s almost two years now,” Gabe Betancourt says of the death of his wife, Nellie. “When you sleep with somebody for 67 years and you stretch your arm, she’s there. There’s no way I will ever forget her.” (Adria Malcolm for KFF Health News)

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Refugee resettlement fell sharply in South Dakota during the last federal fiscal year, and no refugees have arrived in the state during the past 11 months, according to the agency that manages the program.
A new report from Lutheran Social Services of South Dakota says 149 refugees resettled in the state during the 2025 fiscal year that ended in September, down from 391 in 2024. Nationally, refugee arrivals fell from 100,034 to 38,102.


Lutheran Social Services has overseen refugee resettlement in the state for the past 25 years and works alongside the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and Department of State. Rebecca Kiesow-Knudsen is the group’s president and CEO.
“We work with those federal partners to provide assistance to arrivals,” she said. “From the day the door to the plane opens, we are trying to work with that individual or that family to make sure that they are successful in their new community.”
Lutheran Social Services helps refugees find employment, housing and education. It also provides cultural education programming, English language training and legal services.
Refugees are people who flee their country to escape war, natural disaster, or persecution.
“Those refugee populations, if you look over the course of history, are always based on where the conflicts are in the international community,” Kiesow-Knudsen said. “It always shifts based on global conflict.”
The president decides how many refugees the nation accepts. President Joe Biden established the admissions cap for fiscal year 2025 at 125,000 refugees.
President Donald Trump set the lowest admissions cap in U.S. history for the current fiscal year at 7,500, and said those admission will be allocated primarily to white South Africans of European descent, who are known as Afrikaners.
That’s why Kiesow-Knudsen doesn’t expect to see many new refugee arrivals to the state any time soon.
“If there’s a case that is approved that has a connection to South Dakota, we might see an arrival,” she said.


Many of the new arrivals to South Dakota between October 2024 and September 2025 are Somalian or Congolese. Millions of people from countries in central and east Africa have been displaced due to conflict, violence and environmental disasters.
Those displacement factors are just one part of how different populations come to resettle in South Dakota. The resettlement program has historically been a family reunification effort. The first piece of information the federal government looks for is family ties, according to Kiesow-Knudsen.
“They’re always looking for ways that they can help people be the most successful in integrating into the country,” she said. “What we know is that people are more successful if they’re close in proximity to your family members.”

Americans woke up on Jan. 3, 2025, to blaring headlines: “US CAPTURES MADURO, TRUMP SAYS,” declared The New York Times, using all capital letters. The U.S. had mounted an overnight military raid in Venezuela that immediately raised questions of procedure and legality. Prime among them was what role Congress had – or should have had – in the operation.
Politics editor Naomi Schalit interviewed political scientist Sarah Burns, author of the book “The Politics of War Powers” and an expert at Rochester Institute of Technology on the historical struggle between Congress and U.S. presidents over who has the power to authorize military action.
Is this a war?
I wouldn’t call it a war. This is regime change, and whether or not it has a positive impact on the United States, whether or not it has a positive impact on Venezuela, I think the likelihood is very low for both of those things being true.
How does Congress see its role in terms of military action initiated by the United States?
Congress has been, in my view, incredibly supine. But that’s not just my word. Having said that, it is true that Congress – in the House, predominantly – tried to pass a war powers act recently, saying that President Donald Trump was not allowed to do any action against Venezuela, and that failed on very close votes.

So you see some effort on the part of Congress to assert itself in the realm of war. But it failed predominantly on party lines, with Democrats saying we really don’t want to go into Venezuela. We really don’t want to have this action. Republicans predominantly were supporting the president and whatever it happens to be that he would like to do. Moderate Republicans and Republicans who are in less safe districts were and are more likely to at least stand up a little bit to the president, but there’s a very small number of them.
So there may be an institutional role for Congress, a constitutional role, a role that has been confirmed by legal opinion, but politics takes over in Congress when it comes to asserting its power in this realm?
That’s a perfect way of putting it. They have a legal, constitutional, one might even say moral, responsibility to assert themselves as a branch, right? This is from Federalist 51 where James Madison says “Ambition must be made to counteract ambition.” So it should be that as a branch, they assert themselves against the president and say, “We have a role here.”
In the 1940s, presidential scholar Edward Corwin said that in the realm of foreign policy, it is an invitation for Congress and the president to struggle. So it should be that Congress and the president are struggling against each other to assert, “I’m in charge.” “No, I’m in charge.” “No, I’m in charge,” in an effort to create a balance between the two branches and between the two things that each of the branches does well. What you want from Congress is slow deliberation and a variety of opinions. What you want from the president is energy and dispatch.
So certainly, if we have an attack like 9/11, you would want the president to be able to act quickly. And you know, conversely, in situations like the questions around what the U.S. is doing in Venezuela, you want slow deliberation because there is no emergency that requires energy and dispatch and speed. So the president shouldn’t be entirely in the driver’s seat here, and Congress should very much be trying very hard to restrain him.
What power does Congress have to restrain him?
They have to pass legislation. They aren’t particularly well suited right now to passing legislation, so effectively there is not a very clear way for them to restrain the president.
One of the things that members of Congress have attempted to do several times, with very little positive impact, is go to the courts and say, “Can you restrain the president?” And political scientist Jasmine Farrier has written that the courts have regularly said to members of Congress: “You have the power to stop the president, and you are ineffective at that. And so if you want to stop the president, you shouldn’t turn to us. You should work together to create legislation that would restrain the president.”
What would such legislation do? Cut off money for troops? Is it finger-wagging, or is it something really concrete?
There are a few different tiers. Joint resolutions are finger-wagging. They just say, “Bad, Mr. President, don’t do that.” But they have no effect in law.
The War Powers Resolution, first passed in 1973, is a legitimate way of trying to restrain the president. Congress intended to say to presidents, “You cannot start a war and continue a war without our authorization.” But what they said instead was “You could have a small war or a short war – of 60 to 90 days – without our authorization, and then you have to tell us about it.” That just sort of said to presidents the opposite of what they intended. So President Barack Obama took advantage of that with the military engagement in Libya, as well as Trump in his first administration.
This is not a partisan issue. It’s not Republican presidents who do it. It’s not Democratic presidents who do it. It’s every president since the War Powers Resolution was passed, and the only time that Congress has drawn down troops or drawn down money was the Vietnam War.
Other than that disastrous war, we have not seen Congress willing to put themselves on the politically negative side, which is taking money away from the troops. Because if you take away money right now, they’re going to be harmed.
What is the War Powers Resolution?
The War Powers Resolution from 1973, also known as the War Powers Act, was Congress – during the Vietnam War – saying definitively to President Richard Nixon, “You have overstepped your bounds.” They had explicitly said in law, you cannot go into Cambodia. And Nixon went into Cambodia.
So that was their way of trying to reassert themselves very aggressively; as I mentioned before, it didn’t work effectively. It worked insofar as presidents don’t unilaterally start wars that are large scale, the way that World War II was large scale. But they do have these smaller actions at varying levels.
Then we get to 9/11 and we see the 2001 authorization for the use of military force, and the 2002 authorization for the use of military force. The 2001 law authorized going after anyone in al-Qaida and associated with 9/11. The 2002 authorization was directly related to Iraq, saying “There is a problem with Iraq, we have to do something.” Both of them were extremely vague and broad, and that’s why we’ve seen four presidents, including Trump, using the 2001 and 2002 authorizations to carry out all sorts of operations that had very little to do with Saddam Hussein or al-Qaida.
In 2021, senators Mike Lee, Bernie Sanders and Chris Murphy collectively got together and tried to create a national security document that would restrain presidential unilateralism. It was a good effort on the part of members of Congress from a variety of different ideological views to attempt to restrain the president. It did not even sort-of pass – it barely got out on the floor.
Since that time, we haven’t seen a lot of efforts from members of Congress. They haven’t really reasserted themselves since the war in Korea, which began in 1950. It’s very clear that ambition is no longer checking ambition the way that it was meant to by the founders.
When you woke up this morning and saw the news, what was your first thought?
Here we go again. This is not a Republican or a Democratic issue. Lots of presidents have made this error, which is that they think if you do this smaller-scale action, you are going to get a positive result for the nation, for the region, for international stability. And very rarely is that the case.

Delbert Hosemann, halfway through what may be their final terms, are not lame ducks yet, but they might need to prove their relevance.","Gov. Tate Reeves and Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann may not be lame ducks, but perhaps they could be described as limping ducks going into the 2026 legislative session that begins Tuesday.
Reeves and Hosemann, two of Mississippi’s most prominent politicians, could be nearing the end of long political careers where they have exercised significant influence. Reeves is in his sixth four-year term in statewide office, while Hosemann is in his fifth.
The 2026 session starts the second half of what could be their final four-year term.
Hosemann, 78, presides over the Senate and generally wields substantial power in the Capitol. He has in the past said he is considering a campaign for governor in 2027. But it is hard to believe he will enter the race if billionaire businessman Tommy Duff runs, as he is signaling he will do.
Term limits will prohibit Reeves from running again for governor, though he is only 51.
Lame duck refers to a politician who loses some clout because his term in office is ending. Generally speaking, the closer that prominent politicians, such as governor or lieutenant governor, get to the end of a final term, the less clout they enjoy, especially in the legislative process where power is often the key to getting things done.
Granted, Reeves and Hosemann, who have both been mainstays in Mississippi politics for going on a generation, might not be lame ducks yet, but a slight limp might be detectable. They might need to prove their relevance.
House Speaker Jason White, the third person in the triumvirate that sets the legislative agenda, most likely does not face similar issues.
White is in his first term as speaker, and, regardless, the office of speaker of the Mississippi House is not term-limited.
The fact that White does not face a lame duck situation puts him in a stronger position on what most likely will be the primary issues of the 2026 session, such as whether to expand the opportunities to provide public funds to private schools.
White is a staunch supporter of providing public funds to private schools, as is Reeves for that matter.
Hosemann has been less enthusiastic, but at times he has appeared to try to compromise on key issues instead of taking strong positions in opposition to White and the governor.
The demand by White and Reeves to phase out the income tax is an example where Hosemann was not as enamored with the proposal. Still, it could be argued that during the 2025 session the lieutenant governor essentially capitulated to the wishes of the speaker and of the governor to phase out the income tax.
Many believe Hosemann has been willing to compromise to ensure on some issues, like tax cuts, he would not be harmed in a Republican primary should he run for governor. In general terms, it is believed there are more voters in the Republican primary who favor cutting taxes and providing public funds to private schools.
But perhaps the data is not certain on the issue of school choice. When vouchers have been on the ballot in other states, even conservative states, they have been rejected. At the same time in the 2024 election where Kentucky voters were awarding pro-voucher Donald Trump a higher percentage of the vote than he received in Mississippi, they rejected a voucher proposal.
So, maybe being against providing public funds to private schools would not hurt Hosemann in a Republican primary.
And if Hosemann is ending his political career, he could have nothing to lose by using his influence to block the school choice proposals in the Senate.
Of course, the key then would be for Hosemann to withstand the woes of being a lame duck or at least a limping duck and prove that he still walks strong.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/01134620/3X0A6396.jpg,,,2026-01-04 07:11:40.487766

“We're coming back to the basic hierarchy of needs here,” said Rep. Theresa Wood, who chairs the House Committee on Human Services.

Theo Wells-Spackman is a Report for America corps member who reports for VTDigger.
Facing federal funding cuts and potentially faltering tax revenues ahead of this week’s legislative session, Vermont lawmakers say decisions over food and heating assistance programs serving their most vulnerable constituents will be particularly difficult.
“We’re coming back to the basic hierarchy of needs here,” said Rep. Theresa Wood, D-Waterbury, who chairs the House Committee on Human Services.
Food aid is among her highest priorities, Wood said. But both 3SquaresVT, Vermont’s version of the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and the state’s charitable food system have been significantly impacted by federal cuts in recent months.
In 2025, 3SquaresVT incorporated a host of tightened restrictions following the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in July. Work requirements have been expanded, a number of categories of noncitizens have been excluded from the program, and new financial burdens have been placed on individual states. 
Vermont will be responsible for more than $8 million in new administrative costs, with millions more in possible penalties under a new accuracy enforcement system. Should the administration make errors according to the program’s rules just 1% more frequently than it did last year, the state could be required to contribute over $7 million to the cost of benefits next year.
Meanwhile, support from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Federal Emergency Management Agency has dried up for local food providers, causing layoffs and reductions in service across the state.
“The federal government’s lack of human compassion is just beyond belief,” said Sen. Ginny Lyons, D-Chittenden Southeast, of the fallout from July’s federal funding law.
Lyons, who chairs the Senate Committee on Health and Welfare, agreed that nutrition assistance is an essential issue going into the session.
“We need to provide food — we need to ensure that SNAP continues,” she said.
The Vermont Foodbank has requested an allocation of $5 million from the Legislature to fund its farm-focused Vermonters Feeding Vermonters program and generally support its network of services.
“What we are seeing is this continued need for support beyond what philanthropy is able to do,” said Carrie Stahler, the Foodbank’s government and public affairs officer.
Stahler said 3SquaresVT has never been available to everyone in the state who needs help with food. But after thousands more Vermonters lost access to the program this fall or became subject to new requirements in order to be eligible, the nutrition assistance system is more important than ever.
Wood said she expects the Vermont Department for Children and Families, which administers 3SquaresVT, to include the program’s new state-level costs in its budget later this month. While she supports full funding for 3SquaresVT, the Foodbank’s request is one of a number of similar pleas to her committee.
“They’re not all going to be able to be met,” she said, adding that her committee is “going to be careful in doing our due diligence.”
Lyons expressed a desire to redirect or generate more funds for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance program, or LIHEAP, which President Donald Trump’s administration has indicated it wants to eliminate. The state’s Public Utility Commission recommended that the Legislature increase funding for heating assistance in an energy cost study last month to shore up the state’s crisis fuel service, and to prepare for potential federal cuts to the program.
The commission suggested raising the existing fuel tax slightly to partially cover the measure, which Lyons said she supports. But Wood urged caution on increasing funds for programs like LIHEAP, saying that this year, there likely won’t be room in the budget.
“We have many things to balance,” she said. “We have to be strategic.”
Housing, a major priority for Wood’s committee, continues to demand attention and funding. In addition to ongoing disagreement over the state’s motel program, Vermont’s housing authorities requested $18 million this fall to fund the state’s Section 8 voucher program after federal cuts left a number of organizations across the state facing shortfalls.
And health care, particularly in a moment where Vermonters face skyrocketing premiums and an increasing state cost burden, will be near the top of Wood’s agenda too.
Sen. Andrew Perchlik, D/P-Washington, who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, said that last year’s buffer against federal cuts would potentially be a difficult model to replicate this year. One-time allocations in general, he said, could be in short supply, including to individual organizations like the Vermont Foodbank. 
Tax revenue slumps in recent months are a concern for lawmakers, Perchlik said. Though nothing is set in stone, he continued, it seems unlikely that the Legislature will have the same scale of tax surplus to use at its discretion, particularly in light of Gov. Phil Scott’s desire to buy down property taxes.
“It’s not clear we’ll have any of that money,” Perchlik said. “It’s definitely going to be more difficult.”

Amelia Cunningham is a reporter with the Community News Service, part of the University of Vermont’s journalism internship for Bradford Journal Opinion.
CORINTH — At the end of a long, wood-lined road in Corinth, Kathy Chapman’s studio stands nestled among the trees. The modest workspace — with panoramic views of the surrounding forest — serves as a quiet refuge from the outside world for the stained-glass artist.
Inside, a wood-fired stove keeps the workshop at a comfortable temperature even with snow outside. The studio’s walls are filled with art of different mediums, including a large array of stained glass projects. 
Chapman is a stained-glass artist and painter, originally from Brooklyn, New York. She grew up spending her summers at Lake Morey and then relocated to Vermont in 1984, after graduating from college. 
Chapman has always considered herself an artist, but she began working in stained glass restoration about 30 years ago. Along with restorations, she also makes acrylic paintings and custom stained-glass windows, available by commission. 
For Chapman, starting a new painting is the best part of the creative process. She described the feeling as “pure excitement.” 
“Something always happens,” she said. “Even if it’s terrible, you turn it around, put it upside down, and keep going until something speaks to you.”
Chapman prioritizes creativity over perfection, embracing a process that often leaves her paintings feeling deliberately “in progress.” This culminates in a corner of her studio she affectionately calls “painting heaven,” where unfinished paintings are lovingly stacked. 
“Sometimes you just get tired of something and want to move on,” she said. “Later, when I’m in a different headspace, I’ll pull one out, turn it around, and start again.” 
While painting gives Chapman a sense of creative freedom, stained glass forces her to slow down and really think about each piece. 
“Stained glass is a real process art,” she said. “You’ve got to make a map, you want to make sure everything is the best it can be before you assemble it.”

This contrast is evident in Chapman’s studio. 
On her worktable, pieces of a soon-to-be church window sit carefully arranged. For restorations, there is no space for “figuring it out.” Once a piece is cut and fired, it cannot be changed. 
Chapman didn’t originally set out to be a stained glass artist. About 30 years ago, a friend and local stained glass artist, Greg Gorman, needed help removing a large rose window from the upper level of a church for restoration. Chapman offered to help.
“It was a total restoration,” she said. “We took it apart piece by piece, and I just loved it.” 
At the time, there were very few people in the region doing large-scale stained glass restorations, a gap that fostered a strong working relationship between Gorman and Chapman. 
For about a decade, Chapman worked out of Gorman’s studio in Lyme, practicing and perfecting her craft. Gorman saw something special in her work. 
“I’m a big fan of hers,” he said. “Her stained glass and painting definitely feed each other. You can always tell it’s the same person.” 
In 2002, Chapman started working out of her own private studio, which greatly influenced her work. The solitude of her studio reshaped her creative process, allowing her to fully immerse herself in her art.
Chapman has lived happily in Vermont since her early 20s. The quiet, nature, and tranquility have all become essential parts of her practice. 
“I live a quiet life,” she says. “It’s easy to be alone out here. I have friends who rescue me from myself when I need it, but mostly I’m very happy being home.” 
Her quiet routines allow her the room to create art as she wishes. Her lifestyle and way of living are an intrinsic part of the art she creates. 
Although Chapman works in isolation, her restorations live in places that are the exact opposite. Chapman’s “bread and butter,” as she puts it, is doing restoration projects for local churches and common spaces, places that are key meeting points for the community. Churches in the area reach out to Chapman when their centuries-old windows need to be cleaned, repainted, and rebuilt. 
These projects are often long and slow. Chapman just finished her fourth year working on a project for the Waterbury United Church of Christ. By next spring, she will have completed the fifth and final window for the church, marking five years spent on the project. 
“For me, that feels like an accomplishment,” she said, “because then [the windows] are good for another hundred years.” 
Chapman’s quiet, solitary life is essential to her craft, but her friendships, she says, are just as important to her practice. 
Amy Peberdy, a fellow artist and longtime friend of Chapman, occasionally helps out in her studio. 
“There’s a real humanity in [Chapman’s art],” Peberdy said. “Mostly what her artwork is saying to the world is to just relax and try to get along.” 
This throughline isn’t always literal, but its tone is consistent through the quirky, slightly medieval, heavily painted art she creates. Chapman’s art is a reflection of the life she lives. A life filled with quiet beauty and art. 
“There’s a story in all of it,” said Chapman. “Even if people don’t see it, it’s there.”

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The fate of one lawmaker’s service in the Nebraska Legislature will likely be decided by yet-to-be-released evidence legislative leaders have said demonstrates a “pattern of behavior” warranting his expulsion.
The Legislature’s Executive Board, essentially its human resources department, unanimously recommended Dec. 13 that freshman State Sen. Dan McKeon of Amherst be expelled “in light of a demonstrated pattern of behavior … and not in response to a single isolated incident.” 
Discussion and a vote are expected early in the 2026 session, which begins Wednesday. The committee has not yet detailed the alleged “pattern.” McKeon, who denies wrongdoing, has made clear he has no intention of resigning.
A legislative staffer has accused McKeon of making “inappropriate contact with her buttocks with his hand, over the top of her clothing,” according to a Nebraska State Patrol report that a spokesman relayed.

The Nebraska Examiner reached out to McKeon’s 48 legislative colleagues in December. Of them, 11 said they supported or leaned in favor of expelling McKeon. Another 14 said they were undecided, most because they wanted to see what evidence the Exec Board had access to first.
Seven senators declined to comment, and 11 more did not return calls or messages seeking comment. 
Part of the struggle, some senators said, is the novelty of an expulsion vote, a rare legislative process that left many lawmakers saying they need to understand how it works and the possible ramifications.










You’re not a statesman. That’s a boor. That’s a 13 year old in a locker room, and he can’t seem to get it through his head that you can’t behave like that.


– State Sen. Kathleen Kauth


Expulsion requires at least 33 votes under the Nebraska Constitution. If successful, it would be the first in state history. In that case, Nebraska would hold a special election in November for the final two years of McKeon’s term. 
McKeon represents central Nebraska’s Legislative District 41 — Boone, Buffalo, Greeley, Hall, Howard, Sherman, Valley and Wheeler Counties. 
McKeon has said he thinks he has the legislative votes to stay, “but time will tell.” He was elected in 2024 with 52% of the vote.
Workplace behavior
State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of Omaha said she called McKeon the night the news of his criminal citation came in late October. She said she wanted to hear his side of what happened at an end-of-session party last May. She said McKeon’s story changed “within just a couple of minutes,” remarks Kauth described as a “lot of projecting, a lot of ‘I’m being a victim.’”
“Then I flat out asked him: Did you touch her?” Kauth recalled. “He said, ‘No.’ Five seconds later, he said, ‘Well, maybe I touched her shoulder.’ Five more seconds, he said, ‘Well, maybe I touched her back.’”
Immediately after, Kauth said, she told McKeon: “Dan, you need to resign.” 
Kauth is chair of the Legislature’s Business and Labor Committee, which oversees state labor laws, a committee on which McKeon sits.

State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln, addressing McKeon’s situation broadly, said he’s seen “consistent and persistent behavior” in the Legislature and a workplace generally that is “incredibly problematic.” 
He said normalization of “abhorrent” sexual harassment and inappropriate jokes, including in the halls of the Nebraska State Capitol, is “gross and frustrating,” adding, “We all need to do better.”
“We as senators all need to do better to hold each other accountable, to hold folks accountable, when we hear those jokes, hear those things, because they’re not funny, and they are inappropriate,” Dungan said at a pre-session Lincoln-area event.
‘A statesman’
McKeon’s attorney, Perry Pirsch, has said the senator’s actions were not sexually charged and noted McKeon has apologized and taken ownership of what they called a “joke.” Pirsch and McKeon, a former wrestling coach, have described the touch as a “pat on the back,” which McKeon said was “like a coach would do.”
The lawmaker from Amherst said he got his “marching orders” from the Executive Board and did everything they required him to do, including moving his office and attending sensitivity training.
McKeon rolls out character defenders amid groping allegation, calls to resign

The legislative staffer’s attorney, Kathleen Neary, has noted that her client is preparing a civil lawsuit against the Amherst lawmaker. Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, a Republican, and multiple state senators have said McKeon should resign. 
McKeon initially tried to plead “no contest” to a misdemeanor disturbing the peace charge in Lancaster County, a plea to accept the punishment but not admit guilt. But shortly after the Exec Board recommended expulsion, he filed to plead not guilty and decided to fight.
McKeon “categorically rejects” the committee’s claim and last week described the push for his removal as a “political game.”
“I think we need a breath of fresh air in Lincoln … that’s what I was trying to bring to the table,” McKeon said Dec. 30 at a small news conference in Cairo, Nebraska. “Somebody that’s a statesman is in there, and they don’t like it.” 
‘Bare minimum standards’
State Sens. Carolyn Bosn and Jason Prokop, both of Lincoln, said at the same mid-December event as Dungan that it’s a privilege to serve in the Legislature and that lawmakers have duties and standards to uphold. 
State Sen. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln. Dec. 18, 2023. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
They said those responsibilities include respecting staff and the institution.
“When those bare minimum standards cannot be followed, I think it sets a precedent. I think it’s disrespectful to each other, to the institution, and I think that creates a real problem,” Bosn said.
Said Prokop: “The Nebraska Legislature is just an amazing representation of the people of Nebraska, and we have to do all we can to make sure that we are maintaining that strong reputation. I’m also supportive of removing those that don’t live up to that expectation.”
‘Altar of political expediency and correctness’
Pirsch, McKeon’s attorney, said in a Friday statement that any legislator who would vote to expel a colleague based on a “disputed factual narrative” and a charge of “only” disturbing the peace is “setting a dangerous precedent.”
“If a contested disturbing the peace [charge] is the new standard of conduct for legislators, all our representatives are at risk for wrongful expulsion,” Pirsch said.










I think we need a breath of fresh air in Lincoln … that’s what I was trying to bring to the table. Somebody that’s a statesman is in there, and they don’t like it.


– State Sen. Dan McKeon


NU Regent O’Connor resigning, effective Jan. 9, in wake of DUI allegation, possible impeachment

Pirsch said he can appreciate the Exec Board’s “desire” to advance the incident “for political purposes” but that McKeon’s district shouldn’t lose voice because of “a bad pun and a pat on the back.”
Pillen would appoint a successor for McKeon’s district through the end of the year if he resigns or is removed from office.
“I am confident there are enough senators of sufficient intellect not to sacrifice the legitimacy of the body on the altar of political expediency and correctness,” Pirsch said. “Senator McKeon looks forward to putting the distraction behind him and moving forward with the legitimate business of the State of Nebraska and the constituents of LD 41.”
‘You can’t behave like that’
Kauth and others say the allegation from a staffer is only part and not all of what concerns them. State Sen. Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue, for instance, said that had McKeon faced just a “he said, she said” allegation, he’d be more inclined to support a letter of reprimand or censure, short of expulsion. 
State Sen. Jason Prokop of Lincoln. Jan. 28, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
But Holdcroft said his understanding is that more has happened, so he’s leaning in favor based on what he’s heard, but he hasn’t seen full details, so he said it’s “tough” to comment.
Kauth was the first to publicly describe a pattern of “inappropriate” comments by McKeon, including comments she said were “sexually laced,” “double entendres” or “totally off base.” She said she’s interrupted some of his comments in the past, including one she said McKeon made in Israel last fall in front of lawmakers from around the country.
There’s a line, Kauth said of the moment in Israel, yet McKeon “just leaped right over it.” She said some “jokes” might be funny in a locker room, “but we’re not in a locker room.”
Kauth said she could not recall the exact incident in Israel, saying his remarks occur “so frequently” it’s hard to remember each.
“His response is always, ‘I’m just joking,’” Kauth said. “You’re not a statesman. That’s a boor. That’s a 13 year old in a locker room, and he can’t seem to get it through his head that you can’t behave like that. Then you behave like that to a subordinate, to a staffer who is in the building, that is wholly inappropriate.”

McKeon, in a Dec. 17 statement, said he would try to watch future comments, “but I might still occasionally have a bad joke slip out, and those who are eggshells should avoid me, not engage me in conversation.”

Lawmakers could have faced a second historic vote in 2026: the possible impeachment and ouster of University of Nebraska Regent Elizabeth O’Connor of Omaha, a Democrat, who faces a felony charge for allegedly driving drunk in May 2025 and seriously injuring another. 
She announced her resignation after the Examiner had started asking lawmakers their thoughts on McKeon and O’Connor.
Kauth has said she was ready to begin impeachment proceedings, but O’Connor’s last day is Friday. Pillen will appoint O’Connor’s successor, and a special election will be held this year.
State Sen. Dave Murman of Glenvil noted that McKeon faces a misdemeanor charge not “even remotely as serious” as the felony charge O’Connor faces. The Nebraska Constitution bars convicted felons from holding public office.
Murman said he would oppose expulsion if it were based on just the misdemeanor allegation. So, Murman said he needs to understand what evidence supports an alleged “pattern of behavior.”
Fear for the ‘political minority’
State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln, who declined to speak with the Examiner regarding O’Connor or McKeon, said at the Lincoln-area pre-session event that it would be “reckless” to prejudge a situation without a public hearing or a fuller understanding.
State Sens. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln and Ben Hansen of Blair. April 10, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Now entering her 12th year as a lawmaker, Conrad said she fears legislative processes, including impeachment or expulsion, could be “weaponized” against a political minority. 
She said she doesn’t trust the “good judgment” of a majority of lawmakers.
“I think it’s incumbent upon all of us, if we believe in fair play, that we do extend a presumption of innocence and due process, even to the accused in very unsavory and untenable situations,” Conrad said Dec. 18. “Because otherwise, a political mob can run roughshod over the will of the voters and be weaponized against a political minority.”
McKeon has said expelling him would hurt the “will of the voters” who elected him.
State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha said she wants the process to play out but “certainly would welcome him [McKeon] resigning.” 
She said the conversation distracts from other issues, including executive branch proposals and additional budget cuts that she said could hurt Nebraskans with developmental or intellectual disabilities.
“There’s a lot of bad people doing bad things to people,” Cavanaugh said at the time.

State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha, a progressive who is the Legislature’s lone registered nonpartisan, offered a different take on what should happen in 2026.
Said Hunt: “I agree that we should go into the new year with a clean slate, and the best thing for the future of Nebraskans and for integrity of our institutions would be for everyone in the Legislature to resign, and the board of regents and the governor and the attorney general.”
Exec Board’s recommendation
Lawmakers said they expect the Executive Board’s details to come to light in the coming weeks as McKeon plans to fight. Many suggested it will get worse for McKeon if he doesn’t resign. McKeon, a former sports official, has suggested the opposite and said his colleagues don’t have all the facts.
State Sens. Jane Raybould of Lincoln and Jana Hughes of Seward based their support or leaning support, respectively, partially on the Exec Board’s unanimous recommendation. Both noted that those representatives, appointed by their legislative peers, are privy to more information.
“I think he [McKeon] needs to step down,” said Hughes. “I’m hoping he will do that before we actually have to do an LR [legislative resolution] and have a hearing and then have a vote.”










I think it's incumbent upon all of us, if we believe in fair play, that we do extend a presumption of innocence and due process, even to the accused in very unsavory and untenable situations.

Of the nine voting members on the Exec Board, six said they would vote the same if and when expulsion comes to the floor, including Speaker of the Legislature John Arch, who sets the legislative calendar. One committee member could not be reached to confirm their position. 
State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, Exec Board chair, said he advanced the recommendation because McKeon deserves “his day in legislative court.” He is one of two Exec Board members who said they would keep an open mind. Hansen says he wants to hear from the full Legislature first.
State Sen. Mike Jacobson of North Platte added in a text: “Will need to see what the future brings, nothing certain. Keeping an open mind.”
‘We’re all very disappointed’
Kauth said lawmakers need to be role models, including in every action and speech.
“We should know better, especially [because] we’re the ones making the laws,” Kauth said. “If we choose not to follow those laws, that is absolutely inexcusable.”

State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston, a former member of the Exec Board and former chair of the Business and Labor Committee, said people “have to have faith in certain groups” and said he assumes his former committee did its diligent work, including with the advice of legal counsel. 
He said he still wants to hear all the facts.
“I think it goes without saying, we’re all very disappointed that this is something that we have to deal with. We shouldn’t have to deal with these things,” Riepe said. “It’s supposed to be a ladies’ and gentlemen’s club, and people need to behave and respond and act accordingly.”

Leveraging a “housing crisis” to scrap environmental protection or other community values makes no sense at all.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Michael Long: Streamlining housing permits shouldn’t sideline the public.","Dear Editor,
The permitting and appeals process for housing and other development in Vermont should be streamlined. Legal challenges can be lengthy, expensive and onerous, and delay is often the central — and winning — strategy. But projects can be challenged, successfully or not, only by parties with substantial funding and sustained commitment. That reality leaves much of the public on the sidelines, even though public policy should serve the public interest first.
From that perspective, expediting disputes makes sense. What does not make sense is leveraging a “housing crisis” to discard environmental protections or other community values. For every worthy project ultimately derailed by appeals under the current system, there may be a deeply flawed project that proceeds unchallenged. Developers with the resources to raise millions and the sophistication to tap tax dollars or credits are rarely stymied by the permit process. More often, they benefit from a judicial and political environment that is more accommodating than it should be.
The Burlington Square Mall redevelopment illustrates the risk. When the project first surfaced, City Hall effectively transformed its planning department into an advocate and accessory for the developer, abandoning its role as a guide and regulator in the public interest. The result was a prolonged pit, lasting social and economic harm, and a development delayed far longer than necessary.
Reforming the regulatory system to facilitate housing development is a worthy goal. But sidelining the public — and the public interest — in the name of a housing crisis is not.

Olympian Ben Ogden “just might be on the verge of taking American cross-country skiing where it hasn’t been before,” the New York Times recently reported. His hometown of Landgrove, population 177, knows how he got there.

University of Vermont graduate Ben Ogden — a two-time NCAA Nordic champion, 2022 Olympian and 2023’s fastest young male World Cup sprinter — “just might be on the verge of taking American cross-country skiing where it hasn’t been before,” the New York Times recently reported.
“He’s never really seen a race where he doesn’t want to burn from the beginning,” the Times wrote of Ogden’s “full-gas-from-the-start style” and “caution-to-the-wind fearlessness.”
But while the media is focusing on the skier’s future ahead of next month’s 2026 Winter Olympics in Italy, longtimers in the 25-year-old’s hometown of Landgrove, population 177, are pointing to his family’s pioneering past.
A century ago, the athlete’s great-grandfather, Samuel Robinson Ogden, was a young New Jersey visitor when he happened upon the Bennington County hamlet’s once desolate central village just before the 1929 stock market crash.
“The whole aspect was sad and dispiriting,” the man now called “Big Sam” went on to write in a memoir. “But I had some experience at fixing over old houses, and I could see possibilities.”

Buying 15 buildings for $4,500, Sam relocated his family to Landgrove and restored the properties. Upon his death a half-century later in 1985, the 88-year-old was remembered as a championing Town Meeting moderator, state House representative, author and columnist, supporter of the fledgling ski industry and a founder of such institutions as the Vermont Symphony Orchestra.
“The consequences of his work can be seen all over contemporary Vermont, though his significance lies as much on what he represented as what he did,” present-day historian Paul Searls has written. “He embodied the paradoxes and conundrums of a state struggling to reconcile the contradictory goals of embracing the modern world while trying to preserve what was best about Vermont tradition.”
Ben knows his great-grandfather through Searls’ book, “Repeopling Vermont: The Paradox of Development in the Twentieth Century.”
“On the one hand, I think it’s kind of cool,” the Olympian, taking a break for an interview, says of his ancestor’s tale of resuscitating a once ailing town.
On the other, Ben isn’t a newcomer like Sam. The self-described “native” views his environs with a different eye.
“I grew up seeing a lot of second homes, which was a confusing thing,” Ben says of a community where 60% of residences are part-time properties. “It’s sort of a waste that there are all these nice houses where Vermonters could live.”
And so the skier — striving, like the state, to push forward without careening off course — faces the same question his great-grandfather posed in a 1963 Vermont planning report: “How are we to get along in the modern world without sacrificing the values and assets we treasure most dearly?”
‘A bundle of contradictions’ 
Sam, born just after the first modern Olympics in 1896, grew up amid the dawn of the automobile and airplane, only to ship off during college to serve in World War I. Awarded France’s Croix de Guerre for heroism, he returned home at age 22 to his father’s insurance and real estate firm. But amid the progress and prosperity of the Roaring ’20s, he yearned for something simpler.
“I felt an intense revulsion for the life we had been living in the city,” Sam went on to write in one of more than half-dozen books he released between 1942 and 1978. “I scorned the rut that we all were in, the absence of real joy, the futility of boredom-inspired cocktail parties. I swore that we were but pawns in the uncreative game known as ‘keeping up with the Joneses.’”
That’s when Sam discovered Landgrove, founded in 1780 but at risk of disincorporation before he settled there in the spring of 1930. With few other residents other than his wife, Mamie, he became a jack of all trades: Blacksmith, selectboard member, justice of the peace, overseer of the poor and, in his most documented role, self-contrarian.
Sam Ogden (second in back row) joins other state officials in a Burlington Free Press photo of April 4, 1940.
A proponent of preservation, Sam fought road plans for a Green Mountain Parkway in the 1930s and, after serving in World War II, pushed to prohibit billboards in the 1940s — two decades before the state adopted a 1968 ban.
“Country living seems to me to erect bulwarks against the mistakes and follies of the age,” the man who helped create the Vermont Natural Resources Council wrote in 1946.
Then again, Sam promoted tourism by helping found Vermont Life magazine and fostered the now billion-dollar ski industry by aiding in the installation of the first rope tow at the Bromley ski area in 1938 and the first chair lift at what’s now the Stowe Mountain Resort in 1940.
Sam acknowledged his dueling dualities.
“The winter season has become the liveliest season of all, and prosperity and increased tax revenues have made the lot of the remote towns and their citizens seem to be much more satisfactory,” he wrote in a 1967 newspaper column. “But there are times when doubts creep into my mind, and, mind you, this is the mind of one who has played some part in the development of winter sports in Vermont.”

Searls, a professor at Vermont State University, points out more paradoxes in his “Repeopling Vermont” book. It chronicles Sam’s connections with both the “most significant efforts to simultaneously preserve yet improve Vermont” and “essentially all of the state’s most important figures,” starting with governors from George Aiken in the 1930s to Philip Hoff in the 1960s.
“Ogden cherished small-town democracy, but he acted on a statewide scale to see decisions ever more determined by centralized bureaucracies,” Searls writes. “He wanted to protect the landscape built by state residents, but encouraged and enabled its change, much for the use of outsiders. He was enamored with the people he first found in Landgrove, yet shaped the town in a way that made it so those people were progressively scarce.”
That said, the historian extends Sam more credit than blame.
“There are no villains in this story, least of all Sam Ogden, who devoted himself to the good of the state and the town he loved,” Searls writes. “Anyone who was that much of a bundle of contradictions deserves association with a state defined by its ongoing struggle to find balance between contradictory impulses.”
That challenge, the historian says, is held in Vermont’s motto: Freedom and Unity.
‘Getting to the top’
Sam had children, one of them Samuel III, who had children, one of them John, who had children, one of them Ben.
Like his great-grandfather, Ben’s a paradox. Each winter he travels the world to blaze trails on skis. Come spring, summer and fall, he roots himself in his hometown, where he learned his sport from his father.
John Ogden, a Middlebury College racer, raised Ben and siblings Katharine and Charlotte as he coached a local youth league named after friend and fellow Vermonter Bill Koch, the first American man to win a Nordic Olympic medal.
John saw his son win a first-ever U.S. men’s youth medal (silver in the team relay) at the 2018 World Junior Ski Championships, a gold in the same event in 2019, a slot at the 2022 Olympics and, finally, the World Cup’s 2023 green bib award for fastest male Nordic skier under age 23.
John did so as he battled cancer for a decade before his death in 2023 at age 56.

“In lieu of flowers, John’s request was that everyone spend a little extra time outside, be it on foot, on a bike, or on skis, in his honor,” his family wrote in his obituary.
Plowing ahead amid adversity can be painful, but Ben has plenty of practice. A member of Stratton’s SMS T2 elite training team, he prepares physically and mentally to push forward no matter what.
“It can be really hard to keep your eye on the prize, so I think about the next section of the race instead of dwelling on the whole thing,” the skier says of overcoming midcourse obstacles. “If I’m on a big hill, I think about getting to the top. After that, I might get a bit of a break and can think about the next thing.”
Following his own advice, Ben returned to World Cup racing the winter after his father’s death and landed on the podium for the first time. He punctuated his third-place finish in the skate-sprint with a celebratory backflip.
‘My great discovery’
Ben’s ability to rise above runs back generations. After Sam’s wife of 51 years died suddenly on Christmas 1971, the family patriarch fell into depression and attempted to take his life.
“It was in the hospital that I made my great discovery,” Sam wrote in a subsequent New York Times column in 1973. “I discovered that all the values which my unbearable grief had twisted into a pattern of evil could be set aright once I looked at them through Mamie’s eyes; and this, by the grace of God, I managed to do. Now I resolved to live with as much joy as I could accomplish, doing the things that I knew she would want me to do.”
Sam lived a dozen more years before his death at Bennington’s Vermont Veterans’ Home in 1985.
“I hope,” he wrote in his last book in 1978, “that the denizens of Landgrove will hang on; nay, more than that, will, in fact, construct a community whose brightness will shed light on other places, a light which may be ever increasing, infectious and contagious, for if this world is to be saved, this is the sort of thing which will have to happen more and more frequently.”

Travel to Landgrove today and you won’t see many gathering spots along the main dirt road, save the 1874 Farmers and Mechanics Hall turned municipal office. But there you’ll learn the town consistently reports the highest voter turnout in the state (87.97% in 2024, topped only by Andover’s 88.65% and Ripton’s 88.36%).
Interest in Landgrove’s current favorite son is equally high, and not just because seemingly everyone is a descendant of Big Sam or knows Ben’s mother, Andrea, the town’s treasurer, assistant clerk and trustee of public funds.
Andrea is one of many with a sense of humor when talking about Ben. She’s happy, for example, to spur him to recount how he wore “wind briefs” underwear during his first major 50K race, only to learn how freezing cold and breathable fabric can lead to, in his words, “two hours of horrendous discomfort.”
U.S. and SMS T2 teammate Jessie Diggins, the most decorated American cross-country skier in history, adds that she offers support by gilding Ogden’s mustache (so signature, it’s part of his YouTube channel logo) with red and blue glitter.
When home, Ben unwinds by rebuilding a 1973 Land Rover he completely dismantled years ago. 
“It started as a little project,” he says, “that has really spiraled out of control.”
A 2022 UVM engineering graduate with master’s credits, Ben says his “pipe dream” is to someday work for a company like South Burlington’s Beta Technologies.
“Vermont is not a great place to start a corporation that gigantic,” he says, “but they’re just doing it because they believe in the state and the people and the culture, and that, to me, is incredibly inspiring.”
The feeling is hereditary. Back in 1967, Sam chronicled life in a book of poems titled “Vermont’s Year.” It opens with a verse about navigating January snow:
… Each advance that now I make
Is but a single pace,
The next unmade, unknown:
Each step my ultimate …

(Photo by Sonny Albarado/Arkansas Advocate)Building a maximum-security, 3,000-bed prison was supposed to be a crowning achievement for Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders as she touts her bonafides as a law-and-order Republican.
Debate over the project is instead casting a shadow on this year’s primary elections and legislative session, with a special election this week in the Senate district where the project is planned.
That election kicks off what’s already expected to be a busy year for Arkansas politics and government, where Democrats hope to make inroads. It could also test just how deep President Donald Trump’s support reverberates in what’s been friendly territory for him.
Here’s a look at some of the biggest stories that will be shaping the year:
Franklin County prison blues
Sanders has shown no signs of backing down from the Franklin County prison site, citing the need to ease the backlog of state prisoners in local jails. But local leaders have said they were blindsided by the plans and that they don’t believe there’s infrastructure for such a facility.
Tuesday’s special legislative primaries could provide an early look at how much local backlash to the prison project could mobilize voters.
Five candidates are vying for the Republican nomination to fill the remaining term of the late Sen. Gary Stubblefield, who was an outspoken critic of the prison project. All five GOP hopefuls and an independent candidate running for the seat in March oppose Franklin County being the prison site.
At least two more opponents of the prison plan — Sens. Bryan King and Ron Caldwell — also will be fending off challenges in the March primary.
The elections lead into this year’s fiscal session, where another fight could be on the way over funding for moving forward with the prison’s construction. The big question is whether it will face another legislative roadblock.
Keeping it fiscal
The prison isn’t the only uncertainty about this year’s legislative session, which is intended to focus on budget issues.
Just a day after the March primary, lawmakers launch their pre-session budget hearings that could indicate how much of a strain Trump’s cuts may create.
It’s also unknown whether Sanders, who has called for eliminating the states’ income tax, will push for another cut or wait. 
Democrats’ bumpy inroads
This year’s election will be the latest bid by Democrats to prove they can make inroads in a firmly red state.
The party is trying to cut into Republicans’ supermajority in both chambers of the Legislature. The GOP right now can easily pass most appropriations bills without needing a single vote from Democrats.
But the party is also hoping to prove competitive in some of the top races, though it remains a longshot.
The top of the ticket is Hallie Shoffner, the farmer and Democrat who’s trying to unseat Republican U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton. Shoffner faces an uphill battle against Cotton as she hammers him over the impact Trump’s tariffs have on farmers.
The Trump factor
The impact of Trump’s policy changes from his tariffs to the Medicaid cuts included in the “Big Beautiful Bill” will also come into starker terms.
That’s especially true with the premium hikes that took effect in the new year following lawmakers’ inability to extend Obamacare subsidies that would have lessened the burden.
Arkansas is a state that Trump won easily each time he ran for president, and the state’s GOP officials have shown little sign of distancing themselves from him. But 2026 could offer a new test on just how solid that support for Trump will remain.
Setting the stage for ’28, ’30
This year could provide some sign of whether Sanders and Cotton are laying the groundwork for 2028 even as they fend off challenges in the midterms. 
With regular appearances on Fox News and a State of the Union rebuttal under her belt, Sanders has been maintaining her national profile ever since taking office. Cotton remains a staunch ally of Trump who also kept his media appearances busy.
The future of three-term Republican U.S. Sen. John Boozman could shake up Arkansas politics if he opts against seeking another term. 
But the year also provides some indication of what races remain on the minds of the state’s other top officials.

Sen. Doug McCrory, House Speaker Matt Ritter, Mayor Arunan Arulampalam and Hartford City Council President Shirley Surgeon were all in attendance, as was Sonserae Cicero, the director of a Hartford nonprofit who had just signed a $475,000 contract to help run the new economic development initiative. 
The Democratic leaders said the program, which was launched in partnership with another nonprofit called Upper Albany Main Street, would serve as a lifeline for small minority-owned businesses in Hartford’s north end by providing them with training and up to $15,000 in grant money. 
“These dollars will not only pave the path for new businesses to grow and thrive; it will ensure that our merchants have the support, technology and resources to stick around for years to come,” Surgeon, the council president, said. 
Fast forward a year, however, and everything has changed. 
Cicero’s contract with the city has been cancelled, the entire program is on hold and the roughly two dozen small businesses that signed up for training are left questioning whether they will receive any of the grant money that was promised. 
All of the hopes that state and local officials had for the program quickly fell apart in August after it became apparent that a federal grand jury was examining the relationship between Cicero and McCrory and investigating several of Cicero’s businesses, which operate under different versions of the name SHEBA.

The small businesses that signed up for the program, meanwhile, have become collateral damage in the ongoing criminal probe. 
Several entrepreneurs who completed the small business program this fall said they were still waiting to learn when they will receive their $15,000 grants.
Tahara Chapman, the owner of a company called High Maintenance, a boutique clothing and hair shop along Albany Avenue, said she did everything that was asked of her during the program. 
She attended courses led by Upper Albany Main Street about how to use Excel and Powerpoint. She created a business plan with SHEBA. And she ended the program by presenting that plan during a business “pitch” competition.  
But since then, Chapman said, she’s been left in the dark. 
“I don’t know what’s going on in the background, but I did what I was supposed to do,” she said. 
Merice Bryan, who is trying to start her own health care business called Best Practices Home Care, said she is in the same position — left to wonder when, or if, the grant money will materialize. 
“I worked very hard and spent a lot of hours going through the program, and I am counting on that money to build my business,” Bryan said. 
How the SHEBA contract fell apart 
How Cicero’s nonprofit ended up winning — and abruptly losing — the nearly half-million-dollar contract in Hartford is a complicated tale that stretches back more than three years.

Cicero did not respond to repeated emails, phone calls and text messages for this story. And McCrory has repeatedly declined to comment on the ongoing federal investigation. 
But the Connecticut Mirror retraced the decisions that led to Hartford awarding the lucrative contract to SHEBA by combing through thousands of records that were seized by the FBI, interviewing officials who appropriated the federal funds and talking with several of the business owners that were supposed to benefit from that money. 
The story that emerged from that reporting involves a defunct state agency, McCrory redirecting money behind the scenes, concerns about Cicero “double dipping” into public funds and a last-minute plan to finally provide aid to the small businesses in Hartford. 
But it all starts in 2022 in the state legislature, where lawmakers were busy divvying up hundreds of millions of dollars in federal pandemic relief money. 
A flood of federal money
That year, state legislators had the unenviable task of deciding how to split up Connecticut’s $20 billion state budget while spending an additional $1.7 billion in federal funds from the American Rescue Plan Act, which was passed in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Gov. Ned Lamont and legislators from around the state submitted proposals for how to spend the additional money, and in May 2022, they passed a bill distributing the federal aid. 
Seventy million dollars was allocated to the governor’s workforce strategies. The state’s hospitality industry received $30 million. Another $10 million was budgeted for financial assistance to nursing homes. And a large number of smaller projects favored by state lawmakers were also bankrolled. 
Among those smaller allocations was $2 million for CT Next, a quasi-public agency that was created in 2015 to foster startup businesses in Connecticut. 
The bill didn’t specify how CT Next was supposed to use the money, but emails obtained by the CT Mirror show lawmakers, including Ritter, the House Speaker, earmarked the money for the Upper Albany Merchant’s Association, which operates under a nonprofit called Upper Albany Main Street. 
Ritter told the CT Mirror that the $2 million was meant to provide sorely needed financial assistance to small businesses in the predominantly Black community along Albany Avenue, which had struggled through the first two years of the pandemic. 
After the money was budgeted for CT Next, Ritter said, he was not involved in the discussions about how to structure the small business program. And, for a time, he heard very little about the $2 million that he helped to appropriate. 
That was until June 2023, when the speaker’s office began to receive complaints that the businesses along Albany Avenue had still not received the financial support that was promised.

Redirecting the funds
At that point, Marilyn Risi, who was the executive director of Upper Albany Main Street in 2023, contacted Ritter to inform him that her request for the federal money had been held up by state officials after more than a year of waiting.  
“The $2 million that you and Senator McCrory allocated for Upper Albany through CT Next was denied,” Marilyn Risi told Ritter in an email.  
“Could you let us know where that funding is and if it will become available?” she added. 
Risi’s email, which was forwarded to state officials by Ritter’s staff, set off a months-long conversation within several Connecticut agencies about what was prohibiting the state from releasing the money. 
Staff at the Department of Economic and Community Development, which was helping CT Next put together a plan for the federal funds, assured everyone that the money would be paid out as lawmakers intended. But in several other emails, DECD employees explained that there were a couple issues that were holding things up. 
The first problem was that CT Next initially planned to use the money to provide loans to the small businesses, which was considered a high-risk activity for the federal funds. 
And the other issue was that CT Next wanted to subgrant a large portion of the $2 million to other nonprofits, one of which was SHEBA. 
Records show that the leaders of CT Next’s board voted to award part of the $2 million to Cicero’s business shortly after the legislature appropriated the money in 2022, and by May 2023, CT Next’s executive director Onyeka Obiocha told state officials that McCrory authorized CT Next to allocate $350,000 of that money to SHEBA. 
“Senator McCrory is aware of and approved of the use of funds,” he wrote. 
Obiocha declined to comment for this story, and he referred any questions about CT Next’s intended use of the federal money to DECD. 
McCrory told the CT Mirror during a brief phone conversation in November that he had never heard of CT Next. 
But according to Risi, it was McCrory who introduced her to the staff at CT Next and proposed a partnership between SHEBA and Upper Albany Main Street. 
She said McCrory showed up at one of Upper Albany Main Street’s monthly meetings with Cicero to pitch the plan for the small business program. 
“Senator McCrory brought Sonserae Cicero to one of our meetings and stated we were going to be working with CT Next,” Risi told the CT Mirror in an interview. “We were supposed to contact small businesses that would be receiving loans and grants, provided that they would participate in seminars that (Cicero) was going to provide.”
Risi said she questioned, at the time, why Upper Albany Main Street needed to partner with Cicero on the small business training. And she pointed out that her organization already had an established relationship with the University of Hartford, which paired up college students with local businesses to help them with loan applications, creating business plans and budgeting.
But McCrory made it clear, Risi said, that Upper Albany Main Street would need to work with Cicero if they wanted to obtain the grant funding from the state.
Double-dipping?
The decision to subgrant part of the federal funds to SHEBA became a sticking point once state officials recognized that Cicero was already being paid $300,000 for the same type of work through another small business program, which McCrory also helped to approve. 
That state-run program, which was overseen by the staff at DECD through its Minority Business Initiative, required small businesses to go through SHEBA’s so-called “accelerator” program before they could apply for a forgivable loan of up to $50,000. 
The fact that Cicero would be paid to provide the same type of training through multiple taxpayer-funded programs, DECD officials explained, could lead people to question the state’s decision to award her more money. 
“They received state funding to perform the exact same work that was outlined in the CT Next proposal,” Rhonda Olisky, an employee at DECD, told other state officials in July 2023. “I believe Onyeka was unaware of that funding, however, he did agree with us that we all want to avoid any appearance of ‘double-dipping.’” 
Throughout the summer and into the fall of 2023, Ritter’s office continued to contact state officials to try to get answers about why the money for small businesses along Albany Avenue had yet to arrive.
But according to Ritter, nobody informed him or his staff about McCrory and Obiocha’s plans to shift hundreds of thousands of dollars in funding to SHEBA and another nonprofit.  
“Our office took the lead in getting this program set up, but in terms of any involvement in sub grant recipients, my office had no involvement in that, nor any knowledge of any of those conversations” Ritter said. 
In the end, none of the federal money ever made it through CT Next and out to the merchants along Albany Avenue. 
Jim Watson, DECD’s spokesperson, said that is because CT Next’s director and staff never finalized an application for the money.
In an email, Olinsky, who raised the concerns about double dipping, said she asked Obiocha to revise CT Next’s plan for the funds during a conversation in July 2023. But she said she never heard anything back from him.
State leaders officially shut down CT Next the following year and folded the quasi-public agency’s remaining operations into DECD.

A last-minute pitch
With CT Next gone and all of its employees laid off, Ritter said he and his staff had to find another way to get the federal money to the convenience stores, barber shops and other businesses along Albany Avenue. 
But as state legislators returned to Hartford in 2024, there was very little time left to formulate that new plan. 
The rules for the pandemic relief funding required the state to have contracts in place for all of the federal money by the end of 2024. Otherwise, it would be forced to return the unallocated funds to Washington, D.C. 
So as the time ticked down on another legislative session, Ritter said he and other lawmakers tapped the city of Hartford to come up with a way to spend roughly $1.7 million. 
The legislature officially allocated the federal funds to the city in May 2024. And Arulampalam, who had just taken over as Hartford’s mayor earlier that year, said he received a call from state officials shortly after that asking him to draft a proposal for how to distribute the money. 
Arulampalam, who was new to public office, said the opportunity to secure $1.7 million for one of the poorest areas of the city was too good of an opportunity to pass up. 
“We knew the money was going to go away. We didn’t know the history of the other attempts” to distribute the money, Arulampalm said. 
Arulampalam said it was Surgeon, Hartford’s council president, who ultimately brought forward a proposal for how to use the money. 
“We trusted Shirley and had reason to trust Shirley because she is part of that Upper Albany neighborhood. She knows that neighborhood and the businesses really well,” Arulampalam said. 
Hartford’s plan
As it turned out, Surgeon’s proposal closely mirrored the plan that was previously pitched by CT Next and approved by McCrory. 
Upper Albany Main Street would receive $475,000 from the city to teach small business owners how to use technology and computer programs. SHEBA would get another $475,000 for taking the businesses through an 8-week class that included training and one-on-one business coaching. And the rest of the money would fund the $15,000 grants for roughly 50 qualifying small businesses along Albany Avenue.  
Surgeon told the CT Mirror she did not speak to McCrory about how to allocate the $1.7 million that the legislature gave to the city and said she was unaware that Cicero had been in line to receive $350,000 when the money was earmarked for CT Next. 
Surgeon, who has appeared as a guest on Cicero’s podcast, said she encouraged the city to hire Cicero because her nonprofit was based on Albany Avenue and because she had prior experience providing small business training to minority-owned companies. 
The goal of the program, Surgeon said, was to make sure the small business along Albany Avenue could keep their doors open. 
“I live here,” Surgeon said. “I want to make sure the businesses survive.”

Arulampalam said the city ran its normal checks before the contract with SHEBA was finalized in October 2024, but he said state officials, who also reviewed the city’s proposal, never informed him of their earlier reservations about SHEBA being paid for similar services through multiple programs. 
Watson, DECD’s spokesman, said that is because state officials no longer had any concerns at that point about SHEBA being paid from multiple sources of taxpayer money. 
“Having done due diligence in vetting and attempting to contract the previous CTNext award, DECD staff was aware that the work proposed by the City of Hartford with the new ARPA allocation was not ‘double dipping,’ as it had a different scope and programmatic focus than the other SHEBA grant with DECD,” Watson said. 
Pausing the program
All of the vetting that was done in 2024 did not prevent the city from freezing the small business program earlier this year, however.
Arulampalam told the CT Mirror that his administration cut off the city’s contract with SHEBA in late August as a direct result of the grand jury investigation and several subpoenas, which ordered the state to turn over any records detailing a “personal or non-professional relationship” between McCrory and Cicero. 
By that point, 26 small business owners had already signed up for the digital literacy courses offered by Upper Albany Main Street. And six of those entrepreneurs had also gone through SHEBA’s portion of the training program in order to qualify for a $15,000 grant. 
Hartford officials said they chose not to cancel the city’s contract with Upper Albany Main Street. But that didn’t really matter. 
With SHEBA terminated, they said, the entire small business program had to be paused, while invoices and other records were sent to the state for review.  
DECD officials confirmed last month that they were analyzing that information, and they said the agency also requested additional documentation. 
According to Hartford officials, Cicero billed the city for roughly $72,000 before the program was officially halted. 
But DECD said all of those expenditures will need to be scrutinized before any of that money can be paid out. 
The same goes for the grants that the businesses along Albany Avenue have been waiting on for more than three years.

(Photo by Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)The deal to lure the Kansas City Chiefs across the state line to Kansas, announced by Gov. Laura Kelly with glee just a few days before Christmas, may represent the largest public subsidy in the history of American professional sports.
Is it a wise investment?
No, but it follows a recent Kansas trend of abandoning caution and reaching for shiny objects. Photos of Kelly clutching a Chiefs jersey were reminiscent of her plunking down $15 to place the first legalized sports bet in 2022. Sports betting came to Kansas following a lavishly obscene campaign by lobbyists to woo lawmakers, as documented by The New York Times. Kelly bet on the Chiefs to win the Super Bowl. They did, six months later, and Kelly donated her $165 winnings to charity.
She’d better hope that luck holds.
That Kansas has given its official blessing to sports and gambling – and has now committed billions of dollars of public debt to build a stadium where you can watch football while gambling on your phone – would have scandalized earlier generations of Sunflower State leaders. It should still scandalize us today, but we have become so inured to the soft sins that it feels like we are living in a Phillip K. Dick version of the reality we once knew.
Just as “The Man in the High Castle” is set in an alternate timeline where the Allies don’t win World War II, today’s Kansas is at once familiar and alien. Dorothy is still here, but she’s feeding slot machines at the local casino. Uncle Henry and Aunt Em have mortgaged the farm to build a stadium for the Wamego Munchkins. The Tin Man is assembling a nuclear reactor in his time off from the battery plant, and the Cowardly Lion is working for ICE. The Scarecrow? He burned up a long time ago in a grass fire out west. About the only vice still prohibited in this version of Kansas is marijuana, which will still get you thrown in the cooler if you’re caught by the Winkie Guards coming back from the Emerald City on I-70.
Okay, I’m sorry for not referring to the correct Wamego High School mascot. But I just couldn’t. They are the “Red Raiders.” While we’re on the subject, the Kansas City Chiefs will tell you that their name is an homage to former Kansas City, Missouri, mayor H. Roe Bartle, who was instrumental in bringing the team from Dallas in 1963. This is one of those “yes, but” explanations; Bartle did have the nickname “Chief,” but it wasn’t because of his municipal experience. Bartle had a long association with the Boy Scouts of America, in which he claimed to have been inducted into an Arapaho tribe and used the name, “Chief Lone Bear.” It should be noted that the Kansas City Chiefs now prohibit headdresses and face paint on game day and took instruction from a Native American working group on cultural sensitivity.
The Chiefs began as the Dallas Texans in 1959, owned by Lamar Hunt, and the team was a charter member of the American Football League. In 1966, the NFL and the AFL merged, and that year’s championship game between the two leagues was called the “Super Bowl” by Hunt.
Hunt’s brothers, Nelson and Herbert, tried to corner the world’s silver market in 1980. They failed and lost a billion dollars (about $4 billion in today’s money) in the process. But a consortium of U.S. banks bailed them out and, after various lawsuits and a Chapter 11 reorganization, the family fortune remained more or less intact. The Hunt family, whose net worth was valued at $25 billion by Forbes magazine, also owns one of Kansas City’s strangest features, SubTropolis, the world’s largest underground office complex carved out of the limestone bluffs north of the Missouri River.
Lamar Hunt died in 2006, aged 74. His son Clark was appointed chair of the Kansas City Chiefs.
It was Clark Hunt who appeared with Gov. Kelly on Dec. 22, announcing the Chiefs would move to a new stadium across the state line by 2031. Since 1972, the Chiefs’ home has been Arrowhead Stadium, part of the Truman Sports Complex. It includes Kaufmann Stadium, home of the Royals baseball team. The facilities are near the I-70 and 435 interchange in Kansas City, Missouri.
Although the location for the Kansas stadium has not been revealed, it’s expected to be near the Legends outlet mall in Kansas City, Kansas. That would place it just 23 miles from Arrowhead, perhaps the shortest relocation in NFL history.
Kansas had tried for years to poach the Chiefs from Missouri, and officials finally achieved the goal by offering to finance most of a $4 billion project for a new stadium, training complex, and team headquarters. Under the state’s STAR bond program, no public vote was needed, just the agreement of Kansas lawmakers and the billionaire Hunt family.
The deal blows up a 2019 border wars truce that prevented Missouri and Kansas from attempting to steal businesses from the other side of the state line in the Kansas City metro area. Kelly has denied breaking the truce, saying sports teams are different than corporations. The deal also follows a 2024 special election in which Jackson County, Missouri, voters soundly rejected a 3/8 cent sales tax to renovate stadiums for the Chiefs and the Kansas City Royals.
Kansas has used STAR bonds – for Sales Tax and Revenue – for a number of projects already, but none of the magnitude called for in the Chiefs agreement. The bonds allow state or local governments to develop projects to enhance Kansas tourism and economic development while paying off the project through sales tax revenue for the area served. In preparation for the Chiefs deal, Kansas lawmakers voted to remove the STAR bond prohibition on paying for more than 50% of a project and extended the repayment period from 20 years to 30. While there will be no referendum for state voters on whether the project is a good idea, local municipalities would have to vote to increase local sales taxes to help pay for the deal.
Past developments have ranged from the Kansas Speedway in Wyandotte County to the Flint Hills Discovery Center at Manhattan. Most projects have been successful, but two – an $83 million bond for the Schlitterbahn Water Park in Kansas City and $10 million bond for the Heartland Motorsports Park at Topeka – have failed. Both are now closed.
The deal offered the Chiefs is likely the largest public subsidy in the history of professional sports, according to reporting by the Kansas City Star. With debt service and facility maintenance, the deal may top $6 billion, with the state on the hook for 60% of that amount. The bond district could include much of Wyandotte and Johnson counties, including the city of Olathe, although boundaries and sales tax amounts have not yet been set.
Kelly, who said the Chiefs announcement was the biggest and most historic of her tenure, has defended the deal by saying it will bring more jobs and economic opportunity to Kansas and help define the state as receptive to business. She also claimed the deal would be paid for by revenue generated by the project, and not with “new taxes.” But it’s difficult to see how Kansas is anything but a chump in handing the Hunt family, which has more than enough money to build its own stadium, the keys to a $3 billion state-of-the-art domed facility in Wyandotte County and s $1 billion headquarters and a training camp in Johnson County. How does creating a massive sales tax district, encompassing much of the Kansas City, Kansas, metro area, amount to anything except new taxes?
At least Missourians got to vote on the sales tax.
Kansans had no such opportunity.
“The growth argument is nonsense because the economic impact from stadiums is mostly an illusion,” according to a recent Washington Post editorial. “When people are at the stadium, it’s a happening place with lots of activity. But there are only eight or nine NFL home games per year.” NFL stadiums spend most of the time empty, the Post noted, and they serve about as many customers in a year as a single American grocery store.
I couldn’t help but wince when I read the analogy to a grocery store. Holy Knute Rockne, no wonder Kansas showered the Hunt family with money. Our lawmakers are known for their fondness for any scheme including real or imagined grocery stores.
Seriously, the comparison to the Beneficient saga of a “pawn shop for the rich” in Hesston is a good one. In both cases, you had somebody who doesn’t need the money receiving concessions they don’t deserve for something hidden behind a curtain.
The Chiefs deal is further proof that Kansas government, on both sides of the lopsided aisle, serves the rich at the expense of everybody else. What kind of sales tax will be required to service the debt on a $4 billion stadium and accessories package? More than working families can bear. The cheapest seats at the beginning of the 2025 season were $160. Those living in the special district who could never afford to attend a Chiefs game must still buy staples and put gas in the car. Any sales tax increase will hit them harder than anyone else, because it is the most regressive of taxes. The argument that the bond district will generate enough revenue to pay for itself is disturbingly similar to some of the trickle-down rhetoric that came from Sam Brownback and company during his failed tax “experiment.”
Putting aside for a moment the question of whether it’s wise to give a $4 billion subsidy to a franchise owned by a single wealthy family, consider what else Kansas could fund with that kind of dough. My list would include libraries, art museums, history centers, concert halls, elementary schools, public parks, community health centers and homes for the unhoused.
Unrealistic?
Perhaps. But no more unrealistic than relocating a sports franchise 23 miles from its traditional location and expecting an economic miracle. Instead, what you get is economic sleight-of-hand where dollars spent on one side of an arbitrary line are now spent on the other. This might be good for a while, but once you’ve ignited an economic war you may lose something of greater value later. Think United Parcel Service or the Amazon Fulfillment Center, which combined employ more than 5,000. There are no signs that either is considering moving now, but with the truce broken and the state’s integrity shot, anything could happen.
There is also the issue that some longtime Chiefs fans are angry.
Rudi Keller, writing for the Missouri Independent, swears he will never root for the Chiefs again.
“The Kansas Chiefs are dead to me,” Keller declared.
Keller noted that after a spectacular run – and winning the Super Bowl in 2020, 2023, and 2024 – the team’s luck seems to have changed this year. They won’t even make it to the playoffs.
Some diehard Chiefs fans expressed concern over the move at a tailgater before the last home game of the season, according to KMBC television. In addition to losing the tradition of the Chiefs at Arrowhead, some questioned whether they would be able to afford tickets at a new venue.
The new Kansas stadium would seat 10,000 fewer fans than Arrowhead, according to the 33-page agreement, which might indicate more expensive seating. The Chiefs will also have the right to keep 100% of the proceeds, after paying a relatively paltry $7 million annually in rent to the state. It will also hold naming rights to the facility – and the ability to sell those rights to a third party. My guess is the Chiefs won’t take the high road and christen it the Eisenhower Sports Complex.
What Kansas gets from the deal are bragging rights – and most of the debt.
Despite the certainty with which Kelly announced the move, the deal is not yet final. Scattered throughout that 33-page document are conditions that have to be met before the move begins, including the acquisition by the Chiefs of the stadium site and NFL approval by Oct. 31.
Let’s all hope for a Halloween reprieve.

If you’ve ever wondered who’s actually in charge when your train is late, your ticket doesn’t scan, and parking enforcement is already writing you up, congratulations, you’ve stumbled upon the mysteries of Connecticut rail governance.



You may not realize it, but a single train ride on commuter rail in our state may be touched by seven or more different agencies, each responsible for a different part of your ride.
The railroad tracks: Fortunately, the State of Connecticut owns the railroad tracks, signals, power lines and right-of-way from Greenwich to New Haven, the largest section of the Northeast Corridor that is not owned by Amtrak.  That gives us more control of ‘our’ trains.  But Amtrak owns the tracks, etc. north of New Haven to Massachusetts (aka The Hartford Line) and east of New Haven (Shore Line East) to New London.
The stations: Here’s where it gets more confusing.  Most train stations in the state are owned by the Connecticut Department of Transportation but a few are owned by the towns and cities where they are located.  In some cases the town owns the station but it sits on CDOT-owned land. 
As for who is responsible for the operation and maintenance of the stations, it’s usually the owner, but CDOT contracts with third parties to run big stations like Stamford, New Haven, Hartford and Bridgeport.  Remember this when you’re slip-sliding on the platform waiting for your train.
Station parking: Parking at the stations is ultimately controlled by CDOT as they own most of the parking lots.  At the big stations with parking structures (Stamford and New Haven, for example) CDOT hires third parties to run the show.  In the smaller towns, where CDOT owns the land, they may lease it to the towns to operate.
The cost of parking is often determined by the local authorities, in most cases the towns or agents of CDOT.  On CDOT-owned land the parking is available to all, regardless of where you live.  In town-owned lots, rates and even access can be limited to local residents.
Commuter rail may be regional, but parking policy seems aggressively parochial.
The train cars: On the New Haven line, CDOT owns about half of the railcars with Metro-North (MTA) owning the rest.  On Shore Line East and The Hartford Line, CDOT owns the cars except those operated with Amtrak equipment.
Train operations: CDOT hires Metro-North to run the trains on the New Haven line and branches.  The two agencies work under an “operating agreement” the size of a Manhattan phone book and just as readable.  On Shore Line East the trains are run by Amtrak and on The Hartford Line some trains are run by Amtrak and others by a CDOT contractor, TransitAmerica.
Schedules: CDOT tells Metro-North the level of service they want and then works with that agency on how to deliver it (given financial constraints in their state budget).  On Shore Line East and The Hartford Line it’s a similar deal, but this time working with Amtrak.
The fares: CDOT sets commuter fares for trains in our state, not Metro-North or Amtrak.  The fares usually increase in lockstep: the latest MTA fare hike in New York soon to be matched by July’s CDOT fare increase.
How does all this work out for you, the rider?  How can a single train trip be touched by so many state and local agencies, towns and city departments?
The short answer is… it does work, sort of.  But it leaves passengers confused when it doesn’t.  If you get a parking ticket at the station, do you think Metro-North is to blame?  If your train is running late or over-crowded, who do you call?
Ours is an imperfect system, a relic of decades of bi-state compromises, overlapping authorities, and well-meaning bureaucrats and operators doing their best inside a structure that practically guarantees confusion.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_0213_SR_CTRail_233-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-04 04:56:46.126991

When President Trump bombed and invaded Venezuela, kidnapped the Venezuelan president and installed a new government to “run” the country, all without the the consent of Congress and in violation of our Constitution, he crossed his own Rubicon.
The post Trump crosses the Rubicon. ‘The die is cast.’ appeared first on WyoFile .","Alea Iacta Est
Julius Caesar, fresh from his victories in Gaul, led his legion back into Roman territory contrary to the Roman law dictating that no commander could lead armed troops into Rome without the Senate’s approval. Caesar did it anyway.

Opinion

When Caesar’s horse stepped a forefoot into the Rubicon River, the northern border of Rome, one of his lieutenants is quoted by the historian Seutonius as saying, “Alea Iacta Est” — “The die is cast.”
Rome would never be the same again. The Roman Republic would erupt in civil war, and ultimately be replaced by the Roman Empire. Caesar would not live to see it. He was, instead, assassinated on the floor of the Senate for his hubris.
The long, slow decline of Rome would follow, and a cautionary tale against unchecked ambition would be chiseled in stone. The history of the Western world became neatly divided between before the Rubicon and after.
When President Trump bombed and invaded Venezuela, kidnapped the Venezuelan president and left Americans to “run” the country, all without the consent of Congress and in violation of our Constitution, he crossed his own Rubicon. The die has been cast, and nothing in America will ever be the same.
Make no mistake, President Maduro was a slimy bastard and Venezuela has been a screwed-up country for quite some time. But changing that situation was never the job of the United States, but rather that of the Venezuelan people.
I am reminded of Ed Abbey’s suggestion regarding uncontrolled immigration at our southern border. Abbey, the author of many left-leaning books on the environment, advised that every refugee from the southern hemisphere, who is escaping despotism in their own country, should be met at the border, given a machine gun and a week’s worth of food, and told to go back home and start their own goddam revolution.
Policing politics in other countries has never been the job of the United States, although we have seldom passed up a chance to do precisely that. Our misguided attempt to “run” South Viet Nam cost us nearly 60,000 American lives and almost tore our country apart. History repeats itself to our detriment.
What will be the eventual butcher’s bill in Venezuela?
Nobody is willing to count that cost, not even Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon who posted on X that the Venezuelan people “now have a chance to be free.” Everyone is too caught up in the machismo and patriotic fervor of the moment, waving flags and shouting “USA, USA.” After all, nothing says patriotism more than kicking the shit out of a third-rate country. Gordon’s recent expression of support and justification for Trump’s crossing of his own Rubicon made my skin crawl.
Every American soldier who bleeds if we get mired in Venezuela, will bleed directly onto Gordon’s hands, and on the hands of everyone who follows Trump across that fateful river.
And that is not to mention the damage done to the United States and our reputation as a beacon of hope in the world. We risk — if we are not already — being perceived as nothing more than a purveyor gunboat democracy.
What, too, of the damage to ourselves, as we cheer loudly for American imperialism instead of self-rule in the rest of the world, while we watch the sacred institutions of our Constitution sacrificed on the altar of poll numbers and deflection from the Epstein files?
Viewed in a certain light, the responsibility for the downfall of Rome should rest on the legion that followed him across the Rubicon. Had those troops simply said to themselves, “This is bullshit,” obeyed the law and stayed on their side of the river, Caesar would have bluffed and blustered and spouted off without anyone behind him to back him up. And the history of the world would be different.
That is the choice confronting us all. Do we follow Caesar, or do we obey the law? 
Perhaps the die is not yet cast.

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)The Charles County Democratic Central Committee chose Yonelle Moore Lee on Saturday to fill the vacant District 27A seat in the House, setting up a conflict with Prince George’s County Democrats who backed a different candidate Tuesday.
The conflict means that Gov. Wes Moore (D) will make the choice between Moore Lee and Darrell Odom Sr., the Prince George’s County nominee, to represent the district that straddles the two counties.
Moore Lee, 50, chair of the county’s school board, won the support of 12 of the 14 central committee members present at Saturday morning’s roughly two-hour meeting.
“Your trust in me really means a lot. I will not let you down,” Moore Lee, 50, said after the vote. “I’m not sure what the next steps may be and what will happen, but either way, I’m very, very proud.”
What happens next is Gov. Wes Moore (D) must make a decision.
The governor has 15 days to choose between Moore Lee and Darrell Odom Sr., once the names are forwarded to him, but the 2026 General Assembly is set to convene sooner than that, on Jan. 14.
The seat became vacant after Kevin Harris was sworn in last month as state senator for District 27, that includes portions of Charles, Calvert and Prince George’s counties. Harris replaced former Democratic Sen. Michael Jackson, who left to become superintendent of Maryland State Police.

Harris attended Saturday’s special public hearing in Charles County and spoke on behalf of Odom, 71, a member of the Prince George’s Democratic Central Committee who received one vote.
Lamont Tyler Bunyon, who runs an optometry practice in Prince George’s, also received a vote from the Charles County Democrats, as he did at the Prince George’s meeting.
As at Tuesday night’s meeting in Prince George’s, Harris was among a few elected officials to speak on behalf of a candidate Saturday.
Reuben Collins II, president of the Charles County Board of Commissioners, and Del. Debra Davis (D-Charles) both spoke on behalf of Moore Lee.
“As chairperson of the Board of Education, she leads one of the most complex public institutions in our region overseeing a $529 million budget and serving over 28,000 students,” Davis said. “She has proven her ability to lead in high-stakes environments, build consensus across diverse viewpoints and deliver outcomes that matter to families. That’s real governing experience.”
Each candidate was asked several questions that included their plans to support the central committee as a “valued” partner. They all agreed.
They differed slightly when asked what legislation or policy areas they would be most prepared to immediately work on.
Although each candidate mentioned education as a priority, Moore Lee specifically touched upon the multibillion-dollar Blueprint for Maryland’s Future education reform plan.
“We have made a promise and a commitment to a world class education with the Blueprint. It’s supposed to be fully implemented by 2030, that is something that’s very important to me,” she said.
Bunyon said a main priority for him would be health care, especially with his work as an optometrist. He noted how several friends died in their 50s.

“We have to do a better job arguing for better health care, advocacy [and] awareness resources, because it’s a lot of preventable things that can be done,” he said. “I hate to say that I’m going to run there and try to be a doctor to folks, but I’m supposed to because I’m trained to do it.”
Odom said public safety “is a strong suit” for him, with a specific focus on juvenile justice reform, domestic violence and emergency response and prevention. Besides his 31 years of service in the Army and Coast Guard, he also worked as an acting fire chief in Prince George’s.
The nearly two-hour meeting did have a little humor when Charles County committee Vice Chair Elaine Hardee asked Odom how he would define ethical leadership and model it as a delegate.
In a previous question, Odom summarized ethics in public service.
“Should I say ditto on that?” Odom said to several laughs in the room.
In the meantime, the Prince George’s Central Committee has scheduled another public hearing Monday to select someone a replacement for Del. Jazz Lewis (D-Prince George’s). The former House majority whip, who has represented District 24 since 2017, announced more than two weeks ago he’s stepping down to work as the director of government relations at the University of Maryland, his alma mater.
Lewis’ last day will be the same day as the central committee meeting.

(Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Members of the Kansas congressional delegation denounced Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro as a dictator and urged President Donald Trump to explain to Congress use of U.S. airstrikes and deployment of troops to seize Maduro for prosecution in the United States.
Several in the federal delegation said it was important for Congress to fulfill its oversight role after Trump unilaterally ordered capture of a foreign leader in conjunction with a U.S. indictment for alleged drug and weapon trafficking. In the months before the assault Saturday, Trump had ordered sinking of small vessels in waters off Venezuela to interdict illegal drug trafficking and had directed the seizure of oil tankers.
U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran, a Republican, said he anticipated briefings on “future efforts in Venezuela” when the Senate returned next week to Washington, D.C.
“I commend the U.S. forces and intelligence community for a successful mission with the capture of Nicolas Maduro,” Moran said. “An illegitimate dictator and narcotrafficker, Maduro will face justice on American soil.”
The delegation’s lone Democrat, U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, said Maduro was a “brutal dictator who has harmed the Venezuelan people.” She went further than her GOP peers in terms of demanding an accounting from the Trump administration.
“Launching overnight strikes without congressional authorization or a clear explanation puts U.S. troops in danger and risks further escalation. The American people deserve answers,” she said.
U.S. Rep. Derek Schmidt, a Republican serving the 2nd District of eastern Kansas, said execution of the arrest warrant for Maduro, and his spouse, was a military and law enforcement achievement.
He said he expected a detailed briefing on the operation “in the coming days” and concluded “Congress must carefully monitor the path forward and always put America First.”
“There is no doubt Maduro’s regime supported the drug trade poisoning Americans in our communities, welcomed American adversaries from around the world into our hemisphere and contributed to the deadly chaos at our southern border in recent years,” Schmidt said. “Bringing him to justice will make our Kansas communities safer. As with any great change, much hard work and uncertainty now lies ahead.”
U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall, a Republican, said Trump promised to secure the U.S. borders and cut off “threats to us and our families at the source.” He also said “Venezuela ignored the call to stop trafficking lethal drugs into America.”
“Our communities and children are safer at home because of bold leadership like this, and I’m proud to stand with him,” Marshall said.
U.S. Rep. Ron Estes, a Republican representing the Wichita region, said the United States was a “safer country” following military action to “protect the American people from the rampant and deadly narcoterrorism enabled by and carried out by the illegitimate Maduro dictatorship.” He said he looked forward to justice prevailing in U.S. courts.
Colin McRoberts, a Democratic candidate for the 1st District seat held by GOP U.S. Rep. Tracey Mann, said he believed the United States’ strike on Venezuela involved “acts of war against a sovereign nation.” Mann didn’t respond to a request for comment.
McRoberts said it was hypocrisy for Trump to embrace an indictment of Maduro on weapons and drug charges after pardoning a former Honduran president for comparable offenses.
On Dec. 1, Trump pardoned former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez. He was convicted in March 2024 on drug trafficking and weapons charges and was serving a 45-year prison term.
“A jury convicted Hernandez of those charges. Donald Trump pardoned him. This attack on Venezuela was not about drugs,” McRoberts said. “We know that Congress has the constitutional authority and duty to get to the bottom of this — to demand and require real answers from the administration, instead of propaganda and lies.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Jerry-Moran-ku-med-3-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-03 18:57:42.849565

Nearly a hundred people came together in downtown Raleigh Saturday to voice their opposition to the Trump administration’s removal of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and apparent subsequent takeover of the South American country. 
The “emergency protest,” organized by Code Pink, the Party for Socialism and Liberation and several Democratic groups, took place in Moore Square Saturday afternoon. 
In an hour-long news conference earlier Saturday, President Donald Trump called Maduro a “narcoterrorist” and said Maduro and his wife would be tried on criminal charges in the U.S. justice system.
Trump said, “we’re gonna run the country” of Venezuela until a “judicious” transfer of power can be orchestrated. Trump also said U.S. oil companies would go into Venezuela to rebuild the country’s petroleum infrastructure, tap the nation’s vast oil reserves and sell the oil to other countries.  
North Carolina Republicans took to social media and the airwaves to praise the president’s actions as a victory for law and order. 
“President Trump’s bold actions have kept his promise to stop drug traffickers and save American lives,” said N.C. GOP spokesman Matt Mercer. “Capturing narcoterrorist Nicolas Maduro protects Americans and makes the world a safer place.” 
But protesters Saturday afternoon said they think the U.S. takeover of Venezuela will destabilize governments throughout the region, and most said they think Venezuela’s oil was the primary aim of Trump’s action. 
“Venezuela has one of the largest oil reserves in the entire world,” Alex Trejo with the Party for Socialism and Liberation told NC Newsline. “The real aim of the U.S. intervening in Venezuela is for the oil and not for this ‘democratic process’ that they’re trying to disguise it as.” 
Karen Still protests in Raleigh, Jan. 3, 2026. (Photo by Laura Leslie/NC Newsline)
Trejo conceded that Maduro was not democratically elected, but said it violated international law for the U.S. to go in and remove him. “It’s the Venezuelan people’s right to go through that democratic process themselves,” he said.  
Nikolai Kutsch with the N.C. State College Democrats said Trump’s actions contradict his 2024 campaign promises to avoid involving the U.S. in wars in other countries. 
“We don’t go in and run another country, and certainly not without congressional approval. This is completely outside of his bounds of power,” Kutsch said. “It is a lie, and it is not going to end well, I think.” 
Karen Still, a U.S. military veteran, held a sign likening Trump’s action in Venezuela to Russia’s attempt to take over Ukraine.
“What he is doing in Venezuela is equal to what Putin is doing. It’s aggression,” Still said. “There’s no good reason for it, and he’s putting America’s security and American lives and service members in jeopardy.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4128-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-03 17:57:27.206193

(Photo by Jerry Cornfield/Washington State Standard)Supporters of two citizen initiatives, one focused on parental rights and another on barring transgender athletes from girls’ sports, moved closer Friday to getting those measures before the Washington state Legislature, and potentially voters.
The political committee Let’s Go Washington turned in signatures in support of the initiatives on Friday at the secretary of state’s office in Tumwater.
Let’s Go Washington said supporters collected 416,201 signatures on petitions for IL26-001. This initiative would repeal changes that legislators made this year to an earlier Let’s Go Washington initiative that codified rights for parents of public school children.
The other initiative, IL26-638, seeks to block transgender girls from competing in girls’ sports. Backers gathered 445,187 signatures for that measure, Let’s Go Washington said.
Initiative sponsors were advised to turn in at least 386,000 signatures. Friday was the deadline for gathering the signatures.
Both measures are initiatives to the Legislature, meaning they would go before lawmakers for consideration in the session that begins Jan. 12. The secretary of state’s office will now verify the submitted signatures to confirm the initiatives can move forward.
“This is not a partisan issue, this is a common sense issue,” said Brian Heywood, the hedge fund manager who leads Let’s Go Washington. He said that about half of those who’d signed the initiative petitions were independents or Democrats. “This has broad support.”
Critics of the latest Let’s Go Washington initiatives say they pose safety risks for vulnerable students, including LGBTQ+ students and those seeking mental health support at school.
“Let’s Go Washington is playing political games with the lives of vulnerable trans and queer kids,” said Sophia Lee, a board member with the Gender Justice League.
“While most parents are loving and supportive, the reality is not all kids are safe at home, and need to turn to a trusted teacher or school counselor for help,” Lee added.
Lee’s statement was issued by WA Families for Freedom, a group opposed to the initiatives that has support from Service Employees International Union 775, the American Civil Liberties Union of Washington and the Washington Education Association, which is the state’s largest union representing public school employees.
Lawmakers have three paths they can take if the submitted signatures are verified.
They can approve the initiatives, making them law. They can reject the initiatives, sending them to the ballot for voters to decide in November’s election. Or they could pass an alternative to the proposed initiatives, and both versions would go to the ballot.
Also on Friday, Washington state Rep. Jim Walsh, R-Aberdeen, canceled an appointment that he’d made to turn in signatures for an initiative to the Legislature that called for proof of citizenship to be required for voter registration in Washington state.
Walsh said he planned to refile the measure as an initiative to the people and would attempt to get it qualified for the November ballot.
The secretary of state’s office said Friday it would likely take three to four weeks to review the signatures for the Let’s Go Washington initiatives. In the meantime, the office will provide the Legislature with a “provisional certification” to make lawmakers aware of the initiatives.
Assuming that the signatures in support of the initiatives are verified, it will mark the third consecutive year that the Legislature will grapple with issues surrounding parental rights, transgender students and diversity, equity and inclusion in schools.
IL26-001, the initiative focused on parental rights, would roll back changes to state law made during the 2025 legislative session by House Bill 1296.
That bill made revisions to Initiative 2081, the so-called parents’ bill of rights, which lawmakers approved in 2024. Initiative 2081, backed by Let’s Go Washington, established certain rights for the parents of public school students under age 18.
Among the changes in House Bill 1296 was to remove a guarantee for parents to be able to access student medical records. Republicans criticized the Democratic-backed rewrite of Initiative 2081 as undermining the initiative.
Rep. Monica Stonier, the lead sponsor of House Bill 1296, said her understanding is that IL26-001 would not affect key aspects of the law, such as guaranteeing students a school environment free of discrimination, harassment and bullying.
She said it was still too early to say how Democrats, who hold majorities in the House and Senate, might handle the initiative if it does end up before the Legislature.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/unnamed-2-scaled-e1728001712821-1024x597.jpg,,,2026-01-03 15:56:32.924395

U.S. Sen. Ted Budd, a Republican, said in a statement Saturday that President Trump’s decisive action to capture Maduro and bring him to justice is monumental and will save American lives from the drugs brought to our shores.

“Maduro was an illegitimate dictator who has long been wanted in the U.S. on charges of narco-terrorism, corruption, & drug trafficking,” Budd shared on the social media platform X.
Democratic U.S. Rep. Deborah Ross (NC-02) said Trump’s military operation was carried out without regard for the U.S. Constitution and without considering the long-term consequences for U.S. security.
“To be clear, Maduro is a despot who stole elections, imprisoned his political opponents, and trampled on the rights and dignity of his people. But the Trump administration cannot unilaterally impose regime change and push the United States to the brink of war. This action endangers our citizens and democracy around the world,” Ross said in a statement.
Ross also criticized the administration for failing to consult with Congress ahead of the military action.

“Using military force to remove a foreign head of state unquestionably requires congressional authorization. Trump ignored that requirement, once again thumbing his nose at our Constitution and Congress. At a minimum, Congress must be fully and transparently briefed and then take appropriate action,” Ross said.
Budd said the actions were within the president’s authority, and praised those responsible for Maduro’s capture.
“God bless our Special Operations Forces who carried out this daring mission, the Air Force, all those with our armed forces & intelligence community who provided support,” said Budd, who serves on the Senate Armed Services committee.
During Saturday’s press briefing, Trump said that the United States will run Venezuela during the transition, and he did not rule out the involvement of American troops.
“We’re not afraid of boots on the ground.”
Republican U.S. Rep. Richard Hudson, whose district includes Fort Bragg, praised the arrest of Maduro.
“Accountability finally came. Parents in our community can rest easier knowing a major peddler of fentanyl is off the streets. I’m grateful for the heroes who carried out this mission and praying for their safe return home,” said Hudson on social media. 
Democratic U.S. Rep. Don Davis (NC-01) praised the operation, but also expressed a desire for more information about what comes in the weeks ahead.
“Protecting American families and ending narcotics trafficking are essential to our national security,” said Davis, a veteran of the U.S. Air Force. “The use of military force demands accountability and transparency, and Congress must be kept fully informed to ensure proper oversight. I expect continued briefings as the situation in Venezuela evolves.”
Protests were planned for downtown Raleigh and other cities on Saturday afternoon.
Mickey Brigham, an organizer with the Party for Socialism and Liberation, called the military action a war for oil.
“Venezuela has the largest reserves of oil in the world, and the U.S. government is using military aggression to try to steal that wealth,” Brigham said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2251091316-1024x682.jpg,,,2026-01-03 15:56:32.924395

Venezuela President Nicolás Maduro and his wife were captured and flown out of the country after months of stepped-up pressure by Washington. President Donald Trump insisted the U.S. government would run the country at least temporarily and was already doing so.
“If we’re starting another endless war, with no clear national security strategy or need, count me out,” U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said in a statement. “Maduro is a cruel criminal dictator, but President Trump has never sought approval from Congress for war as the Constitution requires — and our military deserves. … The American people deserve — and Congress should demand — facts and clarity.”
U.S. Rep. Jim Himes, D-4th District, also condemned the action.
“Maduro is an illegitimate ruler, but I have seen no evidence that his presidency poses a threat that would justify military action without Congressional authorization, nor have I heard a strategy for the day after and how we will prevent Venezuela from descending into chaos,” said Himes, ranking member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, in a statement. “The administration must immediately brief Congress on its plan.”
U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, also raised questions about the legality of the move.
“President Trump’s claim that today’s unauthorized, unilateral military strike in Venezuela is a ‘law enforcement’ action against indicted drug trafficker Maduro rings hollow after the president just pardoned a convicted drug dealer, the former president of Honduras, who was serving a 45-year sentence in U.S. prison, 34 days ago,” Courtney said.
On the social media platform X, U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., questioned Trump’s motives.
“He is starting an illegal war with Venezuela that Americans didn’t ask for,” he wrote. “This is about satisfying Trump’s vanity, making good on the long standing neocon grudge against Maduro, enriching Trump’s oil industry backers, and distracting voters from Epstein and rising costs.”

President Trump thinks he is above the law. He steals from taxpayers. He thumbs his nose at the law.And now, he is starting an illegal war with Venezuela that Americans didn’t ask for and has nothing to do with our security.  How does going to war in South America help…— Chris Murphy  (@ChrisMurphyCT) January 3, 2026

State Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, said the move was “unpopular and illegal.”
“President Trump never laid out the need or the plan to the American people or Congress before attacking a sovereign nation and putting the lives of the men and women of our military at risk,” Duff said in a statement. “This is an unpopular and illegal attack motivated by the vanity of a president focused on TV ratings instead of exploding prices here at home.”
Trump brushed off criticism from U.S. Democratic lawmakers that he did not seek permission from Congress ahead of time and that the strike was illegal. He called his Democratic critics “weak, stupid people” and blamed his political opponents for inflation in the U.S.
He said the operation in Venezuela was “really genius.”
“All they do is complain,” he said of the Democrats.
“They should say, ‘Great job.’ They shouldn’t say, ‘Oh Gee, maybe it’s not constitutional.’ You know, the same old stuff that we’ve been hearing for years and years and years,” Trump said.
The stunning, lightning-fast American military action, which plucked a nation’s sitting leader from office, echoed the U.S. invasion of Panama that led to the surrender and seizure of its leader, Manuel Antonio Noriega, in 1990 — exactly 36 years ago Saturday.
The United Nations said it was “deeply alarmed” by the U.S. strikes and reported detention of Maduro. It expressed concern that the escalation was a violation of international law.
“These developments constitute a dangerous precedent,” Stéphane Dujarric, spokesman for the U.N. secretary-general, said in a statement. Dujarric said the U.N. worried about the larger implications for Latin America and the Caribbean and called on “all actors in Venezuela” to respect human rights and the rule of law.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26003525929670-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-03 13:57:05.923743

The six-year redshirt senior quarterback threw for 303 yards and three touchdowns and ran for 50 yards and two scores to take MVP honors, Koredell Bartley scored on a 100-yard kickoff return and Wake Forest beat Mississippi State 43-29 in the Duke’s Mayo Bowl on Friday night.
Ashford, who arrived at Wake Forest this season eager for a chance to start, threw TD passes of 14 yards to Kamrean Johnson, 64 yards to Jack Foley and 62 yards to Ty Clark III and had scoring runs of 2 and 1 yards for the Demon Deacons (9-4).
Wake Forest finished the season winning seven of its final nine games, this one sending coach Jake Dickert to a celebratory mayonnaise bath.
“When I got to Wake Forest, I was in a rough spot mentally and physically,” said Ashford, who transferred from South Carolina after also spending time at Oregon and Auburn. “I was kind of down on myself, almost at a point where I didn’t know if I wanted to keep playing. Man, these guys just instilled just so much in me, and, just helped me in so many ways and instilled that confidence back in me.”
The end result was a nine-victory season for Dickert, the most wins by a first-year coach in Wake Forest history.
The victory also meant having 42 1/2 pounds of mayonnaise dumped over his head. But he had some support, as his three children joined him in the celebration and got doused as well.
“I couldn’t get my wife to do it. She was like, ‘Absolutely not!’” laughed Dickert. “But to share that with my kids is something that is going to be a special memory for us for the rest of our lives.”
Clark finished with 153 yards from scrimmage after taking over the starting role after second-team All-ACC selection Demond Claiborne opted out of the game after declaring for the NFL draft.

Freshman quarterback Kamario Taylor, making his second college start, had a big second half for Mississippi State (5-8) and finished 13 of 22 for 241 yards and a touchdown. He ran for 60 yards and another score before suffering what appeared to be a significant leg injury with 1:46 left in the game. He was carted off the field.
Mississippi State coach Jeff Lebby wouldn’t go into detail after the game about the extent of Taylor’s injury, but sounded relieved, saying: “I feel good about the initial reports.”
After the Bulldogs took an 3-0 lead on the game’s first possession, Bartley fielded the ensuing kickoff at the goal line and weaved his way up the field before turning up the speed and outracing five defenders to the end zone for the longest touchdown in bowl history.
Ashford, a sixth-year QB playing for his fourth college, put Wake Forest ahead 30-12 in the third quarter on a 2-yard run to make it a three-possession game and the Demon Deacons seemed in cruise control.
But the Bulldogs came storming back.
Mississippi State finally found the end zone on the last play of the third quarter when Taylor took a shotgun snap, got a running start and leaped over the line and extended the ball over the goal line on his descent.
He added a 2-point conversion toss to cut it to 10 and then found Sanfrisco Magee over the middle for a 42-yard catch-and-run touchdown pass to make it 30-27 with 10:17 left.
Wake Forest appeared to put it away when Ashford ran for his second touchdown with 4:07 remaining, but Navaeh Sanders blocked the extra point and Kelly Jones scooped it up and scored for 2 points for the Bulldogs to make it 36-29.

On the ensuing possession, Mississippi couldn’t manage a first down and Lebby made the curious decision to punt on fourth-and-11 from the Bulldogs 25 with 2:35 left in the game, putting trust in his defense that it would force a three and out and get the offense the ball back.
That backfired, as Ashford dumped a pass off to Clark on a third-and-7 and he raced 62 yards untouched to the end zone to seal the win.
Taylor’s mother, LaQuandra Conner, took to Facebook after the game posting a picture of her and her son, saying “thanks everyone for the prayers it was his ankle but NOTHING is torn or broken GOD had MY BABY covered and for that I say THANK YOU LORD.”
Taylor was making his second career start for the Bulldogs (5-8) after a promising initial appearance in a loss to No. 6 Ole Miss.
He finished 13 of 22 for 241 yards and a touchdown against Wake Forest. He also ran for 63 yards and another score in when he took a shotgun snap, ran forward and dove over a pile of players and extended the ball over the goal line.
“A ton of toughness and there’s a ton of things to be excited about,” Lebby said about Taylor. “… For what he was able to get out of this bowl experience with 15 extra practices, the ability to go play in another game against a really good opponent, to me that is huge for us as we’re continuing to build this thing.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/03103308/AP26003209908711.jpg,,,2026-01-03 11:56:44.721857

(Photo by Westend61/Getty Images)Communication with loved ones, neighbors and mental health professionals can be a key piece of addressing the stressors and mental health issues that affect farmers at higher rates than other professions. 
According to the National Rural Health Association, suicide rates are “significantly higher” in rural areas than in urban areas and farmers die by suicide at a rate 3.5 times higher than the general population.
Mental health hotlines for farmers have seen more calls this year. In addition to the normally stressful profession, farmers have another year of unstable trade, less than desirable markets, high input costs and the phrase “farm crisis” on the tip of many people’s tongues.

Amber Wright, a therapist with Integrated Telehealth Partners, said there are certain signs that a farmer, or anyone, might be in a poor mental health state. Wright said communication, on the part of the person struggling and from their support network, are important factors in addressing some of the issues. 
Wright, who meets with patients via telehealth at UnityPoint Health’s Behavioral Health Clinic in Grinnell, said irritability, increased substance or alcohol consumption, and sleeplessness are signs that someone might be having more than just a bad day. 
“That could be another symptom of something else major,” Wright said.

FarmAid hotline:

According to FarmAid, which operates a hotline for farmers in need of assistance, farmers have unique stressors that affect their mental health: farming relies on factors outside of a farmer’s control, they often work alone for long hours at a time, there is a lot of pressure to hold onto their land and they usually have a self-reliant attitude that makes it difficult to ask for help. 
Rural areas where farmers live are also more likely to be mental health care deserts, which adds to the difficulty of finding help. 
Wright said meeting the “daily requirements” for living – adequate food, fluids and sleep – can help alleviate some of the stress that can lead to a more serious mental health issue. She also recommended farmers make time for a hobby or activity, like walking the dog, going for a drive, or grabbing coffee with a friend. 
“Trying to find those skills that are going to help you decrease that stress and also kind of help bring your morale back up too,” Wright said. 
Telehealth counseling and online resources can be another option for rural households. Iowa State University, Iowa Farm Bureau and Iowa Corn Growers Association have lists of mental health resources for farmers. 
Other organizations, like Farm Rescue, offer operational support, like haying or feeding livestock, to farm families in distress.
ISU has the Iowa Concern hotline and a partnership with Farm Foundation to offer free counseling and other resources. The university also has a list of stress management resources, like financial planning, legal counseling and disaster assistance. 
Wright said resources like this can be helpful to manage stress. Even writing out expenses and trying to come up with a financial plan can make it a little less stressful the next time a piece of equipment breaks down. 
“Always communicate, write out things, write them down, talk to people … ask for help,” she said.

Southern Turnings, founded by Scott and Jane Ann Maddox, has become a staple for residents and a tourist destination for visitors. 
The business now hosts community events, weekly classes and has expanded to additional locations, playing a significant role in efforts to bring activity back to Pine Avenue.
Starting with a single lathe 
When Southern Turnings opened more than eight years ago, Scott Maddox said downtown Wiggins had “one other struggling business.”  
“When I moved here (in 1997), this was a vibrant community,” he said. “All the buildings were open, there were shops, there were things to do. It was wonderful. Over time, that kind of dissipated, and basically there was nothing here.” 
Originally, the space was intended to be Maddox’s studio — just an air-conditioned space to turn wood. The idea to add a coffee shop and retail area came from Jane Ann Maddox. Still, the first few years showed little promise.

Maddox remembers asking his wife to buy a soda just to log a transaction for the day.
“I just thought we’d lost our minds. I mean, there was just no business,” he said.  
They stuck with it through the COVID-19 pandemic, and eventually, the tide turned. 
“Pretty soon we were sitting here going, ‘This is crazy!’” Maddox said. “I give credit to our community for making that (growth) happen, because obviously, if they wouldn’t come through that door, we wouldn’t be growing.” 
He said there’s no secret to success — much of the credit goes to their employees and patrons. 
“I don’t think I’ve done anything different than anybody else could have done, but I am told that people hope we never leave,” he said. 
Teaching the next generation

As Southern Turning continues to grow, it offers new opportunities to connect with the community — including weekly hands-on woodworking classes.  
Maddox first learned about woodturning — using a lathe to shape wood into symmetrical items like bowls and cups — during a trip to Silver Dollar City in Stone County, Missouri. He was fascinated by the craft, watching a young ex-Marine with PTSD turn wood for three hours.  
A retired high school teacher, Maddox said he envisioned his studio as an extension of the classroom. Over the years, he has taught students who have gone on to sell their pieces to help pay for college. Today, his students range from age 11 to 92. 
While Maddox may be  one of the only practicing woodturners in the area, he’s part of a broader community that stretches across Mississippi and into Memphis.
“There’s something about making something,” he said. “I would hope that kids would get more involved because that’s something that will last forever, but once people like me pass away and are no longer turning, it’s a craft that’s going away.” 
A vision for what comes next

Southern Turnings’ success has grown alongside renewed efforts to revitalize downtown. Maddox said local business owners formed the Pine Avenue Business Association, which now hosts events on the first Saturday of each month to bring more people to the area.
That momentum has inspired the Maddoxes to expand. Two and a half years ago, they opened a drive-thru coffee hut, which has thrived like the original location. A third location — a coffee shop at Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College — is expected to open Jan. 5. 
The Maddoxes have also begun thinking about the future. With retirement on the horizon, they’ve considered eventually selling the business — but for now, they say they’re focused on staying connected to the community.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/29092413/Wood-Turning_Image_Studio.jpg,,,2026-01-03 09:12:17.047576

Dozens of boat strikes have been carried out in the Caribbean that the president and members of his administration have justified, without showing evidence, by saying the boats were carrying drugs to the U.S.“The United States of America has successfully carried out a large scale strike against Venezuela and its leader, President Nicolas Maduro, who has been, along with his wife, captured and flown out of the Country,” Trump wrote on his social media site, TruthSocial. “This operation was done in conjunction with U.S. Law Enforcement.”The president will hold a press conference at his Florida residence in Mar-a-Lago at 11 a.m. Eastern. Andy Kim: Officials ‘blatantly lied’ to CongressThe news drew ire from members of Congress. New Jersey Democratic Sen. Andy Kim said for weeks Trump officials briefed Congress that the boat strikes were not “about regime change.”“I didn’t trust them then and we see now that they blatantly lied to Congress,” Kim wrote on social media. “Trump rejected our Constitutionally required approval process for armed conflict because the Administration knows the American people overwhelmingly reject risks pulling our nation into another war.""Utah’s GOP Sen. Mike Lee initially questioned “what, if anything, might constitutionally justify this action in the absence of a declaration of war or authorization for the use of military force.”But Lee later changed course after speaking with Secretary of State Marco Rubio.“He informed me that Nicolás Maduro has been arrested by U.S. personnel to stand trial on criminal charges in the United States, and that the kinetic action we saw tonight was deployed to protect and defend those executing the arrest warrant,” Lee said of Rubio.Rubio has long stated that Venezuela’s president is not legitimate, nor is his government.

Free.,Trump says US 'will run’ Venezuela during transition after capture of President Maduro,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-says-us-will-run-venezuela-during-transition-after-capture-president-maduro,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said Saturday that the United States will “run the country” of Venezuela until “a proper transition can take place,” following the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in a strike against the South American nation, a stunning move conducted without congressional notice or approval.Trump in a press conference from his Florida estate made it clear how much the secret Friday military operation related to securing oil, and he detailed how petroleum companies would finance the rebuilding of Venezuela’s oil infrastructure. Trump as well as Secretary of State Marco Rubio also signaled other countries, such as Cuba, could face the same interventionist fate as Venezuela. “If I lived in Havana and worked for the government I'd be concerned,” Rubio said, referring to the communist nation’s capital. Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, who was also captured, will be brought to New York to face a U.S. indictment on narco-terrorism and conspiracy charges originally levied in 2020. The Venezuelan’s reelection to the presidency in 2024 was determined by many countries, including the U.S., to be illegitimate, and he has been characterized by the administration as the leader of a drug cartel.“This extremely successful operation should serve as (a) warning to anyone who would threaten American sovereignty or endanger American lives,” Trump said. “What happened to Maduro could happen to them.”The early morning military strike quickly drew strong rebukes from Democratic lawmakers, who said the action superseded Congress’ authority to declare war. It’s also caused deep concern among world leaders, some of whom pushed for an emergency United Nations meeting.However, Republicans in Congress stood by the president’s decision, saying it was justified.No timeline for US involvementTrump did not give a timeline for how long the unusual U.S. intervention in Venezuela might go on, but said the next year would look different for the nation. “We are going to run the country until such time that we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition,” Trump said. He added that the U.S. would make Venezuela safe for “the great people of Venezuela, and that includes many from Venezuela that are now living in the United States and want to go back to their country.” Since taking office, the Trump administration has tried to end temporary and humanitarian legal protections for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan immigrants. Trump during the press conference repeated accusations that Maduro has sent Venezuelan immigrants with ties to the Tren de Aragua gang to the U.S.Friday’s military action campaign, named “Absolute Resolve,” came after Trump waged a months-long pressure campaign to oust the authoritarian leader. Dozens of boat strikes have been carried out in the Caribbean that the president and members of his administration have justified, without showing evidence, by saying the boats were carrying drugs to the U.S.“The United States of America has successfully carried out a large scale strike against Venezuela and its leader, President Nicolas Maduro, who has been, along with his wife, captured and flown out of the Country,” Trump wrote on his social media site, Truth Social, early Saturday. “This operation was done in conjunction with U.S. Law Enforcement.”Before the Saturday press event at Mar-a-Lago started, the president posted a picture to social media of Maduro handcuffed, blindfolded and aboard the U.S.S. Iwo Jima Navy ship.‘We’re not afraid of boots on the ground’Trump at the press conference was joined by Rubio; Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth; Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Dan Caine; CIA Director John Ratcliffe; and senior White House adviser Stephen Miller, who is a lead architect of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. Trump said that an “overwhelming American military power” was used to capture Maduro and his wife in the “dead of night” from “air, land and sea.”He added that no U.S. military members were killed in the operation, but did not rule out a continued presence for American troops in Venezuelan territory. “We’re not afraid of boots on the ground,” Trump said.Trump said those officials standing behind him at his press conference, “for a period of time,” would “be running” Venezuela. The president offered few details on what that U.S. intervention would look like, but called it a “partnership.” It’s unclear if there are any American officials or troops stationed yet in or near Venezuela. CubaTrump also lodged a thinly veiled threat against the Cuban government.“Cuba is not doing really well right now,” Trump said. “I think Cuba is going to be something we’ll end up talking about.”He added that the U.S. also wants to help Cubans who have been “forced out of their country,” so they can return to the island nation. The Trump administration has also moved to end humanitarian protections for more than 110,000 Cubans. Rubio, whose parents were part of the first wave of Cuban exiles before the Fidel Castro regime took over Cuba, agreed, and criticized Cuba’s government as being run by ""incompetent, senile men.”It’s unclear how the next in line to the presidency for Venezuela, Vice President Delcy Rodríguez, will fare. Trump said that Rubio had a conversation with Rodríguez, and said “she’s essentially willing to do what is necessary to make Venezuela great again.”María Corina Machado, the leader of Venezuela's opposition party, and recent Nobel Peace Prize winner for her work to advance democracy in her home country, called for national unity and said that “the hour for freedom has arrived.” “We have struggled for years, we have given it our all, and it has been worth it. What had to happen is happening,” she said in a statement.Indictment in Southern District of New YorkMaduro and his wife will face a trial in the U.S. They have been indicted in the Southern District of New York, Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote on social media. The DOJ also indicted their son, Nicolás Ernesto Maduro Guerra, along with several other Venezuelan politicians, and the alleged leader of the Tren de Aragua Venezuelan gang, Hector Rusthenford Guerrero Flores.President Maduro is charged with “Narco-Terrorism Conspiracy, Cocaine Importation Conspiracy, Possession of Machineguns and Destructive Devices, and Conspiracy to Possess Machineguns and Destructive Devices against the United States,” Bondi said. In 2020, the first Trump administration lodged the same four counts of narco-terrorism, conspiracy to import cocaine, possession of machine guns and conspiracy to possess machine guns. The new indictment includes Maduro’s wife, son and the alleged leader of the Tren de Aragua gang. Andy Kim: Officials ‘blatantly lied’ to CongressThe news drew ire from Congress, which has the authority to declare war. New Jersey Democratic Sen. Andy Kim said for weeks Trump officials briefed Congress that the boat strikes were not “about regime change.”“I didn’t trust them then and we see now that they blatantly lied to Congress,” Kim wrote on social media. “Trump rejected our Constitutionally required approval process for armed conflict because the Administration knows the American people overwhelmingly reject risks pulling our nation into another war.”However, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, said the capture of Maduro meant the Venezuelan president would be held accountable. “President Trump’s decisive action to disrupt the unacceptable status quo and apprehend Maduro, through the execution of a valid Department of Justice warrant, is an important first step to bring him to justice for the drug crimes for which he has been indicted in the United States,” Thune said.He added that when senators return to Congress Monday, he looks forward to additional security briefings from Trump officials.House Speaker Mike Johnson, Republican of Louisiana, made similar remarks and called the attack “justified.” He said he’s working with the Trump administration to schedule briefings with House lawmakers when they return to Washington.  The top Democrat on the House Rules Committee, Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, wrote on social media that without “authorization from Congress, and with the vast majority of Americans opposed to military action, Trump just launched an unjustified, illegal strike on Venezuela.” Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, who is also co-chair of the Congressional Venezuela Democracy Caucus, said in a statement that the “capture of the brutal, illegitimate ruler of Venezuela … is welcome news for my friends and neighbors who fled his violent, lawless, and disastrous rule.”However, she called for the opportunity for Venezuelans to partake in democracy, such as being able to swear in the presidential candidate who won Venezuela's election in the summer of 2024.President-elect Edmundo Gonzalez was forced into exile and fled to Spain under asylum. Voter results showed that Gonzalez won by a large margin, but Venezuelan government officials, without providing proof, determined that Maduro won. Mike Lee speaks to RubioUtah’s GOP Sen. Mike Lee initially questioned “what, if anything, might constitutionally justify this action in the absence of a declaration of war or authorization for the use of military force.”But Lee later changed course after speaking with Rubio.“He informed me that Nicolás Maduro has been arrested by U.S. personnel to stand trial on criminal charges in the United States, and that the kinetic action we saw tonight was deployed to protect and defend those executing the arrest warrant,” Lee said of Rubio.Rubio has long stated that Venezuela’s president is not legitimate, nor is his government. Rubio accused him of being the head of a drug cartel.  “He is not the legitimate president of Venezuela,” Rubio said during Saturday’s press conference. “He is a fugitive of American justice.”Rubio, who while in Congress was a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also defended a lack of notification to lawmakers.“This is not the kind of mission you can do congressional notification,” Rubio said. For months, Democrats and a handful of Republican lawmakers have tried to curb the president’s strikes in the Caribbean, which have killed about 115, but Congress failed to pass several War Powers Resolutions.The War Powers Resolution of 1973 is a tool for Congress to check the power of the executive branch by limiting the president's ability to initiate or escalate military actions abroad.  Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine, who has pushed for the Senate to vote on the War Powers Resolution, said he will again advocate a vote to curb Trump’s military actions in Venezuela. Venezuelans in the USAs the U.S. conducts military land strikes on Venezuela, more than half a million Venezuelan immigrants are legally fighting the Trump administration's move to end Temporary Protected Status. TPS is granted when a nation's home country is deemed too dangerous to return to, due to violence, such as war, or a major natural disaster.More than 600,000 Venezuelans have TPS, which was initially granted in 2021, just one day before the first Trump administration finished its term. Temporary protections were granted to Venezuelans due to Maduro’s regime. Trump has also tried to apply the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to any Venezuelan national, aged 14 and older, who is a suspected gang member, for the purpose of removing them from the U.S. without due process. Trump and Maduro also clashed after several deportation planes carrying Venezuelan immigrants landed in El Salvador, where more than 200 men were detained at a brutal mega-prison known as CECOT.Maduro called the move a “kidnapping,” and several months later the Venezuelans were returned to their home country in a prisoner exchange. World leaders call for UN to conveneIt’s unclear what the consequences of the Trump administration’s move to capture a foreign leader will have on international relations, but many world leaders disavowed the attacks and called for an emergency United Nations General Assembly meeting. The U.N., which is five miles away from the New York court where Maduro will stand trial, did not immediately respond to States Newsroom’s request for comment.Mexico’s President, Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo, condemned the attacks and said they violated Article 2 of the United Nations Charter. “Based on its foreign policy principles and its pacifist vocation, Mexico makes an urgent call to respect international law, as well as the principles and purposes of the UN Charter, and to cease any act of aggression against the Venezuelan government and people,” she said in a statement.Sheinbaum Pardo called on the United Nations to “act immediately to contribute to the de-escalation of tensions, facilitate dialogue and create conditions that allow a peaceful, sustainable solution in accordance with international law.”Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs also criticized the attack in Caracas, Venezuela. “The justifications put forward for these actions have no factual basis. Ideological hostility has prevailed over pragmatic, businesslike approaches and over efforts to build relationships based on trust and predictability,” according to Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.Brazil's president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, said on social media that the U.S. moves to capture Maduro and bomb Venezuela “cross an unacceptable line.”“Attacking countries, in flagrant violation of international law, is the first step toward a world of violence, chaos, and instability, where the law of the strongest prevails over multilateralism,” he wrote. The Prime Minister of Spain, Pedro Sanchez, called for de-escalation and said that international law “and the principles of the United Nations Charter must be respected.”",,,,2026-01-03 14:12:01.022736

From beginning to end, 2025 was a year of devastation for scientists in the United States.
January saw the abrupt suspension of key operations across the National Institutes of Health, not only disrupting clinical trials and other in-progress studies but stalling grant reviews and other activities necessary to conduct research. Around the same time, the Trump administration issued executive orders declaring there are only two sexes and ending DEI programs. The Trump administration also removed public data and analysis tools related to health disparties, climate change and environmental justice, among other databases.
February and March saw a steep undercutting of federal support for the infrastructure crucial to conducting research as well as the withholding of federal funding from several universities.
And over the course of the following months, billions of dollars of grants supporting research projects across disciplines, institutions and states were terminated. These include funding already spent on in-progress studies that have been forced to end before completion. Federal agencies, including NASA, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Agency for International Development have been downsized or dismantled altogether.
The Conversation asked researchers from a range of fields to share how the Trump administration’s science funding cuts have affected them. All describe the significant losses they and their communities have experienced. But many also voice their determination to continue doing work they believe is crucial to a healthier, safer and more fair society.

 Pipeline of new scientists cut off

Carrie McDonough, Associate Professor of Chemistry, Carnegie Mellon University
People are exposed to thousands of synthetic chemicals every day, but the health risks those chemicals pose are poorly understood. I was a co-investigator on a US$1.5 million grant from the EPA to develop machine-learning techniques for rapid chemical safety assessment. My lab was two months into our project when it was terminated in May because it no longer aligned with agency priorities, despite the administration’s Make America Healthy Again report specifically highlighting using AI to rapidly assess childhood chemical exposures as a focus area.
Labs like mine are usually pipelines for early-career scientists to enter federal research labs, but the uncertain future of federal research agencies has disrupted this process. I’m seeing recent graduates lose federal jobs, and countless opportunities disappear. Students who would have been the next generation of scientists helping to shape environmental regulations to protect Americans have had their careers altered forever.
I’ve been splitting my time between research, teaching and advocating for academic freedom and the economic importance of science funding because I care deeply about the scientific and academic excellence of this country and its effects on the world. I owe it to my students and the next generation to make sure people know what’s at stake.

 Fewer people trained to treat addiction

Cara Poland, Associate Professor of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Biology, Michigan State University
I run a program that has trained 20,000 health care practitioners across the U.S. on how to effectively and compassionately treat addiction in their communities. Most doctors aren’t trained to treat addiction, leaving patients without lifesaving care and leading to preventable deaths.
This work is personal: My brother died from substance use disorder. Behind every statistic is a family like mine, hoping for care that could save their loved one’s life.
With our federal funding cut by 60%, my team and I are unable to continue developing our addiction medicine curriculum and enrolling medical schools and clinicians into our program.
Meanwhile, addiction-related deaths continue to rise as the U.S. health system loses its capacity to deliver effective treatment. These setbacks ripple through hospitals and communities, perpetuating treatment gaps and deepening the addiction crisis.

 Communities left to brave extreme weather alone

Brian G. Henning, Professor of Philosophy and Environmental Studies and Sciences, Gonzaga University
In 2021, a heat dome settled over the Northwest, shattering temperature records and claiming lives. Since that devastating summer, my team and I have been working with the City of Spokane to prepare for the climate challenges ahead.
We and the city were awarded a $19.9 million grant from the EPA to support projects that reduce pollution, increase community climate resilience and build capacity to address environmental and climate justice challenges.
As our work was about to begin, the Trump administration rescinded our funding in May. As a result, the five public facilities that were set to serve as hubs for community members to gather during extreme weather will be less equipped to handle power failures. Around 300 low-income households will miss out on efficient HVAC system updates. And our local economy will lose the jobs and investments these projects would have generated.
Despite this setback, the work will continue. My team and I care about our neighbors, and we remain focused on helping our community become more resilient to extreme heat and wildfires. This includes pursuing new funding to support this work. It will be smaller, slower and with fewer resources than planned, but we are not deterred.

 LGBTQ+ people made invisible

Nathaniel M. Tran, Assistant Professor of Health Policy and Administration, University of Illinois Chicago
This year nearly broke me as a scientist.
Shortly after coming into office, the Trump administration began targeting research projects focusing on LGBTQ+ health for early termination. I felt demoralized after receiving termination letters from the NIH for my own project examining access to preventive services and home-based care among LGBTQ+ older adults. The disruption of publicly funded research projects wastes millions of dollars from existing contracts.
Then, news broke that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would no longer process or make publicly available the LGBTQ+ demographic data that public health researchers like me rely on.
But instead of becoming demoralized, I grew emboldened: I will not be erased, and I will not let the LGBTQ+ community be erased. These setbacks renewed my commitment to advancing the public’s health, guided by rigorous science, collaboration and equity.

 Pediatric brain cancer research squelched

Rachael Sirianni, Professor of Neurological Surgery, UMass Chan Medical School
My lab designs new cancer treatments. We are one of only a few groups in the nation focused on treating pediatric cancer that has spread across the brain and spinal cord. This research is being crushed by the broad, destabilizing impacts of federal cuts to the NIH.
Compared to last year, I am working with around 25% of our funding and less than 50% of our staff. We cannot finish our studies, publish results or pursue new ideas. We have lost technology in development. Students and colleagues are leaving as training opportunities and hope for the future of science dries up.
I’m faced with impossible questions about what to do next. Do I use my dwindling research funds to maintain personnel who took years to train? Keep equipment running? Bet it all on one final, risky study? There are simply no good choices remaining.

 Inequality in science festers

Stephanie Nawyn, Associate Professor of Sociology, Michigan State University
Many people have asked me how the termination of my National Science Foundation grant to improve work cultures in university departments has affected me, but I believe that is the wrong question. Certainly it has meant the loss of publications, summer funding for faculty and graduate students, and opportunities to make working conditions at my and my colleagues’ institutions more equitable and inclusive.
But the greatest effects will come from the widespread terminations across science as a whole, including the elimination of NSF programs dedicated to improving gender equity in science and technology. These terminations are part of a broader dismantling of science and higher education that will have cascading negative effects lasting decades.
Infrastructure for knowledge production that took years to build cannot be rebuilt overnight.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)There was nothing under the tree this Christmas for South Dakota’s schools, state employees and health care providers.
Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden proposed no funding increase for them in the next state budget.
“Because our revenues haven’t grown much, we have to keep them flat this year,” Rhoden said during his annual December budget address.
Hearing that news so close to the holidays, I was reminded of the climactic movie scene in “National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation,” when a wife takes her husband to task for eliminating his company’s Christmas bonuses.
“You didn’t!” she exclaims. “Well, of all the cheap, lousy ways to save a buck!”
Governor proposes ‘limited budget’ for SD that avoids big cuts but keeps school funding flat

Rhoden’s plan looks even cheaper and lousier in light of the revenue our state government has surrendered, the money it’s wasted, and the questions that have arisen about its spending on economic development.
Three years ago, lawmakers and then-Gov. Kristi Noem decided to reduce the state sales tax rate from 4.5% to 4.2% until 2027. It was an ill-considered attempt to distract homeowners from their property tax complaints by giving them a sales tax holiday they didn’t ask for, and it cost the state more than $100 million in annual revenue. Most consumers, meanwhile, aren’t noticing the penny they’re saving every time they spend $3.33.
Noem’s administration also squandered $20 million developing a prison site that ultimately had to be abandoned.
That fiasco began four years ago. The state was flush with cash from federal COVID-19 relief and stimulus funding, so Noem and legislators started stuffing money into a prison construction account. They wanted to replace the oldest parts of the Sioux Falls penitentiary, which dates to 1881.
Noem’s Department of Corrections selected a site in rural Lincoln County, and a lawsuit quickly arose from landowners who hadn’t been told that a prison might pop up in their neighborhood.
Years of contention boiled over last winter after Noem bolted to run the federal Department of Homeland Security. An insurgent group of legislators led a revolt against the Lincoln County location, and Rhoden — who was elevated from lieutenant governor upon Noem’s departure — surrendered to reality. He pushed the reset button and appointed a task force that selected a different site in Sioux Falls.
By that time, the state had already spent an unrecoverable $20 million on the abandoned land, for myriad expenses including design work, sewer pipes, herbicide application and geothermal test wells.
More recently, questions have arisen about the combined $69 million of grants, loans and tax rebates that the administrations of Noem and Rhoden have showered on CJ Schwan’s. The money is helping the company build a $550 million frozen food production plant in northern Sioux Falls that will employ 650 people (the math works out to about $106,000 of state aid per employee, for jobs that will pay an average of $40,000 per year).


Let us know what you think...


 

CJ Schwan’s employs Noem’s former state economic development commissioner, Steve Westra, who pledged the first state grant to the company four years ago before leaving his state job. The company also has the chairman of the state’s Board of Economic Development, Jeff Erickson, on its corporate board, while Erickson is involved with a corporation that rents space to CJ Schwan’s in a downtown Sioux Falls office building.
CJ Schwan’s is part of CJ Group, a South Korean conglomerate that had $30 billion in revenue last year. That’s an amount four times larger than South Dakota’s annual state budget.
Now, after flushing so many dollars, Rhoden wants lawmakers to pinch pennies. He’s offering schools, state employees and Medicaid-funded health care providers the equivalent of the jelly-of-the-month subscription that Clark Griswold’s boss substituted for bonuses in “Christmas Vacation.”
Clark called that “the biggest bag-over-the-head, punch-in-the-face I ever got.”
South Dakotans might feel the same way if lawmakers adopt Rhoden’s budget plan.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/EM8A3851-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-03 08:11:41.189736

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — With Tyson Foods weeks away from shuttering its Lexington beef plant, the anticipated financial blow to the state is becoming clearer. Meanwhile, some workers have made strides to adjust.
The statewide economic loss, including both direct and ripple effects, is estimated at $3.28 billion a year, according to a recently released University of Nebraska-Lincoln analysis.

While public documents reported that a “mass layoff” of 3,212 Tyson workers will occur “on or around” Jan. 20, the UNL study projects more than 7,000 jobs will be lost statewide, along with an annual labor income loss of $530 million. That higher job loss count includes employees in other industries that support the Tyson beef plant operation and its workforce.
Tax revenues also will drop with the exit of Lexington’s largest employer. The projected annual decline in state personal income tax revenue is estimated at $23.2 million, according to the Dec. 22 report, and state sales tax proceeds are predicted to slide by $10 million a year.
Dawson County and neighboring communities will feel a concentrated punch, say authors and economics professors Elliott Dennis and Eric Thompson. Dennis specializes in livestock and risk management in UNL’s Department of Agricultural Economics. Thompson is an economist and director of the UNL Bureau of Business Research. 
According to their analysis, local sales tax revenues in Dawson County will likely fall by $2.77 million a year due to the plant folding. Tyson has said that certain wind-down activities may continue for a short time beyond the Jan. 20 date.
Thompson called the Tyson plant closure significant statewide, saying he hasn’t seen many local employers “of this scale” close shop in the past few decades. The UNL analysis said the Lexington plant could process nearly 5,000 cattle daily, about 4.8% of total daily U.S. beef slaughter. It said the plant’s demise marks the first time one of the “Big Four” meatpacking companies has permanently closed a major facility during the current cattle supply crunch.
Still, Thompson said, such an occurrence in a market economy is not unnatural. 
“The state needs to really focus on getting new investment,” he said.
 Norfolk plant still empty 

Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen has said that Tyson officials were exploring options for the Lexington facility that include repurposing it into a “value-added” ag operation. Tyson has not announced any plan.
Nebraskans lament Tyson decision to close Lexington plant with 3,200 workers

U.S. Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb, has lamented publicly that Tyson about 20 years ago “pulled out” of his hometown of Norfolk, eliminating 1,300 jobs at the company’s stripped and now-abandoned meatpacking facility there, and the property has yet to be repurposed.
Since Tyson announced the Lexington plant closure on Nov. 21, Pillen has said that more than 1,600 people attended job fairs and other events designed to connect displaced workers with potential jobs and state workforce support services. More events are scheduled.
An hour drive from Lexington, the recently opened Sustainable Beef meatpacking plant in North Platte is hiring about 100 more workers and raising its daily cattle processing goal as a result of Tyson’s Lexington announcement, the North Platte Telegraph and Wall Street Journal have reported.
Lexington-area Tyson workers were inquiring about jobs immediately after Arkansas-based Tyson announced the closure. Sustainable Beef CEO David Briggs told the Telegraph that about 400 former Tyson workers already had joined his workforce, some before and some after the Nov. 21 announcement. 
Today, the North Platte plant reportedly aims for 1,000 employees and to process 1,800 head of cattle per day.
Rancher-owned Sustainable Beef opened its plant in 2025 and was expected to create a more competitive supply chain against the “Big Four” producers. The four, Tyson, JBS, Cargill and National Beef, control about 83-85% of U.S. beef processing capacity, which, Dennis said, has long been a point of concern for cattle producers regarding market power and price.
For the Dec. 22 economic impact report, the UNL economists drew upon multiple data sources and used the IMpact analysis for PLANing (IMPLAN) model, a tool they described as an industry standard. 



What led to packing plant shutdown?
A separate UNL analysis identified a fundamental driver of the Lexington plant’s closure as U.S. cattle supplies, saying the national herd is at a 70-year low. That Dec. 12 report said the cattle shortage stems from:

A multiyear drought in Texas and Southern Plains states that burned up pasture and increased feeding costs
Improved beef efficiency, leading to more beef per carcass due partly to genetic improvements
Slower-than-expected herd rebuilding due to aging producers, higher interest rates and producer desires to pay down debt leading to less retention of heifers
Recent disruptions, including shut down of the southern U.S. border to Mexican feeder cattle due to concerns about New World screwworm

Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen has said also that he was told key contributors to Tyson’s decision to end Lexington operations involved the age and inefficiencies of the factory, which was built decades ago to manufacture combines and other farm machinery before being retrofitted for a meatpacking plant around 1990.

President Donald Trump’s administration announced this week Louisiana will receive $208 million in 2026 from the massive $50 billion federal rural health fund that will be distributed over the next five years.  The amount of money each state receives will be recalculated annually until the $50 billion is exhausted in 2030. 
Louisiana officials said this initial allocation indicates the support the state can expect to garner in future years. Assuming its $208 million allocation continues, Louisiana should receive more than $1 billion for rural health care support over the five-year life of the fund, Louisiana Health Secretary Bruce Greenstein said Friday in an interview. 

The state plans to use some of its money to add slots to health care training and degree programs that already exist at Louisiana public universities and colleges. The additional spots would be prioritized for students who show an interest in working in rural areas. 

Greenstein held out a mental health counseling program at Northwestern State University as an example of a degree track that could be expanded with the rural health funds. He said the university has more qualified candidates applying to that program than it can afford to train currently. 

The state is also looking to expand the Health Care Employment Reinvestment Opportunity (HERO) program, which leverages public money to attract private funding for scholarships given to health care students who agree to work in underserved communities. A new rural version of this initiative is likely to be set up with the money, Greenstein said.  
Louisiana is also looking to set up a rural clinician credit bank, where rural hospitals and other health care providers can draw down public funds in order to provide signing and retention bonuses for medical professionals. This would allow rural health care employers to compete with their urban and suburban counterparts, who have more resources to provide such incentives, Greenstein said.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 

The money may also go toward reestablishing a state income tax credit for rural health care professionals, according to Louisiana’s application for the rural health care funding submitted last year. Approximately 400 rural health care workers took advantage of a similar tax credit when it existed previously, according to the application. 
Louisiana will also help rural hospitals purchase electronic health records systems with the money. Greenstein said this should improve access to care for people who need to see specialists. It will make it easier for rural hospital patients to have their cancer screenings, X-rays and other images transferred from their primary care provider to specialists at other hospital systems, for example. 

Putting rural patients’ records into an electronic system will also make it much easier to collect data and identify trends in health care across the state. Louisiana will be able to better respond to its health care challenges when it has access to more accurate and better information about health care delivery, Greenstein said. 

The rural health funding will also allow Louisiana to distribute wireless health care devices to more residents. 

Patients with chronic conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or diabetes, would be able to take readings of their blood pressure, blood sugar and blood oxygen levels at home that could then be monitored by health care providers remotely. 
This could help rural residents, who live farther away from medical facilities, when it’s necessary to see their health care providers in person and before their condition requires emergency services, Greenstein said. 
The state will also use the federal money to partner with rural health care providers to launch nutrition programs called “food FARMacies.” Rural hospitals and other providers will be given the money to provide education on diet and disease prevention through food and meal planning. They will also be sites for direct access to fresh food through collaborations with local farmers, according to the state rural funding application. 

The health department will be using some of Louisiana’s existing programs for nutrition and fitness the LSU Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge has already developed. 

Jeff Reynolds, executive director of the Rural Hospital Coalition of Louisiana, said his organization is excited about the opportunities the funding will enable, particularly when it comes to luring more health care workers to rural institutions. 

But health care experts have warned the federal government’s $50 billion rural health care fund will not be enough to make up for massive cuts to the national Medicaid program over the next decade. Those reductions, pushed by Trump, will disproportionately impact rural hospitals because their patients are more likely to have low incomes and rely on Medicaid for health insurance.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/vaughanregionalmedicalcenter_mclelland12870-1024x6831766063149-1.jpg,,,2026-01-03 06:13:13.761326

Decisions now are largely local, but state lawmakers could soon change that.","An aerial view shows an Amazon data center last year in Ashburn, Virginia. Maryland officials are trying to balance between opponents of data centers and their environmental and energy demands, and the wholesale acceptance of centers by Virginia, for their jobs and tax revenues. (Photo by Nathan Howard/Getty Images)The proposals seem to be cropping up left and right.
A vacant Social Security building in Baltimore County. A former power plant in Montgomery. An old mall site in Prince George’s. And that’s on top of a data center campus that has long been under development on a former industrial site in Frederick County.
It’s likely that large scale data centers, which have a large presence in neighboring Virginia, will make their way to Maryland in greater numbers in the years ahead. Yet, there isn’t a cohesive statewide policy regulating the arrival of these facilities, which demand immense amounts of energy. Instead, local jurisdictions wield much of the power to approve or deny projects through zoning rules.
“Local governments can make decisions that affect the entire state,” said Dave Arndt, co-chair of the Maryland Legislative Coalition Climate Justice Wing, who focuses on data centers. “If they approve a very large hyperscale data center that requires new transmission lines, new distribution lines and a new substation — and uses the same amount of electricity as the city of Baltimore — that’s going to increase our rates.”
During the coming General Assembly session, data center regulations are likely to draw some interest, as Maryland’s grid operator continues to issue dire warnings about just how much energy they’re projected to demand — and how that could send energy prices soaring ever further.
Perhaps one needn’t look any further than December’s special session, during which lawmakers overrode Gov. Wes Moore’s (D) veto of a study to evaluate data centers’ potential impact on the state, one of several studies the governor rejected.

Speaking from the Senate floor about the study, Sen. Charles Sydnor (D-Baltimore County) said his office learned over the summer about the data center proposal in Woodlawn — in his district — and has been in “fact-finding mode” ever since.
“The experts are adamant that across the country, and here in Maryland, we are currently rushing to approve data center projects through a poorly planned, chaotic process that lacks a foolproof regulatory framework to protect our communities from harm,” Sydnor said.
Sydnor argued that data center projects seem to offer benefits “only for the wealthy,” while the costs “are socialized for everyone else.”
Sen. William G. Folden (R-Frederick), speaking for an override of the governor’s veto, said looming data centers have “a very real impact. Frederick County is the first that has really started to develop our data center platforms, and right now we’re looking at a 2,200-acre parcel.”
Last session, the legislature integrated a few data center regulations in a broader package of energy reforms. For example, one provision required electric utilities to create new rate schedules for large-load customers such as data centers — subject to approval from the Maryland Public Service Commission (PSC).
“It is the intent of the General Assembly that residential retail electric customers in the State should not bear the financial risks associated with large load customers interconnecting to the electric system serving the State,” read the bill, which Moore signed in May.
But it seems clear more rule changes are coming.
For his part, the governor argues that the state should open its doors to data centers — but not without constraints.
“I do not believe in the false choice that oftentimes is being laid out: That it’s either we let Big Tech do whatever they want, and we turn intoo Northern Virginia, or it’s, don’t allow any type of economic development in the state,” Moore said during a recent news conference. “I don’t think either one of those answers are right.”
In 2024, Moore’s administration proposed a bill exempting data centers’ diesel-powered backup generators from scrutiny by the  PSC, which passed.
In his recent remarks, Moore said he envisions a process where state officials work with the impacted community, local officials and environmental groups to determine how data centers considering Maryland can contribute using “best practices,” including by bringing their own power generation along with them.
Data center woes at PJM
Under current policies, all electricity ratepayers share the costs of system expansion and maintenance. But there’s a growing push to require very large users to fund the power boosts that they require.
Maryland Gov. Wes. Moore (D) announces a new executive order focused on bolstering energy generation in Maryland on Dec. 19, 2025.
Leaders at PJM Interconnection, the operator of the nation’s largest electric grid, which includes Maryland, Washington, D.C., and a dozen other states, are currently considering a host of possible policy changes related to data centers. They’re expected to make a decision in January, after which the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission gets to make the final call.
A proposal from state governors, including Moore, called for PJM to provide incentives for data centers to bring their own power generation. A proposal from state lawmakers, including several Marylanders, would require PJM to curtail power to data centers in emergencies if they do not bring their own generation.
The need for regulatory change appears dire. At its energy capacity auction in December, PJM failed to procure all of the energy that it deemed necessary for the 2027-2028 delivery year — and the projected demand from data centers was largely to blame.
The shortfall doesn’t mean that the grid won’t be able to serve customers during the delivery year. But PJM aims to have a 20% reserve margin for power system emergencies, and it only secured 14.8%.
The shortage happened because PJM projections show there will be an increase of nearly 5,100 megawatts worth of data center demand for those years, though there is worry that the demand is being over-counted as data centers talk to multiple power companies about the same project.
PJM officials are optimistic that their policy changes could reduce the shortfall by lowering the projected toll of data centers.
“There are factors here that lead us to believe that we will actually be closer to the … standard once the delivery year arrives, because of things that we expect to change between now and 2027,” said Stu Bressler, executive vice president of market services and strategy at PJM.
Maryland isn’t ‘negotiating with an empty hand’
At the same time, Maryland is eyeing policy changes of its own.
Sen. Katie Fry Hester (D-Howard and Montgomery), said she is working on a bill that would require all data centers of a certain size to receive a certificate to operate from the PSC.
She argues that the bill would provide a new layer of state scrutiny focused on energy usage, going beyond the current permitting regime at the Maryland Department of the Environment, which is more focused on emissions and site conditions. But it would also create a state-level repository of data center proposals, making it easier to keep track of proposals.
“It’s basically a transparency bill, so that we’ll have everything in one place at the state,” Hester said.
Del. Lorig Charkoudian (D-Montgomery) said she is crafting a bill that would encourage data centers to curtail their power usage during peak periods, such as hot days, when the electrical system is taxed by heavy usage of air conditioners. The electrical system is built around withstanding the peaks, Charkoudian said, even though most of the year, the system is far from maxed out.
“I’m really focused on: When data centers are coming online in Maryland, how can they be part of the solution for the 100 hours a year where their presence is going to lead to driving up costs?” Charkoudian said.
Data centers could reduce their usage by moving particular work to non-peak periods, or pre-cooling their equipment to avoid cooling during the hottest time of the day, when the grid will be most taxed, Charkoudian said.
Charkoudian said her bill will also incentivize data centers to build battery energy storage facilities in their areas, so that they could turn to stored power during peak periods.
Arndt from the Climate Justice Wing called Charkoudian’s bill a “win-win-win situation.”

“They [data centers] stay operational. The grid stays operational. We win because we don’t have to build new peaker plants,” Arndt said, referring to plants that are called on in peak demand periods.
But it’s important that the bill continue to ensure that data centers use clean backup power during peak periods, rather than relying on fossil fuel backup generators, Arndt cautioned.
“We don’t want diesel generators running for four hours in a community just because we’re running low on energy.” Arndt said.
Angie McCarthy, Maryland conservation advocate at Nature Forward, said her group supports Charkoudian’s bill, though she knows it won’t come without controversy. She expects data center players to argue that onerous regulations could cause data centers to seek sites in nearby states such as Pennsylvania and Ohio, rather than Maryland.
“From our perspective, Maryland is seen as a prime spot for data center development, because we have such access to the fiber-optic cables and other infrastructure that Virginia has installed in their state,” McCarthy said. “We aren’t negotiating with an empty hand.”
The Maryland Tech Council, a trade association representing technology companies, has focused much of its recent messaging on the economic boost that data centers can bring to the state.
A typical 800,000 square foot data center produces about 5,000 jobs during construction, along with $775 million in economic activity and $18 million in state tax revenue, according to a Tech Council report issued in August. During operation, a typical facility spurs 500 permanent jobs, $31 million in annual compensation and $14 million in annual state tax revenue, according to the study, conducted by the Sage Policy Group, a Baltimore-based firm led by economist Anirban Basu.
In a more recent report, the Tech Council zeroed in on Prince George’s County, arguing that a “mid-sized” data center development would generate over $1 billion in economic activity during construction, and $20 million in annual tax revenue for the county.
“As other states aggressively compete for data center investment, Maryland cannot afford to sit on the sidelines,” reads the August report. “By welcoming responsible data center development, Maryland can address its immediate fiscal and economic challenges while positioning itself as a leader in the digital economy for decades to come. The time to act is now; before this opportunity, like so many others, migrates to neighboring states with more favorable business environments.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2161851139.jpg,,,2026-01-03 09:56:46.080237

Scott Applewhite/AP)The midterm elections for Congress won’t take place until November, but already a record number of members have declared their intention not to run — a total of 43 in the House, plus 10 senators. Perhaps the most high-profile person to depart, Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, announced her intention in November not just to retire but to resign from Congress entirely on Jan. 5 — a full year before her term was set to expire.
There are political dynamics that explain this rush to the exits, including frustrations with gridlock and President Donald Trump’s lackluster approval ratings, which could hurt Republicans at the ballot box.
Rather than get swept away by a prospective “blue wave” favoring Democrats — or possibly daunted by the monumental effort it would take to survive — many Republicans have decided to fold up the beach chair and head home before the wave crashes.
As of now, two dozen Republican House members have either resigned from the House or announced their intent to not run for reelection in 2026. With only two exceptions — Republicans in 2018 and 2020 — this is more departures from either party at this point in the election calendar than any other cycle over the past 20 years.
There is also growing concern within the House Republican caucus that Greene’s announcement is a canary in the coal mine and that multiple resignations will follow.
As a political scientist who studies Congress and politicians’ reelection strategies, I’m not surprised to see many House members leaving ahead of what’s shaping up to be a difficult midterm for the GOP. Still, the sheer numbers of people not running tells us something about broader dissatisfaction with Washington.
 
Why do members leave Congress?
Many planned departures are true retirements involving older and more experienced members.
For example, 78-year-old Democratic congressman Jerry Nadler is retiring after 34 years, following mounting pressure from upstart challengers and a growing consensus among Democrats that it’s time for older politicians to step aside. Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker who will turn 86 in March, is also retiring.
Sometimes, members of Congress depart for the same reasons workers might leave any job. Like many Americans, members of Congress might find something more attractive elsewhere. Retiring members are attractive hires for lobbying firms and corporations, thanks to their insider knowledge and connections within the institution. These firms usually offer much higher salaries than members are used to in Congress, which may explain why more than half of all living former members are lobbyists of some kind.
Other members remain ambitious for elective office and decide to use their position in Congress as a springboard for another position. Members of the House regularly retire to run for a Senate seat, such as, in this cycle, Democratic Rep. Haley Stevens of Michigan. Others run for executive offices, including governor, such as Republican Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina.
But some are leaving Congress due to growing frustration with the job and an inability to get things done. Specifically, many retiring members cite growing dysfunction within their own party, or in Congress as a whole, as the reason they’re moving on.
In a statement announcing his departure in June, Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., mused that “between spending another six years navigating the political theater and partisan gridlock in Washington or spending that time with my family,” it was “not a hard choice” to leave the Senate.
 
What’s unique about 2026?
In addition, there are a few other factors that can help explain why so many Republicans in particular are heading for the exits leading up to 2026.
The shifting of boundaries that has come with the mid-decade redistricting process in several states this year has scrambled members’ priorities. Unfamiliar districts can drive incumbents to early retirement by severing their connection with well-established constituencies.
In Texas, six Republicans and three Democrats — nearly a quarter of the state’s entire House delegation — are either retiring or running for other offices, due in part to that state’s new gerrymander for 2026.
All decisions about retirement and reelection are sifted through the filter of electoral and partisan considerations. A phenomenon called “thermostatic politics” predicts that parties currently in power, particularly in the White House, tend to face a backlash from voters in the following election. In other words, the president’s party nearly always loses seats in midterms.
In 2006 and 2018, for example, Republican members of Congress were weighed down by the reputations of unpopular Republican Presidents George W. Bush and Trump. Republicans had arguably even greater success in midterm elections during Barack Obama’s presidency.

Currently, 2026 looks like it will present a poor national environment for Republicans. Trump remains highly unpopular, according to polls, and Democrats are opening up a consistent lead in the “generic ballot” question, which asks respondents which party they intend to support in the 2026 midterms without reference to individual candidates.
Democrats have already been overperforming in special elections, as well as the general election in November in states such as New Jersey and Virginia, which held elections for governor. Democrats are on average running 13 points ahead of Kamala Harris’ performance in the 2024 election.
As a result, even Republicans in districts thought to be safe for their party may see themselves in enough danger to abandon the fight in advance.
 
Retirement vs. resignation
One final, unique aspect of this election cycle with major consequences is not an electoral but an institutional one.
House conservatives are quietly revolting against Speaker Mike Johnson’s leadership style. That members may be frustrated enough not just to retire but resign in advance, leaving their seats temporarily vacant, is a notable sign of dysfunction in the U.S. House.
This also could have a major impact on policy, given how slim the Republicans’ majority in the lower chamber is already. Whatever the outcome of the midterms in November, these departures clearly matter in Washington and offer important signals about the chaos in Congress.

The Chesapeake Bay Journal
One of the murkiest questions surrounding the Chesapeake Bay cleanup effort seems like it should be the easiest to answer: Is the water getting clearer?
For decades, widely used data indicate that, overall, water clarity is getting worse.
Earlier this year, for instance, the Chesapeake Bay Report Card released by the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science reported that 2024 water clarity was “very poor” and that “water clarity scores continue to show a significant decline over time.”
One of the major goals of the state-federal Bay Program partnership is to reduce the amount of sediment and nutrients entering the Bay to improve clarity so that underwater grass beds can get enough light to survive.
The region has spent billions of dollars to control sediment and nutrient-fueled algae blooms that cloud the water — seemingly without significant results.
Yet underwater grass beds in the Bay have expanded even as data seem to show that the water is murkier. The amount of submerged aquatic vegetation, or SAV, increased from 38,227 acres in 1984 to 78,451 acres last year.

If the water is cloudy, how are grasses getting enough light to expand?
A recent analysis published in the Annual Review of Marine Science came up with an answer, though it is murky too: The amount of light available for plants is improving, even if it doesn’t always look that way.
“For a long time, the story was that we’ve been cleaning up the watershed, but clarity is not improving,” said Jessie Turner, an assistant professor in the Department of Ocean and Earth Sciences at Old Dominion University, who was the lead author of the journal article.
“That has switched, but it was hard to untangle things,” she said.
Turner has been trying to sort out the story for nearly a decade, first as a student at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science and then in her current position. Former colleagues from VIMS and the University of Delaware are co-authors of the article.
It turns out that how far we see into the water — how visibly “clear” it is — is not the same thing as how much light is passing through that water.
The Bay goal is to get more light to underwater plants, but the main tool for measuring clarity has been the Secchi disk — a black and white disk that is lowered into the water until it disappears. The Secchi disk is cheap and easy to use and has been relied upon for decades by researchers and citizen scientists.
But it measures visual clarity, not the amount or quality of light that might be reaching plants on the bottom.
Bay water is filled with tiny particles. Some are bits of sediment, but many are tiny algae cells and microscopic bits of detritus from organic material that is breaking down in the water.
Those organic particles limit visibility, but they don’t block light waves. Instead, they scatter them, reflecting light through the water column. Turner likens it to headlights in a fog bank. The headlights brighten the fog, which is made up of tiny water particles, but a driver can’t see very far into it.
“You can have a lot of light getting to your eyeball in the fog, but the visibility is very poor,” Turner said. “In the water, that would look like a very shallow Secchi depth reading. But you still have enough light for something like seagrass.”
“What ultimately matters to something like SAV is how much light is getting to the bottom,” she said.
When Turner and her colleagues examined historical data gathered with specialized light sensors, they found a different trend than those seen with Secchi disks.
Data from those sensors, which assess the amount of sunlight that is penetrating the water, including the specific wavelengths that are important for plant photosynthesis, show improvements since around 1990.

Many factors affect clarity and light availability, and their relative importance varies from place to place. Sorting them out is complex. For instance, the amount of sediment in the water has slowly declined over time. That has helped clear the water, but clearer water allows for more algal growth, Turner said, which in turn contributes to more tiny particles of organic material. The particles gradually settle to the bottom but are easily resuspended.
That can cloud the water from a Secchi disk perspective, but the increased amount of tiny organic particles, rather than larger sediment particles, can improve light.
Trying to understand all those factors, Turner said, “is a little bit of a maze.”
Water clarity is still important, she noted. Someone diving in the Bay wants to be able to see where they are going, and someone throwing a fishing line into the water wants a fish to be able to spot bait at the end of the line.
Future nutrient reductions should further reduce algae production, and over time that could improve clarity. That might be happening — Secchi disk readings in the last decade do show a slight improvement.
But it’s hard to predict whether Bay clarity goals will be met, Turner said. That’s because the Bay system has been fundamentally changed over the decades by things such as marsh loss, shoreline hardening and the transformation of its watershed to meet the needs of a growing population.
“A recovered Chesapeake Bay with improved water clarity may not resemble the ecosystem that we predict or expect,” Turner wrote in the paper. As a result, the future Bay may have a mix of different particle types and sizes than it did in the past, which means expectations about future clarity may be altered as well.
The good news is that even if clarity goals are not fully attained, continued light improvements will have ecological benefits, especially for grass beds, which will result in healthier ecosystems over time and more habitat for fish and crabs.
“We may get to a point where you still can’t see the bottom when you go swimming in a lot of places,” Turner said. “But if the ecosystem is healthy in terms of what’s living in it, then maybe that’s a success story in and of itself.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/692f0bc449c13-1-1024x667.jpeg,,,2026-01-03 10:56:54.767648

In 2023, the Office for Disciplinary Counsel, which handles discipline for members of the state bar, filed a complaint alleging Knudsen broke rules of professional conduct in 41 separate counts — which Knudsen’s lawyers described as a “political stunt.”
Subsequently, in 2024, the Commission on Practice, which regulates lawyers, recommended the state Supreme Court suspend him for 90 days. Knudsen is a Republican in his second term as AG.
In an order Wednesday, the Supreme Court, which included five district court judges as a majority of the state’s highest court recused themselves, dismissed the recommendation to suspend Knudsen, citing in part violations to his due process rights, although Justice Katherine Bidegaray dissented.
But the court had to grapple with a number of points in its deliberations, including arguments that Knudsen, as an elected official in the executive branch, couldn’t be regulated by another branch of government.
The court opinion, written by Chief Justice Cory Swanson, created precedent in stating that the Attorney General is subject to the Commission on Practice and ultimate jurisdiction of the Montana Supreme Court.
In recent years in Montana, Republicans including Knudsen have been highly critical of the judiciary.

While the court asserted its own jurisdiction and dismissed much of the case against Knudsen, Swanson wrote that Knudsen’s actions “throughout the saga of 2021 were beyond what we have seen any competent attorney, let alone the Attorney General, do.”
Swanson added that the opinion of the court “suffices as the Court’s public admonition regarding the rule violations.”
“Moreover, we plainly warn all Montana attorneys, including Knudsen and his subordinates, to obey lawful orders of all courts,” the opinion said.
In the opinion, the court also addressed whether Knudsen had been afforded due process, and whether the allegations against him were factual. 
In addressing the specific complaints against Knudsen, mostly related to disobeying court orders and making statements critical of the Supreme Court, the ruling found that Knudsen violated two rules of professional conduct, but that the Commission “failed to provide legal justification” and proof that he had violated three other rules of professional conduct. 
However, the court also found several instances where Knudsen successfully argued that his due process had been violated. 
In one instance, the Commission excluded an expert witness without allowing Knudsen time to respond to a motion, while in another the court stated that the Commission issued “inadequate conclusions of law.”
“This due process violation alone is sufficiently serious to vacate the Commission’s decision and remand it for a new proceeding or entry of an amended decision explaining its conclusions of law,” the ruling stated. But, “given the time, expense and turmoil that have exceeded all expectations in this proceeding, we have no intention of remanding this matter for another round.”
The majority opinion used those instances as reasoning for dismissal and for not disciplining Knudsen for the actions that were proven violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct, a justification Bidegaray described as “unprecedented” in her dissent. 
In a statement, Knudsen expressed his appreciation for the Supreme Court “bringing this frivolous complaint to a long-overdue conclusion.”
“We’ve said it from the very beginning, this was nothing more than a political stunt,” Knudsen said. 
 DISSENT

While the five district court judges appointed to hear the case agreed with Swanson, Supreme Court Justice Katherine Bidegaray, one of the court’s newest members, dissented, arguing that finding a lawyer broke rules of conduct but refusing to discipline them weakened the court’s authority and erodes confidence in the legal system. 
Bidegaray said the court record, and state precedent, don’t justify nullifying Knudsen’s disciplinary record “or insulating an elected attorney from professional accountability.”
While she concurred with much of the majority opinion, she added that she would hold Knudsen violated a third professional rule of conduct by disobeying a court order that “was prejudicial to the administration of justice.”
She also pushed back against the conclusions that Knudsen’s due process rights were violated by the Commission, and that none of the actions taken resulted in substantial prejudice against him — indeed a two-day hearing, plus the Supreme Court’s ability to review the written decisions, gave Knudsen his due process, she wrote. 
But Bidegaray’s biggest dissent came from the “unprecedented and extraordinary decision” to not discipline Knudsen for the professional violations the court agreed Knudsen committed. 
“There has never been a case where this Court dismissed a disciplinary action while also holding that the attorney committed proven misconduct,” she wrote. “Until today.”
She added that dismissal ultimately nullifies the entire proceedings of the case, and “such a remedy is incompatible with our constitutional obligation to regulate the bar and protect the public.”
Bidegaray also pointed out some irregularities in how the Supreme Court handled the case, comparing them to ones made by Commission that were considered egregious enough to warrant due process violations. 
“The Court appears to have a different standard for adherence to its own procedural rules in these proceedings,” she wrote.
Bidegaray wrote she would impose a public censure, a 30-day suspension and require Knudsen to pay for litigation costs.
“Discipline is not punitive; it is protective—of the public, the courts, and the profession—and serves to preserve confidence in the fair and orderly administration of justice,” she wrote.
In the majority opinion, Swanson noted Bidegaray’s dissent and stated that while her arguments could be correct, the failings by the Commission throughout the process — with due process requirements, and inadequate findings of fact and conclusions of law — precluded such a conclusion. 
“When an attorney — from the newest associate in the smallest firm to the elected official who supervises more lawyers than any other in the state — faces a potential loss of professional licensing, then we expect the proceeding to carry the burden of persuasion and uphold the procedural due process standards written in the rules and in our caselaw,” Swanson wrote. “The Commission failed to do so in numerous respects here, and we only weaken our regulation of the practice of law if we overlook those violations.”

Growth will inevitably continue in Vermont, but is growth something we want to promote or try to manage? 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Jerry Ward and John Bossange: Hijacking the abundance myth.","Jerry Ward lives in Randolph and is a retired physician. John Bossange lives in South Burlington and is a retired school principal. Both serve on the Board of Directors of Better (Not Bigger) Vermont.



The panic stirred up by some of our leaders regarding the so-called housing crisis appears to be rooted in a loosely defined abundance narrative that has been adopted to justify rapid growth without fully accounting for its consequences.
Recent commentaries published in VTDigger by Julie Moore, secretary of the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources; Kerrick Johnson, commissioner of the Vermont Department of Public Service; and Miro Weinberger, executive chair of Let’s Build Homes, try to assert that we need to build 40,000 new homes within the next four years. Even Gov. Phil Scott has issued a controversial executive order to boost housing production. Adding to this rush to grow, the Vermont Futures Project has proposed increasing the Vermont population to 802,000. We feel that these initiatives, when combined, are leading us down a path toward growth that will not serve us well.
Growth will inevitably continue in Vermont, but is growth something we want to promote or try to manage? Healthy growth occurs naturally when we foster the conditions that support growth. It is unnecessary and irresponsible to start by building 40,000 new homes by 2030, and we certainly don’t need to increase our population by 150,000 within the decade, especially in Chittenden County, as promoted by the Vermont Futures Project.
We have no argument with those who believe Vermont desperately needs more affordable apartments, duplexes, multifamily homes, condominiums and single-family starter homes. But that is not what has been happening for the last 20 years in Chittenden County, and that’s not what the housing industry is proposing for the future. As we know, there are numerous negative impacts from short-sighted, unsustainable, sprawling growth on municipal services, and it’s the taxpayers who ultimately bear the burden from expensive, market-driven development projects.
The most disappointing and glaring omission in the abundance discussion is simply defining abundance. Of what? Some abundance proponents focus on more energy and less regulation to promote economic development, while advocates in Vermont are focusing on housing. But what happens if we unfetter the constraints imposed by energy, natural resources and Vermont’s strong environmental regulations, and we build those new homes?
Do we not then need an abundance of more clean water? Agricultural land to produce more food? More storm, sewer and water treatment systems? More waste and recycle facilities? More municipal personnel in our towns and village offices? Teachers for the new children. Police, fire responders and maintenance workers for our roads and parklands, to mention just a few impacts of more energy, housing and people? Abundance leads to a need for more abundance, and that has not been adequately addressed by the proponents of the Abundance Agenda in Vermont. That’s the abundance myth.
As a nation, we are conflicted about growth and yet addicted to it. Our existential challenge is to accept a vision of growth within our limited financial capacity and shrinking natural resources. Shortsighted, unsustainable growth is enticing because of the apparent short-term improvements to our standard of living. However, the long-term impacts can bring irreparable damage to what feels like home. Increasingly, we are dealing with the consequences of negative impacts and not planning accordingly for sustainable growth.
Struggling to find an affordable place to live, to pay for all the impacts resulting from an abundance of excessive growth, is the unavoidable but unaddressed elephant in the room. So far, none of the individuals mentioned at the beginning of this commentary or any representative from the organizations they represent have addressed this issue.
Here in Vermont, the home affordability crisis is exacerbated by the growing capture of the housing market by large equity firms and out-of-state investors who purchase single-family homes and rental properties, reducing homeownership opportunities and driving up the cost of rents and housing prices. For those abundance advocates concerned with inhibitors of growth, it is large corporations with lobbying teams that deserve everyone’s greater scrutiny, not necessarily state or local regulations enforced by our small towns and villages.
So, when Moore, Johnson, Weinberger and Scott talk about reducing costs, or about opponents preserving the existing regulatory barriers, or write that we need affordable housing, or that Vermont needs an abundance agenda, or that environmentalists are creating political theater, or that too many families remain priced out of the communities where they grew up, keep in mind the exploitation of the Abundance Agenda, that unspoken elephant in the room. Abundance inevitably leads to a need for more services and natural resources. For private investors, corporations and out-of-state profiteers, that’s not their concern. Vermont’s proposed Abundance Agenda is a gold mine for them, unattainable for most struggling Vermonters.
Abundance needs to be for everyone, not just for those who will destroy our environment, deplete our natural resources and make excessive profits. If it does not, abundance, as defined by influential leaders in Vermont, will remain a hijacked myth and a tool for the rich to get richer.

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — Clarkson Regional Health Services, the University of Nebraska Medical Center’s longtime private partner in providing medical care and hospital services, is offering the university system a chance to buy out its share of the Nebraska Medicine partnership for $500 million, both groups announced Friday.
The NU Board of Regents is set to consider the transaction in a discussion and vote planned Jan. 9 that appears to have already secured significant political support, including from Gov. Jim Pillen, a former NU regent. He said the change, if approved, would help keep the hospital in Nebraska hands.
“I strongly support this transaction, because it will directly benefit the citizens of our great state by bringing them better health care and by further strengthening the University of Nebraska system,” Pillen said in a statement.
University officials said it was not yet clear how much of the $500 million would be privately funded and how much would be sought from state taxpayers as part of a budget process that NU acknowledges comes at a time when the purse strings are already tight from a projected revenue shortfall, and campuses have already faced budget cuts.
Dr. Jeffrey Gold, president of the NU system and a former UNMC chancellor, said patients would see no changes in the care or cost of medical care they receive in a Nebraska Medicine clinic or to the group’s health care workforce support structure that stretches “border to border.”
The key difference would be Nebraska Medicine’s governance structure shifting from two owners to one, he said. Many Nebraskans already assume UNMC runs the Med Center and don’t know that Nebraska Medicine’s clinics have involved Clarkson as a private partner since 1997, or that the east Omaha hospital has since the 1950s.
Gold said UNMC and the NU system would benefit from joining top fellow academic medical centers at the University of Iowa, the University of Michigan and Ohio State University, which oversee the clinical and hospital side of respective medical nonprofits, in addition to the medical training and teaching. 
The new-look Nebraska Medicine would still be governed by the Nebraska Medicine board, not the NU Board of Regents, Gold explained. That group has a duty to make sure the hospital is providing quality care to patients.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“What does the average consumer really care about this?” Gold asked, repeating a reporter’s question. “The answer really is what I would characterize as stability, to make us, from a governance perspective, look a lot more like our peers.”
Part of the transaction is also valuable for helping UNMC consolidate Clarkson properties around the Med Center campus, where growth and construction cranes are as common as ambulance arrivals. And Clarkson, which helped the university build the core hospital building at 42nd and Dewey Streets, has pledged a $200 million gift to help replace it.
Today, the buildings around UNMC that house doctors’ offices and the Clarkson Tower at Nebraska Medical Center are owned by Clarkson and made available for use by Nebraska Medicine at drastically reduced leases or for no lease at all.
Gold says renters occupy much of those Clarkson properties, and he expects the combination of revenues from that real estate, debt service and some public dollars to be used to cover and recoup the $500 million, though funders are still sorting out the mix. He said none of the public project funding would pull from the budgets of other NU campuses. 
Considering the quality of health care offered at Nebraska Medicine, Gold said he could see a scenario in which some of the revenue streams provided by Nebraska Medicine could help keep NU tuition more affordable than it might be otherwise.
Clarkson, for its part, appears poised to transition from its longtime focus on providing health care to using funds from the sale to grow a private foundation focused on grants aimed at making Nebraska the healthiest state and improving how health care is delivered here.
“Clarkson’s partnership with the university to establish and grow Nebraska Medicine has been a successful one, and we are proud of the advancements we have made together in serving our community,” said Jim Landen, chairman of the Clarkson board. 
Dr. Bill Lydiatt, CEO of Clarkson and a head-and-neck surgical oncologist, said he is excited to give to its longtime partners at NU and “provide them with the best path toward continuing the important work of Nebraska Medicine, including serving as one of the finest teaching hospitals.”
Gold understands he and NU will face financial skeptics on and off campus by seeking a $500 million project at a time of slimmer budgets, but he said the other options for UNMC clinical partners would have involved private partners from out of state, including some he called “far less attractive.”
His goal, if the regents agree, is to close the transaction within a six-month window and keep building. 
“This is as much to protect this critical asset as a Nebraska public asset as it is anything else,” Gold said.

Sarah Andrews is a reporter with the Community News Service, part of the University of Vermont’s Reporting & Documentary Storytelling program.
WATERBURY — For 48 years, George Woodard woke up before dawn and milked his cows. His day would end the same way, in his barn with the herd. 
For many of those years, Woodard’s 200-acre farm was booming. Now, the milking stalls in his barn sit empty, only occasionally visited by Woodard and his tabbycat, Jack. 
“It was a time which was precious. And it’s gone,” Woodard said.
Waterbury was once a dairy town. It’s home to Ben & Jerry’s Factory Store, a magnet for tourists seeking socially-responsible, locally-sourced ice cream.
But if they want to see a working dairy farm, they’ll have to go elsewhere. Rising costs of production and competition from ever-growing commercial dairies have driven out Waterbury’s dairy farms.
Until recently, Waterbury was home to three commercial dairy farms: the Wallaces’, the Davises’, and the Woodards’. Today, there are none.

Ten years ago, a fire destroyed Rosina Wallace’s dairy barn, killing her entire herd of 23 cows. After that, it was too expensive to start over. 
“The dairy industry does not want small farmers,” Wallace said. “Financially, it was just impossible for me to get back into it.”
In 1943, Mark Davis’ grandparents bought nearly 200 acres of grazing land to start their farm. 
Davis started milking when he was 14. Later, his wife, Maureen, and their children all took part in managing the herd of more than 40 cows – it’s not a job that can be done alone. 
Davis stopped milking about two years ago, after years of losing money.
“It was a great job, a great way to grow up, a great way to raise our kids. But it’s a very hard way to make a living,” Davis said. “It’s bad for a while, and then it gets worse.”
Woodard’s grandfather bought their Loomis Hill farm in 1912. He used the land for logging and sugaring. 
In 1973, Woodard graduated from Vermont Technical College and returned to Loomis Hill. He started by buying 10 heifer calves. Then, he bought 10 more. By December of 1975, the Woodards started shipping milk.
Across town, Wallace’s great-grandfather bought their Blush Hill Road farmland in 1866. For many years, it was mainly operating as a maple farm and fruit orchard. Wallace’s father decided to transition the farm to dairy after he finished college.
As Wallace’s father got older, he asked her to take over the farm. Wallace couldn’t wait. 
“I grew up helping on the farm all the time. It just never occurred to me that I could be the farmer,” Wallace said. “I gladly came back to the farm and worked with my dad to learn everything.” 
In the 2000s, the price that large milk buyers offered small farms plummeted. They reduced the amount of milk purchased from small dairies. 
Woodard and Wallace, like many other small dairies, started producing organic milk. The buyers were willing to pay more, and demand was higher.
The costs were higher, too. Organic feed was expensive, and the demands of keeping the herd healthy were high. 
“The last 10 years that I farmed, I was organic,” Wallace said. “I thought being organic would help me to be able to stay healthier financially, but then the price of the grain more than doubled.”
Davis didn’t go organic, but expenses still soared. The price farmers received for their milk just couldn’t keep up with the rising costs of feed, maintenance, labor, and processing.  
“My dad had a saying about it. The milk price goes in cycles; it’s bad for a while, and then it gets worse,” Wallace said. 
Dairy death spiral
Those rising costs led to a loss of the support businesses that dairy farms depend upon – a sort of dairy death spiral.
Throughout the 20th century, Waterbury had an agricultural economy. There were two creameries in town, and a large animal veterinarian.
Over time, as small dairies started to close, so did those supporting agricultural services. Emergency veterinarians became harder to find, coming from Waitsfield or Warren. When Waterbury’s creameries closed, shipping milk became more costly. 
As processing shifted to larger plants, milk had to move larger distances, putting small dairies at a disadvantage, said Silene DeCiucies. She’s with the Center for an Agricultural Economy, a nonprofit that advocates for local farmers.
“The economy of scale is very real in dairy, and there’s nothing going against it currently in Vermont,” DeCiucies said.
The story of dairy in Waterbury mirrors the trends in Vermont as a whole. Over the last decade, the number of dairy farms in Vermont has fallen from more than 900 to fewer than 500 today.
As Vermont loses dairy farms, the remaining ones are becoming larger. Graph via Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food & Markets.
Meanwhile, the size of those remaining farms has increased. Only 2% were considered large farms a decade ago; now, 9% have herds of 700 or more cows.
These changing economic factors slowly pushed Davis, Woodard and Wallace out of milking. Davis says 2014 was the last year his farm turned a profit. 
“I should have stopped 20 years earlier than I did, because, you know, we were feeding a lot of money that was made in the past back into it, just to keep things going,” Davis said.

In 2021, Woodard stopped milking. Davis followed two years later. Now, both farmers run small beef operations. Beef requires less labor, and the costs of production are lower and more stable. 
Woodard now has 10 cattle, Davis has 26. Instead of going to the barn every 12 hours to milk, the farmers spend their time managing the pasture and feed. It’s a much easier way to farm. 
Dairy farming is hard work, and after almost 50 years, Davis welcomes the change of pace.
“I’ve spent my whole lifetime looking for an off switch on a cow, and I’ve never found one,” Davis said.
After the fire destroyed Wallace’s barn and she lost her herd, dairy farming was no longer an option. 
“I really miss it. And if I’d had my choice, I’d still be dairy farming.” Wallace said. “The good thing is I never would have been smart enough to stop when I should have.”
Wallace doesn’t plan to make the transition to raising beef. For her, sending her animals to be processed for beef is too emotionally difficult. 
“For me, the hardest part of dairy farming was determining when I had to pronounce a death sentence for an animal,” Wallace said.
She now takes care of two alpacas, whose wool she processes for textiles. Her farm also is home to her two beloved steers, Ferdinand and Gad.
But that farm no longer turns a profit. Wallace now works at the Cabot Creamery Store, another tourist-focused dairy attraction down the road from Ben & Jerry’s. 
“It’s what I really, really, really like doing, but as long as I have my animals and I’m not making enough money off my animals to keep going, I keep my day job,” Wallace said.
Can small dairy farms survive?
Waterbury’s experience begs the question — Is it possible for any small dairy farm to survive in today’s Vermont?
Laura Ginsburg, an expert at the Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food, and Markets, thinks so.
“People sometimes get stuck at looking at what’s worked in the past, that it should work into the future. But we’re in a very different place today than we were even five years ago,” Ginsburg said.
There is a stable market for organic dairy, and she said innovations can cut costs. 
“I do think there is opportunity, it’s just going to look different than it’s looked in the past,” said Ginsburg.
Young farmers are struggling to start their own dairies. Land costs are just too high. 
“You can only get so much manure in a 5-gallon bucket. And when the 5-gallon bucket is full, there’s no room left for anything else,” Woodard said.
“The same thing has happened with land. You can’t buy a farm anymore,” Woodard said
Today, dairy farming is gone in Waterbury, and it doesn’t seem likely to return. Wallace recognizes that large dairy farms are likely to continue to outcompete smaller ones. 
“Some things change, but some things stay the same, and the whole idea of getting bigger in order to survive probably isn’t going to go away,” Wallace said.
High land prices offer an easy way for struggling farmers to exit the business. But even though they are done with dairy, Wallace, Woodard, and Davis plan to continue farming on their land as long as they are able.
“You’re sitting on a gold mine, but the only way you can, you know, retrieve the gold is to get off the gold mine,” Davis said.
Woodard doesn’t know what the next century will bring to his farm. He says it’s unlikely his kids will want to farm.
But running one of the last dairy farms in Waterbury was a good life, he said — one he would not trade.
“If you’ve got a farm, OK, you’re not going to be making a whole crap load of money, but at the end of 50 years, you still have that place, and you’ve made a living on that place,” Woodard said. 
Wallace has no children, so her niece will take over the fifth-generation farm someday. She hopes her niece will continue to run it as a farm.
“Brown cows and green grass is a beautiful sight,” Wallace said.

The wounded man, Jaime Gomez, 18, was taken to Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, New Hampshire, where he was continuing to receive care, Vermont State Police said in a press release Friday.

State police, who are heading up the investigation, had reported Thursday that Gomez was in stable condition. He is facing two felony charges, state police said.
Police had released few details about the Thursday morning shooting prior to issuing the press release late Friday afternoon that provided more information. According to the release, at about 6 a.m. Thursday, local police received a call reporting a disturbance at the Fox Run Inn on Main Street. 
Warfle responded to the scene and encountered Gomez who, according to the release, was reported “to be agitated and destroying property” there.
“Video of the encounter shows the chief spoke with Gomez and attempted to de-escalate the situation,” the release stated, adding that as Warfle spoke to a witness, Gomez approached them and refused to follow Warfle’s commands.
Gomez, the release stated, then “pulled an item from his pocket and lunged at the chief. At that point Chief Warfle fired his service weapon, striking Gomez, who then dropped a knife.”
The release did not specify how many shots Warfle fired or where Gomez was struck.
After the shooting, Warfle called for medical assistance for Gomez and for additional first responders to come to the scene, the release stated.
The state police have obtained an arrest warrant for Gomez on one count of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and another of attempted aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, according to the release. It’s unclear who the victim was in connection with each charge.
State police referred questions about Warfle’s employment status to the Ludlow Police Department. A person who answered a call to the police department Friday afternoon said Warfle was on leave and would not be back for a few days. 
The Vermont Attorney General’s Office and a county state’s attorney’s office will conduct separate use-of-force reviews into the shooting to determine if the police chief’s actions were legally justified.
The last police-involved shooting in Ludlow took place in August 2022, when Ludlow Police Officer Zachary Paul fatally shot 35-year-old Michael Mills, of Cavendish, following a car chase. Mills was reportedly dealing with a mental health crisis and had made many calls to police that night before the pursuit. Reviews by the Vermont Attorney General’s Office and the Orange County State’s Attorney’s Office found that Paul’s use of force was “objectively reasonable and justified.”
Paul, who was 21 at the time, had recently joined the Ludlow Police Department after graduating from the Vermont Police Academy. At the time of the shooting, Warfle was in the cruiser with Paul and was his field training officer. Warfle did not fire his gun during the incident. 
Warfle, who was appointed Ludlow’s police chief last year, had previously worked as a Rutland City police officer. In that position, he was the subject of a Brady letter in February 2019. The letters are filed by prosecutors when an officer’s credibility is called into question and can often mean the end of an officer’s career. 
Then-Rutland County State’s Attorney Rose Kennedy drafted the letter. She said the letter stemmed from Warfle issuing a citation to a person on a charge of disorderly conduct, but following a complaint Warfle admitted that the person’s conduct did not rise to the level of a charge. 
According to the state police press release Friday, Warfle has been cooperating with investigators but had yet to be interviewed.

(Photo by Lance Cpl. Harleigh Faulk/U.S. Marine Corps)Even as Baltimore celebrates a historic drop in homicides, everyone seems to have a different opinion about whether crime by the city’s young people is falling, rising, changing, or staying the same. When those opinions are based on a personal experience of harm, they deserve compassion and support. When they are not, it is reasonable to ask, What evidence are we drawing from?
With support from the Abell Foundation, I have been tracking available youth justice data to fact-check commonly heard claims about Baltimore crime involving young people and to gauge how the system is responding.
Here are some of the things I found: Youth offending has mostly continued its long decline in Baltimore, as it has nationally; the COVID-19 pandemic was a tremendous disruptor that made at least three years — 2020, 2021 and 2022 — unreliable outliers in almost any extended trend analysis; and the youth justice system, in Baltimore and statewide, deserves a lot more informed scrutiny.
Arrest data is a widely accepted, if imperfect, measure of youth offending. Recently published studies show that arrests of young people in Baltimore and across the nation have been trending down for many years, took a deep dive during the COVID-19 pandemic, and began recovering to pre-pandemic levels around 2023. The most reliable long-term data for Baltimore, from the state’s Department of Juvenile Services (DJS), shows that FY 2019 was the last year of a steady decline prior to the appearance of COVID-19, with 1,387 “complaints”—incidents reported to the agency by police and other sources. By FY 2021, when the pandemic was having its greatest impact, DJS received just 582 complaints. The numbers have rebounded since then, to 1,768 in FY 2025, but they are still well below levels recorded prior to FY 2019.

A corollary to widespread concerns about youth offending are frequently heard complaints about how the justice system is holding Baltimore young people accountable for crimes they may have committed. Once again, the evidence is not what media headlines might lead us to believe; in some ways the data suggest we are being too tough.
Maryland’s practice of automatically sending some arrested youth directly into the adult criminal justice system based on charges from police and prosecutors is one example. This practice — which Maryland does more than nearly every other state — has youths 17 and younger facing adult sentences and, if convicted, possible time in adult facilities.
Yet data published online by the Governor’s Office of Crime Prevention and Protection (GOCPP) shows that since FY 2021 the most common autocharge offense statewide has been illegal gun possession. According to data shared directly by GOCPP,  in Baltimore illegal gun charges have been the most common autocharge offense since at least FY 2019. In FY 2024 they accounted for nearly half — 45% — of all such charges in the city.
No one disputes that kids and illegal guns are an awful combination that demands serious attention and action. But research has shown that most youth who arm themselves do so because they are afraid, not because they want to hurt someone.
New interventions like DJS’ Thrive Academy and the city’s Group Violence Reduction Strategy suggest there may be better ways to allay these fears than months of pretrial detention and threats of time in an adult prison — which, in addition to being expensive, are known to increase the risk of recidivism and result in poor long-term outcomes, such as lost education, reduced job opportunities and compromised health.
Among the most important findings, however, is that agencies within the juvenile justice system could do a better job working together to help the public understand aggregate data about system-involved kids. DJS publishes a vast amount of information once a year about youth in its care. But this agency represents only a portion of the juvenile justice system.
At the very least, data from all of the relevant agencies, including the state’s Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services, could be made more compatible. As it is, seemingly interchangeable categories tracked by different agencies — like “arrests,” “complaints,” “charges” and “cases” — mask crucial distinctions that make cross-agency comparisons difficult, if not impossible.
Baltimore’s young people are associated with less than 10% of the city’s crime. Yet when it comes to talk about community safety, our kids are front and center. Making youth justice data more accessible and better understood could keep public opinion from being disproportionately shaped by rumor, algorithms and media headlines about individual incidents. The result could be policy solutions that are better for kids, communities, and limited state budgets alike.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/9349996-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-03 12:11:50.111443

(Photo via Getty Images)Drivers using their phones outside of hands-free or voice-activated modes now face a $100 fine as Iowa’s 2025 distracted driving law goes into full effect.
The measure, signed into law by Gov. Kim Reynolds in April 2025, expanded Iowa’s previous ban on texting while driving to ban all handheld use of personal electronic devices while driving. Iowa is the 31st state to enact a “hands free” law.
Although the law took effect July 1, law enforcement officers were only able issue warnings throughout 2025. But as of Jan. 1, 2026, drivers are now subject to fines for breaking the law. The baseline fine is $100 for using a phone while texting, increasing to $500 in cases if the incident results in an injury, and to $1,000 in incidents that cause a death.
In a December recording of “Iowa Press,” Larry Grant, state safety planner for the Iowa Department of Transportation, said in 2025, Iowa saw a major reduction in traffic fatalities in comparison to previous years. According to DOT data, there were 260 traffic deaths in 2025 — a total of 97 fewer deaths than in 2024 and a nearly a century low. Public officials say the hands-free law, as well as other factors like people complying with other safety laws by wearing seatbelts or obeying speed limits, have contributed to the state seeing fewer deadly traffic incidents in the past year.

“Now granted, one fatality is too many, and everybody needs to realize that — but we’re we’re down 77 fatalities on average right now,” Grant said at the Dec. 12 recording. “And if you go back for our high in the last five years, we’re down over 100 fatalities. That’s 100 lives that are still here. So that’s just huge when we look at that.”
Other states that have passed similar “hands-free” measures, including Iowa’s neighbors Minnesota and Illinois, have also seen reductions in car crashes and traffic deaths since enacting these restrictions.
Part of the reason fines did not start until 2026 was in an effort to give time for drivers to learn about the new law. Sgt. Alex Dinkla, an Iowa State Patrol spokesperson and Brett Tjepkes, chief of the Governor’s Traffic Safety Bureau, said in December the state and law enforcement officers have made a major push to inform people about the new “hands-free” law through educational materials and distributing pamphlets at rest areas and driver’s licensing stations.
Dinkla said in his experience, most people “probably are aware” of the new law, but that he has still encountered some drivers who do not know about the change.
Many newer cars — and a majority of smartphones — are able to enter hands-free mode to ensure compliance with the law, Dinkla said.
“Something that we had to kind of work through, I think with the public and messaging, is that you don’t have to have a new vehicle with all of the technology involved in it,” he said. “Almost every phone that’s out there will make a hands-free call. You can ask Siri, you can ask Alexa, and or even just a one touch which the law allows for, but it can’t be in your hand.”
The law was signed in 2025 after several years of stalling in the legislative process, despite having strong support from law enforcement and safety advocates as well as from families of victims who died in distracted driving incidents.
“It wasn’t one person that did this,” Dinkla said. “It wasn’t one department that did this. This was a collective effort amongst many folks. You heard stories of people that were involved in texting and driving. They championed trying to get that across the finish line. The Governor’s Traffic Safety Bureau, many other city, county supporters with that. So it was definitely a collective effort.”

Melinda S. Spencer, 35, was also charged with abuse of a corpse and tampering with physical evidence, according to police. It’s unclear how far along her pregnancy was. Kentucky has very few and only narrow exceptions to its abortion ban. 
According to a KSP news release, a medical clinic in Campton contacted state police on Dec. 31 around 2:30 p.m. and reported that “there was a lady in the clinic (who) disclosed that she had aborted her pregnancy at her residence.” 
After police arrived at United Clinic, they said, the woman “stated to detectives that she had ordered medication online to complete an abortion” and “took the medication which resulted in the death of a developed male infant.” 
After that, police said, she “buried the infant on the backside of her property in a shallow grave.” Police say they went to the residence property and “located the infant in a shallow grave.” 
The case is still under investigation. 
Kentucky state law defines first degree fetal homicide as causing  “the death of an unborn child” except when a person “acted under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance for which there was a reasonable explanation or excuse.” The crime  is considered a capital offense in Kentucky. 
The woman’s other charges — abuse of a corpse and tampering with physical evidence are Class D felonies. 
Kentucky state law describes abuse of a corpse as treatment “that would outrage ordinary family sensibilities” and includes burial without proper preparation.

The legislation (SB 1032) by Sen. Alexis Calatayud, R-Miami, also would allow doctors to significantly increase the supply limits that qualified doctors can prescribe to patients. The bill would allow doctors to issue certifications for up to 10 70-day supply limits of smokeable medical marijuana, rather than three. Doctors could also issue up to 20 35-day supply limits instead of the existing six.
The proposal would waive the $75 registration and annual renewal fees to receive a medical marijuana ID card for any military veteran honorably discharged from the U.S. armed forces.
A similar measure (HB 719) was filed in the House last month by Rep. Bill Partington, R-Ormond Beach. His bill would go further by requiring the Florida Department of Health to establish reciprocity agreements allowing patients from other states to qualify for a registration card “within 1 business day.”
Partington’s bill also would allow doctors to recommend medical cannabis via telehealth visits for initial consultations. Existing Florida law allows telehealth visits only when patients have their cards renewed.
There are 929,655 medical marijuana patients in Florida, according to the Office of Medical Marijuana Use. To remain in the program, each patient must renew his or her ID card with the state every 12 months at $75 per clip. They must renew certification by their doctors every 210 days, or approximately seven months from the date the physician certifies. Those fees vary by clinic and location across the state, generally ranging between $100 to $200.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/medical-marijuana-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-02 16:57:33.483371

The Delaware City Refining Company has appealed a recent state order requiring the rapid installation of real-time fenceline air-monitoring sensors, arguing that the mandate’s 70-day timeline is technically infeasible and risks producing unreliable data rather than meaningful public protection.
On Friday, Dec. 12, 2025, Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control Secretary Gregory Patterson issued an order directing the refinery to install and operate real-time sensors around the facility to monitor volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, following a butane release in late November that was later determined to have lasted significantly longer than initially reported.
In a statement released this week, the refinery said its engineers evaluated available monitoring technologies and concluded that installing a system capable of reliably meeting DNREC’s specifications within the required timeframe is not feasible. Company officials said they have notified DNREC of those findings and are seeking to amend the order to allow adequate time to select appropriate technology, identify suitable monitoring locations, and establish a realistic installation schedule.
The refinery said it is working cooperatively with DNREC and has formally appealed the order to allow for a compliance plan that balances transparency with technical accuracy.
State’s Rationale for the Order
DNREC issued the expedited order after a release of butane and related VOCs that the refinery initially reported as lasting less than two hours but later acknowledged continued for approximately 19 hours, from Nov. 26 into Nov. 27. While the Delaware Division of Public Health concluded the release posed no immediate or long-term health threat, DNREC said the delayed detection left regulators and the public without real-time information during the incident.
Under the order, the refinery would be required to install fenceline sensors capable of triggering automatic alerts to DNREC and the public when VOC levels exceed set thresholds and to take immediate corrective action if an exceedance is detected. DNREC has noted that PBF Energy, the refinery’s parent company, operates similar systems at facilities in California.
A Broader Debate Over Regulation and Reliability
Supporters of the order say fenceline monitoring would improve transparency and community trust. Critics counter that while such systems can be useful tools, they have limitations: sensors detect only certain pollutants, can generate false positive readings, yet miss releases depending on wind direction, and require careful calibration to avoid false readings.
From a regulatory perspective, refinery officials argue that rushing installation could undermine confidence in the data and distract from the more fundamental goal of improving internal detection and operational awareness.
Economic Stakes for Delaware
The Delaware City Refinery has operated since 1956 and remains a major industrial employer and taxpayer in the region, supporting hundreds of direct jobs and additional work for contractors, trades, and transportation services. At the same time, it has been the focus of repeated environmental enforcement actions and community concern over emissions.
Industry observers warn that overly aggressive or inflexible regulatory timelines can carry unintended consequences. California, often cited as a model for strict environmental policy, has seen 72% of its refineries close in recent years, including two major refineries this month.  This contributes to higher fuel prices, job losses, and increased reliance on imported fuel.
What Comes Next
The Environmental Appeals Board will review the refinery’s appeal while discussions with DNREC continue. Refinery officials say they remain committed to complying with an amended order that achieves the state’s transparency goals without sacrificing technical integrity.
For DNREC, the case is part of a broader enforcement and rulemaking effort, including proposed regulations expected in 2026 that could expand fenceline monitoring requirements statewide.
The outcome of the appeal may set an important precedent for how Delaware balances environmental accountability with economic stability and practical implementation.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/dcrc_-_fenceline-scaled.jpg,,,2026-01-02 16:57:33.483371

Colin Hackley)A divided Florida Supreme Court ruling this week on assisted reproduction methods raises the prospect of children having three parents — or at least raises a new complication for couples seeking to have kids with outside help.
By a narrow 4-2 margin, the state’s high court on Wednesday concluded that under Florida statute a sperm donor did not automatically relinquish his parental rights because the artificial insemination was done at home instead of at a fertility clinic.
A majority of justices agreed to overturn two lower court decisions that had previously found that Angel Rivera had given up his parental rights when he agreed to provide his sperm to Ashley Brito and Jennifer Salas. 
Brito used an at-home artificial insemination kit. According to court documents, Brito and Salas got married after confirming the pregnancy and began raising the child together. However, they separated a little more than a year later. Soon afterward, Rivera filed a petition seeking recognition as the child’s legal father.
The majority justices stressed that they were not concluding that Rivera is entitled to parental rights. Rather, the opinion focused on whether the governing state law, passed in 1993 and amended in 2020, applies to people who artificially inseminate outside a clinic setting.
Justice Jaime Grosshans, writing for the majority, said the law did not apply to Rivera.
“Taken together, it is clear that this section of newly enacted statutes, as well as the one amended statute, focused almost exclusively on providing a legal framework for gestational surrogacy issues and laboratory-based reproductive procedures — i.e. ART, [assistive reproductive technology],” Grosshans wrote.
Joining Grosshans in the decision were outgoing Justice Charles Canady as well as Justice Jorge Labarga and Chief Justice Carlos Muñiz.
Justice John Couriel, who wrote a dissenting opinion that Justices Meredith Sasso and Renatha Francis concurred with, said the majority “gets that job wrong” and that it was clear that Rivera was clearly a donor whose actions were covered by the law.
And Couriel argued that the court’s decision opens the door to circumstances not authorized by the Legislature.
“But now, the majority authorizes Rivera to become parent number three,” Couriel wrote. “This might be good or bad policy by the Court’s lights, but it is not our law.”
Couriel added, “The Court seems bashful about the full import of its reasoning, stopping one step short of what it knows will be an odd result indeed under Florida law: declaring Rivera a child’s third legal parent. And that is understandable. Whatever hoops Rivera and other donors in his position will have to jump through, so too will people who have relied on their donations as they await the courts’ sorting out of claims that the statute on its face resolves.”",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Florida-Supreme-Court-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-02 16:57:33.483371

Gov. Phil Scott has appointed two new lawmakers to fill vacancies in the Vermont Legislature days before the start of the session next week. 
John Benson, a managing partner at the engineering firm DuBois & King who currently serves as chair of the Brookfield Selectboard, will fill the vacant Orange County Senate seat left by Republican Larry Hart.  
Val Taylor will replace Rep. Jim Harrison, R-Chittenden, whose Rutland-11 district includes Killington, Chittenden, Mendon and Pittsfield. Harrison decided to step down amid a move to New Hampshire. Taylor previously served as chair of the Mendon Selectboard. 
Both Benson and Taylor are Republicans, according to Amanda Wheeler, a spokesperson for Scott.
Customarily, the governor chooses a legislative replacement who belongs to the same political party as the resigning lawmaker, picking from a list of candidates submitted by the relevant local political party.
All Vermont legislators are up for reelection this November. In an email, Taylor said she planned to run for the House seat she’s filling. 
She replaces Harrison, who, after almost a decade in office, had risen to vice chair of the powerful House Appropriations Committee. 
In an email, Taylor said she was excited to work in the Legislature to ensure tax dollars are “well spent.”
In Orange County, Hart stepped down in October, citing the toll the position had taken on his physical and mental health. He was in his first year in the role.  
Benson, Hart’s replacement, did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment. 
In a statement, Scott praised Benson’s career serving his local community.
“His career as a civil engineer, decades as a volunteer firefighter, and now on the Selectboard, demonstrate his commitment to working together to solve problems, which will be an important perspective to have in the Senate,” Scott said.

Instead, the Supreme Court is expected to hand down a ruling during its usual late-spring release period. 
State Sen. Caleb Kleinpeter, R-Port Allen, who co-sponsored legislation to change the 2026 election calendar to allow for a new round of redistricting, said in an interview Friday there were no plans to hold another special session or deviate from the existing map. 
Lawmakers can’t create new maps after the Supreme Court’s ruling in the spring because Louisiana is switching to a closed party primary system this year. The switch moved up the qualifying period for candidates from July to February, which created a limited window for redistricting if the decision was issued in late 2025.
The case in question, Louisiana v. Callais, challenges the legality of a second majority-Black U.S. House district Republicans state lawmakers drew in 2024 in response to a federal court finding a 2022 version of the state’s congressional maps was unconstitutional. Louisiana has six seats in the U.S. House of Representatives, but just one favored a Black candidate before the redistricting process in a state where nearly a third of the population is Black.
The case has since been shaped into a test of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, a landmark federal law that prohibits racial discrimination in elections. Section 2 prohibits voting laws or procedures that purposefully discriminate on the basis of race, color or membership in a language minority group. State Attorney General Liz Murrill, who originally defended the 2024 version of the map, now argues race-conscious redistricting under Section 2 is no longer necessary to ensure fair racial representation and now violates the 14th and 15th amendments of the U.S. Constitution.
The Callais case is also notable because justices were originally supposed to rule on the case in spring 2025. But in a rare move, they punted their decision to their next term and called for a second round of oral arguments that were held in October.  The fact that the case had been argued twice gave GOP lawmakers hope a ruling would come earlier than usual. 
Critics of the special session argued Republican legislative leaders would not have authorized the expense of a special session, which can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars in per diem and extra staff time, without the assurance a ruling was coming. 
Kleinpeter and Rep. Beau Beaullieu, R-New Iberia, denied this during the session. 
Beaullieu testified during a committee hearing there was no official forecast for when the decision would be issued. He also acknowledged to a reporter the election calendar changes he backed would become pointless if the Supreme Court doesn’t rule in time. 
Qualifying for closed party primaries in the congressional races, scheduled for May 16, will take place Feb. 11-13. Any party runoffs that are needed will be held June 27, and the general election is set for Nov. 3.

“Thank you for inspiring our nation,” the Vermont senator told the new mayor.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Bernie Sanders swears in Zohran Mamdani as New York City mayor.","Vermont’s Independent U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders swore in Zohran Mamdani, the new Democratic mayor of New York City, during Mamdani’s inauguration on Jan. 1, 2026 (CBS New York).
Vermont’s Independent U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders swore in Zohran Mamdani, the new Democratic mayor of New York City, during Mamdani’s inauguration on Thursday.
Mamdani was officially sworn in at midnight New Year’s Day by New York Attorney General Letitia James. But for his public inauguration ceremony later that day, the mayor chose Sanders to administer his oath of office a second time in a ceremonial capacity.
“You showed the world the most important lesson that can be learned today — and that is that when working people stand together, when we don’t let them divide us up, there is nothing we cannot accomplish,” Sanders told Mamdani in a speech before the swearing-in, in front of tens of thousands of people gathered outside New York City Hall.
Both Sanders and Mamdani are self-described Democratic socialists and are at the forefront of national progressive politics. New York’s Democratic U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, another progressive leader, also spoke at the event. Sanders, who was born in Brooklyn, had endorsed Mamdani’s bid for mayor and campaigned with him last year.
Mamdani has called Sanders “the single most influential political figure in my life.” Sanders told VTDigger last fall that Mamdani’s campaign studied the senator’s 1981 run for Burlington mayor, when Sanders upset a more moderate opponent who’d held elected office for years.
In November’s mayoral election, Mamdani bested former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who was running as an independent after Mamdani defeated him and a field of other opponents in a shock victory in the summertime Democratic primary.


In his speech before swearing in Mamdani, Sanders described the mayor’s signature campaign proposals as “not radical,” even as the mayor’s opponents have assailed them as such. Mamdani has called for raising taxes on New York City’s wealthiest residents to fund universal child care and city buses that are faster and fare-free. He also wants to freeze rent increases for millions of tenants in rent-stabilized housing.  
Sanders said Mamdani’s campaign had a seismic impact on national politics “in a moment when people in America, and in fact, throughout the world, are losing faith in democracy.”
“Thank you for inspiring our nation,” he said. “Thank you for giving us, from coast to coast, the hope and the vision that we can create government that works for all — not just the wealthy and the few.
According to the New York Times, Mamdani’s supporters “defied freezing temperatures” and “a fresh coating of snow” to witness the mayor’s inauguration. While Sanders was bundled in a large green coat for the ceremony, he skipped the mittens — sewn by Essex Junction resident Jen Ellis — that he went viral for wearing to former President Joe Biden’s inauguration in 2021.

More than $100,000 was returned to Montanans in 2025, a press release said. Montana is one of six states that provides restitution assistance to victims of investment fraud. 
“When fraudsters and bad actors harm Montanans, we aggressively investigate them, we fully prosecute them, and we ensure they take a one-way trip to Deer Lodge,” Brown said in a press release. “The most rewarding parts of my job as State Auditor is locking up bad actors and helping Montanans rebuild their lives. There is no better time to do that than this holiday season.”
No general fund money is used in the restitution. Instead, CSI collects money from firms doing investment business in Montana into the Securities Restitution Assistance Fund, a press release said. That fund also includes money collected from those who have violated Montana’s security laws.
State law limits the amount of money victims can receive from that fund and there’s additional restrictions if the fund is “depleted below” $1 million. When laws around victim restitution for securities-related fraud were passed, they were capped at $25,000. 
In 2015 through House Bill 57, restitution was increased to $50,000 for fraud against a victim who is a senior citizen or any other person defined in state law as a “vulnerable person.” That 2015 legislation was run by then-Rep. Moffie Funk, a Helena Democrat, at the request of former state auditor Monica Lindeen.

Their release stated that “currently, a growing number of both Republican and Democratic-led states are stepping up to reform SNAP.”
Some may think the government shouldn’t pay for sugary drinks. I understand that initial reaction. But let’s dig a little deeper.
Elon Musk has received over $38 billion in contracts, subsidies, tax credits and loans from the U.S. government — our tax dollars. Emphasis on subsidies and tax credits.
From 1995 to 2024, South Dakota ranked eighth in the nation for reliance on farm subsidies. Of the $25 billion that came to South Dakota, former Gov. Kristi Noem’s family collected $4.9 million.
Two SD lawmakers join push to ban soda and candy purchases from food assistance program

Meanwhile, some legislators say a single mom of three working two jobs and receiving $109 a month in SNAP benefits shouldn’t be able to buy a diet Coke.
And yes, of course we might wish her cart was filled with fresh fruits and vegetables. But let’s be honest — I hope you’re not judging my shopping list today, either.
What also stood out to me was the claim that “many states are reforming SNAP,” with no detail about how. For example, Michigan’s “Double Up” program allows government food benefits to double in value when healthier choices are made. Studies show that bans will only increase administrative costs and create more stigma around poverty while not making any behavioral changes.
Restricting items doesn’t help families. The path to meaningful assistance is through incentives and support, not punishment. I shared Michigan’s program with Davis, who is my state senator. Perhaps the political optics mattered more than what would actually help her constituents.
This type of legislation helps no one. It adds stigma. It won’t reduce poverty, it won’t improve educational outcomes, and it won’t improve health, because the people being targeted still won’t be able to afford health insurance. But that 99-cent soda? That’s what we’re controlling.
Considering both Davis and Rehfeldt are health care providers and moms, what about legislation to expand free and reduced school lunch, lower health care costs or make women’s health more accessible for rural communities?
We’re angry at the wrong people.
We’re restricting the wrong things.
We’re catering to the wrong individuals.

,Mississippi Today,2026-01-02 20:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,"How Mississippi could meet the needs of more than 19,000 families waiting for child care vouchers",Sophia Paffenroth,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/02/mississippi-child-care-vouchers/,The voucher program has historically only received enough funding to cover 1 in 7 eligible children.,"When she is not caring for her 6-year-old daughter and 1-year-old son, Amaya Jones is working full time at Kroger. Jones wants to go back to school in January to study social work, so she can help young women like herself navigate complicated programs designed to help – but which often trap – poor people. 
“I know what it’s like to be homeless, to apply for (food stamps) and be denied even though you need it, to be looked at as just a number – I know how it all feels,” Jones said. “I want to help mothers and kids and young women.”
Returning to school will only be possible if Jones regains vouchers she lost in June that made child care affordable, she said. 
Jones’ family is one of more than 19,000 Mississippi families who lost access to child care vouchers and is now on a growing waitlist after pandemic-era funding that boosted the program dried up, according to the Mississippi Department of Human Services. 
The extra funding didn’t expand eligibility. The voucher program has historically only received enough funding to cover 1 in 7 eligible children. The additional pandemic funds allowed the program to reach more eligible families – who are now on the hook for hundreds of dollars each month. While thousands of families sit on a waitlist for the voucher, some child care providers are eating the cost and risk closure. 
Mississippi receives nearly $90 million a year from a federal block grant called Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. States are allowed to transfer up to 30% of those funds to a separate federal grant, the Child Care and Development Fund, that supports Mississippi’s child care voucher program. In recent years, Mississippi has elected to make this maximum transfer. But states are not prohibited from using the remaining TANF funds on other child care expenses.
This has been the rub between state leaders and child care advocates lately: Advocates want the state to spend more – including some of its $156 million in stockpiled TANF funds – on the child care voucher. But the agency says that’s not doable.
Mark Jones, director of communications at the Mississippi Department of Human Services, said the agency is pursuing other solutions for child care that will become clearer in 2026. 
“Plugging long-term holes with non-recurring funds is not feasible nor responsible,” Mark Jones said about feeding unspent TANF funds into the voucher program. 
Meanwhile, advocates have argued it’s not responsible to be sitting on millions of unspent TANF dollars. 
“Mississippi gets a new TANF grant, $86 million, every year,” said Carol Burnett, director of the Mississippi Low-Income Child Care Initiative, which has been advocating on behalf of child care access for decades. “We rarely spend it all, which is how we ended up with a huge unspent balance in TANF. So, TANF is not one-time money because we get the grant every year and we don’t ever spend it all.”

Mississippi Today spoke to four national TANF experts who weighed in on the situation. They agreed  Mississippi can use more TANF dollars than it is already using toward child care subsidies. The issue can be complicated, but not as much as Mississippi is making it, said Elizabeth Lower-Basch, deputy director for policy for the Center for Law and Social Policy and a national TANF expert. 
“Mississippi is making this harder than it needs to be, I think, is the bottom line,” Lower-Basch said. 
While TANF funds are flexible and can be used on a wide range of services, the system is inherently labyrinthine. Part of that, experts say, is to safeguard against misuse – something Mississippi is well known for. 
“I’m guessing since Mississippi has gotten so much blowback for some of the ways it used TANF in the past, it’s gotten a little gun-shy,” said Lower-Basch.
While Mississippi may not be able to push more than 30% of its TANF funds through a transfer to the Child Care and Development Fund, experts say there are other ways to use TANF to supply more child care vouchers.
Other states have successfully conjoined funding streams so that extra TANF funds can be used on child care vouchers without technically being considered “transferred funds,” explained Stephanie Schmit, director of Child Care and Early Education at the Center for Law and Social Policy. It can sometimes be complicated. 
“States do ‘marry them’ in ways that work well in their state, but states use different mechanisms to make that happen. There’s often memorandums of understanding or contacts,” Schmit said. “… It’s not as straightforward as ‘direct dollars can be spent through the existing system – done.’ It’s layers, and it’s very much dependent on the state.”
The department is going a different route, Mark Jones said. The agency opened a request for proposals for work supports, or programs that help people in low-income jobs to remain employed. Proposals may include child care, along with 11 other areas – such as transportation and job search assistance – according to the department’s application. 
There’s no guarantee the state will select proposals that include child care – or that the eligibility would resolve the current waitlist. But if the winning proposals include child care, the subgrantee would supply child care for the program participants by paying the child care provider directly, Mark Jones explained. 
“In early 2026, once we announce the TANF subgrantees, we will have a clear picture of the future,” he said. 
The child care crisis
Experts have long-considered the state of U.S. child care a crisis. But that’s indicative of a deeper problem: the devaluing of caregiving and early education nationwide. The system doesn’t work for anyone involved, experts say. Parents can’t afford to buy into it, and child care employees can’t afford to work in it. 
The only solution would be to provide public dollars “in a very significant way,” explained Ruth Friedman, who previously directed the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Child Care during the Biden administration. Except for New Mexico, which recently made child care free for everyone, state and federal governments have been unwilling to make that type of investment, she said.
“Child care is expensive because it’s inherently labor-intensive,” Friedman explained. “Children need adult attention and interactions to be safe and to support their healthy development in child care. But child care programs know parents can’t afford the true cost of care, so the only way they can actually make any profit is to underpay their staff … which just exacerbates the supply problem.”
Friedman worries that H.R.1, the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act that U.S. Congress passed in law in July, will worsen the crisis since it shifts hundreds of millions of dollars in health care and food aid costs to states, leaving less room in state budgets for child care. 
Mississippi is already seeing that play out. After the Legislature appropriated a historic $15 million toward child care last year to make a dent in the voucher waitlist, advocates hoped the welfare agency would request the same this year. 
Instead, the Mississippi Department of Human Services Director Bob Anderson asked the Legislature to put $15 million toward SNAP and made no mention of child care. Agency spokesperson Jones said the agency had to make “tough decisions” since about $140 million in food aid costs previously covered by the federal government are now shifting to Mississippi. 
Later, during a December meeting of the Senate Study Group on Women, Children and Families, Anderson said the department would need $60 million to address the child care voucher waitlist – but clarified that he was not asking the Legislature for that money. 
The federal changes to Medicaid and SNAP will also affect how low-income families and child care workers balance their budgets. In Mississippi, more than a third of child care workers rely on Medicaid or food aid to make ends meet. 
“Since the child care workforce relies heavily on Medicaid and SNAP because their jobs pay so little, OBBBA’s massive cuts to the Medicaid and SNAP programs is likely to cause child care workers to leave the profession,” Friedman said. “Of course families’ child care bills will get harder to pay as their own health insurance and food costs rise as a result of the new law.”
Meanwhile, the thousands of eligible families without vouchers are piecing together haphazard child care with family, or going into debt with their child care providers. 
Jones says she’s lucky her mother can care for her children most days, but she worries about the toll it’s taking on their grandmother, who has heart failure. 
“She’s in and out of the hospital, as well,” Jones said. “One day she can be doing fine, the next day she’s not feeling well. If my baby gets sick, I don’t want him to get her sick. It’s extremely scary trying to live this day by day.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/09120132/3X0A6593.jpg,,,2026-01-02 15:12:32.883711

(Courtesy)Gov. Mike Braun and Attorney General Todd Rokita want a federal judge to lift a decades-old ban on the placement of a Ten Commandments monument at the Indiana Statehouse grounds.
A motion filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana on Tuesday argues that the original legal standard used to block the monument has since been overturned by Supreme Court decisions and that existing law now allows historical displays with religious content.
The case has reemerged amid separate legislative and judicial battles over Ten Commandments displays in other states.
In contention now is an 11,500-pound limestone monument that was donated by the Indiana Limestone Institute in 1996. Then-Indiana Republican Rep. Brent Steele arranged for the donation and placement of the monument, which was intended to be installed near the site of the former Ten Commandments display on the Statehouse lawn, according to court filings.
The attorney general described the top portion of the monument as consisting of a 4-foot, 4-inch tall block of limestone that sits atop a larger rectangular base that is also made of limestone. The Ten Commandments are inscribed on one side of the block and the Bill of Rights are etched on the opposite side.
Smaller sides of the monument contain the preamble to the 1851 Indiana Constitution, as well as a dedication showing the monument was a gift from the limestone institute.
A yearslong battle
A similar Ten Commandments display donated by the Fraternal Order of Eagles previously stood on the Statehouse lawn for more than three decades before it was vandalized and removed in 1991.
In 2000, then-Gov. Frank O’Bannon accepted the replacement monument, but the Indiana Civil Liberties Union sued, claiming the monument’s placement on state property would violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.
A federal judge granted a preliminary injunction later in 2000, concluding that the state’s purpose for erecting the monument was religious, not secular, and that a “reasonable person would … regard it as an explicit endorsement of the Ten Commandments.”
Story continues below.
b977dfd6-2de2-4c1a-8493-8c474a352163
 
The preliminary injunction was later affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit and has remained in effect ever since.
In their latest motion, however, Indiana officials contend the original injunction “rests upon legal principles that can no longer be sustained” because the Supreme Court has “discarded the Lemon test” — the 1971 standard that until 2022 guided Establishment Clause analysis.
Rokita additionally said in a news release that the Statehouse grounds “feature many monuments and markers celebrating Indiana’s and America’s heritage.” 
“This monument belongs among them as a reminder of core principles that have guided our nation,” he continued. “After all these years, it’s time to place this historical recognition where Hoosiers and visitors can appreciate its significance in our common story.”
In the same release, Braun added that the monument “reflects foundational texts that have shaped our Nation’s laws, liberties, and civic life for generations.”
“Restoring this historical monument,” the governor said, “is about honoring our heritage and who we are as Hoosiers.”
Rokita further argued in court filings that the state should be able to erect the monument because subsequent U.S. Supreme Court rulings evaluate religious displays based on historical practices rather than the old Lemon standard used. 
The Republican attorney general pointed to the 2005 Van Orden v. Perry case, for example, in which the high court justices allowed a Ten Commandments monument to remain on the Texas State Capitol grounds as part of a broader historical setting.
Opposition — and pending legislation
Civil liberties groups have long been opposed to such a display on state grounds, though. 
In similar disputes, courts across the country have blocked laws requiring Ten Commandments displays in public schools. A federal appeals court ruled in June that a Louisiana law requiring posters of the Ten Commandments in every classroom was unconstitutional under longstanding First Amendment precedent.
And in Texas, a federal judge’s November order forced several school districts to remove classroom posters of the Ten Commandments and concluded that a state law mandating such displays violated the Establishment Clause.
Still, the fight over religious texts in public spaces isn’t limited to the Statehouse lawn.
A new bill pending in the Indiana legislature, authored by Rep. Michelle Davis, R-Whiteland, seeks to “require each school corporation to place a durable poster or framed picture representing the text of the Ten Commandments in each school library and classroom.”
Davis’ House Bill 1086 has been assigned to the House Education Committee, but it’s not clear whether it will receive a hearing. Similar legislative attempts in the Hoosier legislature have been unsuccessful.
If the federal judge grants Indiana’s motion, the monument could be placed near its originally intended location on the Statehouse grounds. The plaintiffs — which include the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana and Americans United for Separation of Church and State — have 14 days to file a response.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-02 19:44:15+00:00,CT Mirror,CT to get $154M through federal rural health grant for 2026,Lisa Hagen and Katy Golvala,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/02/ct-to-get-154m-through-federal-rural-health-grant-for-2026/,CT will receive federal assistance to improve health care and access in rural parts of the state ahead of anticipated cuts to Medicaid.,"Connecticut will receive about $154 million in its first tranche of federal assistance to improve health care and access in rural parts of the state ahead of anticipated changes and cuts to Medicaid.
The federal aid comes from the Rural Health Transformation Program, a $50 billion fund that will dole out money to all states over the next five years. The initiative was part of President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” amid concerns about how the bill’s Medicaid cuts would affect rural facilities.
Connecticut Department of Social Services Commissioner Andrea Barton Reeves said the award will enable the state “to keep working on long-standing priorities to improve health, prevent disease, and work to achieve our agency’s vision for a Connecticut where everyone is healthy, secure, and thriving.”
“This grant represents a tremendous opportunity to strengthen population health, health care access, workforce capacity, and system sustainability for residents in rural communities across our state,” Barton Reeves stated in emailed comments.
DSS is already hiring for three positions that will be responsible for implementing the Rural Health Transformation Program grant at the state level. 
Over the next five years, half of the $50 billion grant will be evenly divided among all 50 states. The other $25 billion will be based on the sole discretion of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and will take into account the rural makeup of states plus other factors, such as potential for impact.
Connecticut will receive the second-lowest award of all 50 states, just ahead of New Jersey and the smallest award in New England. But it’s possible it will receive more in future yearly allotments.
Every state is slated to get at least $100 million a year through 2030. But stakeholders in Connecticut acknowledged it will be difficult to receive much from the second pot of money at CMS’s discretion, especially since Connecticut is less geographically rural compared to others states.
In a statement this week, CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz said “states are stepping forward with bold, creative plans to expand rural access, strengthen their workforces, modernize care and support the communities that keep our nation running. CMS is proud to partner with every state to turn their ideas into lasting improvements for rural families.”
Officials at the Connecticut Department of Social Services and the Office of Policy and Management took the lead on the grant application and worked with several other state agencies. They received input from rural hospitals, federally qualified health centers and others in the health care field.
Following the passage of the “big beautiful bill” over the summer, the rural grant application process was a quick turnaround that opened up in the fall and wrapped up with the awards announcement by the end of the year.
In November, the Department of Social Services requested roughly $938 million from the federal government for the effort. But the state is unlikely to get anywhere near that amount over the next five years of the federal program.
Still, those who helped craft Connecticut’s application for federal assistance are optimistic about the award as well as “working with the state to maximize these funds.”
“Specifically, we are grateful that the state included many of our suggestions in its plan, such as incentives for the recruitment of providers, the development of a rural residency program and funding for technology infrastructure that will improve access to telehealth and remote patient monitoring,” according to a statement from Joanne Borduas, CEO of the Community Health and Wellness Center, which has health centers located in Torrington, North Canaan and Winsted.
“These are all critical to ensuring that our patients in the rural northwest corner of the state can continue to receive the high quality health care they need and deserve.”
Paul Kidwell, senior vice president of policy at the Connecticut Hospital Association, echoed Borduas.
“We believe there is an opportunity for the state to support the implementation of targeted initiatives that both directly invest in rural health care providers and the surrounding hospitals and health systems on which patients living in rural areas depend for care,” Kidwell stated in emailed comments.
Connecticut Senate Republicans similarly praised the news of the funding, saying it will “help bolster recruitment and retention of health care workers, and it will improve and strengthen opioid addiction services.”
Connecticut’s plan included 31 different initiatives focused on increasing care options in rural areas and facilitating access to that care. It included efforts aiming to reduce or eliminate travel times, like rolling out mobile medical and dental vans, as well as expanding telehealth options. There are also programs that seek to improve overall wellness: bringing evidence-based exercise classes to senior centers and making upgrades to existing trail systems.
A handful of the proposed initiatives would require sign-off from state lawmakers, including streamlining the state’s “certificate of need” approval process for major hospital transactions — such as mergers, acquisitions, and unit closures — and seeking a SNAP waiver to bar the purchase of energy drinks and candy.
The funding comes at an uncertain time for many clinics and hospitals as they brace for major health care shakeups in the coming years.
Cutbacks to Medicaid are imminent as a result of the “big beautiful bill.” Rural providers, who see many government-insured individuals, could suffer disproportionately as a result. And if some of those patients fall off the rolls, hospitals expect to treat more people who are uninsured.
Some of those changes to Medicaid could start as early as the end of 2026.
First-time work requirements for the health program could go into effect on Dec. 31. But states may also be eligible for delaying implementation. And by the end of the year, states will need to start redetermining eligibility for Medicaid every six months instead of once a year.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DayKimball_Putnam_YK_file-1024x682.jpg,,,2026-01-02 14:57:48.536350

Jillian Gilchrest.","Tiffani McGinnis, a West Hartford town councilor and Democratic political organizer, opened a campaign this week to succeed state Rep. Jillian Gilchrest, D-West Hartford, who is running for Congress.
McGinnis is the first candidate to declare for the open seat in the safe Democratic district, and it underscores what Gilchrest has been telling Democrats: Her campaign to qualify for a primary against U.S. Rep. John B. Larson is all or nothing.
“I am running for Congress, and I will not be running for state representative,” Gilchrest said Friday.
McGinnis has made no formal announcement, but she electronically filed her registration as a candidate for General Assembly with the State Elections Enforcement Commission on Tuesday night.
The filing was expected, coming after Gilchrest assured McGinnis that she had no desire for Democrats to put a hold on anyone else seeking the 18th House District seat she won by unseating an incumbent eight years ago. 
“She reached out to me,” Gilchrest said, a gesture she called “very unnecessary.”
McGinnis, 54, is a Tennessee native who had been a political activist for a dozen years before moving to West Hartford a decade ago with her husband and three children.
The last election that McGinnis observed as only a spectator was the 2000 presidential election, which Al Gore lost after the U.S. Supreme Court settled a contentious and close Florida recount in favor George W. Bush.
“I started volunteering in 2004,” McGinnis said Friday.
In 2020, she worked for the election of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris as the organizer of New England Women for Biden-Harris. Four years later, she created Gen X for Harris.
Democrats selected her as one of the electors who would cast Connecticut’s seven Electoral College votes in 2024 for Harris, who easily won the state over Donald J. Trump.

She also was active in Connecticut politics, serving as treasurer of Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz’s reelection campaign in 2022, then chairing a political action committee Bysiewicz formed in 2023, Women in Power PAC.
“Occasionally, I would think about running for office,” McGinnis said.
In March 2023, McGinnis was appointed to a vacancy on the West Hartford town council. She was elected to a two-year term in 2023 and reelected in 2025 on a slate of six Democrats that outpolled Republicans by nearly 3-1 margins.
No other Democrat has made a move for Gilchrest’s seat.
“Tiffani is the only person who has reached out to me,” Gilchrest said.
McGinnis’s registration as a candidate is of value to Gilchrest, whose candidacy has not been helped by speculation that she eventually would quit the race for Congress and seek a fifth term representing in the General Assembly.
Gilchrest was elected to the state House as an insurgent, unseating a 12-term incumbent, Andy Fleischmann, in a Democratic primary she won with 53% of the vote in 2018.
It is a template she now is trying to replicate on a larger, more crowded stage: the 27 communities of the 1st Congressional District, which is dominated by Hartford and its suburbs.
Larson, 77, of East Hartford, is facing his first serious challenge since winning the open congressional seat in 1998. 
Gilchrest, former Hartford Mayor Luke Bronin and Hartford school board member Ruth Fortune are seeking the Democratic nomination.

(LRC Public Information) A Republican former legislator has announced he will try to retake a Central Kentucky House seat. 
Killian Timoney, often seen as a moderate and defeated in the 2024 GOP primary, said in a New Year’s Day Facebook post that he will again be a candidate for the 45th House District. He is from Nicholasville. 
“After taking time to listen, reflect, and recharge with my family, I’m more convinced than ever that Kentucky needs experienced, common-sense leadership focused on what matters most: stronger schools, support for working families, and keeping our communities safe and affordable,” he said. 
Timoney, a longtime employee of Fayette County Public Schools, was defeated in the 2024 primary election by Liberty Republican candidate Thomas Jefferson. A key issue among GOP voters at the time was Timoney’s vote against an anti-transgender law affecting medical treatment for youth and public schools. Campaign mailers slammed Timoney for his vote on the issue. 
Adam Moore (Provided by campaign)
Timoney won about 28% of the vote, or 1,072 votes, in the primary. Jefferson was later defeated by the current incumbent, Democratic Rep. Adam Moore, in the general election. Moore took 50.3% of the vote, or 13,030 votes. 
Moore, of Lexington, is the only candidate to formally file with the secretary of state’s office in the 45th House District so far. The filing deadline is Friday, Jan. 9. 
In a statement after filing in November, Moore said he is “determined to keep bringing home results for our communities” and that he planned to focus on health care access, rising energy costs and “advancing common-sense solutions” in the upcoming legislative session.

A spokesperson for the Senate said Miller died from natural causes.
Miller spend more than four decades working for the Legislature in the state capitol.
From 2009 until 2024, she served as Senate Secretary, and took on a temporarily role during last year’s session before fully retiring.

Our hearts are with her family and grieve that she is no longer with us, but the Senate is grateful for her service and friendship.”
In 2023, the Legislature officially designated the Senate leadership offices in the capital as “The Marilyn Miller Senate Suite,” and a plaque with her likeness hangs outside the entrance.
According to the plaque, Miller accepted a position as Chief Clerk of the House of Representatives for the 1993 session, after retiring from a 30-year career in state government.

Old-timers might opt for the 21-0 victory over LSU in the 1960 Sugar Bowl. But given the stakes, surely this Sugar Bowl victory 66 years later becomes the biggest ever.","NEW ORLEANS — Notes, quotes and an opinion or two from a Crescent City still buzzing Friday morning from Thursday night’s instant college football classic in the Sugar Bowl:
• Las Vegas oddsmakers have made Miami a three-point favorite over Ole Miss for next Thursday’s Fiesta Bowl in Tempe, Arizona. Oddsmakers set the over-under point total at 51.5. Undefeated and top-seeded Indiana is a four-point pick over Oregon in the Peach Bowl.

• Coaches and commentators are always talking and sports writers are forever writing about how crazy college football has become with pay-for-play and the transfer portal. Perhaps the most crazy example might be this: LSU now owes Lane Kiffin half a million dollars because the Ole Miss Rebels have advanced to the semifinals of the College Football Playoffs. Should Ole Miss beat Miami, that total rises to $750,000. If Ole Miss wins it all, Kiffin will make a million. Crazy, no?
• Ole Miss improved to 7-4 all-time in Sugar Bowl appearances, with wins this year and in 2016, 1970, 1963, 1961, 1960 and 1958. Only Alabama, with 10 victories, has won more Sugar Bowls.
• The win over Georgia puts the Rebels’ record at 4-1 against this season’s 12-team College Football Playoffs field. That’s most victories of any team in the tournament.

• All the unusual off-field circumstances (Kiffin leaving, etc.) during this Ole Miss post-season run continue to be regurgitated in the national media. An emotional Ole Miss Chancellor Glenn Boyce, speaking to Yahoo’s Ross Dellenger on the field amid the post-game Ole Miss celebration, tried to put the focus where it belongs.  “It’s incredibly hard to put it in words,”  Boyce said. “The way you hold something like this together is, sure, leadership and leadership matters, but here’s the other way: these players.”
• Biggest football win in Ole Miss history? Old-timers might opt for the 21-0 victory over LSU in the 1960 Sugar Bowl – and it was huge – but given the stakes, surely this Sugar Bowl victory 66 years later becomes the biggest ever.

• Trinidad Chambliss, asked post-game about his pending appeal to the NCAA, said he expects an answer soon. “The NCAA has been closed now, but I’m pretty sure it opens tomorrow, so maybe we’ll get an answer soon,” he said. “I’ve got people working on it. I’m not the one that’s working on it. My job right now is to focus on football and to focus on this team and to focus on being 1-0 in the next game, so that’s my main focus right now.”
• Pete Golding’s signature victory as a head coach came less than an hour’s drive from his hometown of Hammond, Louisiana. “Yeah, it’s definitely special, being 35 miles away,” Golding said. “My brother lives in New Orleans, a bunch of family. A bunch of Hammond High boys here tonight.”

• The Sugar Bowl ended about one hour before college football’s transfer portal opened. Golding, with that in mind, said he has courted junior placekicker Lucas Carneiro in recent days. Carneiro, a transfer from Western Kentucky, is one of the nation’s best placekickers, as he showed in the Sugar Bowl with three long and clutch field goals. “I think a lot of people think Lucas is the best kicker in the country, so a lot of people want Lucas,” Golding said. “So I’ve been meeting with Lucas a lot lately. We’ve had a lot of good meetings here, and especially this week. I got to spend a lot of time with him one-on-one and just getting to know him a little more and figuring out what he wants in the future. … We felt like he was the best kicker in the country coming out of Western Kentucky last year. He’s done an unbelievable job this year.”
• Georgia coach Kirby Smart was gracious in defeat, praising Golding, the Rebels players and even the Ole Miss crowd. Smart said Ole Miss deserved the victory, but added: “I enjoyed that game and that atmosphere. I am proud of our team. I’m sick that we lost, and there’s things I would love to go back and do differently. But I’m just so proud of the way our guys competed when down 10, and just didn’t finish it.”

The Connecticut governor who served the shortest time was Hiram Bingham III, a remarkable figure who might have served as inspiration for the fictional Indiana Jones. Bingham was elected simultaneously as governor and to the U.S. Senate. He chose the Senate role, but to ease the transition for his lieutenant governor, Bingham was sworn in as governor of Connecticut on Jan. 7, 1925 (101 years ago Wednesday).

(Photo: Gaston County Sheriff's Office)Federal law enforcement officials announced Friday that they had foiled a planned attack “in support of ISIS” in Mint Hill, North Carolina, on New Year’s Eve.
According to Russ Ferguson, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of North Carolina, the suspect is 18-year-old Christian Sturdivant, an American citizen and Mint Hill resident.
Ferguson said the man had been in contact with ISIS members in Tiktok chatrooms and “had pledged allegiance to ISIS” while planning a New Year’s Eve terrorist attack on a grocery store and a fast-food restaurant in Mint Hill.
“He started reading ISIS material, started going to ISIS websites, making Tiktok videos, and eventually reached out to what he thought was a member of ISIS. In reality, it was an undercover agent with NYPD in New York,” Ferguson said. “He was preparing for jihad, and innocent people were going to die, and we were very, very fortunate they did not.” 
Ferguson said Sturdivant intended to use knives and hammers and planned to wear a Kevlar vest, but also planned to die in the attack. He was under surveillance for two weeks before his arrest on New Year’s Eve, Ferguson said. “At no time was the public in harm’s way.”
James Barnacle, the FBI special agent in charge of the Charlotte field office, said Sturdivant had been under psychological care in recent years. He said Sturdivant’s grandfather had stopped him from attacking neighbors when the suspect was 14.
“His family actively hid knives and weapons from him,” Barnacle said.
Barnacle said the FBI had been watching Sturdivant during that period in 2022, but stopped its investigation when the teen entered mental health treatment.
But last month, when Sturdivant turned 18, Barnacle said, he resumed trying to contact members of ISIS and was immediately flagged by a number of law enforcement agencies.
Barnacle said Sturdivant was seen as a credible threat. “He wrote a manifest. He stole two hammers out of the storage shed and hid them in his house. He reached out to an undercover agent and requested guns.”
Ferguson said the FBI first tried to have Sturdivant involuntarily committed, but a state magistrate denied the petition. So they obtained a warrant and arrested him for “providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization,” a charge that can carry a prison sentence of 20 years.
Sturdivant is currently being held without bail in the Gaston County jail. No attorney or public defender was listed for him at midday Friday. The case will be prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Gleason for the Western District of North Carolina and DOJ Trial Attorney Elisa Poteat with the National Security Division’s Counterterrorism Section, according to a statement from the U.S. Department of Justice.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GetImage.jpeg,,,2026-01-02 13:57:24.280575

The Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing has proposed a $10,000 fine against the 165-bed skilled-nursing facility at West Burlington’s Southeast Iowa Regional Medical Center, known as The Klein Center. That fine is being held in suspension while the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services determines whether a federal penalty will be imposed in place of the proposed state fine.
According to state inspectors, the staff at the Klein Center failed to perform a proper assessment and failed to intervene when a female resident with Down syndrome coughed, choked and vomited during the evening meal on Dec. 5, 2025.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Inspectors reported that a certified nurse aide alleged that as she and a licensed practical nurse sat talking near the dining area, a male resident of the facility approached them, reported that a female resident was choking and coughing, and asked the nurse to check on her. According to the CNA, the nurse said, “OK,” but didn’t follow up.
About 10 minutes later, the CNA allegedly told inspectors, another resident of the facility approached the nurse and said a woman in the dining area was choking, had turned red in the face and had vomited.
At that point, the nurse checked on the woman, determined she was choking, and encouraged her to spit out any sputum before assisting her from the dining area to her room. Once in her room, the woman “continued to cough with copious amounts of sputum coming up,” inspectors reported, and was unable to take drinks of water or swallow.
‘Maybe this will help’
The CNA reportedly told inspectors that although the woman appeared to be struggling to breathe, the nurse left the room, then returned with the woman’s evening medications. The nurse “placed the pills in (the woman’s) mouth and gave her some water, but (the woman) continued to cough and gag, eventually spitting out” the pills, the CNA reportedly told inspectors.
The state inspectors reported that the nurse then instructed the woman to lie down in bed, with her head elevated, and placed the woman’s CPAP, or Continuous Positive Air Pressure, mask in place, saying, “Maybe this will help.”
According to inspectors, the CNA later told them she “questioned in her head whether it was a good idea putting the woman in bed when she was still coughing but dismissed it since the LPN was the charge nurse.”
Later in the evening, a certified nurse aide noted the woman was pale, had labored breathing, and had thrown up in her CPAP mask. Two nurses were called to the resident’s bedside where they noted the woman’s oxygen levels – which are considered dangerous when they fall below 92% — had dropped to 34% and the woman was no longer responsive.
The staff called 911, but pronounced the woman dead a short time later.
Inspectors reported that when they asked the licensed practical nurse whether she had performed any patient assessments after the choking episode — such as checking the woman’s lung sounds, vital signs and oxygen levels — the nurse “teared up and stated, ‘No.’”
Resident abuse cited in May 2025
In May 2025, Southeast Iowa Regional Medical Center’s Klein Center was fined $500 by the state for resident abuse. In that case, a CNA had reportedly confronted a male resident of the home who had expressed concerns about the welfare of a fellow resident.
The CNA allegedly told the male resident not to worry about the other residents and “sit your f—ing ass down.” A worker also reported hearing the CNA call the male resident a “b—-” while asserting that she knew “how to do my f—ing job.” The employee told inspectors the CNA had called a different resident a “b—–” many times and was generally very vulgar to the residents.
A second employee reportedly told inspectors the CNA once gave a shower to a female resident who complained the water was too hot, prompting the CNA to tell her “shut the f— up.” The employee who reported the matter said the resident was crying afterward and asking why the CNA was mean to her.
In all, three staff members told inspectors they were aware of the CNA’s verbal abuse of residents but didn’t report it, in part because they had to work with her regularly.
Federal records indicate that during the past three years, Southeast Iowa Regional Medical Center’s Klein Center has been fined once by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The facility has a three-star, or average, overall rating from CMS.

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The number of abortions performed in Kansas during 2024 surpassed 19,000 for the second consecutive year in wake of judicial and political decisions in other states restricting access to the medical procedure.
The Kansas Department of Health and Environment reported clinics and hospitals in Kansas conducted a record 19,811 abortions in 2024, up from 19,467 in 2023, 12,319 in 2022 and 7,849 in 2021. Of the 2024 total, 4,763 were provided to residents of Kansas. Demand for abortion among Kansans increased 9.3% from 4,356 in 2023 and was above the 3,844 reported in 2022 and 3,937 in 2021.
In 2024, 15,048 abortions in Kansas were provided to out-of-state residents. That was a slight decline from the 15,111 nonresident abortions in 2023 and a significant increase from 8,475 in 2022 and 3,912 in 2021 among people living outside Kansas.
Three-fourths of abortions in Kansas the past two years were for patients residing in other states, primarily Texas, Missouri and Oklahoma. Here was a state-by-state breakdown in terms of Kansas abortions in 2024 for nonresidents: Texas, 6,736; Missouri, 3,760; Oklahoma, 3,141; Arkansas, 851; Louisiana, 206; and Nebraska, 138.
In June 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide for nearly 50 years. Reversing that precedent returned authority to prohibit or regulate the procedure to individual states.
The Kansas Supreme Court had issued a decision in 2019 that found the Kansas Constitution guaranteed individuals bodily autonomy in health care decisions, including a woman’s right to end a pregnancy. The state court’s decision preserved abortion rights in Kansas after the U.S. Supreme Court severed federal constitutional protections.
In Missouri, abortion was legal only in cases of medical emergency from 2022 to 2024. However, Missouri voters in 2024 approved a constitutional amendment restoring broader reproductive freedoms. Other states in the Midwest responded to the U.S. Supreme Court by imposing bans on abortion, including Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana. Oklahoma has allowed abortions only to preserve the life of a pregnant person. Nebraska enforces a 12-week abortion ban.
Mackenzie Ayers, a spokeswoman for the anti-abortion organization Kansans for Life, said the state health department should have more promptly released information on 2024 abortions in Kansas. The state’s latest report was posted online at the end of December 2025 as part of a larger annual summary of vital statistics on Kansas.

“By waiting until the final hours of the year to release Kansas’ 2024 abortion statistics, Gov. Laura Kelly has made it clear she hoped these numbers would go unnoticed,” Ayers said.

Ayers said Kansans for Life believed young females were obtaining abortions in Kansas without parental consent. She said the organization would be “pursuing every legal option to restore some form of informed consent protections for women in 2026 and continue to sound the alarms about parental consent laws being potentially ignored.”

Janet Stanek, secretary of the state Department of Health and Environment, said the latest annual report provided an overview of information on the health status of Kansans.
“Public health statistics are essential to governmental agencies, businesses, industries and citizens for effective health policy decisions and program planning. KDHE is committed to ensuring accessibility,” Stanek’s report said.


KDHE’s report said 85.8% of all abortions performed in the state during 2024 were for unmarried women. KDHE said 77.1% of Kansas resident abortions in 2024 occurred prior to nine weeks of gestational age. Nearly 93% were prior to the 13th week of gestation and 2.8% came after 16 weeks gestation, the state health department said.
KDHE said there 140.3 abortions per 1,000 live births among Kansas residents in 2024. That was 9.6% higher than the ratio of 128 abortions per 1,000 live births in 2023.
The highest abortion ratio among Kansans residents on 2024 was for females 15 to 19 years of age, who had a rate of 341.9 abortions for every 1,000 live births. The lowest ratio — 80.4 abortions per 1,000 births — was for women 30 to 34 years of age, KDHE said. There was variation among Black, white and Hispanic women. The ratios: white non-Hispanics, 85 abortions per 1,000 live births; Black non-Hispanics, 402 abortions per 1,000 births; and Hispanics, 211.6 abortions per 1,000 births.

During 2024, KDHE said, there were 33,956 live births to residents of Kansas for a rate of 11.4 per 1,000 people. The agency said that was the lowest Kansas birth rate since 1912. The rate in 2024 represented a decline of 0.2% from 34,041 births in 2023. Here was the age breakdown of these Kansas mothers: under age 20, 4.5%; 20 to 29 years of age, 51.2%; 30 to 39 year of age, 41.5%; and aged 40 and over, 2.8%;

KDHE reported Kansas residents had 2,656 low-birth-weight infants, representing 7.8% of total births, in 2024. There were 197 infant deaths among Kansas residents, an increase of 8.2% from 182 deaths in 2023.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/P2130666-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-02 13:57:24.280575

(Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)Following the Trump administration’s last-minute invocation of an energy “emergency” to order a Colorado coal plant to postpone its scheduled retirement, the electricity provider that co-owns the plant is warning that the high costs of continuing to operate it will be shouldered by Colorado utility customers.
Located in Moffat County, Craig Generating Station’s 446-megawatt Unit 1 had been scheduled to go offline on Dec. 31, 2025, part of a wave of coal retirements planned across Colorado through 2030. But an emergency order issued Dec. 30 by the Department of Energy requires the plant to “take all measures necessary to ensure that Craig Unit 1 is available to operate” until at least March 30, 2026.
Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, co-owner of Craig Generating Station, said in a press release that the “additional investments in operations, repairs, maintenance and, potentially, fuel supply” required by the order will raise costs for the plant’s customers, which include dozens of electric utilities and rural co-ops. Unit 1 was already offline due to a mechanical failure on Dec. 19, Tri-State said.

“We are continuing to review the order to determine what this means for Craig Station employees and operations, and the financial impacts,” said Tri-State CEO Duane Highley. “As a not-for-profit cooperative, our membership will bear the costs of compliance with this order unless we can identify a method to share costs with those in the region. There is not a clear path for doing so, but we will continue to evaluate our options.”
The five-page DOE order, signed by Energy Secretary Chris Wright, cites “growing resource adequacy concerns” as justification for the move, which followed similar actions in Indiana and Washington.
Shortly after taking office last year, President Donald Trump declared a “national energy emergency” in an executive order blasted by environmental advocates as a pretext for advancing the interests of fossil-fuel companies. Despite the declaration’s stated concerns about “insufficient energy production,” the administration has continued to cancel and delay major wind and solar projects.
An analysis released in December by the Sierra Club estimated that keeping Craig’s Unit 1 open for 90 days would cost ratepayers at least $20 million. Critics of the administration anticipate that the DOE’s orders will continue to be renewed every 90 days under the authority granted to the department by Federal Power Act, raising costs by $85 million to $150 million annually.
“Keeping this dirty and outdated coal plant online will harm the health of surrounding communities and hurt all of our pocketbooks,” said Michael Hiatt of environmental group Earthjustice. “This unlawful order will benefit no one but the struggling coal industry.”
The DOE order comes amid a series of Trump administration actions targeting Colorado that are widely viewed as retaliation for the ongoing incarceration of Trump ally and former Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters, who was convicted on felony charges for her role in a breach of her own office’s secure election equipment in 2021.
Colorado U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet voted to confirm Wright, a former Denver oil executive, as Trump’s pick for Energy Secretary in January 2025, calling Wright “passionate about strengthening America’s energy independence and lowering costs for Colorado families.” In a statement Wednesday, Bennet, a Democrat who is running for Colorado governor, said he was “disappointed but not surprised by this continued revenge tour.”
“The DOE order is the latest in a string of attacks against Colorado, because we refuse to bend to the President,” Bennet said. “President Trump continues to take out his personal and political grievances on Coloradans who are already struggling to make ends meet.”

Mike Braun ceremonially signs legislation in his Statehouse office on Wednesday, May 28, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana Gov. Mike Braun has re-established a board overseeing the state’s workforce training programs just months after a similar board was dissolved.
Braun signed an executive order saying the State Workforce Development Board was needed to comply with federal law on the implementation of state and federal workforce initiatives.
The governor’s office said the board would serve “as a central coordinating body to align employers, education and training providers, and state agencies around measurable workforce outcomes.”
Braun’s order released Monday comes after the 21-member Governor’s Workforce Cabinet was eliminated as of July 1. The Workforce Cabinet was enacted in 2018 at the request of then-Gov. Eric Holcomb.
The state budget bill approved by the General Assembly last year repealed the Workforce Cabinet from state law and transferred its activities to the state Department of Workforce Development.
Braun has not yet named members to the board or specified its makeup.
The order said Braun will be a board member and that the governor will appoint other members from those nominated by Indiana business organizations, trade associations and labor unions. Board members must include officials responsible for state workforce programs and from local government.
“We will use the Indiana Workforce Development Board to bring together an elite team of job creators and workforce development experts to help create new opportunities and bigger paychecks for Hoosier workers,” Braun said in a governor’s office statement.
The workforce board’s reinstatement follows a renewed push by some Republican lawmakers to reduce Indiana’s roster of more than 250 state boards and commissions.

According to the board, in July 2024, Miller disclosed personal information about himself to a client, which the client stated made them feel uncomfortable. Miller also hugged the client, the board alleged, telling the client they gave “good hugs.” The board says the client also alleged Miller made other inappropriate comments, undisclosed by the board, which Miller denied.
The board charged Miller with engaging in unethical conduct, including, but not limited to, improper sexual contact with a client or making suggestive or improper remarks to a client.
The case was resolved with a settlement in which Miller agreed to accept a warning that any future misconduct could result in additional discipline.
Miller, whose license has expired, also agreed to complete six hours of board-approved education in area of professional boundaries, plus six hours of board-approved education in the area of professionalism.

The comment[...],"(Photo by Getty Images)Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine and local advocates are defending Ohio’s child care system after comments from the Trump administration accusing another state of child care fraud.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said states would need to provide “justification” proving that federal child care funds are being spent on “legitimate” entities. The comments followed fraud allegations in Minnesota related to the state’s child care programs, stemming from a YouTube video by a right-wing social media influencer. The allegations particularly targeted child care centers run by Somali citizens of the state.
The allegations led the Trump administration to freeze federal funding going to the child care sector in Minnesota, which owners and Democrats in the state said would cause major problems in an already struggling sector.
While DeWine said “people are rightfully concerned” about the Minnesota child care fraud allegations, he defended Ohio’s nearly 5,200 state-funded facilities.
In a recent statement, the governor said with the sheer number of facilities “there is certainly the potential for fraud,” but Ohio has several ways of countering the threat.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
He noted the practice of paying facilities based on attendance instead of enrollment, a new provision inserted into the state’s most recent operating budget.
DeWine also said the Ohio Department of Children and Youth has a system in place verify attendance and review childcare programs, along with investigating allegations of fraud.
“The department has a comprehensive review process of child care programs that receive state dollars that includes a review of family eligibility, unannounced health and safety inspections, and financial management reviews,” DeWine said in a statement.
Advocacy groups in the state said the child care system in Ohio certainly has room for improvement, and faces struggles based on cost and accessibility, but the threat of fraud isn’t on the list of widespread problems.
“Ohio has strict child care regulations and inspections,” said Tami Lunan, who leads The CEO Project, which focuses its advocacy on parents, child care providers, teachers, and women of color who work in what the group calls the “care economy.”
Lunan said delaying or freezing funding to providers “would be a disaster” because of the already thin margins under which child care centers operate.
“Ohio’s child care providers, many of whom are small business owners, women, and people of color, operate under constant scrutiny and accountability while serving working-class families who rely on stable, affordable care,” Lunan said in a statement.
“Suggesting otherwise without evidence is dangerous and inappropriate to the providers who are doing essential work and following the law.”
In a Jan. 1 press release, the think tank Policy Matters Ohio said lawmakers need to address workforce shortages, low wages, high costs and other issues, rather than focusing on “misleading claims” about child care.
The organization furthered DeWine’s and other advocates’ statements that Ohio’s system includes strict oversight and “crucial accountability measures.”
“Ohio already has strong systems in place to protect children and taxpayers,” Policy Matters senior project coordinator and child care researcher Ali Smith said.
“Licensed child care providers undergo routine, thorough, unannounced inspections every year, and those reports are available for anyone to review. Suggesting that oversight is lax is simply not true.”
Citing data from the Ohio Department of Children and Youth, Policy Matters said the department received 124 fraud allegations in 2025, and 61 of those resulted in overpayments being paid back to the state. A dozen programs were closed by the Department of Children and Youth in that year.
“This is how accountability and transparent oversight are supposed to work,” Policy Matters stated in its release.
DeWine noted this data as well, adding that 30 other programs accused of fraud were “operating in accordance with state and federal laws,” and 21 are still being reviewed.
Smith encouraged caution for families seeing “unsubstantiated claims of fraud” on social media or elsewhere, citing examples of viral videos that were taken during holiday breaks when facilities were closed.
“We urge Ohioans to rely on official sources, rather than social media speculation,” Smith said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-02 17:06:52+00:00,CT Mirror,"CT DMV raises towing rates, but tow companies say it’s not enough",Dave Altimari,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/02/ct-dmv-towing-rates-increase/,"Towing companies argue the fees won't cover their ""true costs,"" but their ask would have more than doubled the consumers' cost, a report said.","Despite pleas from tow truck company owners for a larger hike in towing rates, a hearing officer for the state Department of Motor Vehicles has approved a 13.5% increase spread over the next three years.
The new rate aligns with a DMV attorney’s recommendation at a public hearing in October before attorney Steven Baron, a per diem contractor hired by the state. Several towing companies appeared at that hearing seeking significantly larger increases from the current $125 rate.
But in an eight-page decision released in December,  Baron said the rate for a nonconsensual tow of a vehicle under 10,000 pounds would increase to $130.63 in 2026 and then go up to $136.51 in 2027 and $142.65 in 2028. Almost all nonconsensual private property trespass tows would be covered under this rate increase. It does not include police-ordered tows.
“It’s too low. I don’t consider it a fair increase,” said Timothy Vibert, president of the Towing & Recovery Professionals of Connecticut.
“It’s basically a cost of living increase and nothing else,” Vibert said.
In approving the DMV’s recommendation, Baron rejected towing companies’ proposal to adopt Maryland’s towing fees which he said “could more than double the cost for the consumer.”
Michael Festa, owner of MyHoopty of Watertown and president of the Association of Connecticut Towers, said in a statement that “the increase falls short of addressing the true cost of compliance, insurance, labor, and regulatory burden faced by licensed towers.”
“Private property towing is no longer a simple service — it is a heavily regulated public function,” Festa said. “Rate relief must reflect that reality, or the system becomes unsustainable.”
Baron also agreed with the  DMV’s recommendation not to raise the storage rate fees for towed vehicles. The rate for vehicles under 20 feet long is $30 if stored inside and $26 if stored outside for the first five days. Rates then increase to $37 and $31, respectively.
At the October hearing DMV attorney David Cardone said the agency did not support an increase in storage rates because it would directly impact the consumer.
“Since the cost of the nonconsensual trespass tow is borne by the consumer, an increase in storage rates may have the greatest  impact on a segment of the population that can least afford to absorb an increase,” Cardone said
In his analysis, Baron noted the towing rate increase mirrors the growth of the Consumer Price index over the past two years. The new rates included several new fees that were part of a legislative overhaul of the state’s more than 100-year-old towing regulations last session.
Legislators passed the new law after a series of stories by The Connecticut Mirror and ProPublica revealed that towing companies could seek permission from the DMV to sell someone’s vehicle after 15 days, one of the shortest time periods in the country. 
The series highlighted how towing companies doing private property or trespass tows were affecting low-income residents who in many cases couldn’t afford the fees to get their cars back.
One of the new charges implemented because of the new legislation is a $50 drop fee as proposed by the DMV. Cardone said towing companies previously were not required to release the vehicle should someone arrive on scene when it was being “hooked up,” but under the new law they must release it.
There is also a new after-hours redemption fee of $50 to cover labor costs. The new statute requires tow companies to be available at all times with proper notice to allow someone to get their car back, especially on weekends. The new fee would cover the costs of an employee having to go to the tow yard to release the vehicle.
Baron did approve a $1 increase per mile in mileage charges to tow vehicles back to their lots — bumping it to $6.65 a mile. The new statute only allows towing companies to charge for a maximum of 13 miles, capping mileage costs at $86.45 under the new plan.
The new rates also removed a fuel surcharge that towing companies were getting if diesel fuel was over $3.50 a gallon. They were allowed to bill customers for fuel, but Baron eliminated that from the new regulations.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2275-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-02 12:13:16.912679

Investing in public schools is ... investing in Mississippi's people.""","Editor’s note: This essay is part of Mississippi Today Ideas, a platform for thoughtful Mississippians to share fact-based ideas about our state’s past, present and future. You can read more about the section here.

Whether you call it “school choice” or vouchers, privatization of education socializes all the costs of education, but privatizes all the benefits.
So under “school choice,” all Mississippi taxpayers will pay for wealthy kids to go to private schools, even though those private schools won’t accept all Mississippi taxpayers’ children as students.
If “school choice” keeps being pushed on Mississippi taxpayers, we will continue to be saddled with an even greater financial burden that doesn’t benefit the majority of Mississippi families nor Mississippi communities. In fact, it actively harms most families, businesses and communities because it starves the public schools, which are the only schools responsible for educating every child who walks through their doors.
We will all end up paying even more for education and getting far less in return because private schools are private for a reason – because they don’t want the responsibility nor the accountability of educating all children. Most private schools are set up to educate a select few and the select few does not include poor children, children with special needs and children who don’t speak English.
Educating all children well and equitably comes with a cost. With public schools, taxpayers not only share the costs, they also reap all the benefits that come with a well-educated citizenry.
I don’t know of any private school that wants to accept the responsibility and accountability of educating all children in their community, but they would gladly accept the generous gift of Mississippi taxpayer money to continue educating a select handful of already-enrolled private school students.

Folks already using private schools would benefit above all others in Mississippi. Where “school choice”/vouchers have passed in other states, we’ve seen private schools increase their tuition once vouchers are available because they know which families can still afford it and it keeps out students that most private schools would rather not serve.
Mississippi legislators have rarely kept their promise to Mississippi taxpayers, families and communities to be responsible stewards of our public schools. Every time the state Legislature breaks its promise to the people who elected them, they increase the financial burden of their own local communities. The Mississippi Legislature ties the hands of the local community by telling them how much they can tax at the local level and what that money can and can’t be used for.
Plus, many of our communities are at or near the maximum percentage they can tax at the local level. And whether they are at or near that maximum local tax percentage allowed by the Legislature, the vast majority of Mississippi communities don’t have the economic capacity to make up for – at the local level – the amount of financial support they’re supposed to be getting from the State. 
“School choice” is a lie built on a false promise. Mississippi has tried vouchers or “school choice” before, and the only people who could receive them were people who had the same skin color as me. Mississippi, like some other Southern states, used vouchers to prop up segregation. Vouchers weren’t intended to be available for all children then, and they won’t be this time either.
“School choice” doesn’t just hurt individual children or families or communities. “School choice” will hurt our cost of living, our overall quality of life, our state’s economic capacity to succeed and, ultimately, the cornerstone of our representative democracy. 
Public education is an American value. Investing in public schools is not only investing in Mississippi’s people, it’s also the most common sense approach to strengthening our economy not only at the state level, but also at the levels of our local communities, families and individuals.
Mississippi would be wise to elect legislators and congressional representatives who are committed to strengthening the single most important factor to improving every community’s capacity to succeed economically – America’s public schools.

This story was first published by WyoFile on Dec. 18, 2025.
The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem’s grizzly population continues to stagnate geographically, a relatively new trend that wildlife managers say is related to bears saturating “suitable habitat” where the species is tolerated.
That finding is described in a new and first-ever rangewide report summarizing where grizzly bears are found in the Lower 48.
Overall, grizzlies, which are classified as “threatened” under the Endangered Species Act, continued their decades-long recovery and reoccupied 4% more habitat over the past two years. That equates to a rangewide expansion of roughly 2,250 square miles, or an area about two-thirds the size of Yellowstone National Park.

But bruins that dwell in the tri-state Yellowstone area were the exception. The estimated 1,050 grizzlies there occupied about 3.5% less ground, or about 963 fewer square miles, than they did two years ago. The report does not address what drove the change, but lead author and Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks research biologist Cecily Costello said it’s likely related to grizzlies running out of ideal habitat in the modern West.
“When you look at the habitat to the east of the Yellowstone Ecosystem, to the south of Yellowstone, you’re looking at a lot of open prairie,” Costello said. “There’s not really big river valleys those bears could move into. There’s a little bit of a limitation in terms of the range expansion in those directions.”
Wyoming grizzly managers see it similarly, attributing the slight retreat to bears losing spaces where they can live without getting into trouble.
“I think it’s just indicative of where the population is,” said Dan Thompson, large carnivore supervisor for the Wyoming Game and Fish Department. “I don’t think we should expect it to expand.”

Matt Gould, the Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team’s new leader, agreed. His predecessor, Frank van Manen, predicted about a decade ago that the grizzly population in the Yellowstone region would soon stabilize — and now it seems to be doing just that.
“Occupied range has kind of waned up, and now it’s kind of slightly decreasing,” Gould said. “It’ll be interesting to see: ‘Does it drastically drop, or is it going to stay steady and bounce around?’”

Range for grizzlies stopped expanding
Biologists first documented the end of a half-century-long era of grizzly range expansion in the Yellowstone area two years ago. At the time, federal scientists observed a 0.5% reduction in the species’ overall distribution — a retreat of 142 square miles.
The mapping Costello and her co-authors just completed examined the period from 2010 to 2024. Distribution in the Yellowstone and Northern Continental Divide ecosystem is based on hard data — from tracked bears, conflicts and other verified observations — over a 15-year rolling window.
The data is smoothed out based on the whereabouts of all grizzlies known to exist in any given area. For that reason, bears that make “outlier” movements, like the subadult male that reached the Bighorns in 2024, don’t usually influence the distribution maps.

Contraction in the Yellowstone Ecosystem’s occupied range comes at a time when there has been a record number of bears dying, though grizzly biologists say they don’t necessarily see the two trends as being related.
Mortality hit a high in 2024, with 72 known grizzlies that died that calendar year, Gould said. The death toll in 2025 is almost the same, at 71, which is about 35% greater than the 10-year average of 54 mortalities. (Editor’s note: Following publication of this story, Gould confirmed an additional death with the Daily Montanan, which put the count at 72 for 2025.) 
The leading causes of death, according to Gould, were livestock conflict (21 grizzlies killed as a result), followed by “site conflicts with humans” (16 grizzlies), self-defense killings (12 grizzlies), accidental deaths (nine grizzlies) and natural causes like predation (six grizzlies).
In 2025, three in four Yellowstone-area grizzly deaths were within a zone in the core of the ecosystem known as the “demographic monitoring area.” That’s a slightly higher rate than average.
Where grizzly bear habitats are retreating
Wildlife managers count bears in the demographic monitoring area. This area was declared fully occupied by bears in 2019.
In Costello’s distribution report, this “core” area represented 71% of where grizzlies were found in 2024. The other 29% of the occupied range fell outside of this core area on the fringes of the mountainous, public land-dominated ecosystem. This is where grizzly range has been retreating. When Yellowstone ecosystem grizzly distribution reached its peak in 2021, more than 40% of occupied range was mapped outside the core zone.
In 2024, the largest contraction in occupied Yellowstone habitat was located in eastern Idaho in the Big Hole Mountains and Snake River Range. Another recession appears in Montana’s Ruby Range, maps from the report show, and there’s a small loss of occupied range in the South Pass area off the tip of the Wyoming River Range.
Costello, who compiled the maps, said she doesn’t put a “whole lot of stock” into small regional changes.
“The edges are a little bit uncertain,” she said, “because you have less [grizzly data] about the edges than you do about the middle.”
The other major population of grizzly bears in the Lower 48 dwell in Montana’s Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem. Occupied grizzly range stretched by 2,500 square miles, a nearly 12% increase. These bears mostly pressed into new habitat on the eastern and southern sides of the ecosystem, gaining ground in the Sapphire Range, and Boulder and Big Belt Mountains, maps show.
There are more than 24,000 square miles of occupied grizzly bear range in the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem, a 12% increase from an assessment two years ago. (Map courtesy of Cecily Costello)
The Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem’s occupied range encompasses much more open prairie than to the south in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.
Partly, that’s explained by Montana grizzlies moving down big river corridors, Costello said. When a bunch of them make the movement, the occupied range line can “pull out really quickly.” Smoothing of the data can then make it look like they’ve reoccupied big chunks of open country, she said.
Habitat is another explanation for why western Montana occupied grizzly range keeps stretching while Yellowstone-area bears have held steady and retreated in places.
“When you look at the plant communities and mountains that exist in western Montana, there’s still a lot of what could be considered decent bear habitat,” Costello said. “It’s the expectation that we’ll probably continue to see bears moving into those habitats.”
A lot of that growth is expected to take grizzly populations toward Idaho’s Bitterroot Ecosystem, which has been unoccupied since the species was wiped out there in the 1950s.

(Photo by Jacob Wackerhausen/Getty Images)The Iowa Board of Nursing has issued a warning to a nurse suspected of being intoxicated at work and failing to report two arrests for drunken driving.
In 2020, the Board of Nursing charged Mandi Irlbeck of Harlan with excessive use of alcohol that might impair a licensee’s ability to practice nursing with reasonable skill and safety. The board alleged that in May 2020, Irlbeck came to work in a condition unfit to work. The board did not disclose the nature or place of her employment.
In additional, the board said it received information that Irlbeck “excessively uses alcohol.”
In a settlement, Irlbeck agreed to have her license placed on probation for 18 months, during which she would not use alcohol and would enroll in a chemical screening program.
In July 2025, the board received a complaint that Irlbeck’s coworkers suspected she had been intoxicated while working as a nurse. While looking into that matter, the board learned Irlbeck had failed to report a 2024 conviction for drunken driving during a period when she worked at a MercyOne medical facility.
The board also learned Irlbeck was then facing a charge of second-offense drunken driving that was still working its way through the courts. That charge stemmed from a May 2025 incident in which Irlbeck was pulled over near Logan and, according to police, had a blood-alcohol level of 0.235% — almost three times the legal limit for driving.
Court records show Irlbeck subsequently pleaded guilty to the second-offense drunken driving charge and, according to the board, she was fired from her place of employment due to concerns with her use of alcohol.
The Board of Nursing charged Irlbeck with being convicted of an offense that directly relates to the duties and responsibilities of the nursing profession, and with engaging in behavior that is contradictory to professional decorum.
The board and Irlbeck recently agreed to a settlement that calls for Irlbeck to accept a warning that states any future infractions may result in some form of discipline. As part of the settlement, Irlbeck also agreed to enroll in the Iowa Practitioner Health Program. Her nursing license remains in full effect.



Board takes action in other nursing cases
Other Iowa-licensed nurses whose cases recently came before the Board of Nursing include:
Melynda Albert of Muscatine — The board alleges that while Albert was working in a Bettendorf assisted living facility in April 2023, she was suspected of taking a vial of morphine from a resident’s supply. Court records indicate the theft occurred at The Summit, a residential care facility in Bettendorf, and that the victim was a dying hospice patient.
Albert was criminally charged with unlawful possession of a prescription drug, possession of a controlled substance and fifth-degree theft. She later pleaded guilty to the possession charge and the two remaining charges were dismissed and was placed on probation.
In December 2023, Albert was criminally charged with theft, and later convicted, for stealing items at a Walmart store.
In August 2024, she was charged with violating the terms of her probation in the morphine-theft case by failing to complete a substance-abuse evaluation as ordered. In December 2024, she was cited for driving with an open container of alcohol in the car.
In April 2025, District Associate Judge Michael Motto ruled Albert had successfully completed the terms of her probation in the morphine-theft case and ordered that all charges in the matter be expunged from the public court record — although those records remain accessible to the public.
Board of Nursing documents indicate the panel filed a set of disciplinary charges against Albert in June 2025, although the written charging documents in the case have not been publicly disclosed. As part of a recent settlement agreement with the board, Albert has agreed to an indefinite suspension of her license that will remain in effect until the completion of a substance-abuse evaluation that indicates it is safe for Albert to practice, at which point her license will be placed on probation for one year.
Jaclyn Zabolotny of St. Cloud, Minn. — In May 2025, Zabolotny applied for an Iowa license to work as a registered nurse. Board records indicate that on her application she reported a criminal history and an out-of-state disciplinary case. An investigation showed that in May 2017, while working as a licensed nurse in Minnesota, Zabolotny was charged with felony possession of a controlled substance procured by fraud or deceit. She later pleaded guilty to the charge and successfully completed probation in 2019, after which her criminal conviction was expunged.
According to board records, Zabolotny admitted she obtained a prescription for an opiate using the credentials of a nurse practitioner so she could get some sleep and keep working the 60 to 90 hours per week she was scheduled. According to the board, Zabolotny “regrets this decision and knows it was wrong.”  Noting that Zabolotny has completed a substance abuse evaluation, recommended educational courses, and mental health counseling, and has maintained an unconditional nursing license in Minnesota since February 2021, the Iowa board agreed to issue her a license free and clear of any restrictions.
Angela Gaynor of Sioux City — Board records indicate Gaynor’s Iowa license to practice nursing expired in 2018. In February 2025, she applied for license reactivation and disclosed a 2019 criminal conviction for felony credit card fraud, which resulted in a deferred judgment and three years of probation. In October 2020, Gaynor entered a guilty plea to a charge of violating her probation by testing positive for THC and alcohol.
In January 2022, she stipulated to a second probation violation resulting from her refusal to enter a residential treatment program. In January 2023, Gaynor was successfully discharged from probation. In deciding to grant Gaynor’s request for a reactivated Iowa license, subject to two years of probationary status, the Board of Nursing noted Gaynor “was forthcoming regarding her criminal history and drug use,” and that she had been sober for 15 years before suffering a relapse.
Nikki Smith of Waterloo — Board records indicate Smith applied for licensure in November 2024. A board review of her criminal history showed a conviction for first-offense drunken driving in July 2020, violation of a no-contact order in October 2022, a second-offense drunken driving charge in May 2024, and domestic-abuse assault by display or use of a weapon in May 2024. Smith subsequently completed a substance-abuse evaluation, a domestic abuse program and a drinking driver’s class, according to the board. Noting that Smith was “forthcoming regarding her criminal history” and that “she took full responsibility for her mistakes,” the board agreed to issue Smith a license, subject to one year of probationary status.
Ursella M. Washington of Perry — The Board of Nursing has charged Washington with committing an act that might adversely affect the physical or psychosocial welfare of a patient; failing to assess, accurately document, evaluate, or report the status of a patient, and failing to respond to a board investigation or subpoena. The board has not disclosed any information as to the alleged conduct that gave rise to the charges or when it may have occurred. A disciplinary hearing on the matter is scheduled for April 23, 2026. Although the charges were only recently made public, state records indicate they were approved by the board on Sept. 8, 2025.

The board says it has opened an investigation into the matter and that in order to allow Wood “the opportunity to respond” to that investigation, and in order to meet the board’s interest in protecting the public, Wood and the board have agreed that for now, Wood will not practice massage therapy in Iowa. The agreement stipulates that it does not constitute “disciplinary action,” although, as a result of the agreement, Wood’s licensure status is being changed to “suspended” until further notice by the board.
Ankeny therapist sanctioned by board
In a separate, unrelated case, the Iowa Board of Massage Therapy has sanctioned Li Labee of Ankeny after charging her with two counts of allowing unlicensed employees to perform massage therapy without the required license.
The board alleged that while operating Bandung Massage in Ankeny, Labee “was, at best, not checking to ensure her employees were licensed by the State of Iowa.”
To resolve the matter, Labee and the board recently entered into a formal settlement agreement that includes conflicting information as to the nature of the discipline being imposed.
The signed, finalized agreement twice describes itself as a “voluntary surrender,” suggesting Labee has agreed to relinquish her license as a massage therapist. However, the “final order” portion of the agreement specifies only that Labee will receive a warning and be required to pay a $2,000 civil penalty, with no mention of her license being surrendered.

Instead, Rep. Ashley Tackett Laferty will run for district court judge. The Martin Democrat, who has represented the 95th House District since 2019, shared her decision in a New Year’s Day post on Facebook. She said she plans to serve the remainder of her term in the House. 
She thanked her constituents for their support, and said some of her proudest accomplishments included backing funding for the Mountain Parkway Expansion through Prestonsburg and for straightening a road to John M. Stumbo Elementary School.
“In addition to serving as your State Representative, for over 20 years, I have worked as an attorney representing our local families,” Laferty wrote. “I hope my record of hard work, and always trying to do what’s right for my community, helps you to support me in this election, as well!  Once again, I humbly ask for your trust and vote!”

Rising Alternatives
Examining the impact, causes and concerns surrounding the rapid growth of alternative instruction options in the state.
Read the series >


Enrollment in alternative instruction has nearly tripled since 2015 — now making up 7.6% of children receiving an education in the state.
The growth comes as public education enrollment decreases in the state for a second consecutive year. Public education peaked in South Dakota in 2023, with 137,759 students enrolled. This year, 135,577 students are enrolled in public schools.
South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden told lawmakers during his budget address earlier this month that his administration expects public school enrollment to continue to decrease next year, due to growing alternative instruction enrollment and lower birth rates.
State-accredited private school enrollment — including religious and tribal schools — decreased slightly to 15,043 this year. Enrollment is still higher than 2023, when it was 14,741.


The Sioux Falls School District reported the largest increase in alternative instruction this year, with 131 more students enrolled. Harrisburg (78), Brandon Valley (67) and Rapid City (64) were also among the highest increases in alternative instruction enrollment in the state.
McLaughlin and Burke school districts reported some of the highest percentage increases of students enrolling in alternative instruction since last year.
In McLaughlin, 18 students enrolled in alternative instruction in 2025, a 157% increase from seven registered the year before.

(Photo by Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Moving the Chiefs to Kansas will spur economic development, but the complexity and lack of details about the deal make it difficult to determine what taxpayers will ultimately pay.
The announcement that the Chiefs and state of Kansas will spend an estimated $4 billion to build a domed stadium in Wyandotte County surrounded by an entertainment district and a team headquarters and training facility in Johnson County has prompted questions about whether Kansans will lose money on the deal.
Economic growth in a large and so-far-undefined area in Wyandotte and Johnson counties will be reserved to pay down STAR bonds over the next two or three decades. The Chiefs also could enjoy property tax subsidies and other financial support if economic development programs are implemented locally. 
It is accurate when state leaders say no new taxes will be implemented to move the Chiefs across the border, said Ian Graves, a Prairie Village City Council member and self-described public finance policy wonk who has been studying the details. 
However, the project may require new taxes down the road to cover the loss of revenue growth that would normally flow into the state’s coffers, he said. 
The Chiefs project will be funded through a 60-40 public-private partnership, according to terms posted online by the Kansas Department of Commerce. The state’s 60% of funding will come from a mix of STAR bonds, or sales tax and revenue bonds, and funds in the Attracting Professional Sports to Kansas Fund, which is revenue from iLottery and sports betting. 
STAR bonds also will be repaid with 100% of liquor sales tax collected in the district. 
According to a Commerce Department fact sheet, the state expects 20,000 new jobs to be created during the construction phase and more than 4,000 new permanent jobs at the stadium and entertainment district that will surround the stadium. The annual estimated economic impact is expected to be $1 billion, and the Chiefs will pay $7 million in annual rent. 
Graves said his primary concern is with how the project freezes future revenue growth.  
“We are diverting natural revenue growth over time that we rely on to basically account for the increase of price in goods and services that governments require,” he said. “If you look at sales tax revenue growth, just naturally, it floats with inflation because as the price of purchased goods go up, sales tax revenues also climb, and then that increased revenue goes back to be able to support the city or state.”
Graves said his interest isn’t part of his Prairie Village role but came about because the city recently passed bonds and he had spent time learning about their mechanisms. He used his computer science background to build an online tool to take a deep dive into costs associated with the Chiefs project.
The tool allows users to change assumptions such as the interest rate, repayment period and principal amount. 
“Even after I made it, I’m like this still isn’t super easy to understand,” he said. “You can set worst-case scenarios, but basically it’s just a lot of money going to it, and you can see that most of it is just regular old sales and use tax. The narrative about alcohol and gambling revenues, that’s just kind of window dressing. It’s just sales taxes that are powering this thing.”
Toggling different scenarios on Graves’ STAR bonds financing model, the state’s portion over time — including principal and interest — could be anywhere from $3 billion to $4 billion and on up. 
Paul Byrne, economics professor at Washburn University, said moving the Chiefs will definitely generate new economic activity for Kansas. 
“Some of the critics kind of downplay that, but you’re having a lot of people crossing the state line, they’re going to spend a lot of money,” he said. “That money is going to have a multiplier effect, and that’s going to have an impact on the revenue. So that I definitely take as a given.”
The multiplier effect refers to the idea that money spent in a community has a ripple effect. A cook at a new restaurant receives a paycheck on which they paid taxes. They then buy groceries at local stores, which fuels more jobs and income in the community. 
However, the question is whether that growth will justify the subsidies going to build the Chiefs’ facilities, Byrne said.
He expressed concern about the way the STAR bonds will be set up and what challenges that will present for repayment and the state budget. Much is still unknown, he said.

Gov. and Secretary of Commerce David Toland will determine the final boundaries of the STAR bonds district when the bonds are issued to pay for the 60% investment the state will make in building the Kansas City Chiefs stadium, headquarters and training facility.

STAR bonds
Kansas STAR bonds are issued to finance major development projects, and under usual circumstances, must be for projects where the capital investment exceeds $75 million and projected annual gross sales are $75 million, according to the Kansas Department of Commerce. 
The bonds must not pay for more than 50% of the development and are typically repaid over 20 years. 
However, to entice the Chiefs and possibly the Royals across the state border, the Kansas Legislature in 2024 passed a special session law that would allow STAR bonds to pay for up to 70% of a project and upped the repayment timeframe to 30 years. 
STAR bonds typically are paid through state retail sales tax dollars generated by the district, which is determined by the Commerce Department. For instance, if the bond district had $1 million in state sales tax revenue in the 12 months preceding the date the bonds were issued, that sets the base value at $1 million. If sales tax revenue jumped to $6 million after the new development, the new revenue of $5 million would go to debt repayment. 
However, new regulations regarding stadium development allow the base value to be changed, Byrne said. 
“It gives the secretary of commerce the right to pick any base value,” Byrne said. “That jumped out at me because they could just make everything zero. If they choose a base value that’s below what would typically be a base value, well then you’re even more clearly capturing sales tax revenue or property tax revenue, or whatever would have gone to the state and to the local government.” 
Although the state has approved using its sales tax revenue in the proposed district to repay the STAR bonds, other taxing authorities in the district, such as Wyandotte County and Olathe, will vote on whether to fund the project with a percentage or all of local sales taxes collected.
Bob North, the Commerce Department’s chief counsel, said changing that base value hasn’t been discussed. But he said state legislators and leaders have made it clear they don’t want to set a base that would have any effect on existing income.
“We’re not going to set an artificially low base, because that could actually have an impact on state general fund revenues,” he said.

The state budget
The Chiefs economic development package will affect state revenue, North said. 
“We think some of that foregone revenue will be made up with increased income tax and some of the other kinds of economic benefits we’re going to see from the Chiefs being here,” he said. 
North stressed that only the state portion of the sales tax revenue increase in the bond district will repay the Chiefs bonds. Local governments will have to determine whether they are going to pledge county or city sales tax revenue to the STAR bonds. 
If local communities choose not to participate, it would have a negative financial impact on the project, North said. 
“STAR bonds are built on the premise that it’s going to be a partnership between the state and the local units of government,” he said. “We anticipate both Olathe and Kansas City, Kansas, unified government voting to participate in the STAR bonds. It’s really important, and something that we’re monitoring very closely.” 
But would it be a deal breaker if they don’t participate? 
“It’s hard to look nine to 12 months into the future,” North said. “The answer to that is going to depend on the kind of economic conditions that are present in nine to 12 months, interest rates and general economic conditions and things like that. So we can’t definitively say at this point in time what that impact might be.”
The participation of local governments concerns Graves, who said taking away the growth in revenue could put the area in a position of being unable to keep up with annual increases in the cost of doing business. 
“It all creeps up on you over time,” he said. “That’ll happen about two election cycles out, is when that will really bite. In one or two election cycles, it’s going to be like, ‘Gosh, we really have this budget shortfall, and it’s because we’ve nuked off all this natural growth from Wyandotte and JoCo from feeding into the state coffers.’ And so how are they going to plug that hole? Are they going to cut services? They going to raise taxes? They going to do both? And that will be a question for future Kansas. Not cool just-got-the-Chiefs Kansas, right?”

The map
A map put out by the Kansas Department of Commerce highlights possible boundaries for the STAR bond district, which is key to determine how much of an area’s sales tax revenue will be pulled into paying for the stadium. 
The map is labeled “illustrative” and notes the final boundaries will be determined by the secretary of commerce. When overlaid on a county map, it looks as if the boundaries could include all of Wyandotte County, but North said that won’t be the case. 
The district will be finalized by the secretary closer to when the STAR bonds are issued, which will be in six to eight months, he said. 
“The size of the district is going to be contingent, to a certain extent, on what we need to do to finance the bonds,” North said. 
For instance, if interest rates drop two points in the next few months, the district would have a smaller footprint, and the opposite is also true, he said. 
“The unknown is the exact site in Wyandotte County, and until that piece is resolved, we can’t really finalize what Wyandotte County is going to look like,” he said. “It certainly will not be the entire county. The STAR bond district will be the stadium and then the mixed-use development that’s adjacent to the stadium.”
North said the STAR bond act allows the commerce secretary to reduce or add to the district’s size after it is set up, if necessary, but he could only think of instances in which the land area has been reduced.

Up in the air
Some parts of the plan are uncertain, such as whether the Chiefs will take advantage of the state’s High Performance Incentive Program, or HPIP, Byrne said. The program provides a 10% income tax credit for eligible capital investments, with the threshold in five metro counties, including Wyandotte and Johnson, set at $1 million. 
It also provides a sales tax exemption that can be used on the company’s capital investments, and a training tax credit up to $50,000. 
The HPIP is for companies that locate their headquarters in the state and pay above-average wages. North said it is a statutory program and isn’t included in the stadium bill, so if the Chiefs meet the criteria laid out, they can participate.  
Byrne said visiting players on opposing teams would likely pay tax for their work in the state, which would be a benefit to state revenue. In addition, other events held at the stadium during the offseason could bring in revenue. 
Although the published STAR bonds district map isn’t finalized, it indicates the district will be large, he said. 
One misconception he’s seen around STAR bonds is confusion over where the sales tax revenue comes from to pay off the bonds, Byrne said. 
“People think there’s some special way where they only include the Chiefs stadium. It captures everything,” he said. “Somebody goes in the middle of May and goes to a restaurant, that’ll be captured as well. And clearly that person probably isn’t going there just because there’s a stadium there, because the Chiefs are there. That’s the misconception.”
Graves said other uncertainties are outlined in the STAR bonds terms, which open the possibility of setting up other taxing districts such as TIFs, or tax increment financing districts. A TIF district does what STAR bonds do, except with property taxes. 
Property tax values are frozen at the beginning of the project, and when improvements generate additional property taxes, those dollars would pay for improvements.
The STAR bonds terms with the Chiefs also open the possibility to establish community improvement districts and transportation improvement districts, Graves said.  
“All of those can be set up, and they do not count toward the public portion of the project’s cap,” he said. “What I take that to mean is that Wyandotte could, in theory, establish something like a TIF in the surrounding area around the Chiefs stadium, at the behest of the Chiefs or the developers working for the Chiefs, or what have you, to also capture revenues on the property tax side and divert that to developing those districts.”
One of the unknowns about the Chiefs development is exactly where it will be located. It is expected to be on land near the Kansas Speedway in the Village West development of Kansas City, Kansas. (Photo by Grace Hills for Kansas Reflector)
Yay or nay?
Both Graves and Byrne pointed to economists who, in general, say stadium subsidy deals are not winners for states. 
Byrne said he can’t ignore the economic development that will occur. 
Unlike some projects that are controversial because they simply shift economic activity from one part of a town or county to another part, Byrne said shifting economic dollars from MIssouri to Kansas will positively affect Kansas. 
“There’s a reason you had those border wars for all those years,” Byrne said. “If you can get someone across that state line, it is going to generate pretty significant economic activity.”
North pointed to expected job creation, which will increase state income tax collections, and property taxes from major developments that occur. That assumes local areas don’t set up a TIF district that would subsidize the development by nixing property taxes.
Graves said he’s “agnostic” about whether the state should have fought to bring the Chiefs to Kansas. 
“What I wish we could be more clear about is how this financing works,” he said. “Because I don’t feel like we’re being transparent with the residents about where this money is coming from, and what public services they rely on that rely on this increment that naturally grows. I don’t think we’re being straightforward. After 10 years of growth, this could be hundreds of millions of dollars diverted every year to financing this thing, and that’s a hole in the budget. What’s going to flood that hole?”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_7847-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-02 10:11:41.531426

(Anna Padilla for Source NM)New Mexico’s 2026 legislative session begins Jan. 20. While state economists expect the budget to continue its streak of increased revenue, projections show it will be by slimmer margins than previously expected, and elected leaders have made it clear that few state agencies will receive everything they’ve requested.
In Legislative Finance Committee hearings in November and December, state agencies presented their funding requests to lawmakers and repeatedly faced warnings: The state is at its lowest point for “recurring funds” — which refers to ongoing spending, such as increasing the number of full-time employees at a state agency — since the COVID-19 pandemic.
New Mexico’s economy is “treading water” while much of the nation is in or near a recession, a recent Legislative Finance Committee report found. The report estimated the state would finish this fiscal year with $13.4 billion in recurring revenue — a nearly $323 million decrease since LFC’s previous forecast in August.
Lawmakers and state analysts attribute the low point to a number of factors, ranging from massive reductions to corporate income tax as part of President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” to spending on the governor’s executive orders for disaster response.
“The tariffs, increased prices and higher uncertainty are impacting a wide range of areas. One example: Oil prices per barrel are down 20-plus percent,” Rep. Nathan Small (D-Las Cruces), who chairs the House Appropriations and Finance Committee, told Source NM. “There are no doom and gloom conclusions here. While we retain really strong non-recurring capacity and we’re in a safe place with really strong reserves. The ‘new money’ and the ability to invest in new programs, make a ton of new governmental hires — that is something that we’re going to have to watch very carefully.”
In recent hearings, lawmakers and legislative analysts blamed HR1, commonly known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” for significantly limiting the state’s revenue sources. The legislation gave hefty corporate income tax breaks to industries such as oil and gas and manufacturing, which combined make up half of New Mexico’s corporate tax base. Corporate income tax was briefly in the red this fiscal year for the first time since early in the pandemic, they said.
The federal fallout is responsible for tens of millions of dollars in revenue loss, according to the December LFC report. The federal increase to the standard deduction will lead to an estimated loss of $39.2 million for New Mexico and changes to Medicaid and state-directed payments will lead to an estimated loss of $17.1 million, the report says.
The LFC report projected that the state will only have $105.7 million in “new money,” which refers to a year’s total revenue minus the prior year’s spending. That amounts to less than 1% of growth from the current fiscal year.
Small said that he has confidence in the state’s finances and believes leaders are in a “strong position” to invest in the state. But that doesn’t mean there aren’t concerns.
Of particular concern, he said, are hiring new full-time employees at state agencies and paying for health insurance premiums. Small said he is “very fearful” of federal cuts to programs like Medicaid and wants to ensure the state doesn’t spread itself too thin by compensating for the federal cuts.

“That is something we are very, frankly, fearful of. Cutting billions of dollars to our health care system that is already stressed is quite concerning,” Small said. “It’s another reminder to make sure we retain the capacity to address those challenges the best that we can and it means not going too far on recurring spending in other areas.”
One way the state could spread itself too thin, the December LFC report says, is in funding emergency responses.
Spending on executive orders from the governor to pay for the state’s response to unexpected disasters like wildfires, flooding and the COVID-19 pandemic have become a growing point of contention between the fourth floor of the Roundhouse and state lawmakers. Those orders alone could wipe out all of New Mexico’s new money next fiscal year, the report says.
State agencies had opportunities in November and December to present their budget requests to lawmakers on the interim Legislative Finance Committee.
Budget requests ranged from the routine to the unexpected during those hearings. A coalition of cities and towns said water infrastructure projects are underfunded by $200 million; rural prosecutors asked for help with internet connections and high-mileage cars; the state Public Education Department secretary disclosed a $35 million shortfall after a debacle that involved paying multiple school districts to serve the same students virtually.
While 30-day legislative sessions typically are reserved for budgetary matters, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s office told Source NM that public safety will be on her legislative agenda, known as a call. Lawmakers in both parties have announced plans to propose legislation around firearm dealers and criminal sentencing.
The governor released her own $11.3 billion budget proposal on Dec. 22, a 4.6% increase over the current fiscal year that includes additional spending for the state’s universal child care program, as well as funding to compensate for decreased federal dollars.
“The recurring, very expensive new investments will be very challenging,” Small told Source. “This is the final year of the administration. In a lot of ways, we are and should be focused on finishing things out, as opposed to starting brand new initiatives.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_0528-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-02 10:11:41.531426

(Photo by Janine L, Weisman/Rhode Island Current)South Carolina lawmakers and utility executives have been grappling with how to meet the state’s growing power needs. But the state has been slow to make use of federal programs that aid the energy crunch from another direction — by reducing the amount of power used.
That could change, pending final approval from the U.S. Department of Energy.
South Carolina’s Energy Office is expected to award the operator contract for a pair of consumer rebate programs by Jan. 14, according to a state procurement notice, nearly 3½ years after the passage of the Biden administration’s hallmark clean energy package that funded them.
How long it will take for the state’s $137 million share to go out after the contractor is chosen remains to be seen. The federal energy agency has left other states in limbo for months.
What the programs do
The Home Electrification and Appliance Rebates program reimburses up to $14,000 to low- and middle-income residents who install high-efficiency electric appliances in their homes.
Another program is available to homeowners of all income levels. The Home Efficiency Rebates program, dubbed HOMES, pays for home improvements. That could include insulating and sealing homes or installing smart thermostats that automatically reduce heating and cooling use during hours when no one is home.
While any homeowner can apply for HOMES, low-income families are allowed the biggest rebates. Caps range from $2,000 to $16,000, depending on applicants’ income and their project’s estimated energy savings.
Renters may be eligible for either program with written permission from the property owner, according to the state Energy Office.
And residents that meet income eligibility, earning no more than one and a half times the area median income for their county, can apply for funding under both programs. To qualify for appliance rebates in Richland County, for example, a household income can’t exceed $139,000. In Charleston County, the income cap is about $166,000. In Greenville County, it’s about $146,000.
South Carolina’s share of the federal funding package is to be split almost evenly between the two programs, according to a database maintained by Atlas Public Policy, a Washington, D.C., climate policy research firm.
Where the programs stand
A handful of states had fully executed contracts and access to funding before President Joe Biden left office. Five states, including North Carolina and Georgia, as well as Washington, D.C., already have both programs in place, according to the database. Seven other states have at least one of the programs in operation.
North Carolina’s programs have been running since Jan. 16, 2025. Georgia started with a pilot program in November 2024 and began full operations in March 2025.
As of Dec. 2, 2025, Georgia had paid out $1.9 million total to 184 households under the appliance-rebate program. Its HOMES program had awarded 684 households a total of $7.1 million, according to the state’s online dashboard.
North Carolina is rolling its programs out one county at a time. As of June 13, the state had received more than 4,100 applications.
But the U.S. Department of Energy has slow-walked a review of Biden-era funding, leaving the remaining 36 states and five territories that applied wondering whether their share of funding will actually come.
South Carolina’s Energy Office started the application process near the end of September 2023, which included opting to participate. Nearly 1½ years later, in mid-January 2025, the U.S. Department of Energy gave the initial funding nod, but the state still had to come up with a plan for how to give those funds out and what to focus the spending on.
Five days later, President Donald Trump took office.
On day one, the president signed an executive order freezing clean energy-related funding in the previous administration’s massive energy and infrastructure laws. This threw the future of the two energy efficiency programs into question, alongside several other initiatives, including grants for solar programs that help low-income communities and funding to expand the availability of public electric vehicle chargers along the U.S. interstate system.
In early June, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright told a U.S. House energy panel that his agency’s review was ongoing.
“By the end of this summer or middle of this summer, we are going to have clarity on most of the big projects,” Wright said.
But where the energy efficiency rebates fit into that review is unclear, and nothing appears to have changed since that hearing.
South Carolina joined the queue near the end of July, submitting its plan for final approval.
While the Energy Office is prepared to select a contractor, it too will remain on hold until federal sign-offs resume.
Other programs
As for those other energy-related programs, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced in August it was terminating a $124 million Solar For All grant won by South Carolina’s Office of Resilience. While other states have filed lawsuits in an effort to keep their funding, South Carolina did not.
The state Office of Resilience was still in its first year of planning when the funding was pulled, so the agency had yet to work out details for spending the grant.
EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin pointed to a provision in Republican’s “One, Big, Beautiful” spending package repealing the fund that housed the money.
​“EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program, or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,” Zeldin said in a video posted to social media.
The provision applied only to “unobligated” funds, however, and the states suing to hold on to the money argue the environmental agency had awarded all $7 billion of the program’s grant money.
SC can restart electric vehicle charging program after federal funding restored

Court battles also took place earlier in 2025 over electric vehicle charging funds.
The Federal Highway Administration stopped sending out dollars for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program, known as NEVI, in February.
Twenty states, the District of Columbia and half a dozen environmental groups sued the Trump administration over the paused funding. The money remained on ice until a federal judge, in June, ordered the freeze be lifted.
In August, the highway agency sent notices out to states, letting them know they could reapply.
The agency has since approved South Carolina’s new application.
The state is eligible for about $70 million and will start looking for contractors to build charging stations sometime in 2026, according to the state’s transportation department.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/electrician-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-02 10:11:41.531426

A celebration of Didier on Dec. 31 in Cadours before his ashes were laid to rest alongside his mother and grandparents in Villefranche. Vermont friends are invited to send remembrances of Didier, to be translated and shared with his family, to nwelch@uvm.edu.

Long-time Burlington photographer Didier Delmas died Dec. 22 in Cadours, France, from complications of von Hippel Lindau Syndrome. He was 71.
Born in Villefranche-de-Rouergue, Didier briefly studied architecture in Toulouse before leaving school to pursue his dreams in photography. Self-trained, he first worked as an archeological photographer for Toulouse’s Musée Saint-Raymond before opening his first studio, focusing on hard-to-photograph metal and glass. His early fine arts photographs are in the permanent collections at the Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris, and the Galerie Le Château d’Eau, Toulouse.
During summer visits to the U.S., Didier photographed campus life for Middlebury’s French School. When in 1983 he was awarded a photography contract for the “Joy of Gardening” cookbook, he settled first at Shelburne Farms and then in Burlington. For nearly 20 years he excelled in advertising and catalog photography. His fine arts giclée prints were sold through Frog Hollow and elsewhere.
Retiring from photography in 2001, Didier pursued a second dream of studying philosophy. After completing a bachelor’s in Cinema Studies at Burlington College, he went on to earn a master’s and a doctorate at McGill University, specializing in 17th-century visual culture.
Didier is survived by his father, Bernard Delmas, his sisters Marilyne (Roger) Nègro and Christine Delmas and their children, all of southwest France, as well as by his ex-wives, Gretchen Amussen of Paris and Nancy Welch of Hanover, New Hampshire. His death is also mourned by the many Vermont friends who affectionately called him “Chef Didier” and remember him as a gifted chef and generous host.

Brockport, N.Y.

Putney, Vermont
Details of services
A memorial celebration is being planned for April 4th in Southern Vermont.

Kai George, 83, died peacefully in her home in Putney on Dec. 16, 2025 with her family by her side.
Kai’s achievements and rich experiences could fill a book. We will share some of those here, but as anyone who met her recognized, the qualities that made Kai so special were her love of life, her generous spirit, and her desire to connect with everyone she met, from young children to elders. 
Over the last 24 months, as a glioblastoma brain tumor gradually took away her ability to do many of the things she had enjoyed throughout her life, she delighted in time shared with friends and family. Those who knew her from earlier times saw a person who combined these qualities with remarkable abilities ranging from cooking, gardening, singing, playing guitar and piano, knitting, and much more–all of which she seemed to do effortlessly. Although she was prodigiously talented, she was exceedingly humble — always showing much more interest in the lives of her friends and family than her own notable achievements.
Kai was born Karen Jean Lowen in Brockport, N.Y. on July 30, 1942, the first child of Rev. M. DeForest “Dee” Lowen and Thelma Orchidea (Johnson) Lowen. Her immigrant “Mormor,” four aunts, and two cousins created a warm community around her, celebrating Swedish holidays with joy and devotion.
Kai lived in Utica, N.Y. during her elementary school years. In eighth grade her family moved to Ridgewood, N.J. and she graduated from Ridgewood High School in 1960. She attended Earlham College for two years before marrying Malcolm “Mac” George on June 30, 1962 in her father’s American Baptist church in Ridgewood. The newlyweds moved to San Francisco where Mac began his architectural career and Kai attended San Francisco State University, receiving a B.A. in elementary education. 
Kai began her career teaching elementary school in the turbulent 1960s in Berkeley, California. In her first teaching job out of school, Kai supported her Black students as they faced protesters opposed to busing laws that brought them to her school. Kai took time away from teaching when her first child, Randy, was born in 1969. The young family traveled in Europe for several months in 1971.
After their second child, Kirstin, was born, Kai and Mac left the San Francisco Bay Area and city life to begin a new chapter in rural Midcoast Maine in 1973. It was there in the town of Montville that Kai and Mac put down roots and lived for the next 36 years. Kai formed some of her deepest, most enduring friendships there.
She gracefully integrated being a devoted mom with building a house in the woods, growing a significant portion of her family’s food, and becoming an integral part of the Waldo County community. Soon Kai found herself going back to teaching, first as a childbirth educator (which she did for nearly 20 years), then as the director of the local Adult Basic Education program. In 1981 she returned to teaching elementary school full-time. 
In 1989 Kai created the Multi-Aged Integrated Learning Environment (MILE) program at Walker Elementary School in Liberty, Maine. Beginning with MILE One for 5-8 year olds and soon extending to MILE Two for 8-11 year olds, this pioneering initiative was centered around Kai’s deep belief in meeting every student where they were, regardless of their age, and building holistic learning communities that explored exciting themes (e.g., Maine animals) while learning the traditional subjects.
She was widely recognized for her excellence as an educator and had the pleasure of teaching many children whose parents knew Kai as their childbirth teacher and in some cases as their first grade teacher! In 1996, Bill Clinton awarded her the Presidential Award for Excellence in Math and Science Education. She was flown to the White House to receive this honor from Hillary Clinton.
When the first of Kai’s four grandchildren was born in 2004, she retired from teaching and became a devoted and delighted grandparent. When her twin grandchildren were born in India in 2014, she travelled there for two months to help care for the babies. She shared her love of the natural world with all of her grandchildren. Kai took her “barn barns” on many adventures including hiking, canoeing, camping, attending circus yoga camps, and much more. All four of this next generation considered their Farmor/Mormor to be like a third parent and friend. 
Kai moved from Maine to Putney, Vermont in September of 2009, following Mac’s death that spring. In her new community, Kai developed many close friendships. She was a tutor and nature educator at the Putney Central School, worked shifts at the Community Center food shelf, was on the board of the Putney Mountain Association, sang in the River Singers Chorus, and won the award for most classes attended in one month at the local yoga studio. She enjoyed sharing her love of vegetable gardening with her neighbors at Putney Commons and created beautiful flower gardens there.
Throughout Kai’s life, she made time to travel overseas, often with friends and sometimes as a volunteer. She also prioritized immersing herself in wild places with Mac and other friends: up mountain trails, on pristine lakes, and along the coast of Maine. Knitting and sewing for loved ones was a source of great pleasure, as was making nourishing, delicious food. She was well known for her ability to host guests in her beauty-filled homes while simultaneously, and seemingly without effort, cooking a fabulous meal. 
Kai accepted her terminal diagnosis with equanimity and without fear or regret. Instead, she continued to express wonder and appreciation for the natural world and her loved ones. Toward the end of her life, as Kai began to need more assistance, this supreme giver was finally able to receive care from dozens of friends and family near and far, new and old. Local friends visited and assisted her daily. Maine friends whom she’d known for 50 years came to stay with her every few weeks over these last two years
 Kai left this world with the same grace with which she lived her life. Even in her final days, Kai never lost her infectious smile and love for everyone. She lives on as an inspiration to all who knew and loved her.
Kai is survived by son Randy George and daughter in law Eliza Cain of Moretown, Vermont; daughter Kirstin Edelglass and son in law William Edelglass of Marlboro, Vermont; granddaughters Maia George of Burlington, Vermont and Solveig George of Beverly, Massachusetts; grandchildren Jasmine and Sarah Edelglass of Marlboro, Vermont; brother Neal Lowen of Oakland, California; and many cousins, nieces and nephews. She was predeceased by father M. DeForest Lowen, mother Thelma Lowen, husband Mac George and brother Eric Lowen.
 For those wishing to make a donation in Kai’s name, her family suggests these two organizations for which she volunteered: the Putney Mountain Association or the Community Asylum Seekers Project.

If this wasn’t football, you’d call it a fairy tale. All that’s missing are magic beans and silver slippers.
Here Thursday night at the jam-packed Superdome, one of the world’s most famous sports venues, Chambliss willed the Ole Miss Rebels to a scintillating 39-34 Sugar Bowl victory over the proud Georgia Bulldogs. He did it with his strong right arm. He did it with his legs. He did it with courage and with uncommon flair.

Last season Chambliss was doing it at Division II Ferris State in Michigan, where he won a national championship. This year, he’s doing it on the biggest stage in college football, where he is now two steps from winning another much, much bigger trophy.
Chambliss threw for 362 yards and two touchdowns, often darting away from some the biggest, strongest, red-shirted human beings you will ever see. At one point he completed a Sugar Bowl-record 13 passes in a row. He made plays when there didn’t seem a play to be made. Sometimes, it seemed like magic. And after all that he might have led the loudest Hotty Toddy in history. “Are you ready?” he hollered into the microphone after being awarded the MVP trophy. About 40,000 Ole Miss fans, most dressed in powder blue, thundered the rest. 
Said Georgia coach Kirby Smart, accurately, “Their quarterback is just incredible. I mean, he does an unbelievable job of not giving up sacks and making plays with his legs. They made more plays than we did; and I’ve got to be honest, that’s part of football. They out-executed us, out-coached us, out-played us.”

“I’m speechless,” Chambliss would later say in the post-game press conference. “We were down 9 points at one point, and they were down 9 points when we played them before, so it was kind of like roles reversed. I didn’t play my best football in the fourth quarter when we played them before, so I wanted to redeem myself.”
Mission accomplished – and then some.
Georgia, winner of two national championships this decade, had won 53 straight games when leading at halftime. The Bulldogs led Ole Miss 21-12 at intermission, only to be outscored 27-13 over the last 30 minutes. Every time Ole Miss needed a big play – and those times were many – Chambliss stepped up and made it. Georgia had won and amazing 75 straight games when leading going into the fourth quarter. Not this time.

Make no mistake: Rebel heroes were many this night:

Mississippians Will Echoles (the defensive MVP) of Houston, Suntarine Perkins of Raleigh and Zxavian Harris of Canton keyed a defensive effort that made just enough stops to seal the victory. 
Running back Kewan Lacy, as good as any back in the country, ran for 98 bruising yards and two touchdowns.
Wide receiver Harrison Wallace III snagged nine passes for 156 yards and a touchdown, while teammate Deshaun Stribling caught seven more throws for 122 yards. There may be a college team that has as many high-quality wide receivers as Ole Miss, but these eyes haven’t seen it.
And, heavens, let us not forget placekicker Lucas Carneiro, the transfer from Western Kentucky, who launched Sugar Bowl record-breaking field goals of 55 and 56 yards in the first quarter and then hit the game-winning field goal of 47 yards with six seconds remaining. All three kicks would have been good from 60 yards or more. Ole Miss would not have won without him.

This observer had thought Ole Miss would have to win the turnover battle and/or make a big play in the kicking game in order to slay Georgia. That wasn’t the case. Georgia got the game’s only turnover, a 47-yard scoop-and-score fumble return by Dylan Everette in the second quarter. The Bulldogs also made a huge kicking game play in the third quarter, faking a punt to extend a drive that led to a third quarter field goal and a 24-19 Georgia lead. It was pretty much all Rebels after that.
Ole Miss dominated statistically, out-gaining the Bulldogs 473-343. Take away that scoop-and-score and the Rebels would have won more comfortably. 
“Pete! Pete! Pete!” Rebel fans thundered when the Rebels’ new head coach Pete Golding was called to the podium in the post-game awards ceremony. Later, Golding credited the crowd.
“The fans, you know, it felt like a home game to me, looking up and hearing them,” Golding said. “And then for these guys to play the way and to be able to come back the way they did versus a team like that. … They (the Rebels) are never scared and they don’t panic, and that’s what I love about this group.”
Said Smart: “It felt like we were on the road.”
So now, Ole Miss moves on to play Miami at Tempe, Arizona, in the Fiesta Bowl and the national semifinals on Jan. 8. Indiana plays Oregon in the Peach Bowl, the other semifinal, the next night. Winners of those two games will play for the national championship Jan. 19 in Miami Gardens, Florida.
Could the Ole Miss Rebels win it all? 
I’d answer that with this: Would that be any more unbelievable than a transfer from Ferris State beating the Georgia Bulldogs with one of the greatest performances in Sugar Bowl history?",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/01232241/AP26002189253468.jpg,,,2026-01-02 08:56:32.642202

Consumers will have to pay a 1.5% fee on all products with an embedded battery as the result of a new law aiming to curb risk of battery fires. 


Starting January 1, Californians will pay a new fee every time they buy a product with a non-removable battery – whether it’s a power tool, a PlayStation, or even a singing greeting card.
The 1.5% surcharge, capped at $15, expands a recycling program that’s been quietly collecting old computer monitors and TVs for two decades. The change is a result of Senate Bill 1215, authored by former state Sen. Josh Newman, a Democrat who represented parts of Los Angeles and San Bernardino. It was signed into law in 2022. 
Consumers will pay the fee when buying any product with an embedded battery whether it’s rechargeable or not. Many of these products, experts said, end up in the trash. In its most recent analysis, the California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery estimates about 7,300 tons of batteries go to landfills illegally or by accident.  
California pioneered electronic waste fees with computer monitors and TVs in 2003. The fee worked, keeping hazardous screens out of landfills and building better systems for proper disposal. But over the last 20 years, electronic waste has continued to evolve.  
Powerful lithium batteries have become cheaper and more accessible as demand for technology has increased. They now power everyday products, from cellphones and AirPods to power tools and toys. 
“These things are everywhere. They’re ubiquitous,” said Joe La Mariana, executive director of RethinkWaste, which manages waste services for 12 San Mateo County cities – a co-sponsor of the legislation. 
They’re also, under some circumstances, a risk. Under harsh conditions at recycling and waste facilities, lithium-ion batteries can burst into flames and even explode.
“Paying a small check‑stand fee to fund proper collection is far cheaper than million‑dollar fires, higher insurance premiums, and rate hikes passed back to communities,” said Doug Kobold, executive director of the California Product Stewardship Council, which co-sponsored the legislation. 
A growing problem 
In 2016, in the San Mateo County city of San Carlos, a lithium-ion battery sparked a major fire at the Shoreway Environmental Center recycling facility. It caused a four-month plant shutdown and $8.5 million in damage. RethinkWaste, a regional waste management agency, oversees that facility. As a result of the fire, its insurance premium rose from $180,000 to $3.2 million annually, La Mariana said; ratepayers ultimately bore that cost. 
That fire catalyzed the waste management agency to seek solutions to the growing battery fire problem. 
“Being a publicly owned facility, every bit of that property is owned and paid for by our 430,000 ratepayers,” La Mariana said. “So we have a fiduciary responsibility to maintain the integrity of these assets. But also, on a human level, we have a very high responsibility for the safety of our colleagues and our co-workers.” 
Battery fires in waste and recycling facilities are an everyday hazard. Experts say they’re  underreported, likely because facilities fear oversight or increases in insurance premiums. 
And batteries can catch fire anywhere. Earlier this year, two girls were hospitalized after an electric scooter caught fire in a Los Angeles apartment building. According to the Federal Aviation Administration, there are nearly two battery fires on U.S. flights every week. 
Clean energy shift brings battery hazards
The fee consumers will pay in the new year is just one piece of the state’s evolving response to the emerging risk of lithium-ion batteries. 
Single-use plastic vapes are exempt from the new law because the Department of Toxic Substances Control raised concerns about collection and recycling systems handling nicotine, a hazardous substance, said Nick Lapis, an advocate with Californians Against Waste, which co-sponsored the legislation. They’re also the fastest growing source of lithium-ion battery waste.  
“If you imagine somebody’s a pack a day smoker, that means every single day they’re throwing out a device with a lithium-ion battery,” Lapis said. 
Last year,  assemblymembers Jacqui Irwin and Lori Wilson introduced Assembly Bill 762, a law that would ban single-use plastic vapes entirely. Lapis says he expects the Legislature to address the risk of vapes this year. 
Large-scale lithium-ion batteries present great danger of a different kind.
During the Los Angeles fires, dangerous lithium-ion batteries, including from electric vehicles, were left behind — resulting in a major cleanup operation by the Environmental Protection Agency. 
And almost a year ago, a fire burned at a battery storage site in Moss Landing for two days, requiring more than 1,000 people to be evacuated. Monterey County neighbors to the facility have complained of feeling sick since the fire, and a recent study detected toxic metals in nearby marshes. 
In 2024, Newsom established a collaborative of state agencies, including the California Air Resources Board and the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, to look into safety solutions for battery storage technologies. New CalFire regulations for battery storage systems will take effect this year.  
Finding ways to properly dispose of batteries and their lithium in the waste stream is critical as the state transitions away from fossil fuels, said Meg Slattery, a scientist for Earthjustice. 
“The next question becomes … where are we sourcing materials, and thinking through what happens to this when we’re not using it anymore, which I think we’re not traditionally great at thinking about as a society,” she said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/120925-Cell-Phone-Shopper-TC-GETTY-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-02 08:11:55.297007

A recent report found that with many fines and fees borne by poor people, about 42% are not paying what they've been assessed. The report recommended lowering fines and fees as a way of improving overall revenue collection. (Will McLelland for Alabama Reflector)A recent report found that reducing the size of fines and fees increases the likelihood of collecting more revenue, and that imposing a “collections fee” to compel people to pay increases their debt burden.
The report from the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation, published in October, draws on five years of research into fines and fees imposed in the court system within Jefferson County, which includes Birmingham. It could have major salience in a state where governments rely heavily on fines and fees for revenue.
“The way that fines and fees are set up right now, you are not done with your sentence until you have finished paying,” said Leah Nelson, co-founder and co-principal investigator on the project and  a senior research associate at the Public Affairs Research Council of Alabama. “Meaning, based on our findings, that almost no one actually finishes. The most common outcome is not finishing.”

While the research was only isolated to one county, the process for collecting court debt is nearly identical for all counties throughout Alabama, even though the amount of charge and offense the fine is tied to may be different.
Fines and fees are typically imposed when a person is found guilty by a court, which then levies a predetermined set of assessments based on the type of severity of the offense. Restitution may also be ordered for the victim to experience a financial loss.
Once the court receives payment, the money is then disbursed according to the priorities set by state law.
Fines and fees occupy two spheres, according to Nelson, as both a tool of criminal justice and a way of funding the courts.
“Certainly, it is a sanction, it is a penalty to penalize them for what they did wrong,” she said. “Is it intended as a deterrent? Probably. We all know we are going to get a fine if we speed and get caught. But then it is also a public finance tool, which is a completely different set of values.”
The report said fines and fees are problematic revenue generators because a substantial part of the population is unable to make their payments.
“In terms of overall payment trends, 42% of people pay nothing toward their fines and fees, with only 16% of people determined to be indigent paying off their full debt, compared with 50% of those who were not found to be indigent,” the report states.
The report also found that the balance for defendants increases over time, going from a cumulative median balance of about $1,200 when people are first assessed to a median balance of more than $1,500 about five years later. The top quartile in the sample had a balance of about $1,800, according to a graphic in the report, which then increased to almost $3,500.
The report did not include a breakdown for income for this specific analysis, but the median income of the census tracts demographics of the sample of people included in the report is about $44,000.
Increases in the balance are likely the result of a 30% collection fee that is imposed on outstanding court debt in addition to what is already owed. If someone has an outstanding balance of $1,000, the total increases to $1,300.
About two-thirds of the people who owed fines and fees in the sample are Black, according to the report.  Blacks on average initially owed $1,300 while whites owed $1,150. The cumulative balance for fines and fees for Blacks was more than $1,800 while whites had a cumulative balance, on average, of about $1,500.
“It is so complicated because I think it is reasonable to rule out the idea that judges are, on an individual basis, making decisions that are affected by the race of the defendant,” Nelson said. “The reason I say that is because these fines and fees happen, pretty much, by default.”
One reason that could explain why Blacks face a greater burden is they are disproportionately affected by the criminal justice system.
In terms of offenses involving drugs, the initial fine is $1,000 but each subsequent fine is $2,500.
“We also know that Black people are policed differently than white people, and particularly around drug possession, we see pretty significant disparities in arrest rates even though we know that, generally, Black people and white people use drugs at about the same rates,” Nelson said. “You should see equal distribution by population of arrests for that crime because the crime is committed by both races at about the same rate. But we see more Black people more likely to be arrested for unauthorized possession.”
The report documents other problems that may arise because of unpaid court debts.
People could avoid going to court because of fears pertaining to fines and fees. People who owe fines and fees are also less likely to engage with law enforcement because of the potential consequences they face stemming from unpaid court debt.
“People don’t know what will happen,” Nelson said. “It could be that an officer could tell them to go to the courthouse and pay it, or it could be that the officer arrests them, depending on the jurisdiction.”
The fears can even reach into health care.
“I talked with people who avoided going to the hospital because there is a fear, a myth, that the hospital might run their name, and see that they owe money to the court, and call the police and get them arrested,” Nelson said. “People avoid situations where their names are put on a computer. That is every public amenity.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/NorthportCourt_McLelland10854-1024x682.jpg,,,2026-01-02 08:11:55.297007

(Photo: KGHM Polska Meidz)Gold had a stupendous 2025, the price of an ounce reaching $3,000 for the first time in March, and then topping $4,000 in October. It closed 2025 at more than $4,300 an ounce, 66% higher than the price at the start of the year.
To which silver could have said “hold my beer.”
Silver started the year at around $30 an ounce. It ended on Dec. 31 at a little over $70 — a 144% increase.
Silver doesn’t get near the attention gold does, not even in the Silver State. In debates over Nevada mining taxes over the years, the focus has been on the value of gold, with silver warranting a mention, if at all, as an also-ran.
That’s for good reason. 
When the Nevada Department of Taxation reports mining tax revenues for the Silver State’s primary mining tax, silver isn’t even reported separately. Instead, the value of silver, a byproduct of mining gold, copper, and other minerals, is unceremoniously lumped into total “Gold/Silver” production revenues. 
According to Taxation’s 2024 report, $9.08 billion of “Gold/Silver” was mined in Nevada in 2024.
Roughly 5.7 million ounces of silver were mined in Nevada in 2024, according to the Nevada Division of Minerals. At the annual average price that year of a little less than $30 an ounce, that would amount to around $162 million worth of silver.
Which would mean the value of gold mined in Nevada in 2024 was more than $8.9 billion, 55 times as much as the value of silver.
‘Next generation metal’ though
The skyrocketing price of precious metals over the last year has been attributed in large part to investors worldwide seeking shelter amid global economic volatility and uncertainty, coupled with the declining value of the world’s dominant currency, the U.S. dollar, which dropped by 10% in 2025.
Especially late in the year, some analysts were also describing the rising price of gold and silver as a “momentum trade,” a corollary of FOMO (fear of missing out), in which investors chase after whatever stock or commodity is going up in a flashy way.
But a number of other — and more silver-specific — factors also contributed to the price of silver outpacing gold (as well as the stock prices for Nvidia and the techs) in 2025. In addition to being a precious metal that investors might turn to in volatile times, silver, unlike gold, has, as the cryptocurrency investors might say, multiple “use cases.”
Gold is shiny. But silver has the highest electrical conductivity of any metal.
“Silver is poised to play a pivotal ‘next generation metal’ role across industries critical to the green energy transition and digital transformation over the coming decade,” reads a December report on the mineral’s key industrial applications commissioned by the Silver Institute, a global industry association. 
Silver “enhances energy conversion in solar panels; accelerates data processing in data centers; and enables rapid charging and efficient power transmission in electric vehicles,” the report says.
While the Trump administration may not share the Silver Institute’s enthusiasm for solar power and EV’s, it’s all-in on data centers and the AI hyperscaling for which they stand, and has acknowledged silver has a value beyond merely looking pretty.
The U.S. Geological Survey in November added silver, along with copper, to the official list of “critical minerals,” potentially meaning tariff and federal investment and regulatory policies that would be favorable to U.S. silver producers.
Silver’s status as more than just another shiny object was also underscored in October when China, the world’s second-leading source of silver behind Mexico (the U.S. ranks 9th), announced new restrictions on silver exports, set to take effect with the new year. “This is not good,” Elon Musk wrote on his social media site earlier this week. “Silver is needed in many industrial processes.”
“Good” depends on one’s perspective. Higher metal prices benefit companies with silver-yielding mines.
Musk’s concern notwithstanding, many analysts project the price of silver will continue to rise in 2026, for a lot of the same reasons that drove precious metal prices to shoot up in 2025.
And as the Nevada Mining Association puts it in a blurb on its website, “When performance is more important than price, silver is often the material of choice.”
Continued rising prices of silver and other precious metals is by no means a sure thing. Of all commodity prices, minerals are infamously among the most volatile.
Meanwhile, even if silver has entered a new normal, and the price continues to soar upward, easily and by far the most valuable mineral in the Silver State will still be gold.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/kghm-silver-bars-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-02 08:11:55.297007

(Photo courtesy of IndeDocs)The 2026 calendar year marks the final year before the full effect of Act 20 of 2023 — the Certificate of Need repeal — will be felt in South Carolina’s health ecosystem.
This law will unleash competitive forces in the marketplace and reshape how care is delivered across our state.
But the job is not finished. One critical omission remains: The General Assembly has yet to address employment non-compete agreements imposed on physicians.
When a physician is prevented from continuing to practice in the community they serve, patients don’t get to vote on that decision. The continuity of medical care — something every clinician is trained to protect — can be severed by an administrative clause about which patients don’t even know.
In medicine, the real consequence lands on patients.
In other industries, non-competes may protect trade secrets or competitive advantage. In health care, they restrict something far more personal: the relationship between a patient and the doctor they trust.
A non-compete doesn’t just tell a doctor where they can work. It dictates whether their family must move and whether they can continue providing care in the very community they may have served for years.
In rural areas — where access to care is already stretched thin — the effects are amplified.
One restrictive contract can leave thousands without timely access to a primary care doctor, surgeon, or specialist. Non-competes give employers control of the labor force and take that control away from the communities that depend on those physicians.
Non-compete clauses for physicians are ethically objectionable because they subordinate the physician’s duty to patients to the employer’s business interests.
They treat the doctor–patient relationship as if patients were assets of the hospital rather than autonomous people, which is inconsistent with the special moral status of medical care.
Physicians are fiduciaries, expected to put patient welfare ahead of financial or institutional interests. A non-compete imposed as a condition of employment creates a built-in conflict between that duty and an employer’s interest in protecting market share, making a physician’s ability to continue caring for patients dependent on corporate permission rather than clinical judgment or patient choice.
Non-compete clauses also strip patients of meaningful choice and continuity of care.
When a physician leaves an employer, these provisions can force the doctor to relocate or stop practicing locally, abruptly severing long-standing relationships and compelling patients to transfer care regardless of trust or preference.
Patients are never parties to these contracts, yet they bear the consequences when a trusted physician disappears from their community. Any agreement that makes it harder for physicians to meet their duty of non-abandonment places contractual obligations above professional ethics — a reversal that should give policymakers pause.
Unlike states that have taken legislative action, South Carolina’s approach to non-competes is governed almost entirely by case law.
On paper that means contracts must be “reasonable.” In practice, it leaves individual physicians to challenge large systems on their own — something few are willing or able to do.
Most doctors will not risk becoming a test case, fearing retaliation or years of costly litigation.
The result is predictable: non-competes go largely unchallenged, even as their use expands.
Some South Carolina health systems use non-competes; others do not. National systems that operate in states where non-competes are restricted or prohibited function perfectly well without them, demonstrating these clauses are not essential to stable hospital operations.
Recent scrutiny of non-compete clauses has highlighted a broader gap: oversight reaches only certain entities. In a state like ours — where nonprofit systems dominate — outside enforcement often ends just as the impact on patients begins.
A patient doesn’t feel the difference between a for-profit and nonprofit employer when their doctor is suddenly forced to stop practicing in their community.
What they feel is loss, disruption, and too often the burden of starting over with a doctor assigned to take over their care.
Consider this: Lawyers are prohibited from blanket non-competes, and many lawmakers are attorneys themselves. Patients lose access to their doctors, and physicians lose the ability to practice freely in the communities that need them.
Health care is not a commodity; patients are not assets and doctors are not indentured servants.
South Carolinians deserve a system built around their right to choose who cares for them. If we want a stronger, healthier future for our state, removing non-competes as a condition of employment in medicine is one of the most impactful steps our Legislature can take — for patients, for physicians, and for every community that relies on us.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Hochman-feature-photo-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-02 08:11:55.297007

This isn’t old news. Nor are the solutions that lawmakers like state Rep. LaKeySha Bosley, a St. Louis Democrat, continue to propose in the hopes of finally getting more people to pay attention.
The numbers should raise alarms for Missouriians in every corner of the state, Bosley said.
“I can only imagine how fearful I’d be to have a child in this state knowing what I know statistically. And I know that is very true for other women who are not just in the urban areas but are in rural communities that don’t have access to a hospital within 20-plus miles, or even an urgent care, or anything,” Bosley said. “And that right there is where we should be putting a lot of our focus.”
Bosley, who is entering her eighth and final legislative session in the Missouri House, said she hopes to finally push through legislation that better addresses the state’s birth outcomes. She is among the only lawmakers so far to pre-file multiple legislative fixes to better study and prevent infant and maternal deaths. 
“We are a state that claims to love our children and want to put our children in the best outcomes to succeed in life,” Bosley said. “And the only way that I know how to do that is to start at the beginning.”
State Rep. LaKeySha Bosley, D-St. Louis, raises her hand to ask a question during the House Elections Committee hearing in September 2025 (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
On average, 70 women die each year in Missouri during childbirth or in the first year postpartum. Of those deaths, 80% are deemed preventable. Cardiovascular disease and mental health conditions were among the main causes of pregnancy-related deaths in the state.  
Missouri’s Pregnancy-Associated Mortality Review board dissects the causes of death in each case, aiming to identify preventable situations. 
Bosley is hoping to pass legislation that would establish a similar board to track and study infant deaths in the state, as well as fund grief counseling for family members who lost a child during childbirth or shortly after. The same bill would also expand the maternal mortality board to also study and address the socioeconomic and environmental outcomes, including global warming, on pregnancy outcomes. 
While the state’s infant mortality rate improved slightly from 2022 to the latest 2023 data, 441 babies still died before they turned 1 year old in Missouri in 2023, putting the state 33rd in the nation for infant deaths. Black infants are dying at twice the rate of white infants. The leading causes of death for infants in Missouri were birth defects, preterm birth, sudden unexpected infant death and accidents, according to a recent report from the March of Dimes. 
“The problem here is not only is this a lack of access issue, this is also a social economic issue,” Bosley said. “Most women who live in very poor communities in rural Missouri and also women of color typically have greater health risk and lower health outcomes. That goes back to systemic bias at how the health care system came to be.” 
State Sen. Barbara Washington, a Democrat from Kansas City, who is also pushing for the expansion of doula services, is hoping to further expand the state’s maternal mortality review board to include more diverse statewide representation. Her legislation would also add data on prenatal and postnatal health care access to the data collected by the board.
“We gotta do something,” Washington said. “ … People that English isn’t their first language and women of color, and women who are poor, especially Medicaid recipients, they’re not treated with the same level of respect. I’m not sure if any woman is, to be honest.”

Not long ago in Missouri, women on Medicaid were seven times more likely to die within a year of pregnancy than women on private insurance, according to a report by the state’s Pregnancy-Associated Mortality Review studying deaths from 2017 to 2021. Black mothers in that time frame were 2.5 times more likely to die within a year of pregnancy than white mothers. 
These outcomes prompted lawmakers to expand Medicaid coverage for new mothers from 60 days to one year postpartum.
One of Bosley’s bills seeks to include coverage for doula services for up to one year through the state’s Medicaid program, called MO HealthNet.
Doulas — who offer support for families during pregnancy, delivery and postpartum, but do not deliver babies — have been lifted up as one solution to improving maternal and infant health outcomes, especially among low-income families and families of color.
Last year, in an effort to address this, the state issued an emergency rule allowing doulas to be reimbursed through Medicaid. That rule has since expired.
Bosley also reintroduced a bill seeking to create the “Missouri Dignity in Pregnancy and Childbirth Act,” which would establish an evidence-based implicit bias program for perinatal health providers at all Missouri hospitals. 
“I don’t think we’ll ever get rid of bias, unfortunately, but we can at least have a conversation so people can start to be conscious about certain thoughts,” she said. 
She made note of a recent case in Indiana where a Black woman in active labor was turned away from a hospital and gave birth a short time later in a truck. She also noted the recent charges against a Virginia nurse accused of intentionally injuring at least one baby in the NICU.
“This is not something in the 1800s when we didn’t have technology that we have now,” Bosley said. “These are real-life stories that are happening in the 21st century.”
Another bill would make childbirth classes free for expectant mothers enrolled in the state’s Medicaid program.
Undocumented mothers in Missouri navigate pregnancy, postpartum as ICE threats loom

Rose Anderson-Rice, CEO of Generate Health, a St. Louis nonprofit that works to create more equitable maternal and infant health outcomes, particularly for families of color, said legislative fixes such as expandingMedicaid eligibility can be really impactful. 
She hopes to see lawmakers and community leaders focus on growing and diversifying the perinatal workforce, invest in addressing social determinants of health, fund community-based organizations that work with moms and babies, and improve access to maternal health care for families who are both underserved and under-represented. 
Anderson-Rice pays particular attention to the state’s infant mortality rates, thinking of the classrooms full of children lost, whose futures — perhaps as doctors, athletes, parents — will never be realized.
“Public health professionals often liken infant mortality to the canary in the coal mine- it’s an indicator on the health of the community,” she said. “This is not about politics; it’s about responsibility. If we want a healthy Missouri, we need to fix this now.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/obstetric-services.jpg,,,2026-01-02 07:12:01.988053

(Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Stricter cellphone bans, more focus on STEM and increased school “efficiency” are shaping up as some of the highest-priority education debates Indiana lawmakers will tackle during a fast 2026 legislative session that starts back up next week.
The session will be shorter than usual — ending by late February — after legislators already convened for two weeks in December on redistricting. Senate bills must be filed by Jan. 9, and House bills by Jan. 14.
Multiple education bills have already moved, and one — a cellphone crackdown proposal — was heard in the Senate education committee in early December. Caucus leaders in the Republican-dominated General Assembly won’t formally roll out their priority agendas until next week, however.
At an annual legislative conference hosted last month in Indianapolis, lawmakers and Indiana Secretary of Education Katie Jenner previewed a crowded policy landscape shaped by academic recovery concerns, declining enrollment, student disengagement and growing unease about children’s use of technology.
Cellphones in classrooms — and beyond
One of the most visible education debates of the coming session is already underway: whether Indiana should expand restrictions on student cellphone use to cover the entire school day.
Under current law — approved by lawmakers in 2024 — schools must prohibit cellphone use during instructional time unless a teacher permits it for academic purposes. Senate Bill 78 would go further, requiring public schools to ban cellphone use “from bell to bell,” including during lunch and passing periods, with limited exceptions.
‘Away for the day’: Indiana lawmakers take up bill expanding cellphone ban to entire school day

The bill already received public testimony in the Senate Education Committee in December and was authored by committee chairman Sen. Jeff Raatz, R-Richmond. Raatz said the committee is likely to vote on the measure early this month.
Supporters argue the change would reduce distractions and improve student focus and mental health. Opponents — including some parents and students — have raised concerns about safety, emergencies and local control.
Jenner signaled broader alarm about technology’s impact on children, calling for a statewide conversation that extends beyond classrooms.
“I cannot tell you how much it is impacting our children,” Jenner said. “We are seeing seven- and eight-year-old[s] with social media accounts. We are seeing nine-year-old[s] on anxiety medicine because they’re obsessed with the number of likes and the comments.”
House Education Committee Chair Rep. Bob Behning, R-Indianapolis, said lawmakers are also exploring ways to regulate social media platforms themselves, particularly the algorithms that keep children engaged.
“We’re also … looking at some language that could potentially avoid litigation, but goes after the algorithms,” Behning said. “That’s what’s getting the endorphins … that impact their cognitive ability.”
More work on literacy
Lawmakers and education officials continue to tout Indiana’s recent gains in early literacy, driven by state investments in reading instruction and intervention. But Jenner said the work is far from finished — and may prompt additional statutory changes on top of major policies passed in the last two sessions.
“We’ve seen some great success in reading, but we have a lot more work to do,” Jenner said, noting that the state saw a 5% jump in reading proficiency. Current law requires schools with fewer than 70% of students reading proficiently to participate in a state literacy cadre program, which provides targeted, evidence-based instructional support for teachers.
“What we wanted to see is … should we adjust that percentage a bit, or should we do a rolling average of some sort,” Jenner said. She emphasized that any changes should avoid creating an unfunded mandate.
One persistent challenge, she added, is middle school literacy.
“The only needle that we have not moved in Indiana is middle school reading,” Jenner said, pointing to seventh- and eighth-grade outcomes as key concerns heading into 2026.
 Doubling down on STEM
Beyond literacy, lawmakers and state officials signaled a renewed push to strengthen math and STEM instruction — an area they acknowledged is lagging behind recent reading gains. STEM is shorthand for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics.
Behning said Indiana’s success with literacy initiatives could serve as a model for future investments in math, particularly early numeracy.
“We know that if we’re going to be successful in STEM, we have to be successful in math,” Behning said. He pointed to the state’s literacy cadre as an approach lawmakers could look to replicate in math classrooms.
Behning added that many educators were never trained in “foundational, explicit skills in math,” leaving schools struggling to improve outcomes without additional state support.
Funding equity and school operations
Education funding is also expected to remain a flashpoint, particularly for districts with weak property-tax bases. Rep. Ed DeLaney, an Indianapolis Democrat who sits on the House Education Committee, warned that public schools’ share of the state budget has declined over the past decade and urged greater state investment to support high-need districts.
“If we move money to them from the state,” he said, “that may free up some local property taxes.”
Indianapolis charter schools and parents look for help busing students

But legislators are also watching closely as Indianapolis leaders advance recommendations from the Indianapolis Local Education Alliance, which calls for a new authority to manage school facilities and transportation across traditional public, charter and innovation schools.
Supporters say the plan could reduce costs and allow school boards to focus more on classroom outcomes. Critics worry about local control and whether similar models could spread statewide.
“I think we’ll be able to learn some things and probably apply them more broadly in Indiana,” Jenner said, while stressing that conversations around consolidation and shared services look very different outside Indianapolis.
Rural lawmakers and education leaders, she added, are closely watching how urban proposals could influence policy elsewhere, particularly in counties facing population decline, long bus routes and limited resources.
Jenner cautioned legislators against using enrollment alone to drive decisions, however, instead urging them to weigh student outcomes and fiscal health when considering changes.
“I would challenge the General Assembly that those are the two elements, at the very least, that we need to understand statewide,” Jenner said.
 Other priorities rolling in
Education advocacy groups are also beginning to roll out their own legislative priorities, calling on lawmakers to address school funding, staffing and student supports.
The Indiana Coalition for Public Education has called for greater state investment in K-12 schools, more equitable funding for districts with limited property-tax bases, and caution against additional mandates without funding.
Meanwhile, the Indiana School Boards Association is urging lawmakers to focus on local flexibility, shared services, school safety and workforce-related learning, while reducing regulatory burdens on districts.
The Indiana State Teachers Association, the state’s largest teachers union, has not yet released its 2026 agenda.

John James (R-Shelby Twp.).  Photos by Ken Coleman and Kyle Davidson Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s first bid for the governor’s office in 2018 against Republican stalwart Bill Schuette reached record spending, outpacing the previous high in 2006 when Dick Devos’ mega billions gave then-Gov. Jennifer Granholm a literal run for her money.
But the money already spent in the 2026 gubernatorial race shows that it could be on pace to get close to the record-breaking fundraising totals seen in 2006, which saw nearly $80 million in spending, and 2018, which exceeded $90 million.
Year-end 2025 campaign finance reports aren’t due until the end of January, which will detail spending between Oct. 1 and Dec. 31 while also wrapping up the contribution and spending totals for the previous year.
But the public campaign finance data available over two quarters of fundraising and spending, up until October, show that donors have given more than $25 million to Michigan’s gubernatorial primary candidates and the lone independent candidate, Mike Duggan, who is already playing like he’s in a general election. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
That total is expected to rise sharply as the race moves forward because the race is wide open and would include Duggan, the outgoing mayor of Detroit, who has a penchant for attracting big money due to his strength in his successive mayoral elections.
Assuming the 2025 gubernatorial spending amount is at least doubled by the end of the August primary season, and keeps pace to triple that amount by November, it would come close to the 2006 and 2018 fundraising totals. The open nature of the race with likely three viable candidates on the ballot could signal another record-breaking year.
Of note, Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, the top Democrat in the primacy race, has attracted just as many wealthy donor dollars as Duggan and her main Republican rivals, creating a scenario where those same class of high-power donors could be playing all sides in the contest.
Here’s where each of the major candidates stand as the year wraps up, with a look at who has given the most to each of their campaigns.
Jocelyn Benson (D)
Benson is arguably the frontrunner in the Democratic side of the race, and her fundraising totals show why she’s earned that position. She raised $4.75 million up until October and spent just $1.76 million, ending the third quarter with $2.98 million cash on hand.
The state’s campaign finance reporting system, which has been plagued with issues due to systemic changes made in the latter half of Benson’s tenure as secretary of state, allows users to download spreadsheet information to see total contributions to a campaign thus far in a given election cycle — as long as those records contain less than 25,000 entries.
Michigan’s Benson has familial, professional ties to company pushing data center project in Saline

Benson has amassed so many donations that her full contribution analysis report isn’t available for download on the public facing site. That said, what is available shows Benson received large political action committee donations from the Michigan Laborers Political League, the Michigan Legacy PAC, End Citizens United, the Deldin Law PAC, United Food and Commercial Workers Active Ballot Club, Emily’s List Michigan, and the Michigan Regional Council of Carpenters PAC. 
Those contributions ranged from $10,000 to $60,000, according to Michigan’s campaign finance system — which notes that the data is reliable but not guaranteed to be completely accurate.
Benson also received the maximum allowed individual contributions from Shadia Turfah, the president of PharmaScript of Michigan, philanthropist Kathy Brzoznowski, Nancy Tellem, the former president of XBox Entertainment Studios, public health advocate Debra Efroymson, Carolyn Cassin, president of Michigan Women Forward, and Lyna Lam, wife of the California tech billionaire Chris Larsen.
Also contributing the maximum individual amount is Stephen Ross, owner of Related Companies, the firm behind a controversial data center proposed in Washtenaw County. Benson’s husband is also a vice president at Related.
Garlin Gilchrist (D)
Gilchrist as the current lieutenant governor is vying to be the heir apparent to Whitmer’s administration. That’s a steep hill to climb: Michigan has a nearly 40-year history of lieutenant governors launching gubernatorial bids and falling short. 
Gilchrist calls Gaza, Palestine crisis a genocide at Arab convention, fundraising communications

The second-in-command of the Whitmer administration, however, has forged his own path in the race, being the first to make a public stance that the ongoing Israeli war in Gaza amounted to a genocide against Palestinians, and vowed to not take money from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC.
Gilchrist raised less than both Benson and Swanson, but he was still able to raise just under $1.13 million up until October, while spending $748,632 and with $378,457 on hand.
The majority of Gilchrist’s campaign contributions came from small dollar donors, but some of his top dollar donations in included max-dollar contributions from Tyrone Sanders, a government consultant with Obsidian Group, Mike Shehadi, the CEO of Pharamascript Inc., Nicole Hamp, a researcher at University of Michigan, and two political action committees — the Rooted in Community Leadership PAC, and the Collective PAC.
Chris Swanson (D)
The sheriff of Genesee County has less name recognition and top-level political experience than his opponents in Benson and Gilchrist, but he has kept up in fundraising, amassing $1.36 million up until October. He did, however, spend $975,997, leaving the campaign with $385,189 cash on hand.
His top donors include Antonio Pollicella, CEO of Team Wellness Center, Phil Hagerman, the CEO of Forum Health LLC, Ryan LaFontaine of LaFontaine Automotive, and Philp Shaltz of Shaltz Automotive, each giving him the maximum amount.
Mike Duggan (I)
The outgoing mayor of Detroit, a former Democrat, thus far has raised $4.38 million, spent more than $1.96 million and had $2.4 million cash on hand going into October.
Union battles at Detroit Medical Center may shadow Duggan’s 2026 bid for Michigan governor

Several news outlets have reported that a not insignificant chunk of his campaign cash has come from Republican donors, including former Michigan Republican Party Chair Ron Weiser, JC Huizenga, Jeff Sakwa and others.
Overall, the majority of Duggan’s contributors donated in the $5,000 (154 individual contributions) and $8,325 (141 individual contributions) categories, the latter being the maximum amount an individual can donate to a single campaign. Another 262 individual contributions came from the $500 range.
Among his top donors are the CEOs of various companies and organizations, like William Wild of the Midwest Independent Retailers Association, Marjory Epstein, the chair of Vesco Oil, Tricia Keith, the CEO of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, both the CEO and president of Belle Tire, several members of the Penske Corporation, and several members of the Detroit Pistons front office, including Eric Tellem, the team’s vice president of player personnel.
Each of those donors gave the maximum amount to Duggan’s campaign.
John James (R)
Michigan’s John James staffs up gubernatorial election team ahead of 2026 primary season

James bucked his party’s wishes to have him run for reelection in Congress, creating an open race for his seat and inserting himself in a crowded Republican gubernatorial primary. His campaign has positioned him as the frontrunner, and he has the campaign cash to justify some of that thinking despite criticism about him being absent in the race.
The congressman brought in $3.65 million and spent nearly $1.38 million, with more than $2.27 million cash on hand up until October.
Two members of the DeVos family, Pamela DeVos and Dan DeVos, are among his highest contributors, giving $5 million to Mission Michigan, an issues super PAC supporting James’ campaign. Other contributors include various executives in investment firms, technology and industrial companies. 
While the big dollars are flowing to James’ campaign, a large majority of his individual direct contributions came from small dollar donors, campaign finance records show.
Aric Nesbitt (R) 
One of Michigan’s top Republican legislators, Nesbitt, the state Senate minority leader, has amassed $2.7 million and spent $616,869, with more than $2.1 million on hand up until October. He is one of James’ chief rivals in the race and has been attacking him head on in various debates and messaging.

Some of Nesbitt’s largest donors, giving the maximum amount to his campaign, include Carol Van Andel, director of the Van Andel Foundation, and David Van Andel, chair of the Van Andel Institute, both members of the Van Andel family that co-founded Amway with members of the DeVos family.
Also giving the max amount to Nesbitt were Sidney Jansma, the president of Wolverine Gas and Oil, Mark Fazakerley, founder of Eagle Alloy and a major supporter of former GOP gubernatorial nominee Tudor Dixon, Mark Faraj, CEO of KMT Distribution, Ron Boji of the Boji Group, and Chris Yatooma, the husband of Republican secretary of state candidate Monica Yatooma.
Nesbitt also received more than $400,000 from GOPAC, a Virginia-based Republican group the Detroit News reported is funded by some of the nation’s largest companies.
Mike Cox (R) 
A former Michigan attorney general during the Granholm and Snyder years, Cox is back to try and take the GOP nomination for governor this year. Like Nesbitt, Cox is also positioning himself as a quasi-foil to James and has similarly attacked his lack of presence in the race in 2025. Cox ended the third quarter raising $4.58 million, with $757,638 spent and more than $3.78 million on hand. That includes $2 million of his own money he loaned to his campaign.

Among Cox’s top donors giving him the maximum amount are various attorneys or members of Michigan law firms. Attorneys Ben Gonek, Manvir Grewal, Todd Flood, David Shea and Michael Stines, and retired attorney Jeffrey Sheehan. 
Cox also received max-dollar campaign contributions from Greg Wier, president of Prudential Alarm, and billionaire Peter Karmanos, the owner of the Carolina Hurricanes hockey team and the former CEO of Compuware.
Marking the changing of the political times, Justin Elias, the president of Puff Cannabis, also gave Cox $8,325.
Tom Leonard (R)
Leonard, a former Michigan House speaker and the 2018 GOP nominee for attorney general, entered the race later than some of the other candidates, but he was working to catch up with his fellow primary candidates in fundraising.
He raised $937,023 thus far, spent $227,730 and has $709,293 on hand going into October.
Some of his top donors include those who gave to other campaigns, like Weiser, Yatooma, Boji and Faraj, but also Matthew Moroun, the son of former billionaire businessman Matty Moroun, attorney Jeffrey Ishbia, and James Husanger, the chief risk officer of MSU Federal Credit Union. Each of them gave the maximum amount to Leonard’s campaign.
Ralph Rebandt (R)
A former pastor, Rebandt ran for governor in 2022 and made the ballot after scandal plagued the gubernatorial field that year, as half of the candidates in the crowded field were booted from the ballot due to fraudulent signatures on their nominating petitions. Rebandt ultimately lost that race to Dixon.
Undeterred, Rebandt is back but with sharper focus after running once before. He raised $926,800, spent $46,344 and had $880,455 cash on hand up until October.
Only three individuals gave Rebandt the maximum amount allowed, including Lael Bryant of Ask Services, and Randy Simmons, owner of Simmons Insurance. A large chunk of his campaign cash came from a personal loan, giving himself $799,627 of his total haul thus far.

Then came cost overruns, construction problems, and one of the biggest municipal bond defaults in Wall Street history in 1983.
Only one of the five proposed reactors of the Washington Public Power Supply System — or WPPSS, commonly pronounced “Whoops” — was finished at Richland. In 1998, WPPSS became Energy Northwest largely to erase the stigma, and completed the 1,150-megawatt reactor that became the Columbia Generating Station.
Fast forward to today.
Again, Washington is trying to become a hub for nuclear power. But instead of monster-size reactors, the state is now home to multiple ventures involving smaller reactors — all using technologies unheard of in the 1970s and 1980s.
Construction at the Satsop Nuclear Power Plant took place in the late 1970s and early 1980s, as seen here. But the Washington Public Power Supply System project was never completed.

Fusion and small modular reactors are the emerging sources of nuclear power, although both are still fledgling technologies. Policymakers are looking at both. So, too, are some of the nation’s largest tech corporations, eager to find power for electricity-hungry data centers.
One of the first commercially viable fusion reactors in the U.S. is under construction roughly 6 miles southeast of Wenatchee. It’s expected to be working by 2028, with power going to Microsoft. Fusion reactors are attractive in part because they don’t produce highly radioactive waste.
Efforts are also underway to develop a different type of fusion reactor in Everett and Richland. These would be small portable units. 
And there are plans for what could be the nation’s second small modular reactor complex at Richland. Amazon is playing a part in that potential undertaking. Small modular reactors are essentially prefabricated mini-versions of traditional fission reactors. They are supposedly faster and cheaper to build than traditional reactors.
In the works
Founded in 2013 in Redmond, Helion Energy moved its main lab to Everett and recently began construction in July on a reactor site in the small Chelan County town of Malaga.
“This is a first-of-its-kind generator,” said Helion co-founder Anthony Pancotti.
The Malaga complex will house a 50-megawatt fusion reactor called Orion. The plan is for the reactor to deliver power to Microsoft under a contract between the two companies. 
Helion’s long-term plan is to eventually produce more of these reactors to be distributed worldwide, Pancotti said. Helion has roughly 450 employees at Everett and Malaga.
Small portable fusion reactors — about the size of a wine barrel and capable of generating 100 kilowatts — could become a reality in southern Seattle and Richland in a few years.
“What we are going for is mobile power,” said Brian Riordan, cofounder of Avalanche Energy, a company based in the Seattle area that is developing space and underwater fusion reactors.
Initial customers would likely buy the mini-reactors for military satellites and unmanned underwater vehicles. Riordan hopes to sell Avalanche’s first 100-kilowatt reactor before 2030.
The company plans to branch out into other uses, for portable power generators, with Riordan noting that the fusion device needs to produce electricity cheaper than what is created by wind and solar power options. 
Avalanche’s headquarters and research facilities are near Boeing Field. The company recently leased a Port of Benton facility in northern Richland for an operation called FusionWERX.
“FusionWERX is going to be the fusion industry’s equivalent of a commercial wind tunnel — an open-access facility where new ideas, technologies, and components can be tested and validated,” Avalanche’s CEO, Robin Langtry, said in a statement.
Avalanche has roughly 70 employees split between Seattle and Richland.
Another company, X-energy, signed agreements last year with Amazon and Energy Northwest for the retail giant to invest $334 million to study putting four modular reactors on the site of the half-built WPPSS Reactor No. 1, which is next to the Columbia Generating Station.
This piece of federal land gives the project the advantage of existing infrastructure, including roads and utilities from the 1980s.
Amazon’s interest is prompted by its plans to build data centers.
The four-reactor proposal — dubbed the “Cascade Advanced Energy Facility” — would produce 320 megawatts, with the possibility of adding more reactors to reach 960 megawatts.

Energy Northwest has been doing environmental, safety and legal reviews on the proposal. Construction is tentatively set to begin at the end of this decade.
Amazon has tentative plans to work with X-energy to build small modular reactors across the nation by 2039 that would collectively produce 5,000 megawatts of power.
‘The world’s leading hub for fusion’
The concept of fusion has been around for roughly a century. Right now, around 40 fusion development projects using different technologies exist worldwide, while no commercially viable fusion reactors are currently producing electricity.
A huge hurdle is that the amount of electricity needed to create a fusion reaction is greater than the power that would be produced. In 2022, the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California used lasers to produce surplus electricity.
Shortly afterward, Helion Energy achieved that same goal with a setup that slams two atoms together.
Practical fusion is so new that the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission — which routinely takes years to approve new designs for fission reactors — currently does not regulate fusion devices.
Consequently, Helion and Avalanche do not need the commission’s approval for their devices. Instead, they obtain permits from the state and their host counties.
That will likely change soon. Last July, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission sent a report to Congress on how it should license fusion devices.
On Oct. 31, U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell and U.S. Rep. Suzan DelBene, both Washington Democrats, along with other congressional members of both parties, announced the introduction of a bill to provide tax credits for fusion-related ventures. 
“The state of Washington is the world’s leading hub for fusion energy, which one day could provide vast amounts of the type of power we need to keep electricity prices down and increase America’s economic competitiveness,” Cantwell said in a press release.
Then, in November, the U.S. Department of Energy created an Office of Fusion as the Trump administration moved away from renewable energy, such as wind and solar power, in order to shift money to nuclear and fossil fuel development.
Fusion leaders met with the Energy Department on Dec. 9 to lobby for federal support for fusion.
“Now is the time for the U.S. to make a significant investment, and that means over a billion dollars per year in annual appropriations and a one-time infrastructure investment,” Andrew Holland, CEO of the Fusion Industry Association, said at the time, according to Reuters.
Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, a huge federal lab in northern Richland, is beginning two fusion-related materials projects. Materials are critical as, during operation, components of fusion reactors can reach temperatures hotter than the sun.
The Tri-Cities area has deep roots and a strong workforce in the nuclear sector, tracing back to the Manhattan Project in 1943.
Consequently, this region has great interest in new types of reactors, the fusion industry, and clean energy projects, said David Reeploeg, head of federal relations for the Tri-City Development Council, and Sean O’Brien, executive director of the council’s clean energy spinoff called the Energy Forward Alliance.
The Tri-Cities, which include Kennewick, Pasco, and Richland, are also looking at attracting data centers with local nuclear power and having a long-time nuclear fuel assembly plant expand the types of fuel it can offer, Reeploeg and O’Brien said.
“The key focus for us is keeping our workforce employed,” O’ Brien said.
Modular designs
Small modular reactors are like prefabricated houses. There are locked-in designs and pre-built components, which are then taken to a site and assembled. Small modular reactors are designed so extra modules can be added as needed. This concept is supposed to lead to lower costs, faster construction and more flexibility.
Each modular unit would be a mini-reactor capable of generating 50 to 300 megawatts of energy. 
Some U.S. and world leaders are pushing this new nuclear reactor as a carbon-emissions-free power technology to combat climate change.
NuScale Power, based in Corvallis, Oregon, is the only U.S. venture so far to receive Nuclear Regulatory Commission approval for its small modular reactor design. 
The company obtained a contract to build a modular reactor complex at Idaho Falls for Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems, which is part of the Utah state government and provides electricity to four states.
However, many of that project’s prospective customers dropped out, and the project was canceled in 2023.
A 2022 Stanford University study raised questions about contamination from used nuclear fuel from small modular reactors. It looked at NuScale’s designs, as well as designs from two other companies submitted to the federal government. Not among them was X-energy’s, the company involved in the project with Energy Northwest and Amazon. The study picked NuScale’s design because it was the furthest along in the federal review process.

The Stanford study concluded that NuScale’s design and the two others would produce greater volumes of radioactive waste than conventional reactors, and that the used reactor fuel would be roughly 50% more radioactive. 
NuScale contested those conclusions, saying the Stanford study looked at outdated designs.
State legislation teed up
Two Republican Washington state legislators — with high-ranking Democratic cosponsors — have introduced similar 2026 nuclear fission power reactor bills in the Senate and House.
The bills, which do not mention fusion power, call for developing a nuclear power development master plan for Washington state by Dec. 15, 2026. Introduced by Sen. John Braun, R-Centralia and Rep. Stephanie Barnard, R-Pasco, the legislation points to signs that Washington’s push for alternative power sources might not meet the state’s needs.
Washington is a net exporter of electricity, but the state government predicts it will be a net importer of power by 2050. Meanwhile, Montana and Wyoming were expected to send wind and solar power to Washington in the next few decades. But the legislation says that those power sources now look less promising.
The proposed report would address future fission power reactor goals, plus what various governments and utilities should do. It would also look at financing, siting, consulting with tribes, workforce requirements, and regulatory needs.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/helion-malaga-project-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-02 07:12:01.988053

A statewide group tasked with reviewing domestic violence homicides and other related deaths will begin to look at missed opportunities to offer resources and intervention to change future outcomes. 
With a better picture of what help victims and perpetrators had access to before a death, Mississippi’s Domestic Violence Fatality Review Team puts the state in a position to make systemic changes around its response to domestic violence, said team member Stacey Riley. 
“This will help us as a state and give the movement to find what the changes are and how to make them happen,” said Riley, CEO of the Gulf Coast Center for Nonviolence. “It’s not just about ‘We have to make it better.’”
She is among those appointed to the committee established during the legislative session under the Department of Public Safety. Its 13 members include domestic violence service providers, advocates, law enforcement and prosecutors. 
Oxford Police Chief Jeff McCutchen, another committee member, said the group can help learn how to prevent domestic violence deaths and other related crimes. 
“How do we keep this from being a problem that repeats?” he asked. 
Choosing what cases to review will be up to the committee, and the group has a number of domestic violence deaths to choose from. 
Between 2020 and 2024, Mississippi Today reviewed local news stories, police reports, court records and other public information and found that at least 300 people died in domestic violence incidents. This number includes victims, abusers, children, law enforcement and others. 
At least 70 domestic violence incidents occurred across the state in 2025, resulting in at least 44 deaths and 48 injured, according to the Gun Violence Archive. That number is likely higher when other forms of domestic violence, such as beatings, strangulation and stabbings, are factored in and law enforcement investigations indicate that a case is domestic violence related. 
The work of the Domestic Violence Fatality Review Team is years in the making. 
In 2024, the Mississippi Coalition Against Domestic Violence supported a bill to establish the committee, but it did not make it out of committee. 
The next year, the coalition, along with advocates and some who lost family members to domestic violence, spoke in support of a pair of bills to establish the review committee. One version, Senate Bill 2886, became law in July. 
Tara Gandy, who lost her daughter Joslin Napier in 2022, held a framed photo of her as Gov. Tate Reeves signed the bill into law. 
“(The review team) will allow for my daughter and those who have already lost their lives to domestic violence … to no longer be just a number,” Gandy said after the bill signing. “They will be a number with a purpose.” 
Public Safety Commissioner Sean Tindell selected four initial members before the law went into effect in July, said Bailey Martin Holloway, a spokesperson for the department. From there, the members elected a chair and vice chair and additional team members. 
The committee is expected to meet quarterly, Holloway said. The group’s first tasks will be to set up administrative procedures and processes, which can include how the committee will receive cases and how to obtain court, medical and other records to review. 
Riley hopes the National Domestic Violence Fatality Review Initiative can train the committee about methods, procedures and policies to review domestic violence cases. 
Members of the review team are:

Allen McDaniel, Tindell’s chief of staff, committee chair. 
Luis Montgomery, public policy and justice strategist for the Mississippi Coalition Against Domestic Violence, committee vice chair. He lobbied for the bill that established the committee.
Anna Brumfield, special assistant attorney general. She trains law enforcement officers about domestic abuse protection orders and how to use the AG’s Domestic Violence Reporting System and Protection Order Registry.
Kassie Coleman, district attorney for Clarke, Kemper, Lauderdale and Wayne counties. She has prosecuted crimes against women and children and was appointed as a member of the Commission for the Study of Domestic Abuse Proceedings.
Debra Mitchell, a medical social worker.
Stacey Riley, CEO of the Gulf Coast Center for Nonviolence. 
Tiffany Crawford, sexual assault prevention and response program manager for the Mississippi National Guard.
Lanisha Bell, project director for the Tribal Financial Management Center with the Justice Department’s Office for Victims of Crime. 
Michael Harper, Leake County deputy coroner. 
Shella Cage-Head, community advocate.
Jeff McCutchen, Oxford police chief. His department established a victim’s service unit in 2021 to focus on crimes against people, including domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking and harassment.
Sholatta Sharp, special projects coordinator for the Mississippi Coalition Against Sexual Assault. She is a certified sexual assault nurse examiner and trains others to work as examiners.

(Paul Hammel/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN – Beginning in 2013, Oklahoma attorney and college instructor John Maisch made dozens of 700-mile trips over four years to visit the alcohol-soaked village of Whiteclay, Nebraska.
Maisch, who grew up in Grand Island, had earned a reputation as a tough prosecutor of liquor violations in Oklahoma.
When he stumbled almost accidently onto the story of Whiteclay – an unincorporated village on the South Dakota border where beer stores sold more than 3 million cans a year to the adjacent and officially dry Pine Ridge Indian Reservation – he knew he had to do something.
The more he learned, the more he became outraged.
Fact finder
His trips became fact-finding missions, building a case against what he saw as violations of liquor laws. Without any background in movie making, Maisch produced a documentary on the “wounds” caused by Whiteclay – an epidemic of alcoholism, fetal alcohol syndrome and alcohol-related assaults on the reservation, where alcohol possession and sales were outlawed.


How to find the book
The book, “Whiteclay: An American Tragedy,” is expected to be available in book stores in January. Meanwhile, copies can be ordered via the website, johnmaisch.com.


Maisch’s crusade, which culminated in the closing of the Whiteclay beer stores in 2017, is now detailed in a book, “Whiteclay: An American Tragedy,” written by Maisch before his death in 2022.
Maisch’s widow, Julia, took up the task of getting the book published, because she knew her husband wanted people to know about the long-ignored injustice delivered by the beer sales in Whiteclay, especially to the babies born on the reservation with lifelong disabilities due to drinking by their mothers.
“When you have an opportunity to speak up, to help the voiceless, the children who can’t rely on adults to care for them, it’s our responsibility to do something about it,” Julia Maisch told the Nebraska Examiner.
The closings were an historic accomplishment, one that few thought would happen.

The 186-page book details the ups and downs of the campaign to close the beer stores, from fiery exchanges with liquor regulators and cordial meetings with then-Gov. Pete Ricketts and his wife, Susanne, to a disappointing lack of action by Sheridan County officials.
Alcohol had flowed from Whiteclay to the reservation for decades, but the remote village was far from the media spotlight, and in the northwest corner of Nebraska, it had become accepted that in Whiteclay you’d find drunken men and women, urinating, defecating and passing out on the highway through town.
In the book, he wondered if attitudes would change, given the large haul of taxes paid by the beer stores.

Focus on the law
But Maisch knew that legally, alcohol could not be sold in places where there was inadequate law enforcement, and Whiteclay had no local police and the county sheriff’s office was 23 miles away. He eventually began researching the economic cost to Sheridan County and the state of jailing vagrants and those who committed assaults in Whiteclay and treating the children scarred by fetal alcohol syndrome.
His documentary, “Sober Indian/Dangerous Indian,” introduced many to the lives of four men who lived, panhandled and drank on the streets of Whiteclay. The book provided more detail about their struggles with alcoholism and flirts with sobriety, and of the toll it took on their families.
Along with Native American activist Frank LaMere – a longtime advocate to close the beer stores – Maisch criss-crossed the state and nation, screening the documentary and exposing the misery of Whiteclay. It led to testimony at legislative hearings and those of the Nebraska Liquor Control Commission, and the appointment of task forces. Like an investigator, he dug up data and personal stories of those damaged by the flood of beer coming from a village of less than 20 residents.

“Although most public officials I encountered may disagree, my objective was always to engage – not enrage – those who were involved in the Whiteclay issue,” Maisch wrote. “But more times than not, I found myself getting into verbal spats with elected and appointed officials because, in my opinion, they lacked the moral courage to do what their oaths required them to do.”
The misery of Whiteclay hit the national radar in 1999, when two Native American men who frequented the beer-soaked village were found dead a few yards from the beer stores.
LaMere, a member of the Winnebago tribe who lived across Nebraska from Whiteclay, began calls for change at the village. Nebraskans for Peace, as well as activists from the American Indian Movement took up the call, organizing protest walks and seeking legislative changes. A documentary, “The Battle for Whiteclay,” detailed the sordid history of alcohol sales from the village.
But bills in the Nebraska Legislature died in legislative committees, and attention to Whiteclay often fell from the radar, to be reignited, sporadically, by a protest march or discovery of a death on the streets.
Concerned citizens gather
Maisch began assembling a group of other concerned citizens, like Dennis Carlson, a retired attorney who investigated cases of legal malpractice for the Nebraska Supreme Court, and Alan Jacobson, a Lincoln business owner appalled by what he saw in Whiteclay.
This sign, on the fence of a closed Whiteclay business, is a remnant of the village’s notorious past when street people drank openly on the streets and four stores sold up to 3.5 million cans of beer a year. (Paul Hammel/Nebraska Examiner)
There also were people involved in the fight against fetal alcohol syndrome, caused when a pregnant woman consumed alcohol. A key ally was Nora Boesem, a former pediatric nurse from Newell, South Dakota, whose family had become foster parents for dozens of kids from the reservation who suffered from fetal alcohol-related impacts.
Through Maisch, reporters learned about, and published stories about, one of Boesem’s foster children, Arianna, who was born prematurely, with damage to almost every internal organ due to fetal alcohol syndrome. She required several taxpayer-funded surgeries, daily pain medications and required almost constant care.
Lasting impacts
The book includes other heart-wrenching stories about those scarred by alcohol-fueled domestic abuse, women sexually assaulted and left on Whiteclay streets, and men seeking sobriety and later relapsing to the beer stores.
More than once in the book, Maisch expresses surprise at how forthcoming those impacted by Whiteclay’s alcohol were about the sordid impact on their lives.
“As a Christian, I was convinced that God was with us every step of the way as we battled to close Whiteclay’s beer stores,” he said.
In the end, Maisch saw signs of hope in Whiteclay. Ambulance and law enforcement calls fell, and the village was no longer a contributor to the woes of the reservation, and new programs involving children and providing a “maker’s space” for Native artists and crafters were established.
“Nothing changes if we protect our own comfort at the expense of others’ pain,” he wrote. “Nothing changes when we refuse to be unsettled, But when we are willing to feel that discomfort and step across the line and stay with it, something begins to shift.”
“That is where the healing begins. That is where justice takes root.”

More about the author
John Maisch’s activism on a social issue – the misery caused by alcohol sales from a Nebraska village to an officially dry South Dakota reservation – spawned an effort at Central Oklahoma University, where Maisch was an associate professor of business law.
The “John Maisch Collective for the Greater Good,” launched in 2022, is an effort to engage students and faculty on social issues and foster collaboration to address them.
“The intent was to be able to take on more complex issues,” said Sunshine Cowan, the center’s director.
“Dr. John Maisch was a part of those early discussions, and his work with communities was well known and respected,” Cowan said. “He deeply engaged with the community in a way that The Collective and our campus want to honor and emulate.”
The main goal of The Collective, she said, is to “build a collaborative network that works together on meaningful community work,” involving faculty, staff and students.
One outgrowth of that is an annual college scholarship, the “Dr. John A. Maisch Social Impact Scholarship,” which recognizes students who engage with their communities “in meaningful ways,” Cowan said.
The Collaborative will hold a spring workshop with an author experienced in community building and holds “coffee connection” times each month where individuals can drop in for casual conversation.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — The Oklahoma Attorney General’s Office has received over 220 complaints of open records violations this year, with the numbers increasing since a public complaint form launched, officials said. 
Anthony Sykes, the assistant attorney general in the Public Access Counselor unit, said between January and July, 128 complaints were received, or about 18 per month. After the complaint form launched in August after House Bill 2163 became law in May, that number has grown to be about 25 per month.
The law gave the Attorney General’s Office the power to enforce violations of the Open Records Act and outlined a review process for denied public records requests through a complaint form monitored by the Public Access Counselor Unit. The agency can seek “legal enforcement” when government entities fail to comply with open records laws.

Editor’s note: This story is part of Oklahoma Voice’s end-of-year series that provides updates to some stories that captured the interest of Oklahomans in 2025.

Filing a complaint for review is prohibited if the person requesting to inspect a public record is doing so for “commercial purposes.” 
About 42% of the complaints to the form were against a state agency, state records show. A third pertained to a city while nearly a quarter of complaints were about a county. Records show 2% of complaints were about a school board.
Records from the Attorney General’s Office show that 70 of the complaints to the portal have been closed. Over 30 of these were deemed “unfounded” complaints while decisions were issued in nine were issued a decision. Records showed another 12 were resolved by the parties involved and 10 considered were “not timely.” Some complaints were also closed because they were either withdrawn or for commercial purposes. 
Two-thirds of complaint filers were members of the public, 26% were members of the media and the rest were either commercial complaints or classified as “attorney discovery,” according to data provided by the Attorney General’s Office. 
Of the remaining 18 open complaints, 10 have a decision being drafted, three are awaiting a response from an agency and five were incomplete, records showed. 
Sykes is the only full-time employee assigned to this unit but he said the agency is working to onboard another employee for administrative support. 
“The complaint form has been a great improvement as it details the circumstances and explains that the complaint must be accompanied by the request for records and any response by the public body,” Sykes said in a statement. “This allows the complaint process to begin with a more complete picture.”
The agency evaluates a complaint to determine whether further action is needed within seven business days, Sykes said. The time needed to resolve complaints varies “substantially,” he said, but all complaints are resolved 60 days after the public body has responded. 
“It’s also worth noting that many of these complaints involve multiple violations or issues, so the total number of concerns we’re addressing is even higher than these figures suggest,” he said.
The Attorney General’s Office issues a decision, or “formal advisement,” on a complaint to the public body in question, Sykes said. 
Some decisions issued have included complaints against the Attorney General’s Office, the Oklahoma Department of Health, the City of Coweta, the Oklahoma Department of Public Safety, the City of Oklahoma City, and the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. 
The complaints were made by journalists, private citizens and attorneys.
In all of the provided examples, Sykes wrote that the public body either had had a “reasonable” response to the complainant, was justified in denying public records, or had “a good faith legal basis to deny access to the information and records referenced in the Complaint.”

,WyoFile,2026-01-02 11:25:00+00:00,WyoFile,Wyoming officials leaned into Trump’s immigration agenda in 2025,Andrew Graham,,,,,https://wyofile.com/wyoming-officials-leaned-into-trumps-immigration-agenda-in-2025/,"

As the Trump administration dramatically increased deportations across the country, both federal and state officials have made sure the state contributed to the effort, making it largely hostile territory for undocumented immigrants. 
The post Wyoming officials leaned into Trump’s immigration agenda in 2025 appeared first on WyoFile .","At times during the first year of Donald Trump’s second presidency, it seemed Wyoming would be left out of the upheaval of his administration’s aggressive crackdown on undocumented immigrants.
Though exact numbers are unknown, the state has a low population of such folks.  A 2023 estimate by the American Immigration Council put the number of undocumented immigrants in Wyoming — a challenging statistic to document — at around 9,800, largely of working-age adults. 
Wyoming also lacks a major city with liberal-leaning politics — the type of places where the Trump administration performed some of its most headline-grabbing enforcement actions, like the president’s use of military and national guard troops in Los Angeles or the intensive activities of federal agents in Chicago. 
But by summer, as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents conducted operations in Teton County and other parts of the state, it had become clear Wyoming was not isolated from the Trump administration’s efforts to dramatically increase deportations. Wyoming’s undocumented population also encountered more hostile policies at the state and local level than it did a year ago, driven by state legislators, Gov. Mark Gordon and some county sheriffs. 



The year began with conservative lawmakers in Cheyenne seeking to thrust the state into immigration enforcement, long the purview of the federal government. Lawmakers passed several bills to that end. One new law bans sanctuary cities (though Wyoming has none, technically). Another invalidates driver’s licenses that some other states issue to undocumented immigrants.
The Wyoming Senate rejected one of the more extreme measures, a bill from Torrington Republican Cheri Steinmetz that, as originally written, would have forced state law enforcement officers to question people about their immigration status during routine police work. Other parts of the bill made it a crime to carry an undocumented person in your car — something opponents said would criminalize large swathes of U.S. citizens, including friends and family members of immigrants. 
Senators, worried about unforeseen consequences, tossed the bill in February, about halfway through the 2025 legislative session. 
But over the next nine months, officials governing large swathes of Wyoming upped their involvement with immigration enforcement. Gov. Gordon directed the Wyoming Highway Patrol and the state’s National Guard to ink agreements with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to play varying roles in immigration enforcement. Six county sheriffs signed on as well.
The most significant example is likely Sheriff Brian Kozak of Laramie County, who in October announced that he and 25 of his deputies had all joined a federal program where they received training on checking immigration status and detaining people on behalf of ICE. Though Kozak promised deputies would detain people only following interdictions on suspicion of other law breaking, his strong alliance with ICE sparked fears among local immigrant advocates that deputies would engage in racial profiling.
At the start of 2025, Laramie County Sheriff Brian Kozak put a blinking vacancy sign, in the style of a roadside motel, over the door to his jail. He wanted to show the facility had space and was open for business, including for federal immigration detainees. (Andrew Graham/WyoFile)
Kozak’s disclosure in late November that his deputies had detained an estimated 30 people for ICE, largely following traffic stops, fueled advocates’ criticism. 
But Kozak’s partnership with ICE is popular with Wyoming conservatives. That same week, the Wyoming Freedom Caucus cheered a special operation by Kozak’s department, ICE and the Wyoming Highway Patrol that led to the detention of 40 truck drivers. “Countries have borders. Wyoming is proud to help enforce ours,” the caucus wrote on Facebook. 
The post’s unnamed author drew a connection between this year’s new law to outlaw driver’s licenses that other states issue to undocumented immigrants — a priority of the Freedom Caucus — and the enforcement operation. It’s unclear whether any of the truckers arrested during the three-day November campaign were driving with such a license. 
In the upcoming legislative session, lawmakers are likely to push for more restrictions on people living in and traveling through the state without legal U.S. residency. Already, the Legislature’s Joint Transportation, Highways and Military Affairs Committee has advanced a bill draft to mirror in Wyoming statute a federal crackdown on the English proficiency of commercial drivers.

Wyoming sheriffs, like Trump and officials in his administration, have pitched the enhanced enforcement as targeting people not only here illegally, but who also have a criminal record, a group they have referred to as “the worst of the worst.” ICE’s arrest data, however, shows that the majority of people being placed in immigration detention by federal agents do not have criminal convictions. That trend holds true for arrest numbers from Wyoming and Colorado, which WyoFile analyzed in collaboration with the Colorado Sun in July. 
Over the course of the year, WyoFile spoke to undocumented immigrants who work in the state’s energy industry, its construction industry and in health care. Those workers described stalled asylum cases and logistical and financial hurdles barring access to legal status, despite paying taxes and participating in Wyoming’s economy for years. And as the Trump administration ramped up its deportation dragnet, they also described living in increasing fear. 
An exact accounting of who has been arrested and deported from the state is difficult to come by. But WyoFile and reporters at other outlets we collaborated with tracked some people into ICE’s detention system. They included a Mexican laborer who was a 25-year resident of Jackson Hole, a Romanian national with a misdemeanor DUI, a Nicaraguan barber in Cheyenne and a Cuban immigrant who was detained at a regular check-in with ICE in Miami. 
The Cuban man, who was attempting to renew his work permit when detained, came to Wyoming through the Natrona County Sheriff’s agreement with ICE to hold people when the federal agency needs more bed space for people it’s holding in the region. He described his 40-day stay in a Casper jail cell, far from home and uncertain at the time what his fate may be, as “hell” that wore on his psyche. Other men placed in the jail with him on July 18 remained there at least through the end of November. 
When U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detained Cuban immigrant Josue Rodriguez Perez at a check in appointment in July, it began a months-long saga of imprisonment that led him to detention centers around the United States, including the Natrona County jail. In September, he was deported to Mexico, a country where he does not have ties. (courtesy photo/Josue Rodriguez/illustration by Tennessee Watson/WyoFile)
The Cuban immigrant, Josue Rodriguez, was then deported to Mexico, a country to which he had no ties. 
Rodriguez’s saga showed how ICE agreements entangle local agencies in the Trump administration’s crackdown well beyond Wyoming’s borders. 
In Uinta County, Sheriff Andy Kopp has offered his jail beds to ICE as a lucrative revenue source. He is using the money to raise his deputies’ salaries in tough fiscal times driven, in part, by the Wyoming Legislature’s cuts to property taxes.
This fall, that arrangement briefly drew Kopp’s appearance in federal court, although in a nominal and procedural capacity, after one Mexican national captured by ICE during a sprawling operation in Idaho sued for his freedom. Though Kopp, like other sheriffs and elected officials at the state and national level, has said they want to remove dangerous criminals from the country, the Idaho man doesn’t fit that bill. He appears to have no criminal record and is the father of five children who are U.S. citizens, who were left without his support during his detention.

(Jordan Hansen / Daily Montanan) It’s almost impossible to fathom the extent of the fall of democracy in our nation in one year — but 2025 indeed saw an assault on our freedoms across the board from the most authoritarian president and administration in recent history.  Unfortunately, those same tendencies have trickled down through various state governments as well — and Montana is no exception.
But take heart, fellow citizens, while we were numbed by the shock and awe attack on our institutions, laws, policies, and liberties, there are significant signs that the people and the courts are realizing we must fight back and demand adherence to the law, the Constitution, and the tenets of humane treatment for our people and the environment.
In that regard, the new year opens with a tremendous court victory here in Montana that found the Department of Environmental Quality illegally approved a Big Sky area subdivision. The state’s approval of septic systems for eight lots in the Quarry 1 subdivision was challenged by Upper Missouri Waterkeeper, which contended the agency failed to fully analyze the likely impacts to the already impaired Gallatin River.
The ruling, which granted Waterkeeper summary judgment on their claims, found the state’s water quality regulatory agency “was arbitrary, capricious and unlawful and in violation of the Montana Constitution, MEPA [Montana Environmental Policy Act] and the WQA [Water Quality Act].”
The significance of the Court’s decision cannot be understated, since coming right behind Quarry 1 is another major subdivision, Quarry 2 — which will face many of the same problems. Namely, too close to the river, sitting on top of porous river gravels, and a very active downgradient layer of groundwater that ultimately carries pollutants and nutrients directly to the Gallatin River.
The “development at any cost” policies of Montana’s current administration are indeed coming with costs — and those costs affect us all in the loss of our clean and healthy environment, our incredible fisheries and wildlife legacy, and the destruction of our natural landscapes. As the impacts stack up, so do the court challenges — from gravel pits to subdivisions to mines as Montanans say “enough is enough.”
On the national scene, we are likewise seeing a rising and determined resistance to the destructive and divisive policies of the current administration. Once again, the challenges are arising across the nation as Americans realize the freedoms, liberties, and norms of governance we once took for granted must now be actively, fiercely, and continually defended.
The Supreme Court recently ruled the administration cannot send the National Guard into Chicago because the president lacks the legal authority to do so. Likewise, the administration’s policies are being challenged on a host of issues from the brutal and racist immigration raids to the lawless slaughter of those merely suspected of transporting drugs to undeclared wars and bombing sovereign nations without Congressional approval.
Despite the constant barrage of self-aggrandizing proclamations from the president, he is not everyone’s “favorite president.” Across the board, polls show more than six in 10 Americans do not approve of him, his administration, or his illegal policies and actions.
Make no mistake, 2026 is the year we must stand together and stand up to defy the intimidation of the press, attacks on free speech, and disregard for the law and Constitution.
Renowned actor George Clooney just rendered some sage advice to those who capitulated to Trump’s threats saying: “If CBS and ABC had challenged those lawsuits and said, ‘Go f— yourself,’ we wouldn’t be where we are in the country. That’s simply the truth.” Indeed, it is — enough is enough.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DSC_0079-1024x678.jpg,,,2026-01-02 06:56:39.487004

Brandon Kingdollar: “I had the exciting opportunity to watch a crucial labor fight up close in 2025 as North Carolina Amazon warehouse workers sought to unionize against one of the largest corporations in the world. After seeing them lose their first election by a three-to-one margin, I used public records requests to peel back the curtain on allegations of union-busting and retaliation leveled by the union campaign.”
After losing their bid to unionize the Amazon warehouse in Garner by a three-to-one margin in February, labor organizers with Carolina Amazonians United for Solidarity and Empowerment are challenging the election results, arguing Amazon coerced employees into voting against the union campaign.
In a filing with the National Labor Relations Board on Feb. 24, CAUSE alleges that Amazon misled workers into believing that they would lose existing benefits and wages if they voted in favor of the union, brought in a speaker who said the union would deport workers, and targeted pro-union workers for discipline throughout the election period.
“The Employer engaged in improper surveillance of employees, created the impression of surveillance, and interrogated employees regarding their Union support and Union activity,” the CAUSE objection reads. “The Employer selectively enforced workplace rules regarding performance standards and appearance, targeting known Union supporters for discipline and enforcement while ignoring similar violations by workers who were not known Union supporters.”
Though more than 30% of workers comprising the bargaining unit signed union cards in 2024 — representing the support of more than 1,000 warehouse associates — fewer ultimately voted in favor of the union, with just 829 voting in favor and 2,447 voting against, according to the NLRB. That left the union campaign far short of the majority vote necessary to win the right to bargain on behalf of the warehouse staff.
In response to the objection filing, Eileen Hards, a spokesperson for Amazon, declined to comment on general allegations of coercion, surveillance, and selective discipline, but expressed satisfaction with the result of the election.
“Our team in Garner overwhelmingly chose to keep a direct relationship with Amazon,” Hards wrote in an emailed statement. “We look forward to continuing to make RDU1 a great place to work together, and to supporting our teammates as they build their futures with us.”
In March, the NLRB placed the union campaign’s challenge on hold while complaints around the company’s conduct during the election period are vetted. Meanwhile, labor activists are gearing up for renewed efforts at Garner’s RDU1 warehouse as well as additional facilities throughout the Carolinas.
‘We desperately need the protection of the NLRB’
Since 2022, CAUSE has brought more than a dozen unfair labor practice complaints against Amazon, largely focusing on employee terminations, discipline of union organizers, and a general climate of surveillance.
The first of these complaints, coming in June 2022, soon after the union campaign’s formation, cited warehouse rules forbidding discussion of wages, hours, and other working conditions as an illegal prohibition on union activity. It also pointed to the end of site-specific COVID-19 updates, restrictions on the company’s internal discussion board, and the removal of a “web clock punch” feature on the employee app as impediments to protected labor activities.

The most extensive labor litigation pursued by the union surrounded disciplinary action against its co-founder, Rev. Ryan Brown, who alleged in 2022 that his complaints about warehouse conditions and racial discrimination were met with retaliation from supervisors, including a “final written warning.”
In a May 2024 response to the complaint, Amazon conceded that it issued the warning but denied that “such discipline was issued for any unlawful purpose” and was instead purely due to violation of company policy.
Arguing that the complaint should be dismissed, attorneys for Amazon went further than the facts of the individual case: they claimed the NLRB’s adjudicative procedures themselves are inherently unconstitutional, as board administrators are “improperly insulated from the President’s removal power.”
“The Complaint should be dismissed because the agency procedures through which the Complaint will be resolved violate Article II of the United States Constitution,” attorneys for Amazon wrote. “The National Labor Relations Board’s concurrent exercise of legislative, executive, and judicial power in this proceeding violates the separation of powers established by the United States Constitution and the guarantee of due process found in the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.”
Though Amazon was ordered in September 2024 — nearly two years after the initial complaint — to produce documents relating to policy complaints and allegations of discrimination that Brown and other employees voiced, the union withdrew its complaint the following month, due to the time and expense of the lengthy appeals process.
CAUSE has alleged that several employees have lost their jobs as a result of union organizing leading up to and during the election period, including Brown and Duke professor Orin Starn. Those terminations have continued in the wake of the election, organizers say, including that of Diedre King in March. According to CAUSE, she worked at the Garner warehouse for four years with an unblemished disciplinary record and was an “active, dedicated, and visible” member of the union organizing committee before she was accused of slapping a coworker during the election period, a claim she denies.
King said in the wake of her termination, she has received “amazing” support from other members of CAUSE. Organizers set up a fundraiser that has raised more than $5,500 for her as of Friday, and she said she also received a flood of calls offering support, even from colleagues she did not know before. “They call, they check up on me and see what I’m doing, get me out, get me involved in stuff — and not want me to sit at home and, like, be really depressed.”
Starn, the Duke professor, pointed to King’s termination and that of another employee afterwards as evidence of a “mass purge” targeting union organizers. A worker on the warehouse’s loading dock and an active organizer with the union, Starn was let go in December 2023 after a social media post in which he toasted the union effort with a sip of rum in the parking lot after work.

While the company cited its drug and alcohol policy as grounds for the dismissal, Starn wrote in an October 2024 NLRB appeal letter that he was instead let go for the “real and illegal reason” of openly campaigning for the union, one of just three workers doing so at the time.
“My firing damaged our effort by keeping me out of the facility and the chance to mobilize workers there, although we are making strong progress in our card collection nonetheless,” he wrote. “We desperately need the protection of the NLRB in supporting rightful complaints like mine to keep a powerful company from getting away with demoralizing illegal tactics in trying to suppress worker efforts to have a voice in the workplace.”
Hards, the Amazon spokesperson, wrote in a statement that Starn’s termination was not related to his union activities and disputed his characterization of selective enforcement of the company’s drug and alcohol policy.
“The decision to terminate Mr. Starn was unrelated to whether he supported any particular cause or group. Mr. Starn was terminated for violating Amazon’s drug and alcohol policy, a violation that has resulted in several other terminations at RDU1 in the past,” she wrote. “We expect all of our employees to follow our policies, and we take appropriate action when those policies are violated.”
Ultimately, of the 13 labor complaints brought by CAUSE organizers, all but two have been dismissed or withdrawn. But the most recent of those complaints, an expansive Feb. 7 complaint alleging a campaign of surveillance, intimidation, and retaliation by Amazon throughout the election period, remains open, as does a Jan. 15 complaint citing the arrest of CAUSE supporters on warehouse property in December. A Feb. 12 complaint that Amazon brought against the union over the removal of company posters is also still active.
A resolution to CAUSE’s election objections will come only after their prior complaints are adjudicated. “I have determined to postpone the objections hearing until I determine the merits of the related pending unfair labor practice allegations and whether consolidation of the pending objections with an unfair labor practice proceeding before an administrative law judge is warranted,” NLRB regional director Michael Turner wrote in March.
With President Donald Trump’s election, however, it appears CAUSE’s claims may well face an uphill battle with the NLRB. In March, Trump nominated Crystal Carey as the board’s next general counsel — a management-side labor lawyer whose firm has represented Amazon in labor disputes and advanced the claim that the board itself is unconstitutional.
Union supporters allege ‘a total fear campaign’
At the center of the ongoing dispute over the labor election results is the conduct of Amazon and the union campaign during the election period, from late 2024 to early 2025.
Organizers say Amazon carried out a campaign of intimidation and union-busting, culminating in the arrest of CAUSE supporters on warehouse property, while the company says the campaign went too far in its efforts to reach workers on the premises and counter company messaging, accusing them of trespassing and vandalism.
In their Feb. 24 election challenge, lawyers for CAUSE wrote that the thrust of Amazon’s messaging campaign was that unionizing would be “futile” and was likely to lead to the rollback of higher wages, benefits like volunteer and unpaid time off, and other employment protections that the company had granted in the absence of organized representation.
“[Amazon] threatened employees with the loss of benefits and/or pay if workers voted in favor of being represented by the Union,” the attorneys wrote. “[They] solicited employees to participate in the production of anti-Union marketing materials, and took video footage of employees to use in anti-Union videos without the employees’ knowledge or consent.”

Italo Medelius, a CAUSE organizer who worked the warehouse’s shipping dock, said managers and employee relations consultants would walk the warehouse floor, soliciting workers and discouraging them from joining the union. This was paired with a “Vote No” promotional video that aired on repeat on televisions across the facility’s lobbies and break rooms, which he said featured a former Teamster making the case that union representation would only harm the workers. “So just a total fear campaign, 24/7 inside of that warehouse,” he said.
According to a report by LaborLab, a pro-union nonprofit corporate watchdog, Amazon paid management-side consulting firm Road Warrior Productions more than $366,000 over the span of roughly a month to create anti-union materials used in the election, which the organization condemned as “union-busting services.”
“Amazon is one of the greatest union busters in the history of the world,” said Medelius. “They cover every single inch of that warehouse in some way, shape, or form with anti-union propaganda.”
Hards, the Amazon spokesperson, cited the extensive organizing efforts across Amazon facilities throughout the U.S. as necessitating the use of labor consulting firms. She pointed to “tens of billions of dollars in benefits” including health care, a 401K program with a company match, and pre-paid college tuition as evidence that investments in workers vastly outweigh the use of those services.
“We also know that there are outside organizations working hard and spending heavily to spread inaccurate information about us to our teams. Which is also why we work to ensure our employees are fully informed about their rights and how decisions about outside representation could impact their day-to-day lives working at Amazon,” Hards wrote in a statement.
Medelius also described an anti-union persuasion campaign that he said targeted Spanish-speaking workers specifically, which he said invoked racial stereotypes in an attempt to divide workers. Medelius, who is bilingual, said he was individually banned from Amazon’s Spanish-language informational meetings after speaking out against these tactics. He added that on one occasion, he was required to report for a random drug test minutes after speaking out at one of these meetings, an experience he said other organizers reported as well.

“The crazy thing is that we’ve been fighting for translation in Human Resources. So, if somebody that’s a Spanish speaker has an issue that needs to be resolved by HR, I have to go with them to translate for them,” Medelius said. “But when it comes to union busting, everything is in Spanish, so it’s kind of a little bit dystopian there.”
Starn recounted a town hall meeting in which a manager sought to associate CAUSE with immigrant deportation efforts to “raise fear and uncertainty” among workers and scare them out of supporting the union effort.
“At one of the town hall meetings, one of the mangers says, you know, ‘We’ve been hearing that CAUSE is telling people that if they vote no, they’ll be deported, and we don’t think anybody should be deported,’” Starn said. “This is a completely outlandish charge, but it’s the kind of thing Amazon does.”
This incident was also detailed in the election challenge, with attorneys for the union campaign writing that Amazon “coerced and intimidated employees into voting against Union representation by falsely accusing the Union of suggesting workers could be deported for voting no” and themselves “suggesting that workers’ immigration status could be impacted by the results of the election.”
According to Hards, employees came forward with complaints that union organizers told them if they did not vote in favor of the union, they could face deportation, and the comments during the informational session were intended to rebut those claims.
The complaint also alleges that Amazon took action against specific employees to prevent them from voting in favor of the union, including delaying a known union supporter’s return-to-work date until after the election had concluded. And it details a culture of surveillance in which workers’ social media accounts were allegedly monitored for statements about the campaign and where workers were “interrogated” about support for the union.
Many of these allegations were also the subject of a Feb. 7 unfair labor practice complaint filed by CAUSE that remains open, including a claim that workers were explicitly asked to report union activity to management and that Amazon selectively targeted known union supporters for disciplinary action.

These claims have been a persistent subject of CAUSE’s labor complaints long before the union card campaign concluded, with their attorneys writing in a May 2023 unfair labor practice complaint that Amazon was “instructing its employees to file internal complaints against supporters of [CAUSE]” and launching investigations against organizers to search for cause to terminate them.
The union alleges that interference with the election effort came to a head on Dec. 7, 2024, when three organizers not employed by Amazon were arrested by Garner Police on trespassing charges as they sought to pass out food and collect union cards outside the warehouse. Days later, Amazon also terminated Brown, the union co-founder, citing inflammatory remarks likening company management to slaveholders and labeling a defender of the company an “Uncle Tom.”
Hards declined to comment on the broader allegations of coercion and surveillance, but wrote that the company was within its rights to seek the removal of non-employees from its property during the Dec. 7 incident.
“Last December, several individuals who aren’t Amazon employees or partners came on to our property and refused multiple requests to leave,” Hards wrote. “After repeated attempts to remedy the situation and consistent with our standard protocols, we engaged law enforcement for assistance. Those individuals were eventually arrested after refusing to follow the police officer’s orders.”
She also condemned Brown for what she described as efforts to “push misinformation to the media” on his arrest and said his dismissal was the result of “repeated misconduct” including the use of “derogatory and racist language,” which the company had previously investigated. “His most recent violation resulted in his termination because we don’t tolerate that type of inappropriate behavior at Amazon.”

During this same period, Amazon alleges that union supporters tore down posters encouraging workers to vote no, labeling the actions as “acts of property damage.” CAUSE contends in its own complaint that scores of pro-union posters and signage from inside and outside the facility were destroyed — including signs posted in the break room and banners supporting the union hanging on the public sidewalk outside the warehouse.
Despite these setbacks, the card campaign succeeded in January after organizers collected signatures from more than 30% of workers comprising the prospective bargaining unit. But in February, they lost by a roughly three-to-one margin, a result that indicated there had been a falloff of support in the critical month leading up to the election — a result that Medelius said came as “a blow” in the moment.
“Ultimately, just looking at it, we knew that historically and logically we were facing an uphill battle from the very beginning,” Medelius said. “Everybody that’s a professional labor organizer has told us, you’re never gonna win the first time.”
‘This election hasn’t stopped the train’
On Friday, organizers with CAUSE once again set up their tents outside RDU1 — their first demonstration on-site since the election. As they renewed their pitch to workers, the company began work on a new eight-foot fence along the property line.
“My biggest fear leading up to the election was if there is a loss, or if there is a big loss with a big margin like what happened, that we would just collapse — that’s what Amazon pretty much hopes, right?” Medelius said. “But with us, I mean, the next day we had a meeting, that Sunday, and it was one of our most attended meetings. There were even people that voted no that were there and trying to figure out how we can build a better union.”

He described a mood of “optimism and hope” among organizers as the fight moves forward and called the 829 supporters in the warehouse a strong foothold to come back and succeed in the next effort. According to NLRB rules, a union campaign can file for a new election 12 months after the conclusion of the previous one. That means organizers could give Amazon “another Christmas present this year” with a renewed card authorization campaign, Medelius said.
King said she has heard from workers who voted no and who have had a change of heart since, pointing to issues like a wave of terminations after the election and excessive enforcement of policies like cell phone restrictions and “time off task” discipline.
“That’s why we’re out here today, to let people know that we’re still here,” she said on Friday, sitting under one of the tents to meet and persuade former coworkers. “We’re not going anywhere, and we have your back, but we need y’all to have ours as well.”
After the first election effort, Medelius said, organizers now have firsthand experience with the company’s anti-union tactics, giving them a better chance at countering their messaging among workers.
“Now we know the rules, we know what we’ve got to do, and we can come in with a better strategy,” Medelius said. “It’s kind of like a boxing match, right? You lose one round, but then you jump back and win the next three, so we’re very excited to do that.”

In particular, he outlined plans to strengthen CAUSE’s Hispanic Organizing Committee and day shift and night shift organizing committees, and to begin collecting authorization cards year-round. He added that organizers had been in contact with workers at the RDU5 and DRT8 warehouses in Durham as well as facilities in South Carolina who want to begin their own efforts, but declined to offer specific information about potential future campaigns, citing the need for secrecy around organizing strategies.
Benny Koval, chair of CAUSE’s night shift organizing committee, said the immediate priority was “what we can do on the shop floor,” pushing back on issues like excessive temperatures in the facility, post-holiday rush layoffs, and mandatory overtime days — one of which was slated to be on Mother’s Day before the company backtracked after employee outcries, Koval said.
“I feel like they’re just stepping on us to see how much we’ll take to a certain extent,” Koval said.
Meanwhile, efforts to unionize Amazon continue throughout the U.S., particularly across the South. In Louisville, Kentucky, workers at the company’s KCVG Air Hub are seeking to organize through the Teamsters, and in Bessemer, Alabama, labor officials have ordered Amazon to hold a third union election after finding unlawful interference in previous attempts.
Abraham Walker, a sociology professor at Fayetteville State University, said the South poses some structural obstacles for union campaigns. Every state in the region is a “right-to-work” state, meaning that workplaces cannot make union membership compulsory and all workers are entitled to the same benefits regardless of union affiliation, creating what Walker called a “free rider problem” in which workers reap the rewards of union-bargained contracts without paying dues to support organizing efforts. And because of the low rates of union membership throughout the South, many workers do not know anyone who is a member of a union, leaving them susceptible to misinformation about union impacts, Walker said.
Labor groups from across the South came together to support the CAUSE campaign. Fayetteville State University professor Abraham Walker pointed to these ties as a source of strength for the union going forward. (Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)
He noted that in Chattanooga, Tennessee, it took three elections before workers at the city’s Volkswagen plant voted to unionize the facility in 2024. Walker said a benefit of CAUSE’s status as an independent grassroots campaign is that “they’re not going anywhere.” He cited “very strong coalitions” the organizers built across the Research Triangle as a source of structural support that will allow the union to renew its efforts going forward.
“Despite the final tally, I see a lot of promise in CAUSE’s future,” Walker said. “There’s going to be a process of reassessment, I think, going forward. They will in all likelihood try to do this again — it might not be a year, it might be a few years from now, but one of the things about Amazon warehouses, which is both challenging and potentially an advantage, is the turnover’s high.”
The New York Times reported in 2021 that Amazon sees a roughly 150% turnover rate among its hourly associates each year. Medelius said this was a source of difficulty in this year’s election because many of those who signed authorization cards were already gone from the warehouse by February. But that fact can also be turned to the union campaign’s advantage, he said: many, if not most, of the 2,447 who voted against the union will no longer be with at RDU1 in a year’s time, giving organizers “a brand-new warehouse” for its next effort.
“All we’ve gotta do is keep our supporters, make sure that we keep telling them our motto, ‘Don’t quit, organize,’ and that’s the way that we’re going to out-organize them, so the plan right now is keep calling for an election — if we lose, do it again,” Medelius said.
“We’re going to organize as if we had won the election, we’re going to continue building our movement, and we’re gonna continue not just within RDU1, but all across the Carolinas,” he added. “This election hasn’t stopped the train.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P2080246-scaled-e1741104680670-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-02 06:11:57.954642

(Photo by U.S. Department of Agriculture)State and federal changes to food benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, are expected to start affecting Idahoans in 2026. 
The Idaho Legislature in 2025 approved restrictions on candy and soda purchases through the program, and the U.S. Congress approved an expansion of work requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents on the program through the sweeping tax and spending package, called the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” 
The federal bill also removed SNAP eligibility for refugees who don’t yet have a green card; this change was implemented immediately upon its passage in July. 
There are 124,714 Idahoans receiving food assistance through SNAP as of Dec. 12. The average recipient gets around $182 monthly per beneficiary to use for groceries. 
SNAP benefits are paid for by the federal government and administered by the state. Starting in fiscal year 2028, states will for the first time in the program’s history be required to pay for some of the benefits, as well as an increased share of the administrative costs. Idaho’s expenditure on the program is expected to increase by $6 million annually, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
 Candy and soda ban to take place in early in the new year 

SNAP recipients won’t be able to purchase candy or soda with program funds starting Feb. 15, according to the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare. Program payments are made through an “Electronic Benefits Transfer,” or EBT card, which can be used like a debit card at the grocery store for eligible purchases. 
Amid hearings for the candy and soda SNAP bill in the 2025 legislative session, retailers largely opposed it because of the broad definitions, which included: 

“‘Candy’ means a preparation of sugar, honey, or other natural or artificial sweeteners in combination with chocolate, fruits, nuts, or other ingredients or flavorings in the form of bars, drops, or pieces.”
“‘Candy’ shall not include any preparation containing flour and shall require no refrigeration.” 
“‘Soda’ means any nonalcoholic beverage that contains natural or artificial sweeteners.”
“’Soda’ does not include any beverages that contain milk or milk substitutes, that are greater than 50% vegetable juice or fruit juice by volume, or that require preparation before consumption, such as powders or concentrates.” 

To enact the changes to the food program, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare had to receive permission from federal authorities through a waiver. 
U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. signed three similar waivers in June, approving the candy soda restrictions for Idaho, Utah and Arkansas.

 Updated SNAP work requirements, delayed by government shutdown, to begin in April 

Changes made in the federal “Big Beautiful Bill” to work requirements for some SNAP beneficiaries were supposed to be implemented in November. However, disruptions caused by the federal government shutdown delayed implementation.
Idaho Health and Welfare spokesman AJ McWhorter told the Idaho Capital Sun on Dec. 22 the agency was on track to make the changes in April. He said the agency intended “to absorb the changes with no request for additional staff or funding.” 
The changes will mean more people will be subject to work requirements to receive benefits. 
For able-bodied adults without dependents, there are additional work requirements to be able to use SNAP for more than three months within three years. 
To receive benefits for more than the time limit, these beneficiaries must work or volunteer at least 80 hours a month, participate in a work program at least 80 hours a month, participate in a combination of work and work program for a total of at least 80 hours a month, or participate in public “workfare” for assigned number of hours a month. 
Prior to the passage of the Big Beautiful Bill, there were exemptions from this time limit for veterans, people experiencing homelessness, young people aging out of foster care, parents with children under 18, and people aged 54 and older — meaning they could continue to receive SNAP assistance for more than three months even if they weren’t working. 
The changes to these exemptions mean the following able-bodied adults will be subject to work requirements:

Removal of exemptions for veterans, those experiencing homelessness and youth aging out of foster care
Narrowed exception for parents with responsibility of children under 18 years old, to those of children under age 14
Increase of the upper age limit for the exception from 54 to 64 years old

The bill also added time-limit exemptions for Native Americans, Alaska Natives, and tribal members. 
For states to waive the work requirements, they must now show an unemployment rate over 10%, with exceptions for Alaska and Hawaii. The prior waiver allowed states to identify areas that lack sufficient jobs.

(Moe Clark/Colorado Newsline) Colorado lawmakers in 2018 unanimously approved a law that was meant to speed up the release of eligible people behind bars when state prisons got too full. But the law hasn’t worked as intended since it was triggered for the first time in mid-2025.
The so-called prison population management measures have barely made a dent in the Colorado Department of Corrections’ vacancy rate after four months, meaning state prisons remain at or near capacity without enough room for the growing prison population.
The vacancy rate in state prisons stood at 1.92% as of Aug. 16, marking the 30th consecutive day the department maintained a vacancy rate below 3%. House Bill 18-1410 requires that once that threshold is reached, the department must begin to take steps to reduce the incarcerated population in coordination with the state parole board and the Office of Community Corrections, which oversees halfway houses. At the end of December, the vacancy rate in prisons stood at 2.91%.

The law was intended to expedite existing processes to better manage the state’s prison population, not release additional people who are not eligible for parole, Christie Donner, executive director of the Colorado Criminal Justice Reform Coalition, said. 
“There aren’t going to be big numbers of releases — it’s not intended to be that — but it’s a way of identifying and expediting processes, removing some of the barriers so that there can be a responsiveness to when they’re running out of beds,” Donner said. 
Rändi Moore, chair of the Colorado State Board of Parole, said the board has reviewed 88 people who met the criteria of the prison population management measures law. Of those reviewed, only 29 have been released from prison.
An incarcerated person needs to have a parole plan approved by the DOC’s Division of Adult Parole before the parole board evaluates the viability of housing and employment options in the plan, Moore said. DOC spokesperson Alondra Garcia-Gonzalez said the department secures and vets housing for someone eligible for parole, but the parole board has the final authority to approve a plan.










I think the short answer is it's not doing much.


– Justin Brakke, legislative policy analyst


Some paroles, when they occur after an incarcerated person’s eligibility but before their mandatory parole date, are discretionary. But discretionary parole releases have dropped since the law took effect.
When during a recent meeting Colorado lawmakers asked about the effectiveness of the state’s prison population management measures, Justin Brakke, a nonpartisan legislative policy analyst, said, “I think the short answer is it’s not doing much.”
Parole qualifications under the law are very restrictive, and it excludes certain violent crimes, Brakke said. The Office of Community Corrections is required by the law to identify open beds that DOC can use on a weekly basis until the vacancy rate rises above 4% for 30 consecutive days. But Brakke said the DOC doesn’t have authority to put people in those beds — the local boards of those community corrections centers do. 
Community corrections has higher turnover rates, which makes bed counts more fluid, and many halfway houses are coed with fewer women than men, while the need remains higher for men, said Brian Hulse, chair-elect for the Colorado Community Corrections Coalition.
The average length of stay for someone in community corrections during the 2024-2025 fiscal year was 259 days, Division of Criminal Justice spokesperson Paula Vargas said. People can be sentenced right to community corrections so they don’t have to go to prison, but others go to community corrections while transitioning out of prison.

Community corrections programs that are coed have a set number of beds for men and for women, Hulse said, but when there aren’t women to fill their designated beds, those available beds will sit empty despite the demand for the male population. 
The location of open community corrections beds affects availability too, because halfway houses are meant to reintegrate people back into the community they came from, Hulse said. 
“We might have beds open in a rural area, but not necessarily the right fit for clients that need to go to that community, whereas the demand might be in an urban area where a particular program or jurisdiction might be at capacity too,” Hulse said. 
Mark Wester, the outgoing chair of the Colorado Community Corrections Coalition, said that while there is always opportunity to maximize unused capacity in community corrections, providers have seen an uptick since the prison population management measures took effect. But the need for more community corrections beds is there, too. 
“I think that the entire system is trying to respond to the increased demand from prisons, and we’re very aware that the Department of Corrections is at the 3% vacancy threshold,” Wester said. “So the coalition members have been really working hard to make sure that we accommodate as many people as possible.”
County jail backlog
The backlog of people in county jail waiting to be transferred to state prisons further exacerbates population issues. The Joint Budget Committee approved funding in September for 153 additional beds specifically intended to address the backlog. While those beds helped the department make progress in October and November, when the backlog dropped to about 330 people, Garcia-Gonzalez said it is back up to 590 people awaiting intake. The state budgets for just over 250 people to be temporarily held in county jails. 
Now that the prison population management measures law has been “beta tested,” Donner said, she hopes the department and state legislators will seek to make changes to improve the effectiveness of the law. 
“There are things that we can be doing to manage the prison population, so our hope is there’s appetite for that,” Donner said.
Donner said she would want to see more specific actions outlined that everyone within the system needs to take to reduce the prison population, because the law in its current form only requires that state leaders — including the governor, the parole board and district attorneys — are notified of the low vacancy threshold. Hulse said the law has heightened awareness among providers, at least in community corrections, of the need and the demand. 
“Awareness around what the state is facing from a prison population management standpoint I think brings more acuity to decisions made and efficiency in which those decisions are made,” Hulse said.

(Capital-Star/Peter Hall)Pennsylvania is likely to play a crucial role in determining the balance of power in Congress in the 2026 midterm elections, with four U.S. House seats expected to be competitive — more than any other state. 
“Each of these districts are within a couple of points,” said pollster Berwood Yost of Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster. “There aren’t a lot of competitive districts across the United States, and so both parties want to retain those districts.” 
Yost is the director of the Center for Opinion Research and the director of the Floyd Institute for Public Policy at the school
Tight margins in three races — two of which were Republican pick-ups in 2024 — make them targets for Democrats looking to regain control of the House. Another seat in the Philadelphia suburbs is a perennial goal for the Democratic Party, but voters have remained loyal to the GOP.
Though all 19 of the commonwealth’s congressional districts will be on the ballot next year, the four closely watched races and their incumbents are: 

First Congressional District, held by U.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick
7th Congressional District, held by U.S. Rep. Ryan Mackenzie
8th Congressional District, held by U.S. Rep. Rob Bresnahan 
10th Congressional District, held by U.S. Rep. Scott Perry

But Yost noted challenges for the quartet.
October poll results from F&M, overseen by Yost, reported 36% of respondents felt “worse off” financially than they were a year ago in the commonwealth. One area where prices will increase substantially in 2026 are health care costs for moderate-income Pennsylvanians using marketplace plans. 
Congress opted not to extend enhanced subsidies at this time, which Yost said would be “an albatross” on candidates.

“It makes all of these people vulnerable,” he continued. “Because everybody’s going to know somebody who either drops their coverage or is complaining about what they’re paying for coverage.”
Three of those Republicans — Fitzpatrick, Mackenzie and Bresnahan — signed onto a discharge petition on Dec. 17 to force a vote on extending subsidies, breaking with party leadership.
That poll also identified a drop in President Donald Trump’s popularity, with 41% believing he was doing an “excellent” or “good” job, compared to 58% who believed he was doing a “fair” or “poor” job.
“There’s a relationship between seats lost and presidential popularity,” said Yost. “The less popular the president, the more seats they tend to lose.” 
Neither Mackenzie nor Bresnahan have a long congressional record in their districts, making them more at risk, Yost said. Fitzpatrick and Perry, on the other hand, have both held onto their seats against previous challenges. 
 The greater political climate

James Markley, a spokesperson for the Republican Party of Pennsylvania, told the Capital-Star that next year wouldn’t be much different from previous cycles.
“2026 will be a challenge, but Pennsylvania is the ultimate swing state. Our elections are always competitive,” he said. 
Wins from 2024 — from Trump down to two congressional seats that flipped from Democratic to Republican — were “tremendous victories,” he added.
“New members like Congressman Ryan MacKenzie and Congressman Rob Bresnahan are already leaving their mark on our country. Our goal is to make sure we send them back to D.C. to continue the hard work they’re doing everyday for our commonwealth and our country.”
Congressional health insurance tug-o-war puts Pennsylvanians in a lurch

But as Trump’s approval ratings fall, Democrats across the nation hope to tie sitting Republicans to his administration. 
“All four of Pennsylvania’s swing-seat Republican congressmen are uniquely vulnerable due to their own failures and self-inflicted wounds: Bresnahan has become the poster-child of Washington corruption and is stock trading away his seat, Mackenzie is a late-night TV punchline for taking marching orders from his party bosses, Fitzpatrick has become Trump’s doormat, and Perry is so extreme that he disparaged veterans who don’t share his politics,” said Eli Cousin, the Mid-Atlantic regional press secretary for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. 
“What Bresnahan, Mackenzie, Fitzpatrick, and Perry all have in common is the fact that they have overseen skyrocketing costs on everything from health care to groceries to electricity – and they will be held accountable for their records at the ballot box next November,” he continued.
Voters in midterm elections frequently turn to the minority party in Congress, but could also boost a Pennsylvania politician who is believed to have national ambitions. 
As reported by Axios, Gov. Josh Shapiro, who is running for re-election next year, seeks to “engineer a blowout” in the 2026 midterms in order to gain an edge ahead of the 2028 presidential primaries. At the heart of the strategy: flipping all four congressional seats.
Two candidates openly have the backing of Shapiro in central Pennsylvania, and he appears to have favorites in the other districts, according to the publication. 
 1st Congressional District: a Philly suburb
Straddling two Philadelphia collar counties — Bucks County and part of Montgomery County — U.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, a moderate Republican, has retained the seat even as the district swung between the two parties in 2020 and 2024 elections.

A former special assistant U.S. attorney and FBI agent, Fitzpatrick succeeded his brother, Mike, and won a seat for the first time in 2016. A Fitzpatrick has represented the area since 2008.
In 2024, Fitzpatrick earned re-election with 56% of the vote, more than 59,000 votes ahead of Democratic challenger Ashley Ehasz. 
Politico analysts believe that the 2025 election results could spell trouble for the incumbent, however, after Democrats won several local seats. Most recently, Inside Elections moved the district from “likely Republican” to “leans,” citing November’s results in the area. 
Across the aisle, a slate of Democrats have filed to to run against Fitzpatrick, including: 

Bucks County Commission Chair Bob Harvie
Delaware Valley University professor Tracy Hunt
Attorney Lucia Dora Simonelli 
And eyewear company manager Robert Strickler

Axios reported that Shapiro has “quietly” backed Harvie, though it isn’t official. John Hoban, an independent, is also running for the seat.
 7th Congressional District: A Lehigh Valley “toss-up”

Republican U.S. Rep. Ryan Mackenzie, PA-07. (Official photo)
One of the most competitive seats in the country is expected to be the 7th Congressional District, nestled in the Lehigh Valley. 
Ryan Mackenzie, a Republican, edged out incumbent Democrat Susan Wild with 50.5% of the vote, a 4,000-vote margin, in 2024. Wild had two terms under her belt. 
Roll Call ranks Mackenzie as the fourth most “vulnerable” incumbent, and all three major election forecasters (The Cook Political Report, Sabato’s Crystal Ball and Inside Elections) label the race as a “toss-up.”
But the national Republican fundraising arm seems to hope for a bruising primary, pointing to a December Politico report on “deep divisions” within Democrat ranks. A Dec. 1 post from the GOP called the primary “a microcosm of the whole party: messy, out of touch, and having no clear direction.” 
Running for the Democratic nomination: 

Bob Brooks, firefighter and president of the Pennsylvania Professional Firefighters Association 
Former federal prosecutor Ryan Crosswell
Northampton County Executive Lamont McClure 
Former PPL Electrics Utilities executive Carol Obando-Derstine
Lehigh County Controller Mark Pinsley

Combined, the six Democratic contenders raised more than $1.5 million by October, months ahead of the May 19 primary vote. 
Shapiro endorsed Brooks in December, headlining a fundraiser for the candidate later that month. Obando-Derstine has the support of Wild, who previously held the seat, and an endorsement from Emily’s List, an abortion rights organization. 
 8th Congressional District: Stocks and Scranton

Though Trump solidly won the Pocono-based district, boosting Republican Rob Bresnahan’s 2024 victory to flip the longtime Democrat-held seat, questions over stock trades have plagued the incumbent.
Republican U.S. Rep. Rob Bresnahan, PA-08. (Official photo)
In 2024, Bresnahan defeated incumbent Democrat Matt Cartwright with nearly 51% of the vote, or more than 6,000 votes. In that time, he has made over 600 stock trades, some of which came ahead of crucial votes — spurring accusations that he used his position to make advantageous trading decisions.
One such vote includes the decision to sharply cut federal Medicaid funding by adding work requirements and limiting state oversight on provider taxes. The New York Times reports that Bresnahan sold between $100,001 and $250,000 worth of bonds issued by the Allegheny County Hospital Development Authority for the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. 
He also sold up to $15,000 of stock in Centene, the country’s largest Medicaid plan provider. NBC News additionally reported another $130,000 in Medicaid-related stocks Bresnahan sold. 
In defense of his moves, Bresnahan said he doesn’t tell his financial advisors what to do with stock purchases. 
The freshman lawmaker, whose initial wealth came from the sale of his family’s construction business, campaigned on the promise to end lawmaker stock trading. In December, he signed a petition to force a vote on a bill to ban congressional stock trading. 
The Democratic contenders are: 

Scranton Mayor Paige Cognetti
Francis McHale, a former attorney with the state Dept. of Labor and Industry 
And Scranton-based Eric Stone

Cognetti launched her bid for the seat while running for reelection this fall, followed by McHale, who criticized Cognetti for the dual campaigns. 
Shapiro has “quietly” backed Cognetti, according to Axios. 
 10th Congressional District: a 2024 rematch

While the other three Republicans don’t yet have challengers within their own party, the same can’t be said for U.S. Rep. Scott Perry, a retired Army National Guard brigadier general who served in Iraq. 
Republican U.S. Rep. Scott Perry, PA-10. (Official photo)
Representing the 10th Congressional District, which includes all of Dauphin County and parts of Cumberland and York counties, at least two GOP challengers have lined up: Karen Dalton, a former staff attorney at the capitol, and Josh Hall.
Along with Mackenzie’s Lehigh Valley seat, Perry’s race is considered to be a toss-up by election ratings agencies. Perry has held a seat in Congress since 2013 and previously served in the state legislature.
He won re-election two years ago by less than 51%, just over 5,000 votes ahead of Democrat Janelle Stelson, a former television news anchor. Stelson has the nod from Shapiro, who headlined a fundraiser campaign launch for her in July. 
Stelson also faces a primary before a potential rematch against Perry. Also running for the Democratic nomination are: 

Carlisle-based Jason Cass
Dauphin County Commissioner Justin Douglas
And Army veteran William Lillich

Independent Isabella Harman, also an Army veteran, is also running for the seat. 
Within this district and other competitive primaries, Yost noted that the right primary candidate can make a difference. 
“For both parties, there have been times when base primary voters deliver a candidate that suffers at the general election,” said Yost. 
Following the May primaries, the general election will be Nov. 3, 2026.
“I think the fundamental question underlying all of these races is, ‘How big is the anti-Trump sentiment? How large is the wave or how well can these congressional Republicans separate themselves from people’s feelings about Trump?” Yost said. “We’ll have to wait and see.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DSC_7425-1024x682.jpg,,,2026-01-02 10:11:41.531426

Joseph Shekarchi, background. (Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Heading into his sixth year leading the chamber, Rhode Island House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi has mastered the art of satisfying a flurry of funding requests despite an ever-present budget deficit.
This year feels different. 
“It’s going to be a challenging year,” Shekarchi, a Warwick Democrat, said in an interview in mid-December. “It’s going to be by far, the most challenging year I’ve had as speaker.”
The biggest source of his holiday headache: the federal government, which under President Donald Trump has upended once-reliable federal funding streams for state and local government. 
Nearly $135 million in federal grants for state energy programs, infrastructure projects, public health initiatives and education programs have been cut off, or rendered inaccessible due to new strings attached to the money, according to an Oct. 30 analysis by the Rhode Island Office of Management and Budget. Meanwhile, major changes to federal health care and food assistance programs under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act will kick tens of thousands of vulnerable residents off critical safety net programs, simultaneously forcing state agencies to invest millions of dollars in personnel, IT and consultants to meet new federal mandates. 
The most sweeping changes to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) don’t kick in for one or more years. But legislative leaders are trying to prepare now for the financial and human costs.
“Everything is on the table,” Senate President Valarie Lawson said in a separate interview. “There’s tremendous need here in Rhode Island, and we can’t abandon these people.” 
Lawson is fresh to the role, having ascended in the final throes of the 2025 session. Her rise to power was fraught with tension and grief after the death of her predecessor, former Senate President Dominick Ruggerio, in April. 
Lawson, an East Providence Democrat and president of the state teachers union, acknowledged the public controversy permeating the upper chamber even before Ruggerio’s death. But the wounds inflicted by the Trump administration might offer a chance for lawmakers to find common ground in standing against federal funding cuts and policy changes.
“Most people who are here really feel like their priority is to get things done for Rhode Island, just like it’s my priority, and that’s our driving force here,” Lawson said. “We’re all professional here, and I really do think that members of this chamber care about policy, and this is where they want the energy of the chamber to be as well.”

Here are the top talking points when the gavel bangs on Tuesday, Jan. 6, marking the start to a new session: 
Health care 
Looming Medicaid cuts will kick 33,500 Rhode Islanders off the government health benefits program by the end of 2026. But Rhode Island’s fragile health care system is already suffering. 
Uncompetitive reimbursement rates with neighboring states have sapped the state’s supply of health care providers, including primary care doctors and nurses. 
Insurance premiums have spiked by double-digit percentages, yet insurance companies are still struggling to remain solvent amid rising health care costs of their own. Cash-strapped hospitals can’t keep up with the volume or cost of uninsured patients, a situation that will grow more dire if the buyer of Roger Williams Medical Center and Our Lady of Fatima Hospital can’t close the deal by mid-January.
The two safety net hospitals have ridden a roller coaster of uncertainty since their owner, Prospect Medical Holdings, filed for bankruptcy in January 2024. Prospective buyer The Centurion Foundation is still struggling to secure the investor-backed bonds needed to finalize the purchase and prevent the facilities from imminent closure.
The two hospitals treated 50,000 emergency room visitors last year and employ more than 2,700 people. But legislative leaders have not yet suggested forking over state funding to keep them afloat as Mass Gov. Maura Healey did in 2024 after Steward Health Care filed for bankruptcy and sold its Massachusetts hospitals.
Shekarchi and Lawson are still hoping Centurion will close the sale by a Jan. 15 deadline set in federal bankruptcy court in Texas. If not?
“Then there might be more efforts in the state,” Shekarchi said. 
Even if Centurion closes the sale successfully, he’s anticipating some “asks” from the nonprofit buyer, though what and from whom remain unclear.
“We’ll address that when we get there, but we have to close the deal first,” Shekarchi said.
Lawson said keeping Roger Williams and Fatima open is “paramount to our health care system.” 
The Senate’s 2026 policy wish list features other health care items, too: creating a medical school at the University of Rhode Island, banning insurance companies from requiring pre-authorization for mental health visits — piggybacking on the 2025 law that ended pre-authorizations for primary care — and regulating pharmacy benefit managers to make prescriptions more affordable. 
“When we talk about health care, we’re looking at short-term, medium- and long-term,” Lawson said. “We need a fully functioning health care system so we have affordable, attainable access to health care.”
Creating a medical school at URI would cost $225 million over the first decade, including substantial state contributions along with private and philanthropic funding, according to a preliminary report commissioned by a state consultant. 
“It’s an expensive proposition, and it’s long,” Shekarchi said, noting the 10 years it would take before doctors graduated and were serving the community. 
A legislative commission exploring the topic is expected to issue a final report in January.

Education, housing 
Also costly: drastic changes to the education funding formula. A task force created by the Rhode Island Foundation has recommended major overhauls to the calculations that fund local education districts, including placing a greater responsibility on the state to level the playing field for low-income students and non-native English speakers.
Lawson and Shekarchi both said they were aware of the forthcoming report, but said it was too early to comment.  
Lawson, who spent more than three decades as a teacher in East Providence Public Schools, remains hungry to expand access to free school meals to all students, regardless of income, as nine other states have done.
“I still think it’s really important, because it’s removing an obstacle for kids to succeed,” Lawson said. “Kids who are fed, they achieve higher standards and test scores.”
The $40 million price tag has been a sticking point in recent years across both sides of the rotunda, but lawmakers are exploring ways to boost federal spending to cover the costs, Lawson said.
If education is Lawson’s strong suit, Shekarchi has made housing his focus tackling the many local land use rules making it harder to build and renovate fast and affordably. He again expects to release a multi-bill housing package this year that would cut red tape in local and state housing laws, though he’s awaiting final recommendations from the pair of legislative commissions considering housing affordability and land use. 
Workforce 
Intertwined with housing availability and affordability is the state’s talent pool. Fresh off the loss of Hasbro Inc., which cemented plans to abandon its century-old Rhode Island roots for a fresh new office in Boston’s Seaport district by the end of 2026, Shekarchi is keeping in close contact with other major state employers like CVS Health and FM. So far, executives at these companies have not given any hints they intend to abandon or reduce their local footprints, Shekarchi said.
Keeping major corporations happy relies not only on face time with Smith Hill leaders; they want access to workers, something Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks said was a major reason why the toy and gaming empire is moving to Boston. 
That’s why the Rhode Island Senate has thrown its weight behind a $65 million “workforce innovation center” at the Community College of Rhode Island’s Warwick campus. The new building, funded via borrowing put to voters on the November 2026 ballot, would serve as a centralized hub for career and technical programs in critical industries like health care, defense, manufacturing, IT, construction and renewable energy, according to informational materials provided by the Senate on CCRI’s behalf.

Eye on 2026 elections 
Eleven months out, conversations over candidates seeking state office in 2026 are flowing, including speculation over whether Shekarchi will run for governor. Shekarchi remained tight-lipped, promising an announcement sometime in the first quarter. 
Gov. Dan McKee and his 2022 rival, Helena Buonanno Foulkes, are already jousting in what is shaping up to be a competitive Democratic primary, while a handful of Republicans have declared their candidacies, including former aide to Gov. Don Carcieri, Aaron Guckian.
All 113 members of the legislature will also be up for reelection in 2026 — an unspoken yet obvious factor that hangs over Smith Hill every two years. A trio of incumbent Democrats already face challengers propped up by a new, conservative-leaning political action committee, The League of RI Businesses. 
Senate Majority Leader Frank Ciccone and Majority Whip David Tikoian’s attendance at fundraisers for two of the legislative challengers raised eyebrows. But Lawson has stayed away from the debate, and even Ciccone said he has not decided whether he will back his niece, Laura Turini, in her campaign to unseat Sen. Bridget Valverde of  North Kingstown.
Lawson and Ciccone appeared an unlikely pairing when matched in April, with starkly different views on guns, abortion and other social issues. But Lawson sees value in a number two with different opinions; after all, it’s the same dynamic that characterized her relationship with Ruggerio as his majority leader last year.
“We all have to deal with different opinions and thoughts in the chamber, so I think it’s an asset,” she said.
And without major gun safety legislation on the horizon this year — at least, not yet — their policy differences might remain more veiled.

Tax the rich revisited 
Ciccone and Lawson share interest in a tax on top earners, though Ciccone draws the line at $1 million minimum. 
In 2025, proposed legislation sought to add a 3% surtax on the top 1% of earners, which would affect roughly 5,700 state tax filers who earned $625,000 or more. It failed to advance in either chamber.
“Those are middle class people, still saving,” Ciccone said of the lower threshold.
Lawson said she was open to either version of a tax on top earners, noting the need to generate more income as federal funding shrinks. A 3% tax on the top 1% of earners would bring in $190 million annually for the state, according to analysis coupled with the 2025 bill.
Shekarchi reverted to his signature phrase when asked about his interest in a wealth tax.
“It’s all on the table,” he said.
Massachusetts voters in 2022 approved a ballot measure adding a 4% surtax on income over $1 million. But the Commonwealth exempts taxes after death on estates up to $2 million — a higher threshold than the $1.8 million exemption limit in Rhode Island..
“We need to be comparable to what our neighbors are doing,” Shekarchi said.
McKee, who gets first crack at a fiscal 2027 spending plan, also signaled new openness to a tax on high earners in an interview with the Providence Journal.

Washington Bridge
While legislative leaders get final say in the state’s annual tax and spending plan, Shekarchi deferred to the executive branch on what’s next for the Washington Bridge.
Coming off what he considered a “successful” oversight hearing in November led by former U.S. Attorney Zachary Cunha, Shekarchi did not see additional action items for the legislature to take on.
“This is an executive function, and we’re waiting for the governor’s budget, we’re waiting for the transcript from the hearing, and we’re also waiting for some information to come from the [Rhode Island Department of Transportation (RIDOT)]” Shekarchi said.
Lawson, who travels the traffic-snarled span each day to and from work, said she was focused on restoring both the infrastructure and public faith in government.

RIPTA
The cash-strapped Rhode Island Public Transit Authority faces a projected deficit of nearly $15 million for fiscal 2027, despite lawmakers directing new revenue sources to the transit agency through gas taxes and the state highway maintenance account in 2025. Yet RIPTA was still forced to enact sweeping service cuts to two-thirds of its routes starting last fall. 
Shekarchi still sees room to “right-size” the agency, reducing frequency of low-ridership routes and overhead cost. The long-awaited efficiency study published in August also focused on slashing service to close the perennial agency budget gap.
Transit advocates have questioned the seemingly singular focus among lawmakers on cutting costs at RIPTA, while expenses at other behemoth state agencies, including RIDOT, swell.
Shekarchi acknowledged that other branches of government could benefit from some scrutiny of returns on investment. 
But, he continued, “We’re not a business, we’re not a corporation. We serve people.”

Lightning round Q & A
Will Sen. Frank Ciccone keep his federal firearms license? 
Yes. The Providence Democrat says he has “no interest” in giving up the license, and recently received a call from “someone looking for something,” although he hasn’t sold a gun since December 2024. 
Is Sen. Val Lawson reconsidering giving up her day job amid continued scrutiny of ethical conflicts?
No. The Senate President insists she is no different than any other member of the part-time legislature, many of whom also face personal and professional conflicts in certain bills.
Has House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi smoothed things over with Gov. Dan McKee?
It seems like it. Despite the governor refusing to sign the fiscal 2026 budget, prompting harsh words exchanged with legislative leaders, Shekarchi said he still has a “good working relationship” with the executive branch.
Will there be legislation related to the Brown University mass shooting?
Too soon to tell. House Majority Leader Christopher Blazejewski, who lives in the East Side neighborhood where the shooting occurred, said his family and the wider community will be “forever changed” by the tragedy.

(Photo by AnnMarie Hilton/Maine Morning Star) When Maine lawmakers return to Augusta in January, they will face an agenda shaped as much by federal policy shifts as by ongoing state issues held over from last session, including rising health care and energy costs, immigration enforcement, tribal sovereignty, and a justice system strained by chronic underfunding.
Hundreds of bills were carried over from the first of the two-year session of the 132nd Legislature. But since then, the future of several safety net programs that help Mainers with food, health care and utility costs have become increasingly uncertain due to federal policy changes: tens of thousands of Mainers are bracing for higher insurance premiums, electricity rates are slated to increase, and new work requirements go into place for federal food assistance programs. 
The Legislature will have to decide if and how the state can fill in funding gaps left by federal changes.
At the same time, lawmakers are expected to revisit contentious debates that stalled last year, including over data privacy protections, tribal sovereignty, and how far Maine should go in insulating local communities from federal immigration enforcement.
Many of the issues lawmakers will confront next year are not new, but advocates have told Maine Morning Star the stakes are higher now. In several policy areas, legislators will be forced to choose between incremental fixes and broader structural reforms, which could shape Maine’s economic and legal landscape for years to come.
Here’s a look at some of the major issues lawmakers will consider:
Health care
Approximately 60,000 Mainers are expecting to see health care costs skyrocket because of the pending expiration of enhanced premium tax credits, which subsidize the cost of marketplace health insurance for millions of Americans. That combined with federal changes to eligibility for MaineCare, the state’s Medicaid program that provides coverage for thousands of low-income families, health care will be a priority for the Legislature to tackle next session.
The increasing cost of MaineCare was the source of last year’s $118 million budget shortfall, which Democrats plugged with the two-year budget passed by the majority party in March.

While there are no specific bills carried over from last session to address additional health care funding gaps projected due to federal rollbacks, lawmakers can utilize placeholder bills, such as LD 378, titled “An Act to Strengthen Health Care in Maine,” as well as the supplemental budget to appropriate needed funds. 
The Legislature’s health insurance committee will take up at least two relevant bills  —  LD 910, which would increase transparency in health insurance reporting, and LD 961, which would remove some barriers for nurse practitioners to provide care — carried over from last session when lawmakers reconvene.
Immigration 
Gov. Janet Mills last month announced her intention to allow certain restrictions on local involvement in federal immigration enforcement to become law (though that won’t take effect until later in 2026). 
But that does not mean lawmakers won’t be continuing to debate how the state should intervene in President Donald Trump’s mass deportation agenda. 
The bill the governor is letting become law, LD 1971, places restrictions on enforcement activities absent formal agreements with federal authorities, which is currently the case for all local and state agencies in Maine. But lawmakers carried over into the next session a related bill LD 1259, which would explicitly prohibit state and local law enforcement agencies from entering into formal agreements of that sort. 
Lawmakers will also consider several new immigration-related bills, including proposals focused on protecting against erroneous detentions, preventing immigration enforcement in places like schools and hospitals, and clarifying language to ensure jails can refuse to detain people on civil immigration offenses on behalf of federal authorities. 
Read more about these bills here. 
Energy costs
As energy costs continue to rise, lawmakers across the political spectrum have said they are committed to finding ways to alleviate the pressure on Maine ratepayers. 
In late November, the Public Utilities Commission announced new electricity prices for 2026. Both Central Maine Power and Versant customers can expect to see their bills increase by an average of $13 to $17, according to an analysis by the Office of Public Advocate. 
Last session, legislators passed a law that is meant to lower the cost of net energy billing, a renewable energy credit program that receives a lot of blame for rising costs, though regulators have said the increases have more to do with the volatility of natural gas and other fossil fuel prices.
One idea that will be on the table in 2026 is an energy tax credit. There are two proposals — one from a Republican and one from a Democrat — seeking to use this as a mechanism to offset costs for Maine households. 
With one of the bills carried over from last session, Rep. Kilton Webb (D-Durham) is proposing new legislation that would create a $50 a month tax credit for qualifying low-income ratepayers.
Details are not yet available for another new bill, sponsored by Sen. Denise Tepler (D-Sagadahoc), titled: “An Act to Reduce Household Energy Costs and Increase Appliance Affordability in Response to Federal Cuts.”
Wabanaki rights 
The movement to return more sovereignty to the Wabanaki Nations is poised to continue in the upcoming legislative session with both sweeping and piecemeal proposals. 
The Penobscot Nation, Passamaquoddy Tribe, Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians and Mi’kmaq Nation — collectively known as the Wabanaki Nations — are treated differently than other federally recognized tribes, more akin to municipalities than sovereign nations because of a 1980 land settlement agreement. 
Wabanaki leaders reflect on gains as Legislature poised to revisit sovereignty proposals

Wabanaki leaders have said that their Tribes signed the Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act to get fair compensation for stolen lands, not to give up the level of sovereignty that has been interpreted by the state and courts to date. 
Two bills that the Legislature will contemplate next year are nearly identical to past proposals that were blocked either by Mills or through the Legislature’s opaque funding process.  
LD 785 is omnibus legislation that would implement the remaining recommendations of the 2019 state task force that studied the issue, while LD 395 focuses on just one of the recommendations, restoring the Wabanaki Nations’ access to beneficial federal laws. 
Among the many federal laws that do not apply to the Wabanaki Nations is one that offers federally recognized tribes the right to exclusively regulate and take in revenue from gambling on tribal lands.
Lawmakers earlier this year attempted to give the Wabanaki Nations exclusive rights to operate internet gaming in Maine and afford the Tribes more revenue from gambling at private casinos. The latter legislation is being carried over into next session, while the igaming bill was held by the governor, meaning Mills can either veto it within the first three days of session or allow it to become law without her signature.
Data privacy 
The Maine Legislature has debated how aggressive the state should be in protecting consumer privacy online for the past several years. But competing proposals — along with sizable behind-the-scenes influence from lobbyists — have left the state without a comprehensive data privacy law. 
When lawmakers return in January, the issue will again be in play. 
There remains stiff opposition from some lawmakers and local businesses to the stricter proposal, even though it’s been the favorite of the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee so far. 
This plan mirrors a law that took effect in Maryland in October, a deviation from the more than a dozen states that have adopted a model favored by industry groups. 
Some of the resistance is similar to that seen in Maryland, including concerns about untested language, but businesses are also worried about financial impacts on top of an already uncertain economic landscape, including President Donald Trump’s tariffs.
Indigent defense 
Despite a dire lack in funding for Maine’s public defender system and hundreds of indigent defendants waiting for their court-appointed attorneys, the Legislature last session failed to make up for a $13 million budget shortfall. The Maine Commission on Public Defense Services needs that money to continue to pay their rostered attorneys, who take up a bulk of indigent defense cases, past April. 
As Maine continues internet privacy debate, another state’s law could provide insight

Lawmakers on the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee were caught between two competing realities, co-chair Sen. Anne Carney (D-Cumberland) explained in September: “The need for [Public Defense Services] to have additional funding and the lack of a surplus of resources for the Legislature to appropriate.”
Several bills related to indigent defense, including some broader reforms that were carried over, will be taken up this coming session. These include LD 1941, which would reestablish parole, and LD 449, which proposes conditional discharge for certain defendants — reforms that advocates believe would help alleviate the backlog and the hundreds of Mainers that have routinely be held in jail awaiting representation
Waste
With the facility that takes more than half of Maine’s landfill waste expected to reach capacity in just a couple years, lawmakers have been trying to balance environmental concerns with the state’s growing trash problem. 
Last legislative session more than half a dozen bills were introduced to address relations between the Juniper Ridge Landfill and its Old Town neighbors, as well as the waste itself that ends up in the landfill. 
Lawmakers and advocates in October toured three waste facilities to see for themselves how the state is handling the roughly 1.8 million tons of waste generated each year. 
Much of the debate last session involved loopholes that permit out-of-state construction debris to be trucked into Maine. Casella, which operates Juniper Ridge, has argued it’s necessary to stabilize the wet sludge waste at the facility.
Legislative leaders approved an emergency proposal, LD 2070 from Rep. James Dill (D-Old Town),that would prohibit the state Department of Environmental Protection from issuing landfill expansion permits that would alter freshwater wetlands. 
This proposal comes after the state signaled its support for expanding Juniper Ridge, despite objections from environmental advocates, the local community and the Penobscot Nation. Environmental advocates argued against the expansion in court this summer.

(Photo by Marcus Ingram for the Virginia Mercury)When the Indiana state Senate recently rejected a mid-cycle partisan redistricting of its congressional delegation, it was not only a rebuke to President Donald J. Trump; it also upheld a norm that has guided American democracy for more than a century.
Since the early 1900s, states have almost never redrawn congressional maps outside the decennial census, except to comply with court orders or to make minor technical corrections. That restraint has served an important stabilizing function. 
History suggests that midcycle gerrymanders lead to greater division and polarization, and more volatility in the Congress. And the impact may hit closer to home, if Virginia voters uphold Democratic legislators’ current effort to reshape the state’s political maps.
 Earlier fights

America has experienced mid-decade redistricting battles before, including a failed attempt in Virginia’s legislature by GOP leaders in 2013 but they have largely been confined to the 19th century.Between 1870 and 1896, mapmaking became a weapon in a relentless partisan war. And the federal courts largely ignored review of these plans.
During this period, “partisan gerrymandering” was indistinguishable from “racial gerrymandering,” as Black voters were a monolithic Republican voting bloc targeted by Democrats, primarily in the South, which was rebuilding after losing the Civil War and facing scores of newly franchised voters who had previously been enslaved. Democrats in Alabama redrew congressional maps in the mid-1870s to pack nearly all Black Belt counties into a single district to reduce Republican seats.
Ill-fated GOP plot foreshadowed Democrats’ plans for 2026 redistricting redo

Ohio was the biggest culprit in the 19th century redistricting wars. It had the third-largest congressional delegation at the time behind New York and Pennsylvania. As control of the state’s General Assembly flipped between Republicans and Democrats between 1876 and 1892, partisans in the legislature redrew maps seven times, creating massive swings in the makeup of their congressional delegation, and influencing which party had the majority in the U.S. House.
Like today, the impetus for these state actions came from national leaders. In 1878, the Democratic Speaker of the House implored Ohio and Missouri to act to save their majority. The two states complied, flipping nine seats to the Democrats and preserving their slim majority in the House.
Because the U.S. House was smaller then (293 members in 1878 versus 435  today), small swings in congressional delegations had greater impact. And, like today, small party majorities in the House made partisan gerrymanders attractive options to gain an advantage or fight the opposition.
In 1888, for example, Republicans in Pennsylvania responded to Ohio’s efforts by carving 21 pro-Republican districts out of 28 statewide, just enough to move the House into GOP hands.
The era was marked by shifting majorities, rapidly redrawn maps, and sudden swings in the size and orientation of state delegations. There were fewer states, no “one person, one vote” standard, no independent commissions and virtually no judicial review. Redistricting was a political free-for-all. Party leaders gradually concluded that midcycle redistricting was creating too much chaos, and their numbers dramatically decreased after 1896.
For more than a century, we believed we had left this chaos behind.
 Back to the future: Why Texas matters

Apart from Texas in 2003 and Georgia in 2005, recent mid-cycle revisions have been rare and used mainly to correct errors or comply with court orders. 
The 2025 Texas mid-cycle gerrymander marks a return to this earlier era and has opened a new front in our partisan conflict. Conservative legislatures in Missouri and North Carolina quickly joined this Trump-supported effort to influence the mid-terms by passing new maps. 
Democrats felt they had no option and moved forward with their own plans. California voters have now authorized a new Democratically flavored map for 2026, and Virginia Democratic state legislators proclaim their desire to create a 10-1 Democratic congressional majority in a state where Republicans received 42.2% of the vote in the last gubernatorial election. New York and Illinois may soon follow, even if they wait until next year.  
States race to outmaneuver rivals, each pushing the envelope of partisan advantage. The redistricting process risks becoming a rolling, perpetual conflict rather than a once-a-decade recalibration.
 The Supreme Court’s retreat

The Supreme Court’s role is central to this shift. The  court, led by Chief Justice John Roberts, has been eroding  50 years of federal court redistricting oversight since landmark cases like Baker v. Carr (1962), which established the “one person, one vote” principle and forced states to draw districts of equal population size.  
In LULAC v. Perry (2005), the Court upheld the practice of mid-decade redistricting for partisan purposes.But its most significant decision was Rucho v. Common Cause (2019), where the Supreme Court held that federal courts should not review partisan gerrymanders, defining such disputes as “political questions.” And, in the recent Texas case, the majority ignored evidence that race was considered by the legislators and upheld the map as a “purely partisan” action — thereby shielding it from federal scrutiny.
Racial gerrymandering remains reviewable under Shaw v. Reno (1993), but the pending case of Louisiana v. Callais could restrict that avenue as well. The erosion of federal oversight returns primary authority to the states — just as in the 19th century.
 The gamble

History shows hyper-partisan maps can backfire. In the 1880s and 90s, parties would gain power in state legislatures and proceed to draw new maps with small margins for error. Missouri Democrats in 1892 engineered a 13–2 partisan advantage in its delegation — only to lose eight seats two years later when the national tides shifted and the Republican landslide brought GOP control of the U.S. House.
Texas may face similar risks. The state’s new map relies heavily on 2024 voting patterns. By 2026, an anti-Trump backlash coupled with demographic shifts — especially among Hispanic voters — could make several engineered “safe” seats unexpectedly competitive.
Barriers exist in other states as well. California has provided itself some protection against court challenges because its map enjoys the imprimatur of a constitutional amendment approved by the voters. 
Virginia legislators are trying to do the same but will need to convince voters to approve a constitutional amendment before new maps are adopted.  
Missouri’s plans are now threatened by a 300,000-signature petition drive that mayplace the GOP’s new maps directly before the public for an up-or-down vote. Expect court challenges to these maps to include arguments they are too late in the cycle to be implemented,  a claim that the Supreme Court has found appealing in the past.  
 Power in the states

As the U.S. Supreme Court withdraws from oversight, state laws and constitutions grow more significant. The problem is that every state has its own constitution, laws and precedents.  Today, eleven states already restrict mid-decade redistricting, including Colorado, where its Supreme Court struck down a 2003 Republican attempt to redraw congressional districts after the party gained control of the legislature.  Several other states permit challenges to partisan gerrymanders. 

In 2022, the Alaska Supreme Court invalidated two state senate districts as constitutional violations of equal protection. 
Michigan and Wisconsin courts have historically shown willingness to engage such claims. 
Oregon and New York constitutions explicitly prohibit map-drawing that favors or disfavors parties or incumbents.
Courts in New Mexico and Kentucky acknowledge a willingness to evaluate partisan-gerrymander claims, even as they have not yet overturned them.  
State supreme courts in North Carolina and Ohio struck down partisan gerrymanders, only to reverse themselves after political turnover on the bench.

Yet uniformity remains elusive. Courts in Kansas, Nevada, New Hampshire and North Carolina presently embrace the U.S. Supreme Court’s view that partisan gerrymanders are “political questions” better left to legislatures.  And the composition of state Supreme Courts can change dramatically, and with it, rulings on the constitutionality of partisan maps. This patchwork ensures that challenges will succeed in some states but not others, deepening an already troubling trend toward national division.
 A nation dividing itself

Texas did merely not redraw its congressional lines. It revived an old practice at precisely the moment when federal oversight is diminishing and partisan stakes are growing. The result is a redistricting system that increasingly resembles the volatile 19th-century environment — only now with a larger Congress, more diverse electorate, sophisticated data tools and far more at stake.
If this trend continues, redistricting will shift from a decennial process to a continuous political battlefield, intensifying division among the states and accelerating the geographic, political and cultural split already reshaping the nation.

(Photo illustration by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)As pennies vanish from the American landscape, many businesses are clamoring for federal guidance on how to handle cash transactions in a penniless world.
Should retailers round up or down? Should they round in favor of the customer? Or in favor of the business?
So far, calls for federal direction have gone unanswered. Some businesses are setting their own policies, but states are now beginning to act amid growing uncertainty.
While the question revolves around only a few cents per transaction, it does raise important consumer protection and legal questions for states to consider. Retailers must weigh threats of potential lawsuits, while policymakers worry about protecting the most vulnerable consumers who rely on cash for everyday purchases.
President Donald Trump in February moved to eliminate the penny from U.S. pocketbooks, citing the high cost of minting them — about 3.7 cents per penny. But even before the coin’s final production run last month, U.S. retailers and banks were reporting widespread penny shortages.
To provide clarity, lawmakers in New York have proposed legislation mirroring Canada’s rounding standard — up or down to the nearest five cents. And officials in Georgia and Utah have issued nonbinding guidance to businesses.
“States do not have the luxury of waiting for the federal government,” said Katherine Tschopp, senior associate at government relations firm MultiState.
Complicating the issue are the growing number of jurisdictions requiring businesses to accept cash — a move aimed at protecting vulnerable consumers who may not have access to credit cards or electronic payment systems.
In November, New York became the ninth state to add such a rule, according to tracking from MultiState. At least eight major cities also require businesses to accept cash.
A bipartisan group of federal lawmakers have proposed legislation in the U.S. House and Senate to require all cash transactions be rounded to the nearest five cents, but neither proposal has made it to a floor vote.
The record-breaking federal government shutdown and heated debate on health insurance subsidies have sidelined the penny discussion, Tschopp said. She thinks the federal government will likely determine a national rounding policy — eventually. But in the meantime, she expects more states to weigh in.
New York Democratic Assemblymember John T. McDonald III said he agreed with Trump’s move to phase out the costly production of the penny. But businesses are asking for some kind of guidance now, he said.
“In the absence of federal action, I think it’s important that the states act to provide clarity — clarity for everybody: clarity for the consumer, as well as the merchant and the state,” McDonald told Stateline.
Approaches to rounding
McDonald’s proposed legislation mirrors Canada’s rounding policy following the 2012 elimination of its one-cent coin. His bill calls for so-called symmetrical rounding of after-tax cash purchases to the nearest five-cent mark. Purchases ending with one, two, six or seven cents would be rounded down. And purchases ending in three, four, eight or nine cents would be rounded up.
So, a consumer would get no cash back from a $1.99 purchase. But a retailer would hand over a nickel to someone spending $1.97.
McDonald sits on the National Conference of State Legislature’s State and Local Taxation Task Force that has been examining the penny issue. That task force has recommended symmetrical rounding as the fairest method for merchants and consumers.
McDonald noted that the NCSL group reached a bipartisan consensus on the issue. And he said he’s found no opposition from New York businesses or consumer groups on his bill.
“In this day and age where we seem to have a lot of fractious conversations on other issues, it’d be nice to find something that actually we can all agree on,” he said. “And to have it start with the good old little penny would be a good spot.”
Last month, South Dakota Republican state Sen. Tim Reed urged state lawmakers to start communicating with agencies, retailers and the public over the issue.
A co-chair of the NCSL task force, he said businesses need guidance and consumers may need reassurance. While he acknowledged concerns about “strategic pricing” — in which retailers set prices to push rounding to their advantage — the group’s report characterized that as a “limited risk.”
“Everybody’s thinking, ‘Oh, I’ll get overcharged, or I’ll get undercharged,’” Reed said at an NCSL virtual event about the penny. He said it would be good for people to know that “really this is all going to kind of wash out in the end.”
New York Democratic state Sen. James Sanders Jr. said the cash acceptance law he sponsored in 2025 ensures people without access to smartphones or banking are not excluded from commerce. That law also says customers paying with cash cannot be charged more than other buyers.
“Otherwise, you absolutely have a two-tiered system,” he said, noting that cash is “a lifeline” for working families, older adults, immigrants and small businesses.
Sanders said he would prefer for retailers to round down to the nearest nickel on cash transactions to protect consumers.
“For the large corporations, this could be a difference of hundreds of thousands of dollars if they are steadily rounding up,” he said. While each rounding transaction represents a loss or gain of only a few cents, Sanders said, “multiply that by tens of thousands of people, and you’ve effectively raised the price of your product without any type of sanction.”
Sanders said he plans to introduce legislation on the matter soon, but added that he remains open to McDonald’s current proposal of symmetrical rounding. More than anything, he said, businesses desire some kind of guidance.
“We’re not trying to cheat business. We’re just trying not to be cheated by business,” he said. “The people I’ve been speaking to are honest souls, and they just want to know the right thing to do in a penniless society.”
A rapid change
The U.S. Mint in Philadelphia struck the last penny on Nov. 12, but pennies were already scarce at that time.
By mid-November, more than 100 of the government’s 165 coin distribution sites across the country were without pennies, according to the Retail Industry Leaders Association, which represents major chains including CVS, Target and 7-Eleven.
In a November survey of its members, that organization found six national chains had more than 1,000 stores that had no pennies.
The association said most of its survey respondents were rounding cash transactions to the benefit of customers — always down to the nearest five cents. While it’s fair for shoppers, it’s “costing businesses millions of dollars as small amounts add up across thousands of daily cash transactions.”
While states weigh the issue, the association is pushing for a federal answer.
“We are urging the federal government to quickly address the problem, to allow for uniform adjustments by retailers that operate in a multitude of states,” Austen Jensen, the organization’s senior executive vice president of public affairs, said in a statement to Stateline.
Other groups, including the American Bankers Association, have also pushed for federal action.
“They’re obviously concerned about it and wanting a federal fix,” said Christopher Phillips, a partner at law firm Holland & Knight. “The government fairly abruptly decided they weren’t going to mint any more pennies and these shortages of pennies spread fairly quickly across the country.”
For retailers, the problem is both practical and legal, said Phillips, who represents payment system companies and financial technology firms.
In many of the jurisdictions that require merchants to accept cash, the laws explicitly forbid charging cash customers more — and have a per-transaction fine for violations, raising the possibility of big fees. And Phillips said merchants could face class-action lawsuits for rounding policies in which plaintiffs argue they are charged more than advertised or face unfair or deceptive business practices.
Federal regulations also ban retailers from charging more for purchases made with food stamps, through the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, or SNAP. Cash rounding policies complicate that rule, as some customers would be charged less for certain cash purchases than those using SNAP cards.
“The unintended consequences of these administrative actions, and these laws and how they flow together to create real problems that were certainly never envisioned,” Phillips said.
So far, merchants have come up with their own policies.
Because of the penny shortage, the East Coast convenience store chain Sheetz asked customers to move to cashless payments or round up to support charitable causes. It even offered free beverages for those willing to cash in 100 pennies.
Kwik Trip, which operates convenience stores across the Midwest, in October announced its registers would automatically round down cash transactions to the nearest nickel in favor of customers.
But without a federal standard, the landscape is patchy, Phillips said. Rounding creates a winner and a loser in each cash transaction. Some companies have pushed to standardize their practice across the country, but others will only choose to round down if required.
“Others are like, ‘You know what? This is actual money for us,’” he said. “‘We’re not just going to give it up for the sake of convenience.’”

Maya Homan/Georgia RecorderA key program aimed at helping individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities gain access to home care may be getting a refresh in 2026.
Officials at Georgia’s Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities unveiled a series of proposals during a December board meeting aimed at restructuring the waiting list for a state-run Medicaid program that provides waivers to people with disabilities designed to keep them out of institutional settings. The waivers can be used to provide services like medical supplies, personal care assistants and emergency alert systems.
However, the proposals made to the board are just recommendations, and a timeline to move forward with the plan has not yet been set.
Georgia had over 7,800 people on a waiting list for waivers as of this past March, though the agency says not everyone who is on the list has an urgent need for services. Boosting state funding to provide services to more people has long been a perennial issue at the state Capitol, and there’s been a push in recent years to work toward ending the wait list entirely. 
Senate panel pushes for new money to support Georgians with disabilities, pay hike for caregivers

Members of an advisory council dedicated to addressing the issue say the first step to revamping the program will be to identify which applicants have the most urgent needs so their applications can be prioritized.
“When I hear on the street that we’ve got 7,000 people on a planning list, everybody panics,” said Bruce Lindemann, who serves as the chair of the state’s Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Advisory Council. “We need to understand, first, what comprises that planning list.”
Under a new proposal, Georgia’s existing waiting list would be restructured into a three-tiered system that distinguishes between those with urgent needs, those who are expected to need services in the next one to five years and those who may need services even further in the future. The council also recommended that the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities create a new type of waiver for individuals with disabilities who don’t currently qualify for the New Option Waiver or Comprehensive Support Waiver Program, and implement a new assessment tool to improve data collection.
“Our charge is to ensure Georgia’s planning list assessment process is fair, accurate and aligned with national best practices, while remaining workable for DBHDD staff,” said Rita Young, the executive director of Participant Directed Advocates of Georgia, a nonprofit that supports individuals and families who participate in the two waiver programs.
Georgia leaders are also taking inspiration from states like Louisiana and Pennsylvania, which already have systems in place to prioritize waiver services based on the urgency of the applicant’s need.
D’Arcy Robb, the executive director of the Georgia Council on Developmental Disabilities, expressed cautious optimism about the board’s recommendations.
“I think the key is really going to be the implementation,” she said. “It’s going to require an ongoing commitment from the state, and I think in order to be done well, DBHDD needs to continue having very serious input and shared decision-making power with people with disabilities, their families and with organizations.”
As the state grapples with the impact of Medicaid funding cuts under the federal budget reconciliation package, colloquially known as the “big, beautiful bill,” Robb said she hopes state leaders will ensure that Georgians with disabilities continue to have access to the services they need.
“The problem is that [the bill] makes such big cuts to Medicaid, states are going to have to make hard choices,” Robb said. “We want to make sure that our state leaders are aware of the many ways Medicaid touches the lives of people with [disabilities], and that those are not impacted.”",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_2122-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-02 05:11:41.309453

We talk about how aging, disability, grief, policy, public health, serious illness, long-term care, loneliness, stigma, silence, fear, culture, history, can impact the health of LGBTQ+ people.
We also discuss the dangers of the “single story” about the LGBTQ+ community and how it impacts the way this community is cared for, an idea drawn from a powerful talk by author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie.
Essentially, she explains, the single story creates stereotypes. And the problem with stereotypes is not that they are untrue, but that they are incomplete. They make one story become the only story. And it turns out, if we show a group of people as one thing over and over, they become only that one thing. Unfortunately, we do it all the time. Immigrants, people who are unhoused, people living with Medicaid and many more.

The class I teach takes stories and storytelling seriously. Their power in shaping how people think, feel and talk about LGBTQ+ people, and how to tell more complete stories and why it matters for creating a society and healthcare system where more people can actually thrive.
For their final exam, the students deliver a 5-minute talk challenging the single story around the LGBTQ+ community. Every semester, the stories literally take my breath away for their compassion, honesty, authenticity, creativity and humanity. This year, they were especially powerful.
Throughout the semester, 7 guest speakers come to talk with the class. We hear from a physician who is trans and taking care of patients on the East Coast; an assisted living manager caring for the some of the most vulnerable to fight loneliness, hopelessness and boredom among older adults; a researcher who studies cancer disparities among LGBTQ+ people; a grief counselor who specializes in the many ways grief impacts the LGBTQ+ community, especially disenfranchised grief, which is so common in this community; and a queer community historian that explains the role history has played in generating stigma, silence and fear.
Many of the students are queer. Many more are there because they love someone who is queer. Some are communication majors, but most of them are not. Attendance is so high and consistent, I don’t even need to take it.
Over the years, teaching this class has made me worry about the safety of my students and my own, because across the country, classes like this have been banned — or if not yet banned, targeted with demands that we be forced to stop teaching.
But do we really know what we won’t learn if these classes are banned?
Last month, our class had the final exam. One student told me that when her mom calls at the end of each week, this class is the only one she talks about with her — all the things she learned that week, like how the stress of living with chronic stigma takes up to 12 years off the life of LGBTQ+ people.
The student also told her mom about how a guest speaker described a grade school assignment. He was shown pictures of a dog, cat, tree, squirrel and told to circle the category that was not like the others. He circled the dog because the rest all could climb a tree. He was penalized in class for not choosing the tree. The guest speaker talked about how early these associations are taught and rewarded, and how quickly the conversations about why one is more right than the other becomes the single story.
The student also told me (and her mom) how she has fallen in love with writing for the first time. She said she appreciates how our course assignments break some of our common scripts in a way that gives people more space to answer questions and talk about their life.
Another student told me that this class is where she found “safety in a moment of chaos.” She said the class taught her “the importance of caring for others while also taking care of herself.” And that having this class for a few hours each week “gave her hope and made her believe in a better future.”
Another student told me it’s been the “best class she’s had all of college,” and that “she felt safe, heard and supported in every single class.”
One student brought a handwritten note to the final exam giving thanks for the semester, saying, “it was truly everything I needed and more.” After talking about disability for most of her assignments and final, after her father was in a horrific accident leaving him wheelchair-bound, she said she was leaving class inspired to do more.
Another student wrote after the class to say, it was “truly life-changing.”
I’m sharing their stories because this is what most professors want students to feel — safe, heard, seen, inspired, hopeful. Students don’t learn a specialized vocabulary in an LGBTQ+ course. We don’t have special books. Special slides. Students are not tested on queer facts or other queer things.
This class, like many LGBTQ+ classes, are about creating empathy, learning how to have better conversations, and ultimately, learning to take better care of each other.

A family huddled over the kitchen table, staring at their electric bill. Chalkboard signs in a coffee shop bemoaning Connecticut’s high energy costs. The incumbent Democratic governor promising to open new power plants, even if it means expanding natural gas.
As issues of affordability take center stage in this year’s midterm elections, Connecticut’s nagging struggle with high electricity bills is making its way to the top of early messaging in the state’s budding 2026 gubernatorial race.
Politicians and voters in Connecticut are no strangers to frustrations over their utility bills and the vexing efforts to lower them. For years, and across several election cycles, the state has ranked near the top in the nation for the highest average cost of electricity.
But with electricity prices nationally now rising faster than inflation, candidates in other states have begun to tackle the issue in ways that serve as a prelude to this year’s races.
In a handful of recent elections in New Jersey, Virginia and Georgia, for example, Democrats outperformed expectations by running on keeping utility rate hikes in check and raising warnings about the proliferation of power-guzzling AI data centers. The party’s earlier focus on adopting renewable, carbon-free power has given way to promoting the development of new nuclear reactors — and even natural gas — as a way of meeting rising demand without harming voters’ pocketbooks.

The shift in attention toward energy prices was evident at the 2025 national convention of state utility regulators in Seattle, according to Elin Swanson Katz, who previously led Connecticut’s Office of Consumer Counsel, which advocates on behalf of utility customers.
Katz, who now works as a consultant on energy issues, said the convention schedule was packed with panels discussing the trends that are driving up prices, as well as ways to maintain affordability while making investments in grid infrastructure and new sources of electricity.
“As someone who has spent my career largely as a consumer advocate and somebody who thinks about public engagement, it was a real sea change, something that I think we should have been talking about all along,” Katz said. “There’s no doubt, based on national polling, that consumers — customers — want affordable energy, but they also want investments in renewable so, I mean, there’s definitely tension on that.”
In April, a poll conducted by Ipsos and the consumer nonprofit PowerLines found that nearly three-quarters of Americans were concerned about rising energy costs, and nearly 60% said they felt their state governments were not doing enough to protect ratepayers.
Already, efforts have been made over the last year to address Connecticut’s energy costs. The results have been mixed.
In June, Gov. Ned Lamont — who is seeking a third term — signed legislation promising to save customers roughly $100 a year on their electric bills, mostly by borrowing money to offset portions of what’s known as the public benefits charge on customer bills.
Those savings were quickly dissipated, however, by a new rate hike for United Illuminating customers and the announcement of higher winter supply rates. 
The legislature’s efforts were also largely overshadowed by a clash between utility companies and their regulators at the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority that resulted in the agency’s leader, Marissa Gillett, stepping down in October. While Gillett had been hailed by some, including Lamont, as a champion of consumers, critics accused her of skirting laws to exert control over the agency — a charge that was largely upheld in court.
At the same time, President Donald Trump’s efforts to steer federal energy policy in the direction of more fossil fuels has upended long-term investments that states like Connecticut have already made in pursuing cleaner forms of electricity such as solar and wind.
Noah Kaufman, an economist at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, published a paper in November citing rising electric prices as an obstacle to Connecticut’s efforts to reduce carbon emissions. A lack of local fuel resources combined with high delivery costs and certain clean-energy programs all contributed to the state’s high cost of electricity, the paper found.
In an interview, Kaufman said candidates here may have to adjust their pitches to appeal to voters who are concerned about both costs and the climate.
“We have very ambitious decarbonization targets without an obvious plan for how to achieve them at this point,” Kaufman said. “Politicians may have to consider strategies that would have been off the table a few years ago — might not have seemed politically viable — because any sort of reforms are going to go up against constituencies that like the policies in place now.”

Recent elections elsewhere
Historically, electricity prices have tended to take a backseat to other pocketbook issues, such as taxes and gas prices, in political campaigns. That has changed as electricity prices have risen faster than inflation, on average, since 2022.
In New Jersey, one of two states that held gubernatorial elections in November, summer electric rates were up 22% compared to the previous year. 
“The No. 1, 2 and 3 issues in our race was Trump,” said Matthew Hale, an expert on New Jersey politics and professor at Seton Hall University. “But four, five and six were all affordability, and so energy was certainly a big deal,” he said. 
“Energy costs are something people see every single day. When they jump right in the middle of a campaign, it’s a big issue,” Hale said.
The winner of that race, Democrat Mikie Sherrill, promised to freeze electric rates during her first year in office, though experts as well as New Jersey’s regulated utility companies questioned her ability to do so. She also criticized the state’s grid operator, PJM Interconnection, for approving rate hikes as well as the Trump administration for scrapping federal support for solar panels and energy efficiency programs.
At the same time, Sherrill faced a barrage of attack ads from her opponent, Republican Jack Ciattarelli, that used selectively-edited footage of Sherrill appearing to say that voters should support renewable energy programs even if it costs them “an arm and a leg.” Sherrill was actually critiquing how other Democrats had spoken about such issues.
Hale said that Sherrill neutralized those attacks by talking about modernizing natural gas infrastructure and building new nuclear power reactors as part of her energy platform, in addition to her support for renewable energy.
“She didn’t lean into the environmentalists’ wing,” Hale said. “She just sort of said, ‘We need to do better.’ She didn’t back the idea that it was going to be nothing but renewables.”
In Virginia, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger released her own affordability plan that focused on developing more generation from offshore wind, solar panels and small modular reactors — in addition to energy efficiency programs — as a way to bring down bills.
Spanberger also warned that the proliferation of data centers in Virginia was pushing the state toward an “energy crisis.” Her plan called for data center owners to pay their share of the cost to build the new power plants and transmission lines needed to power the facilities.
The Republican in that race, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, said in interviews that Virginia’s data centers were “here to stay” and that she supported an “all-of-the-above” energy strategy that included older, dirtier forms of generation such as coal.
Both Spanberger and Sherrill won their respective states by healthy margins. 
The 2025 elections also saw Democrats in Georgia flip two seats on the state’s Public Service Commission, which regulates utility companies. The winning candidates in those races focused on recent price hikes and the need to transition away from fossil fuels.
Still, experts caution that elected officials generally have a limited ability to actually lower the price of electricity.
That’s because a large percentage of customers’ bills go to pay for things like the maintenance of the transmission and distribution system, which is also growing more expensive. In many states, including Connecticut and New Jersey, utilities purchase electricity from power plants, then sell that power to customers without any markup. While elected officials may appoint regulators to approve utility rates — in Connecticut, appointments to PURA are made by the governor — those regulators are typically expected to approve justifiable costs.
“Politicians make those decisions, and it’s going to affect things a little bit, but that’s not going to fundamentally fix the fact that Connecticut has really high energy prices,” said Erik Katovich, a professor of energy and resource economics at the University of Connecticut.
Katz, the former Connecticut consumer counsel, echoed that sentiment saying candidates such as Sherrill and Spanberger now face the tough task of formulating policies that will fulfill their promises to voters.
“I don’t think there’s any really fully developed policy in any of these states, because it’s really, really hard to do,” Katz said. “If there were simple answers we would have done it already. But, I do feel encouraged that so many smart, skilled, experienced professionals are now recognizing that affordability should be in the top two issues that we address around our electric system.”

What Connecticut candidates are saying
Since taking office seven years ago, Lamont has signed numerous climate-related measures, including a 2022 law that promised to eliminate greenhouse gases from the electricity supplied to Connecticut customers by 2040.
But with the cost of utility bills proving a perennial issue throughout his tenure, the centrist Democrat has been wary of pursuing a more immediate decarbonization agenda sought by many environmental advocates and those on the Left.
In a recent interview with the Connecticut Mirror, Lamont said that his is an “all-the-above” energy strategy that includes support for renewable such as solar and wind along with natural gas and the nuclear power supplied by the Millstone Nuclear Power Station in Waterford.
“In most cases, a lot of the renewables are also part of our long term solution to hold down costs,” Lamont said. “Natural gas — which I’ve been talking to our neighboring states and the White House about how it can replace some of the liquefied natural gas with more piped-in natural gas — that would be a lot less expensive and always on as well.”

Early last year, Lamont met with Trump administration officials in Washington, D.C., to discuss an expansion of pipelines that could deliver more natural gas into Connecticut and the rest of New England. In August, the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection signaled its intent to approve a pair of compressor stations in Brookfield, expanding the capacity of the existing Iroquois Pipeline.
And while Lamont was an early backer of efforts to grow New England’s offshore wind industry, his administration has opted against buying into any new projects with the states of Massachusetts and Rhode Island, citing the rising costs of wind power.
Now, the governor faces challenges from both sides of the aisle over the cost of electricity and his commitment to the climate.

On the Republican side, state Sen. Ryan Fazio of Greenwich and former New Britain Mayor Erin Stewart have both launched campaigns that zero in on the state’s high cost of electricity. 
(Betsy McCaughey, a former lieutenant governor of New York, is also reportedly mulling a run for governor but has yet to formally launch a campaign. Appearing on Newsmax in late December, she criticized offshore wind projects supported by Connecticut and other New England states.)
Fazio, who serves as the ranking Republican on the legislature’s Energy and Technology Committee, has been one of the leading voices among lawmakers in favor of eliminating — or at least sharply reducing — the public benefits charge that pays for things such as energy efficiency programs, financial aid and investments in renewable energy that have been mandated by state lawmakers.
Fazio also criticized the costs of some of the renewable investments supported by customers as “obscenely expensive.”
“I think the evidence is there that it’s important to Connecticut residents and voters who are becoming increasingly wise to the fact that it’s actually elected officials in the state government who have been inflating the cost of the public benefits charge and electricity rates in general,” Fazio said. 
During the 2025 legislative session, Fazio proposed shifting the cost of the public benefits charge — currently around $1 billion a year — onto the state’s budget. When that effort failed to gain traction, Fazio worked with Democratic leaders and Lamont’s office on a compromise measure, Senate Bill 4, that ultimately passed with bipartisan support. The bill authorized officials to borrow up to $250 million over two years to pay off some of the public benefits charge.
Moving forward, Fazio said lawmakers should examine each of the programs in the public benefits charge to determine whether they should remain a charge to customers, be covered in the state budget or be ended entirely. That would include making decisions over whether to provide public funding for certain programs, such as the low-income discount rate, that are intended to help some customers pay their bills.
“Should we have more of this program, less of this program? That’s, I think, a conversation for the appropriations process,” Fazio said. “On its face, it is not something you just shove in the electricity bill.”

Stewart’s campaign declined to make the candidate available for an interview on energy policy. In April, then-Mayor Stewart posted on X that she attended a signing ceremony for Trump’s executive order supporting the coal industry, where she said she met with Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and talked about the state’s “affordable energy future.” Connecticut’s last coal plant, Bridgeport Harbor Station, closed down in 2021 and was partially demolished last year.
In another social media post, Stewart also criticized the bipartisan effort to borrow money to reduce the public benefits charge as “fake relief” because that money would have to be paid back, with interest, by taxpayers. She also called for an end to the public benefits charge and an increase in energy supply, without going into details.
While Lamont supported the bonds included in S.B. 4, he expressed skepticism of proposals for the state to pick up more of the public benefits tab, saying it would merely move around costs without achieving savings.
“Ratepayers and taxpayers are the same people,” Lamont said. “What you’ve really got to do is generate more electricity that will reduce the great spikes … that’s what really drives the cost.”

Lamont is also facing a primary challenge from state Rep. Josh Elliott, D-Hamden, a self-described progressive who has said he wants to push Democrats to adopt more left-wing stances.
“The governor wants to be seen as progressive, so he wants the top line to be ‘historic investment in renewable energy,’ and then at his very next breath, he says ‘historic investment in natural gas,'” Elliott said.
If elected, Elliott said that he would seek to finance the cost of building solar and other renewable energy projects through state bonds that are paid back by taxpayers instead of being tacked onto customers’ electric bills. He also said he would take a tougher approach toward the development of data centers than either Lamont or Fazio — both of whom said they would support such projects if the developers agreed to pay their share of the cost to build the electric infrastructure needed to run them.
Elliott said any power plants built for data centers should have to run off of renewable electricity, not natural gas or petroleum. He also questioned the economic benefit of large data centers, noting that they tend to employ relatively few people outside of the construction workers it takes to build them. 
“What looks like a boon to our economy ends up being something that, over the long run, is a really bad decision,” Elliott said.
Lori Brown, executive director of the Connecticut League of Conservation Voters, criticized both Lamont and Republicans for embracing natural gas, which she pointed out is subject to volatile price spikes that can increase the cost of energy, particularly in the winter.
“In Connecticut, the narrative is just being driven as if clean energy is the reason for all the woes in in electric bills,” Brown said. “That’s just such a false narrative.”
Additionally, Brown and other environmental advocates argue that investing in clean energy helps avoid other long-term costs associated with climate change, such as damage from storms and health care costs for people with respiratory illnesses.
Both CTLCV and the Connecticut chapter of the Sierra Club endorsed Lamont during each of his previous two runs for governor. The split over the issue of gas pipeline expansions, however, could push those groups to withhold their endorsements or consider backing Elliott in the primary.
Steve Lewis, the chair of the Connecticut Sierra Club’s political committee, said the group has yet to meet to discuss endorsements but said the pipeline issue is “something we need to consider very seriously.”
In response, Lamont pointed to his administration’s support for solar and wind projects, as well as efforts to improve energy efficiency. He added that any projects to expand pipeline capacity would be subject to the “highest environmental standards,” and compared against other energy resources to determine which have the lowest costs. 
“You’re not serious about affordability if you’re not serious about an all-the-above strategy,” Lamont said.

Federal impact
In addition to their Connecticut-specific pitches, each of the the candidates for governor must also navigate the seismic — and at times unpredictable — shifts in federal energy policy being introduced by the Trump administration.
In October, the Trump administration ordered a sudden halt to work on a massive offshore wind farm, Revolution Wind, off the coast of Rhode Island. At the time, the project was nearly 80% completed and employed more than 100 workers at the State Pier in New London.
The move drew swift criticism from Lamont and other proponents of offshore wind, who predicted that the loss of Revolution Wind would increase the risk of blackouts while pushing additional supply costs onto electric customers. Eventually, a lawsuit by the project’s developer succeeded in getting work to resume.
Then, three days before Christmas, the Trump administration again ordered a pause for Revolution Wind and four other offshore wind projects under development.
Even Republicans such as Fazio and Stewart expressed some unease over Trump’s intervention in Revolution Wind, despite their criticisms of wind power.
“To be that far along in the process and then just pull a plug on something just to prove a point was pretty, pretty foolish,” Stewart said in an interview with CT Mirror in December, prior to the administration’s second effort to halt the project.
Fazio has criticized the cost of the power purchase agreement Connecticut entered into with Revolution Wind’s developers, which he said is likely to result in additional charges on customers’ monthly electric bills. 
“On the other end, you know, the project is down the path,” Fazio said. “There’s a tradeoff there and I hope that the concerns that the federal government has, that the state and feds can communicate about [them] and work [them] out.”
Trump has also complicated ongoing efforts in Connecticut to utilize federal money to spur investments in climate-friendly programs. As part of a wide-ranging tax and spending bill passed last year, the federal government began phasing out tax incentives and other subsidies for electric vehicles, solar panels and energy efficiency upgrades that had been a centerpiece of President Joe Biden’s energy policy.
“It’s huge,” said Kaufman, the Columbia professor. “The whole premise of [Biden’s] Inflation Reduction Act and the subsidies for clean energy within that law was that the federal government was going to pick up the tab for a lot of investments in clean energy, or energy efficiency, or conservation actions.”
While the Trump administration and Congress have continued to support some investments in low- and zero-emission technologies, particularly nuclear, Kaufman said the changes in federal policy will generally force state officials to choose between picking up the cost of clean energy programs or discontinuing them.
“To keep moving forward, that means more of those costs are going to going to have to be incurred by Connecticut ratepayers and residents,” he added. “That’s a big deal… we’re just in a very different situation here than we were a few years ago.”
In Connecticut, Kaufman said officials could also look to trim some of the costs of clean energy programs — such as subsidies for rooftop solar or tradable credits for renewable energy — without imperiling the broader public push to adopt those technologies.
Last February, Trump announced new tariffs on Canadian energy imports, sparking confusion as to whether they would apply to electricity crossing the U.S.-Canadian border on transmission lines. New England imports about 11% of its electricity from Canada. 
A spokesperson for the regional grid operator, ISO New England, said in an email that the federal government has yet to levy tariffs on those imports, and that the additional duties announced by the administration are not believed to apply to electricity.
Meanwhile, the president’s promises to lower electricity costs by keeping open aging coal power plants is unlikely to have much of an impact in New England, where the only operating coal plant shut down in September.

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)The recent war of words between a prominent local Jewish leader and U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) over Israel’s prosecution of the war in Gaza is a reminder of how volatile the issue has become in American politics.
The punching and counter-punching between Van Hollen, who has become a leading congressional critic of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and Ron Halber, CEO of the Jewish Community Relations Council (JCRC) of Greater Washington, brings the controversy home.
But this was hardly the only reminder that the Israel-Gaza war is a potent political issue in American politics – or that it is likely to become a factor in multiple Maryland elections in 2026 and beyond.
Several developments this year, large and small, abroad and at home, have brought the conflict in Gaza and its political fallout into sharp relief, with untold ramifications for state politics. These include:

The election of Zohran Mamdani as mayor of New York;
A decision by the JCRC to bestow its inaugural Community Champion Award on a leading candidate for Montgomery County executive;
A vote by the University of Maryland student government – on Yom Kippur, the holiest day on the Jewish calendar – calling on the university to divest from companies and institutions with ties to Israel’s military;
A Jewish state senator suggesting a fellow Jewish Democrat hated Jews because he was advocating against government funding for an entity that seeks to build business partnerships between Maryland and Israel;
Ongoing criticism of Van Hollen by certain Maryland Jewish leaders;
The Trump administration negotiating a tenuous ceasefire in Gaza;
The deadly attack on Australian Jews celebrating Hanukkah at a beach resort

War of words over Israel heats up between Van Hollen and Halber

What it all adds up to, as a determinative political issue for 2026, is hard to say. But it’s hard to ignore the idea that the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, and Americans’ reaction to it, could be very impactful in the midterm elections, even in Maryland.
Over the past six months, Maryland Matters interviewed close to 20 people about how Israel and Gaza could influence the 2026 elections here – elected officials and political strategists, civic and religious leaders, activists and academics. Pointedly, only a few agreed to be interviewed for the record – though a handful said they would consider putting some of their remarks on the record eventually.
The brutal Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attacks on Israel, which killed at least 1,200 people, and the political violence and humanitarian catastrophe that has followed, resulting in a reported 70,000 Palestinian deaths, has created a pivot point in American politics.
But in a nation that has been pro-Israel for so long, no one can really say what we’re pivoting to. Multiple polls show public opinion shifting, on U.S. support for Israel, on Palestinian rights and on a host of adjacent issues.
This has caused a reckoning for Democrats and Republicans, and for Jewish voters themselves – and has revealed deep fissures within these and other segments of the electorate. In heavily blue Maryland, the impact of the war on Democratic voters may matter the most.
“In the Democratic Party, I think it’s going to be part of the conversation and part of the evaluation process of candidates,” said former Chevy Chase Town Councilmember Joel Rubin, who is also a former Obama administration official and one-time foreign policy adviser to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. He writes frequently about Middle East affairs and Jewish-American politics.
Beyond federal elections
In congressional elections, foreign policy will of course be a topic of debate. But even in state and local elections next year, the crisis in the Middle East may carry an emotional wallop – and could help candidates distinguish themselves from one another. We saw that in the recent election for mayor of New York City.
In the year since President Donald Trump was reelected, Democrats have been cleaved by several divides – ideological and generational and tactical – even with their victories in November’s off-year elections. But it’s also apparent that the conflict in Gaza is another source of division and controversy among Democrats, every bit as important as the other internal debates.










In the Democratic Party, I think it’s going to be part of the conversation and part of the evaluation process of candidates.


– Former Chevy Chase Town Councilmember Joel Rubin, a former Obama administration official who writes frequently about Middle East affairs and Jewish-American politics.


“The U.S.-Israel relationship is definitely an issue that Democratic candidates use to differentiate themselves from other candidates,” said Tali deGroot, vice president of political and digital strategy at J Street, a liberal Jewish organization seeking a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine.
In some ways, at least among Democrats, the divide over Israel and Gaza has become a stand-in for other issues, or is being used as short-hand for voters to evaluate and discuss candidates’ overall perspectives.
“I think a lot of voters would like to see politicians have moral clarity on this issue,” deGroot said.
Rubin calls the debate part of a “values platform,” especially for progressive Democrats. And former state Del. Saqib Ali (D-Montgomery), who has been pressing Maryland Democrats for years to stake out pro-Palestinian positions and to criticize the current Israeli regime, said, “To me, it’s kind of a litmus test: What are your human rights values?”
But one voter’s idea of moral clarity on the Israel-Palestine divide is another’s misguided prejudice, and any statement on the conflict carries risks of misinterpretation and political attack. The world is full of social media warriors, and their weapons are especially sharp when discussing Israel and Gaza. There are broader issues of antisemitism and Islamophobia at work that transcend state and local politics.
Still, Gaza will resonate in Maryland next year.
Most obviously, it will be a factor in the congressional 5th District, if the dean of the Maryland delegation, Rep. Steny Hoyer (D), decides to retire in 2026 at the age of 87.
State, federal lawmakers vow to fight antisemitism at Rockville legislative event

An open-seat race should attract several Democratic contenders, and there will be a range of opinions on Israel and Gaza – some genuine, others pure political calculations. In the past two election cycles alone, a super PAC affiliated with the pro-Israel political powerhouse American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), the United Democracy Project (UDP), has dropped more than $8 million into open congressional races in Maryland, according to Open Secrets, a website that tracks money in politics. That included $4.2 million to defeat ex-Rep. Donna Edwards (D) in the 2022 Democratic primary that now-Rep. Glenn Ivey (D-4th) won; and another $4.2 million on behalf of now-Rep. Sarah Elfreth (D-3rd) last year.
UDP did not respond to a request for comment this fall about its 2026 strategy, but it seems inconceivable that the PAC wouldn’t play in a race to replace Hoyer, either to aid a strong pro-Israel Democrat or to oppose a candidate that AIPAC deems insufficiently supportive. Hoyer has been a huge backer of Israel through his 44-year congressional career; one of the longshot Democrats seeking to unseat him, Harry Jarin, who is Jewish, has blasted the incumbent for his steadfast support of Netanyahu – suggesting the congressman’s stance is out of touch with most Democrats, especially younger voters.
Beyond federal races, there are other ways Gaza and Israel will come up next year. In state elections, and in Montgomery County, there could be questions about annual government contributions to the Maryland Israel Development Center, a public-private partnership that works to forge business ties between the state and Israel.
This year, the state government invested $225,000 in the MIDC, compared to $275,000 in recent fiscal years. Those allocations are set directly by the Maryland Department of Commerce, not by the governor or the legislature, but the executive or legislature could try to end that arrangement. The Montgomery County government set aside $47,000 for the center this year, as the Montgomery Perspective website first reported.
Although attempts in the legislature to strip the funding have so far gone nowhere, conversations about keeping that allocation intact can get heated. In November, when Montgomery County’s legislative delegation held an online hearing about priorities for the 2026 General Assembly session, Nathan Feldman, a former member of the county’s Democratic central committee, urged lawmakers to strip out the MIDC funding.
“The Jew-hate fest continues,” said Sen. Ben Kramer (D), the chair of the county’s Senate delegation, just before Feldman spoke.
Feldman is Jewish.
Fair game for any candidate
Throughout the state, even if the offices they are seeking have absolutely nothing to do with foreign policy, candidates may be asked about where they stand on Israel and Gaza and related issues – the vibey, morality questions that Rubin, deGroot, Ali and others who were interviewed for this article anticipate.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The issue will almost certainly be a factor in the county executive race in Montgomery County, where more than 40% of Maryland’s Jews live. Montgomery County voters are different from those in the rest of the state, given the county’s proximity to Washington, D.C., and their overall fixation on the federal government.
Already, County Councilmember Will Jawando, one of the three leading contenders in the Democratic primary for county executive, has expressed some trepidation about the MIDC funding. In a statement he provided to Montgomery Perspective in late September, he said he wanted to find out if the money is being used to develop weapons, calling continued financial support “a non-starter” if that turns out to be the case.
Earlier this year, Halber’s organization, one of the most prominent Jewish organizations in the Washington region, announced it was bestowing its inaugural Community Champion Award on Montgomery County Councilmember Andrew Friedson (D), a leading candidate for county executive next year. Although the JCRC does not endorse candidates for office or operate a political action committee, the award effectively felt like an attempt by the group to put its finger on the scale in the election.
“Since the day he took office, Councilmember Friedson has been a stalwart supporter of the Jewish community — from delivering much-needed security funding for synagogues and other Jewish community institutions to standing up against antisemitism,” Bob Budoff, president of the JCRC Board of Directors, said in a statement. “The Community Champion Award reflects Councilmember Friedson’s commitment to Jewish children and families and making Montgomery County a better place for everybody. We look forward to partnering with him for years to come.”
Coincidentally and tragically, the May 21 award ceremony, at a temple in Washington, D.C., took place on the same evening two Israeli embassy workers were gunned down in front of a Jewish museum across town.
Moments after those murders, Friedson and his two principal opponents for the Democratic nomination, Jawando and Councilmember Evan Glass, put out statements condemning the violence and the antisemitism that allegedly motivated the alleged attack.
Jewish voters are hardly a monolith in Montgomery County (or anywhere else). Like all county voters, Jewish voters in Maryland’s most populous county are divided by geography, age, overall ideology and income level – and that surely comes into play with their views on Israel.
Competing Oct. 7 events pass without incident on University of Maryland campus

And most Montgomery voters will still be swayed by the candidates’ positions on education, housing, transportation, public safety, economic development and taxes next year. But it doesn’t mean the Middle East won’t carry some import.
Which brings us back to Van Hollen, a giant figure in Montgomery County politics, with a 35-year record of electoral success.
Van Hollen has surprised and disappointed several of his allies by criticizing the Israeli government so vociferously for its military strikes in Gaza – even as he’s heartened others. He along, with Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.) and Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-8th), say they want to curtail some funding for the Israeli military.
DeGroot, of J Street, hailed Van Hollen’s “strong moral leadership” on Gaza. Ali said Van Hollen’s stance epitomizes the evolution of public opinion among Democratic leaders and voters – and compared the rapid change of opinion on Israel to the public’s quick turnaround on supporting gay marriage several years ago.
“I used to feel like it was a stretch to convince [elected officials] to be on my side,” he said.
In private conversations over the past few months, several friends and admirers of Van Hollen’s have fretted that his public criticism of Israel could have consequences if he seeks reelection in 2028. In a withering op-ed in The Baltimore Sun this fall, former state Sen. Bobby Zirkin (D-Baltimore County) blasted Van Hollen for his criticism of Israel and for endorsing Mamdani in New York, and he accused them both of spreading Hamas propaganda.
Some Jewish allies have quietly suggested that Van Hollen’s political survival will be something of a reclamation project – or they express hope that passions over Israel and Gaza will have cooled by 2028.
Considering the progression of voters’ opinions on Israel, this seems like an antiquated view, and also a premature one: The 2026 election cycle is going to have more twists and turns than anyone can anticipate, and Israel and Gaza will be part of the political narrative. 2028 is a lifetime away.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/UMD-SJP-10-7-2024-1024x639.jpg,,,2026-01-02 04:57:28.620574

(Eric Thomas)Most coverage of the Kansas City Chiefs’ new stadium on the Kansas side of the state line has sensibly focused on either the competition between Kansas and Missouri or the related financing of the stadium with public funds. Those concerns matter most politically and fiscally. 
The transition from an outdoor venue at Arrowhead Stadium to a domed stadium has attracted less attention. When people have written about the dome of it all, they have spotlighted the likelihood that a Super Bowl might come to Kansas City. 
After all, cold-weather cities risk brutal game conditions during February for the NFL’s marquee game. Recent Super Bowl host cities illustrate the point: New Orleans, Las Vegas, Arizona, Los Angeles, Tampa, Miami and Atlanta. The most recent cold-weather city? Minneapolis with its U.S. Bank Stadium hosted in 2018. 
But the Super Bowl is just one game. How will a domed stadium change games at the most vital stadium in our state and region? 
Let’s stick with the weather for a moment. The NFL preseason begins in early August, meaning that players and fans can swelter, with temperatures routinely reaching the mid-90s. Expect that to only get worse with climate change. A dome would help (if only through air conditioning that further imperils the environment).
Hermetically, sealed stadiums offer more certainty of a pleasant game. But that doesn’t mean that they deliver dramatic contests. 
Consider the Chiefs’ frigid playoff win against the Miami Dolphins in 2024. Temperatures dipped so low that quarterback Patrick Mahomes shattered his helmet on a run near the goal line, producing an iconic photo and a memorable game. 
The cost of gathering people on such a tundra became clear in the following weeks, when local hospitals reported that they performed several amputation surgeries on frostbitten fans. You could use that example to argue for a domed stadium, but the game could have been postponed or relocated. 
The Chiefs’ new stadium, scheduled to open in 2031, will certainly be the most important in the heartland. The next closest major domed stadium is in St. Louis: The Dome at America’s Center. Ask St. Louis locals, and they will tell you how the dome has descended into disrepair and languor since the Rams left for California. The venue’s schedule of upcoming events is cautionary and lackluster indeed: a Monster Jam truck show this month followed by truck, RV and auto shows. 
The next closest domed stadiums are hefty drives: the retractable-roof stadium of the Dallas Cowboys, plus domes in Indianapolis and Minneapolis. With each of those locations seven hours away by car, the new Chiefs stadium should become a destination for mega-concerts and more. 
Let’s hope that the best parts of Arrowhead Stadium aren’t lost with the move to a dome. Many of my best Chiefs memories come from the tailgate culture of the parking lot — a mix of smoked meats, light beers and elaborately retrofitted school buses. I never thought I would ask for a new sprawling parking lot, especially one that cozies up to the stadium. But the concrete savannah of Arrowhead makes games more fun. 
Following the announcement of the Chiefs’ move to Kansas, I photographed the team’s loss to the Denver Broncos at field level for Getty Images. Even with a crowd diminished by the team’s losing record, the stadium was still loud. That volume is another Arrowhead signature. 
If you are wondering about Kansas City’s status as the loudest place to play, a dome might tilt things a bit. Perhaps the building plans will call for noise reduction to ensure that trapped crowd sound in the dome doesn’t become uncomfortable. Or perhaps the new dome will be even louder than the Chiefs’ record for an outdoor stadium: 142.2 decibels, according to the Guinness Book of World Records. 
As Kansans, our central worry in building should be longevity — because few stadiums are as gray and miserable as old domes. If you visited the Hoosier Dome in Indianapolis before it was pushed aside for the Colts’ new home, you know what I mean. The echo of the music and announcements could make you queasy, not to mention the intense air pressure that would essentially suck you into the revolving doors. 
An aging dome is the worst kind — it sends a team looking for a new stadium in a new city. 
Can the Chiefs build a dome that lasts as long as Arrowhead? The Caesars Superdome in New Orleans suggests so. Built in 1975, the stadium hosted the most recent Super Bowl. (Although, as someone who attended the game, I can testify that the Superdome shows its age, especially in bathroom concourse areas.)
If you are already nostalgic for Arrowhead, there’s good news. The move won’t come for a handful of seasons, so plan your trip to Missouri. 
And be sure to pack the right wardrobe for both the tailgate and the game.

The Rebels move to the semifinal round of the College Football Playoff, where they’ll face Miami in the Fiesta Bowl next Thursday in Tempe, Arizona.","NEW ORLEANS — For much of Thursday night’s Sugar Bowl showdown with Georgia, it looked as if Ole Miss’ dream football season was careening toward a rude wake-up call.
Luckily for Rebel fans, Trinidad Chambliss found the snooze button.
The Ole Miss quarterback put together a performance for the ages, passing for 362 yards and two touchdowns to rally his team to a stunning 39-34 win over the SEC Champion Bulldogs.

With the win, the Rebels (13-1) punched their ticket to the semifinal round of the College Football Playoff, where they’ll face Miami in the Fiesta Bowl next Thursday in Tempe, Arizona.
And if that round goes anything like the second one did, the Magnolia State may have to invest in more respirators.
Down 9 points at the half, the Rebels scored back-to-back touchdowns to open the fourth quarter and held off a fierce Georgia rally.
Chambliss was the star — the senior passed for 362 yards and two touchdowns — but there were no shortages of heroic performances.
Despite coming in as a six-point underdog Ole Miss out-gained Georgia 473 yards to 343, and won despite several bad breaks.

The Rebels settled for field goals on two of their first three possessions in the first quarter, taking an early 6-0 lead.
Georgia’s splendid quarterback Gunner Stockton responded with scoring runs to cap back-to-back 75-yard touchdown drives and put Georgia ahead 14-12.
Ole Miss was driving to take the lead back before the halftime break, but Georgia defender Daylen Everette scooped up a rare fumble from Ole Miss tailback Kewan Lacy and raced 47 yards to extend the Georgia lead to 21-12.

“We definitely didn’t play our cleanest football in the first half on either side of the ball,” Ole Miss coach Pete Golding said. “I kind of challenged them at halftime and said, you know, look, we were up nine on these guys going into the fourth quarter last time. Let’s play 30 minutes of football and out-physical them and execute. They just responded like they have all year.”
The Rebels traded a touchdown — a fumble-redeeming seven-yard bruising run for Lacy — for a Georgia field goal in the third quarter to trim the Bulldogs’ lead to 24-19.

That’s when the real fun started.
Lacy’s second touchdown came on a five-yard run and put Ole Miss ahead 27-24 with 11:29 to go.
Georgia coach Kirby Smart rolled the dice on the Bulldogs’ ensuing possession, opting to try to convert a 4th-and-2 situation at the Georgia 33-yard line.
Stockton rolled to his right looking for a receiver downfield, but didn’t see Ole Miss defender Suntarine Perkins coming from his blind side. Perkins drilled Stockton for a sack, forcing a fumble which he recovered at the Bulldogs’ 23-yard line.

“We knew that was going to be a big play in the game,” Ole Miss defensive MVP Will Echoles said. “I’m not going to say I was surprised, but Perkins made a great play.”
The turnover set Ole Miss up with a short field, and Chambliss cashed it in two plays later with a 13-yard touchdown pass to Harrison Wallace to put Ole Miss ahead 34-24 with nine minutes left.
But the Bulldogs had a response of their own: a seven-play, 75-yard touchdown drive that trimmed the Ole Miss lead down to three, at 34-31 with 7:03 to go. They tied the game with 56 seconds left on a 24-yard Peyton Woodring field goal.
Luckily, Chambliss had a little magic left in his back pocket.

Facing a third-and-five at his own 30, the senior found receiver De’Zhaun Stribling streaking down the home sideline for a 40-yard completion that gave the Rebels a new set of downs at the Georgia 30.
Two plays later, Ole Miss’ splendid kicker Lucas Carniero drilled a 47-yard field goal to regain the lead, 37-34, with just six seconds left.
Georgia tried a trick play on the ensuing kickoff and lateraled the ball out of bounds on their own goal-line, giving Ole Miss two points for a safety and extending the lead to 39-34.

Georgia got the ball back on an onside kick, but a final play that featured 11 laterals ended with a 12-yard loss and Ole Miss storming the field.
It was a strange, almost surreal ending to a marvelously competitive game.
“It was an incredible college football game,” Smart said. “It’s what the college football playoff was built for, to have battles like that.”

(Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission)In Florida, the environmental beat during 2025 featured land purchases and development rights, which tied in to immigration efforts, plus the first bear hunt in a decade and a big electric utility rate increase. 
Bear hunt reopens
Fifty-two black bears were “harvested” during the 2025 Florida black bear hunt, the first of its kind in a decade, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission announced this week.
Members of the FWC  agreed earlier this year to allow hunters to kill 172 black bears within four “bear hunting zones” — 68 in the East Panhandle; 31 in the North; 18 in Central Florida; and 55 in a South hunting area.
Bear Warriors United tried unsuccessfully to shut down the 23-day hunt, arguing that the FWC relied on outdated data and that the hunt was politically motivated; agency staff had not initially recommended a hunt during a December 2024 presentation about its Florida Black Bear Management Plan.
But Leon County Circuit Judge Angela Dempsey denied the organization’s request for an injunction.

Hunters were allowed to kill bears at game feeding stations, using food to bait the animals. And in 2027 hunters will be allowed use to use dogs to assist them in the hunt.
The bear population in Florida is estimated at around 4,050. The 2025 hunt was the first since 2015, when the state shut down that hunt at the end of its second day after nearly 300 bears had been killed.
Legislature bans building in state parks
In 2024, the DeSantis administration proposed building lodges, pickleball courts, golf courses, and other facilities to state parks. In 2025, he signed a bill to outlaw doing any such things in the parks. 
To block another golf course debacle, Florida lawmakers try protecting state parks

What came in between those two events was widespread, bipartisan pushback and protest against the idea of building inside of the state’s natural destinations. 
Earlier this year, lawmakers unanimously supported the State Park Preservation Act. Rep. Peggy Gossett-Seidman, a Republican from Highland Beach, said she received more than 1,500 emails from members of the public following the initial development plan. 
The law now requires more transparent notification of meetings; in 2024, the state tried to quietly advance the development proposals. Originally, the state gave the public six days’ warning before simultaneous meetings across the state to discuss the proposals. Those meetings were rescheduled amid widespread public concern.
The 2024 proposal was one of the Phoenix’s Top 10 political developments of that year. 
Although the DeSantis administration had pushed for development, the governor claimed — after the public pushback — that he’d never seen the proposal. However, DeSantis’ public schedule showed that earlier that year he’d met with the organization involved in the plans. 
The state employee who leaked the proposal was fired. 
In 2011, former Gov. Rick Scott had attempted to put golf courses in state parks, but after pushback then, too, it was scrapped.

Guana River land swap
It started out quietly but opposition grew quickly and got loud.
The Upland LLC in May pitched the idea of a land swap in an application to the Acquisition and Restoration Council (ARC), a state panel that, among other things, evaluates, selects, and ranks state land acquisition projects and evaluates proposed uses of state-owned conservation land.
The state would exchange roughly 600 acres in the Guana River Wildlife Management Area in St. Johns County to the developer. In return, the state would get more than 3,000 acres of land across four parcels scattered across Lafayette, Volusia, Osceola, and St. Johns counties.
Horses riding on trails in Guana River WMA via FWC
The state parcel, managed by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, includes a pedestrian trail and is accessible to the public for waterfowl hunting, fishing, paddling, and wildlife viewing. It contains flatwoods, salt and freshwater marshes, wet flatwoods, wet and dry hammock, and scrub. Threatened gopher tortoises and Eastern indigo snakes inhabit the area, according to the application. 
The land swap, agreed to by the FWC, was quickly included on the May 21 ARC meeting agenda. That gave the public just one week’s notice to oppose the proposal.
But it was enough.
Conservation and environmental groups swung into action and St. Johns County residents who opposed the deal circulated a petition. The proposal transcended local politics though, with state and even national leaders coming out against it.
“Guana Preserve and its beauty, familiarity and serenity is woven into the fabric of our communities and is, indeed, a treasure in northeast Florida. To allow — even enable — this land grab to occur is outrageous and completely contrary to what our community desires. Elected and appointed leaders should vote against this development wolf in sheep’s clothing and preserve this extraordinary natural bounty,” President Donald Trump’s Chief of Staff Susie Wiles told The Tributary. 
Florida Republican U.S. and gubernatorial hopeful Byron Donalds posted on X, “I stand with the residents of St. Johns County: Guana Preserve is NOT for sale.”

One day before the ARC meeting, Upland pulled its proposal from the agenda.
Gov. Ron DeSantis denied any personal role in the proposed land swap.
FPL rate increases
The public community came in high in February, asking for a near-$10 billion rate increase for its customers over the next four years. Critics argue that Florida Power & Light also settled high, getting approval in November from Public Service Commission members to increase rates by about $6.9 billion.
Opponents claim it’s the largest utility rate hike in U.S. history.
FPL is the state’s largest utility with approximately six million accounts and about 12 million customers. FPL’s parent company, NextEra Energy, is Florida-based and publicly traded. 
The five-member PSC holds regulatory authority over rates charged for electric, natural gas, telephone, water, and wastewater. The governor appoints PSC members from a list of candidates recommended by the Public Service Commission Nominating Council.
The months-long debate over the proposed rate hikes could impel the Legislature to change how the PSC operates. Crestview Republican Sen. Don Gaetz pushed for changes during the 2025 session, filing SB 354, but found no support in the House.
Not dissuaded, Gaetz in October filed SB 126, which already has been approved by the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Environment, and General Government.
Building back better banned under SB 180
Pinellas County Republican Sen. Nick DiCeglie says the goal of 2025’s SB 180 was to streamline restoration and improve emergency response coordination following major hurricanes.
But the controversial legislation is the subject of two lawsuits.
Twenty-five local governments have filed in Florida’s Second Judicial Circuit in Leon County, arguing the new law unconstitutionally infringes on their authority to govern their day-to-day operations.
The second suit was filed by 1000 Friends of Florida and east Orange County resident Rachel Hildebrand, also in Florida’s Second Judicial Circuit in Leon County.
Legislature wants to make it impossible for local governments to build back better after hurricanes

Specifically, SB 180 retroactively prevents cities and counties listed in federal disaster declarations for Hurricanes Debby, Helene, and Milton from adopting tougher development rules until October 2027. 
The ban could extend beyond 2027, though. Another section of the law allows a similar one-year ban to take effect anytime a local government is listed in a federal disaster declaration and lies within 100 miles of a hurricane’s path.
Signed into law by Gov Ron DeSantis on June 30, SB 180 gives “any person” standing to sue a local government’s amendment, regulation, or development order and, if successful, to receive their attorney fees.
Local governments have 14 days to repeal any restriction that draws a legal challenge. If a municipality declines, the lawsuit can be filed.
DeSantis defended the legislation, telling reporters over the summer that it gives homeowners battered by hurricanes the ability to rebuild their homes according to pre-storm building codes.
“They want to go out and restore their home to what it was like before the storm hits, and the local governments are telling them, ‘You can’t do it. You gotta do something else,’” DeSantis said. “What right do they have to tell you that you can’t rebuild your home? This isn’t California. This is Florida.”
Destin land purchase
A piece of land in Destin made headlines this year after the state paid the landowner, a political donor, 10 times more for it than the owner purchased it for nearly 10 years ago. 
Campaign contributor skips line, gets big payday from Florida governor and Cabinet

In September, the governor and Cabinet voted to purchase about four acres in Destin without a state-sponsored assessment. Instead, they relied on an appraisal conducted by the seller. 
The previous landowner purchased the land for about $8 million in 2016 and 2017. The governor and Cabinet purchased it from the landowner for more than $80 million. 
The land was previously owned by two LLCs, operated by a Louisiana businessman with a history of contributing to Florida politicians, including those locally in Destin. 
The Legislature, in a last-second budget proposal, made room for the deal. The language lawmakers approved allowed the state to create a park in Okaloosa County without requiring an appraisal.
Legislative Democrats, in announcing their 2026 session agenda, included a bill asking the state to investigate the deal. 
Everglades restoration
This year, the state completed a reservoir on the Caloosahatchee River, a key prevention measure against toxic algae blooms. The project represented a major milestone in Everglades restoration, something the state has focused on for decades. 
The state budget for the current fiscal year, DeSantis’ second-to-last before term limiting out of office, provides $1.3 billion for protection and restoration in the Everglades, a major increase from the previous year. Of that, approximately $800 million is for restoration.
DeSantis asked President Donald Trump early in the year for permission to finish the long-going Everglades restoration project by itself, maintaining federal funding through block grants.

In July, DeSantis’ administration signed an agreement with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to accelerate restoration efforts. His office says the agreement will accelerate the Everglades Agricultural Area Reservoir construction timeline by five years, putting its completion date in 2029.
Those are some of the bright points of 2025 when it comes to the Florida Everglades.
But when the state opened a 3,000-bed immigrant holding facility in the Everglades, environmental groups, worried that state may not have followed federal environmental regulations and concerned that the project could harm the unique ecosystem, sued the state.
The Everglades facility, built of tents and temporary infrastructure, has been the subject of political debate, the Democrats decrying it and the GOP fundraising off of it. 
It was built at the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport, advertised with the promise of using wild alligators as a deterrent to escape.
A judge called for the facility to close by the time September ended, but a federal appellate panel reversed that.
“He can’t claim to be the Everglades governor on one hand, and then plunk down this mass facility in the heart of the Everglades on the other hand,” attorney Tania Galloni, representing Friends of the Everglades, said in a phone interview with Florida Phoenix earlier this year.

It is urgent.","Alzheimer’s disease is not a distant crisis. It is a present, accelerating public health emergency – one that touches families in every city and town in Connecticut.
Yet despite its scale and its profound human impact, Alzheimer’s still does not receive the coordinated attention, funding, or urgency that other major health threats demand. That’s why Alzheimer’s advocacy has never been more important than it is right now.
More than 80,000 Connecticut residents live with Alzheimer’s or another dementia. Behind every diagnosis is a family navigating fear, role changes, and the overwhelming responsibility of providing care. Unpaid caregivers in our state contribute nearly 100 million hours of care annually, often while juggling full-time jobs, raising children, or managing their own health concerns. The emotional and financial strain is immense — and often invisible.
Yet a deeper challenge is quietly growing beneath the surface: the demographic shift accelerating the crisis.  By 2030, one in five Americans will be over the age of 65. Connecticut is already one of the oldest states in the nation, meaning we will feel the impact of this aging wave earlier and more intensely than most. The need for a strong, dementia-capable public health infrastructure is not theoretical. It is urgent.
The encouraging news is that meaningful solutions do exist – and advocacy is how those solutions become reality.
Recent federal legislation such as the BOLD Act and the Alzheimer’s Accountability and Investment Act has transformed the national response to dementia by strengthening public health systems, supporting Centers of Excellence, and — critically — requiring the National Institutes of Health to clearly outline the annual funding needed to achieve the goals of the National Alzheimer’s Plan. That accountability requirement matters. It ensures that Alzheimer’s research and care receive stable, transparent investment rather than slipping to the margins of federal priorities.
Connecticut is also stepping up. In 2025, the state passed legislation that will require all state-regulated health insurance plans to cover biomarker testing— including for conditions like Alzheimer’s — starting January 1, 2026. This coverage improvement will help democratize access to advanced diagnostics and accelerate earlier detection and treatment — a major win for families who have historically faced disparities in access to care.


And these legislative wins didn’t happen by accident. They happened because ordinary people — caregivers, community members, and advocates — raised their voices. They wrote letters, called their representatives, shared their stories, and refused to let Alzheimer’s be ignored. 
I’ve seen firsthand how powerful advocacy can be. Years ago, while serving as an Ambassador to Rep. John Larson through the Alzheimer’s Impact Movement, I wrote to his office encouraging him to support the BOLD Act shortly after it was introduced. Within days, his district office called to say he would co-sponsor. That legislation is now law, and its Centers of Excellence are shaping how states – including Connecticut – respond to Alzheimer’s. It is living proof that individual advocacy can influence national policy.
But our work is far from finished. New treatments are emerging, yet access remains uneven. Early detection tools are improving, but most people are still diagnosed far too late. Caregivers continue to bear an unsustainable load without adequate support. And health equity gaps persist, especially in communities of color that face both higher risk and lower access to diagnostic care.
Alzheimer’s takes memories, independence, and time — but it should not take hope. Advocacy is how we preserve that hope. It ensures that families are not left to navigate dementia alone, that science continues to advance, and that government meets the scale of the challenge with urgency and compassion.
We cannot afford to wait for the crisis to deepen. The moment for action is now –and every voice matters.

Changes coming to Health Department

Maryland Health Secretary Laura Herrera Scott will leave the position she has held since the start of the Moore administration to make room for Meena Seshamani, who until recently was deputy administrator at the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
The governor’s office said Thursday that Herrera Scott, who has been secretary since January 2023, will stay until the end of this month, when she will be temporarily succeeded by Deputy Secretary for Health Care Financing Ryan Moran. Seshamani will take over on April 8, pending Senate approval of her appointment.
Herrera Scott’s departure comes as her agency is at the center of a budget storm, with a $200 million cut to the Developmental Disabilities Administration among the biggest single cuts as the state struggles to close a $3 billion gap in the fiscal 2026 budget. That proposal has sparked emotional rallies by members of the disabilities community as well as pushback from lawmakers.
The department last spring also announced that it had underestimated Medicaid expenses by $236 million, sending lawmakers scrambling to find funds in the final month of the legislative session. And Herrera Scott came under fire in December for her handling of complaints at the Clifton T. Perkins Hospital Center, a high-security hospital that has been riddled with complaints of patient abuse and violence. (GO TO STORY)

Senate warns of $500 million more in budget cuts, ahead of likely ‘disastrous’ federal action

Senate leaders said the legislature is preparing for as much as $500 million in additional cuts to an already strapped fiscal 2026 budget, as they brace for federal reductions and look to rework Gov. Wes Moore’s tax proposals.
“We do believe in the next couple of weeks we will get a better picture as to the extent of the, honestly, disastrous cuts that are likely going to be shifted to the states ahead of the March 14 shutdown date,” Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) said during a weekly meeting with reporters.
Ferguson said he is hopeful that when other states start seeing cuts from a Republican-controlled White House and Congress, “be it Medicaid, FEMA, public education — that they speak to their congressional representatives and explain the pain that would be ahead for cost shifts. But we don’t know where that’s going to land yet, and so that’s a big uncertainty.”
In addition to uncertainty about the federal budget, Senate Budget and Taxation Chair Guy Guzzone (D-Howard) said fiscal committees in the House and Senate are looking at a full range of options, which he predicts could include $200-$500 million in cuts to offset likely changes to unpopular parts of the governor’s budget.

Legislature overrides Moore’s veto, approves creation of reparations commission

It took years to pass — and another eight months to override the governor’s veto — but lawmakers gave final approval Tuesday to a bill that creates a Maryland Reparations Commission.
The bill establishes a 23-member voluntary commission to assess specific federal, state and local policies from 1877 to 1965, the post-Reconstruction and Jim Crow eras, and to examine how public and private institutions may have benefited from policies that led to discrimination. The commission is also charged with recommending appropriate reparations, from a statement of apology to monetary compensation or social service assistance.
The bill had been a priority of the Legislative Black Caucus and its veto in May by Gov. Wes Moore (D), the first Black governor of Maryland, stunned many lawmakers and advocates, in Maryland and nationwide. Legislators immediately vowed an override, which they did by comfortable margins during Tuesday’s special session.
“It’s been a long time coming, and I’m so very grateful that this body saw fit to do that,” Sen. C. Anthony Muse (D-Prince George’s), the lead Senate sponsor, said in a brief interview after the vote. “I think the study will go a long way in revealing some of the things that we’re talking about. I’m happy that it’s happened.” (GO TO STORY)

Federal worker protection bill passes House, but not without a scrap

About the only thing lawmakers agreed on Tuesday was a bipartisan chorus of boos, after one House member resorted to calling Elon Musk a neo-Nazi during an increasingly contentious 30-minute debate over a bill to protect federal workers.
The Protect Our Federal Workers Act ended up passing the House, but not before the debate strayed to support for farmers, the state’s reliance on the federal government, President Donald Trump – and Musk.
“Right now, Republicans have empowered an unelected neo-Nazi with no security clearance or Senate confirmation to essentially determine what cuts should be made and who should be fired,” Del. Gabriel Acevero (D-Montgomery) said of Musk. “That’s the reality of it.”
It was not long after that that the House suspended debate to move to a vote.
House Bill 1424 would reallocate state funds to assist federal workers affected by Trump-directed layoffs and expand the authority of Attorney General Anthony Brown to pursue related litigation. It was portrayed as necessary by Democrats and an overstep by Republicans, who said Democrats were focusing too much on laid-off federal workers, and not enough on other workers in the state.

Vehicle registration costs set to go up July 1

Maryland motorists will have to dig a little deeper after July 1 when they renew their vehicle registrations.
The cost of registering a passenger vehicle will increase 60-75% under new rates that take effect on July 1. The new fees, passed as part of a budget compromise between the House and Senate, include changes to weight classes of vehicles.
“As directed by state law, the MVA is required to adjust vehicle registration fees that will help provide critical revenue for the Transportation Trust Fund, which ensures all of the state’s infrastructure is in a state of good repair,” Motor Vehicle Administrator Chrissy Nizer said. “In order to make these new fees as affordable as possible, the MVA is now offering customers the convenient option to choose either a one or two-year registration at time of their renewal.”
The new fees and a coming surcharge on electric and hybrid vehicles are part of an effort to close a $3 billion projected gap in highway and transit spending. Lawmakers said earlier this year that projects would be delayed unless the state modernizes how it pays for transportation projects.
Currently, owners of passenger cars weighing up to 3,700 pounds pay $137 every two years. Effective July 1, the registration fee for a passenger vehicle up to 3,500 pounds will be $221 every two years, or $110.50 annually. (GO TO STORY)

Bumps AHEAD: Trump administration evaluating Maryland’s authority to set Medicare rates
A look at Western Maryland Hospital Center in Washington County. (Photo by Hannah Gaskill/Maryland Matters).
The Trump administration has signaled an interest in reining in Maryland’s ability to set rates for Medicare services – an authority the state has held for about 40 years.
Maryland’s system, unusual among states, gives the state significant say over the costs of health care services across different coverage plans to keep costs low and consistent. The state hopes to have a similar authority as it transitions into a federal program called the States Advancing All-Payer Health Equity Approaches and Development, or AHEAD, model.
But advocates worry that the feds’ apparent interest in changing who sets Medicare rates could disrupt health care payments for consumers, governments and providers.
The state’s ability to set Medicare rates has been in place for about 40 years under a waiver granted by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI).
In the time since, the state’s health care system has evolved and the Maryland Health Services Cost Review Commission now determines the rates for care across all hospitals in the state, so that health care service costs are similar whether someone has private insurance, Medicare or Medicaid.

Justices asked to decide when a cell phone ‘touch’ becomes reason for a traffic stop

Maryland’s highest court was asked Friday to determine how much a driver has to be handling a phone before police have sufficient reason to pull the driver over for using a cell phone while driving.
The case stems from Michael Eugene Stone’s 2023 stop and subsequent arrest on drug charges in Hagerstown, after police saw him “touch” or tap the screen of his dash-mounted phone in a way they said looked like he might be texting or making a call.
After stopping Stone for “using the phone while driving,” the officers discovered that he was driving on a suspended license, and in a subsequent search of him and his car they found drugs, drug paraphernalia and brass knuckles.
At trial, Stone tried to get the search evidence suppressed, arguing that police did not have the reasonable suspicion needed to stop him in the first place. The trial judge disagreed and let the evidence be submitted, but the Appellate Court of Maryland reversed that ruling in January, saying the officers had not shown they had reason to make a stop.

Maryland lawmakers made history Tuesday, electing the first Afro-Latina and the first immigrant to serve as House speaker.
Del. Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel) is the 109th person to serve as speaker of the House of Delegate but just the second woman of color in the job, following her predecessor, Del. Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County). Her rise to the speaker’s rostrum caps a nearly two-decade career in Annapolis, but got its start in an unlikely place: a small home with a leaky roof in the Dominican Republic.
“My journey did not begin in these chambers,” Peña-Melnyk said. Instead it began “in a small wooden house with a thick tin roof, one that had holes where the rain will come through…. That’s how I grew up.”
She said the family used corn husks and newspaper for toilet paper and often had little or nothing to eat. “Those memories are not shared for sympathy,” she said. “They are reminders of where I come from and the resilience that hardship can forge.”
The memories are also the foundation of what her legislative colleagues — Democrats and Republicans alike — said is Peña-Melnyk’s empathy for others and her desire to work hard to improve the lives of her constituents. (GO TO STORY)

Maryland launches new loan program for laid-off federal workers

Marylanders affected by federal layoffs this year can now apply for an interest-free state loan to help them pay the bills in the short term, according a press release Thursday from the state Department of Labor.
The Federal Emergency Loan Program is directed at the thousands of Maryland residents who have lost jobs in the federal government so far since the Trump administration began slashing the federal workforce to cut down federal spending.
The loan program was created this year under the new Protect Our Federal Workers Act, sponsored this year by Majority Whip Jazz Lewis (D-Prince George’s) and signed into law in April. The law expands the use of two current employee-assistance funds so they apply to federal workers laid off as the Trump administration rushes to slash the size of government. It also expands the authority of the attorney general’s office to take legal action on behalf of laid-off federal workers in some instances, and it creates an expedited state hiring program for workers who lost jobs due to administration cuts.
The program offers a $700 interest-free loan for residents who qualify. Those residents must have been terminated from a federal job since Trump took office, in a mass layoff, relocation, or closure of a unit of the federal government, or in a similar situation beyond their control. (GO TO STORY)

Fish fry: Maryland uses electrofishing to glimpse blue catfish invasion

There is no bright flash or loud bang, no sharp crackling sound. But the rushing waters of the Potomac River have just been electrified.
And for a moment, nothing changes.
But suddenly, they rise to the surface one by one, writhing briefly before they lie still — dozens and dozens of invasive blue and flathead catfish, previously hidden in the gray-blue depths beneath the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge, connecting Maryland’s Oxon Hill to Virginia’s Alexandria.
The fish, with their white bellies and small fins pointed skyward, aren’t dead — just stunned. But the biologists aboard the small Maryland Department of Natural Resources jon boat only have a a few minutes before the fish come to their senses and descend once more.
In that time, the small group of scientists can’t hope to collect every fish — at least a hundred in all — in their handheld dip nets, even though extricating the invasive species from the Chesapeake Bay is the ultimate goal.
This experiment in electrofishing, as it’s known, is more to give scientists a snapshot of what is normally concealed: Just how many of the whiskered invaders lurk in one stretch of the Potomac, in a roughly 50-yard radius surrounding the tiny motorboat delivering the shock. (GO TO STORY)

Prince George’s County State’s Attorney Tara Jackson announced indictments Thursday of two men charged with defrauding a 59-year-old county resident out of $86,000.
Jackson and county police said Zheng Hui Xie, 30, of Flushing, New York, and Jianwei Wang, 27, of Monterey Park, California, impersonated Federal Trade Commission officials in order to convince the resident, who was not named, that there had been fraudulent activity on her Apple ID and that several accounts were compromised.
The resident received a text message on April 28 about a large purchase made on her account, and called a number provided. The person who answered claimed to be with a fraud department, and transferred the woman to an individual who claimed to be an FTC agent.
On two separate occasions, the resident was asked to withdraw money from her bank in order to secure her money. She handed the money over to the fake agents who came to her home. When the resident received another phone call May 15 from an unknown number, and was told to withdraw $24,000, she contacted police. On May 23, investigators with the Prince George’s County Police Department’s Financial Crimes Unit arrested Xie and Wang. (GO TO STORY)

Senate Republicans score budget win as spending plan clears preliminary hurdle

Maryland Senate Republicans scored a victory in Monday’s budget debate, winning an amendment that dedicates a new per tire fee to state highways and bridges.
It was a rare win for the minority party in floor debate, as the Senate gave preliminary approval to a $67 billion budget for fiscal 2026 that includes a tax and fee package that will raise an estimated $1 billion.
While Republicans protested the new tire fee — $5 per tire — they were able to convince Democrats to dedicate the money specifically to state highway projects instead of the Transportation Trust Fund, which goes to transit as well as roads.
“I think that was an amendment that did make a lot of sense,” said Senate Minority Leader Stephen S. Hershey Jr. (R-Upper Shore). “You know, the $5 tire tax is new. They talked about it going to the Transportation Trust Fund. We just wanted to make sure that it actually goes to roads and bridges.”
On Monday night, Budget and Taxation Chair Sen. Guy Guzzone (D-Howard) stepped in before the amendment could be rejected by budget subcommittee leaders. “I can see the nexus on this one, so I’m going to suggest we support this one,” Guzzone said, as he quickly called for a roll call vote.

Advocates are reeling at recent proposals to cut $200 million from a state agency that administers resources for people with developmental disabilities — cuts that advocates call inhumane and harmful for the people who need those services.
“We are deeply distressed by the nature of a number of these proposals,” said Laura Howell, CEO of the Maryland Association of Community Services, who said the plans “are absolutely going to hurt people.”
The fiscal 2026 budget unveiled last week by Gov. Wes Moore (D) calls for a $200 million cut from the Developmental Disabilities Administration, one of the tough choices Moore said state officials and lawmakers face as they grapple with a $3 billion budget shortfall.
“We will be advocating strenuously in the General Assembly to try to find a way to reverse some of this, if not all of it,” Howell said. “I think it’s going to be a really tall order, given the size of the cut.” (GO TO STORY)

$7 million payment to substitute among issues in Prince George’s schools audit

A Prince George’s County substitute teacher was paid more than $7 million in 2022 — and two months passed before the school system recouped the funds.
That was the most remarkable finding in a new legislative audit of the county school system, which described a number of ongoing issues with the system’s payroll, procurement and human resources procedures.
The Maryland Department of Legislative Services audit also found that the school system failed to consistently complete a screening process for employees who have contact with children, and that it failed to investigate 9,376 missing items identified in a 2023 inventory, which were valued at about $6.3 million.
The audit said the 2022 overpayment occurred when a school system employee mistakenly entered the teacher’s identification number in the “hours” field, leading to the teacher being paid for approximately 73,000 work days, rather than three. School system officials didn’t realize the overpayment had occurred for more than 50 days, but recovered the funds within a few days, the audit said. (GO TO STORY)

House rejects GOP amendments, gives final approval to bill creating Reparations Commission

It’s done.
The House of Delegates gave final approval Wednesday evening to a bill that would create a Maryland Reparations Commission, sending the measure to the governor for his signature.
The 101-36 party-line vote would make Maryland one of the few states in the nation with a statewide body to study the inequality endured by African descendants. California became the first state in 2020 to pass legislation; then Illinois in 2021 and New York in 2023.
If approved, the commission would assess specific federal, state and local policies from 1877 to 1965, the post-Reconstruction and Jim Crow eras. Those years “have led to economic disparities based on race, including housing segregation and discrimination, redlining, restrictive covenants, and tax policies,” according to the bill.
The commission would also examine how public and private institutions may have benefited from those policies, and would recommend appropriate reparations, which could include statements of apology, monetary compensation, social service assistance, business incentives and child care costs.
Passage Wednesday followed 90 minutes of sometimes emotional debate and attempts to amend the bill, which could have blocked its passage with just five days left in the General Assembly session. (GO TO STORY)

Weeks after his release from prison, Franklin hired back to Prince George’s council job by Hawkins

At-large Prince George’s County Councilmember Calvin Hawkins II believes in second chances.
He’s led a career marked by overcoming past mistakes, and now he hopes to play a role in a “comeback story” for an old colleague: former At-Large Councilmember Mel Franklin, whom he hired as his new chief of staff earlier this summer.
Franklin’s hiring comes weeks after he was released early from a one-year sentence for a criminal scheme to steal campaign funds to cover personal expenses — and the efforts taken to hide his actions. He resigned from the council last year before later pleading guilty to charges of felony theft and perjury, and was sentenced in November to five years in prison with all but one suspended and three years probation.
Hawkins (D-At Large) did not respond to multiple requests for an interview, but said in a statement Tuesday that he chose to hire Franklin after speaking with him recently and finding that “his contrition was sincere and evident…. His call to serve still shone brightly,” Hawkins’ statement said. “In that moment, I was moved to offer him the role as my Chief of Staff.” A county council spokesperson said Franklin started on July 14 at a salary of $72,000.

A county worker was fired for ‘gross negligence.’ Now, he’s nominated to lead his old agency.

To lead the Prince George’s County Department of the Environment, County Executive Aisha N. Braveboy (D) is turning to someone who was fired from that very department a decade ago.
Samuel Belsham Moki was terminated from the agency in February 2014 for “gross negligence,” after county officials determined that he failed to manage the county’s stormwater pollution management program, which led to the county having to pay thousands of dollars in fines.
Moki challenged the termination before a county personnel board and then in circuit court and in the court now known as the Appellate Court of Maryland. At every turn, judges upheld his firing as justified.
Braveboy acknowledged that “questions have been raised” about Moki’s appointment. But in a news release Wednesday — issued after Maryland Matters inquired about the appointment — she argued that Moki is a “distinguished” former county employee, listing his academic degrees, including a doctorate in political science, and his prior roles with county government. He took on the role in an “acting” status on June 26. (GO TO STORY)

Poll: Majority of Marylanders say they have considered exiting the state

A majority of Marylanders said they have considered moving from the state in the near future even though they believe it is a good place to raise children, according to a poll released Thursday.
Many of those participating in the survey by the Institute of Politics at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, expressed concerns with the state’s business climate, job market and friendliness toward retirees. The poll highlights a potential problem as Gov. Wes Moore (D) attempts to focus on growing the state’s economy.
“For a majority of Marylanders, the state is a great place to live and raise a family,” said Mileah Kromer, a pollster and director of the Institute of Politics.
Many who responded rated Maryland favorably on questions about family, health care and education. A majority of respondents — 56% — said Maryland is a good or excellent place to raise a family. Another 27% said it was a fair place to raise a family and 16% rated the state as poor. (GO TO STORY)

Another federal judge orders AmeriCorps to reinstate workers, restore funds

A second federal district judge in Maryland has ordered the Trump administration to reinstate AmeriCorps workers who were laid off without notice in April and to restore $400 million in funding and grants to nonprofit organizations.
The preliminary injunction handed down Monday by District Judge Matthew Maddox comes a month and two days after a similar ruling in a separate AmeriCorps case in Maryland by U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman — whose ruling is quoted heavily by Maddox.
Both judges blocked moves by the Trump administration and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to shut down AmeriCorps programs, including the National Civilian Community Corps (NCCC), Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA) and various state and private grant programs.
Boardman ruled in favor of 24 states and the District of Columbia that sued to block the DOGE cuts. Maddox ruled in favor of a number of nonprofits from around the country, members of an AmeriCorps labor union and three AmeriCorps service members. (GO TO STORY)

A Maryland Health Department Police captain faces criminal charges, including theft and two counts of misconduct in office, related to college classes she attended when she was supposed to be working.
According to documents filed in Baltimore County Circuit Court, Capt. Astarte Hunt attended classes at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County from January to May 2025. During that time, she was assigned as an officer at Spring Grove Hospital, located in Catonsville near the university.
Prosecutors allege that Hunt, a nine-year veteran of the department who earns $120,140 annually, attended two psychology classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays in the spring semester, during hours that she was supposed to be working. Hunt is accused of falsifying time sheets and claiming she was working when she was attending those classes.
She faces one count of misconduct in office for attending those classes while providing timecards that said she was working the hours she was in class. She is also charged with theft related to the more than $5,100 in pay she received due to falsifying those timecards. (GO TO STORY)

Budget agreement could generate more than $1 billion in new revenue

A compromise spending plan for the coming budget year includes more than $1 billion in tax increases, including a proposal to let local governments increase the maximum local piggyback tax rate.
The revenues were unveiled Thursday by the governor and legislative leaders as part of a broad budget “framework” that will guide negotiators in the next few weeks, as they rush toward the end of the session.
The new revenues, coupled with an estimated $2.5 billion in budget cuts, are designed to cover a projected $3 billion deficit in the fiscal 2026 budget, and leave a reserve for fiscal 2027. The budget will also include “federal government spending triggers” that would activate in response to likely federal budget cuts.
Topping the list of new taxes unveiled Thursday is nearly $500 million from a 3% sales tax on data and IT services, according to budget documents shared with Maryland Matters. The tax, originally proposed as a business-to-business tax, would apply to anyone who uses such a service. (GO TO STORY)

Moore changes tone after encounter with Trump

Maryland Gov. Wes Moore appears to have dismissed any possibility of working with President Donald Trump after a meeting at the White House with the National Governors Association.
In a meeting with reporters Monday, Moore said an interaction between Trump and the roughly four dozen governors in attendance ended any thoughts he may have harbored about working with the president. The first-term Democrat said Maryland and other states must rise to the threat of massive layoffs and slash-and-burn federal budgeting coming from the administration.
“I come back from Washington with no illusion about what kind of partnership that this administration is trying to forge with our nation’s governors,” Moore told reporters, “and … with a clear understanding that if this first month is any indication of where things are going, we as lawmakers had better take this moment seriously and make sure that we’re moving forward.” (GO TO STORY)

‘We had to do something’: Maryland rolls out mandatory reservation system for two state parks

At Greenbrier State Park in Western Maryland, the line of cars sometimes started forming as early as midnight, with visitors desperate to secure a coveted spot beside the park’s popular lake after the sun came up.
On the busiest days, the line could stretch a few miles from the park entrance as more and more cars arrived, said Tim Hamilton of the Maryland Park Service. The resulting traffic is just one of the reasons why the park service will begin requiring advance reservations from all Greenbrier visitors on weekends and holidays from Memorial Day to Labor Day, Hamilton said.
The reservation website rolls out Monday, and reservations will be required starting next weekend for the Memorial Day weekend — both at Greenbrier and Sandy Point State Park, which hosts a popular swimming beach on the Chesapeake Bay Bridge in Anne Arundel County.
Some time later this summer, the reservation requirement will expand to include Point Lookout, Newtowne Neck and North Point State Parks. Hamilton starts the story in 2019, when there were 14.9 million visitors to Maryland state parks, which “shattered” all previous records. But another storm was coming. (GO TO STORY)

Federal court says Social Security can’t dismiss complaints of fibromyalgia sufferers

Their complaints are often ignored or brushed aside, but fibromyalgia sufferers see some hope in a recent court ruling that Social Security Administration officials were wrong to discount an Anne Arundel County woman’s description of the suffering the condition caused her.
Crystal Hultz was first denied Social Security disability benefits back in 2014. Throughout her many attempts to challenge the decision, administrative law judges believed her subjective testimony was not properly supported by medical evidence.
But in a Dec. 15 opinion, a three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that in cases where there are no objective medical tests or markers to identify debilitating conditions, like fibromyalgia, subjective testimony must have more weight.
“This case is about crediting a patient’s accounts of the chronic, debilitating, and little-understood illness fibromyalgia,” Circuit Judge Roger L. Gregory wrote in the opinion. (GO TO STORY)

Hidden no more: Butterflies on licenses, ID cards alert police to hidden disabilities

Several people showed up at Motor Vehicle Administration offices Wednesday to get new identification cards with a special butterfly logo, but it’s hardly surprising that the first one went to Montgomery County resident Eric Carpenter-Grantham.
After all, “Eric’s ID Law,” which allowed for the creation of the new cards, is named after Carpenter-Grantham.
The law requires that the MVA add the butterfly logo above the words “hidden disability” on cards for those who request it, like Carpenter-Grantham, who has high-functioning autism. The logo is meant to help police identify Marylanders with developmental or intellectual disabilities that are not immediately noticeable.
Dozens of elected officials, disability advocates and other supporters traveled to the MVA’s White Oak location to celebrate “Eric’s ID Law” that went into effect Wednesday.

It’s not hard to understand why, and our leaders in Annapolis would be wise to listen to their constituents and fight back against Republican power grabs.
For months, Republican-led states across the country have been engaged in an assault on fair maps and fair elections, redrawing congressional districts in states like Texas, Missouri and now Florida to give them an unfair advantage in the 2026 midterm elections. They know that voters are fed up with their unpopular agenda, which is hurting the working class, raising our costs and weakening protections for workers across Maryland and the country.

Sensing the inevitability of voters running them from office next November, these politicians have turned to gerrymandering in an attempt to rig the elections and silence the will of the voters. Maryland has the chance to fight back and ensure fair representation in Congress by redrawing our maps to better represent this state’s communities and interests at the federal level.
Maryland voters have made it clear that they want Annapolis to fight for them, fight back against this administration and their state-government cronies, and help deliver a Congress that puts the interests of working families first. If we fail to protect the voices of voters and communities across our state in the face of these unprecedented acts in Republican-led states, we risk untold damage to Maryland communities from a government that will not represent us.
Our state has already been rocked by the actions of the current Congress and administration. Federal workers have been fired or left without pay for weeks during the prolonged shutdown. Our communities have been denied disaster aid, our infrastructure projects have had their funding threatened, and other projects critical to our communities have seen their funding cut completely. The only way that Maryland can stand up for ourselves and our interests is through our votes.
Next November, we can head to the ballot box and bring an end to the unchecked, callous actions of Republicans in Washington. But it will be for naught if we cannot overcome the machinations of Texas, Florida and the like.
Maryland voters recognize that unfair elections elsewhere undermine their power as voters. We must protect that power by putting Maryland at the forefront of the fight for our democracy and for fair representation in Congress. Failing to respond to Republican attacks on our elections is tantamount to surrender, and as this week’s polling demonstrates, there will almost certainly be electoral consequences for surrendering.
Maryland’s working families have had enough of Republican attacks on our democracy. If our elected officials won’t stand up and fight for us to have fair representation in Congress, we’ll find some who will.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Untitled-design-newsletter-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-01 21:12:25.829528
