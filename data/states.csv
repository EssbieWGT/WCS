There were no public defenders available to represent the defendant. (Photo by Jake Parrish/InvestigateWest)While Washington state lawmakers’ budget more than doubles funding for public defenders, those attorneys say the sum is still woefully inadequate to meet the needs of local courts. 
Unlike most states, Washington does not bear the burden of funding the constitutional right to counsel. Instead, the onus is on local governments with the state historically only funding less than 3% of overall costs. 
“They were paying such a small portion of the cost that the increase was going to look large,” said Derek Young, interim director of the Washington State Association of Counties. “In a session where they had budget frames and were making cuts to other important programs, I saw this as a really positive first step, recognition that something has to change.” 
The new budget, awaiting the governor’s signature, would increase the state’s contributions to public defense to around 6% of total funding during the next biennium, 2026-2027. The funding boost is not guaranteed after that.
“This is a great start,” said Katrin Johnson, deputy director for the state’s Office of Public Defense, which provides supplemental representation to indigent defendants and disburses the state’s funding to counties and cities. “It’s about collaboration and education to help the Legislature understand the local difficulties and challenges counties have in funding public defense.”
For years, public defender offices across Washington have been struggling to recruit and retain attorneys. It’s a taxing job with a high workload, and not many law school graduates are inclined to relocate to rural areas, leaving these jurisdictions especially susceptible to a shortage. 
Without an adequate pool of public defenders, defendants in places like Yakima County are left waiting weeks, sometimes months, to resolve their cases. 
The people most vulnerable to the state’s shortage of public defenders are disproportionately people of color, said Pierce County Executive Ryan Mello, who testified before the Legislature in favor of increasing state funding for public defense. 
“Poor folks, people of color, sit in jail longer,” Mello said. “The longer they sit in jail, not adjudicating their case, the more likely they are to lose their job, to lose their family, to lose their housing, and things spiral out of control.”
Local jurisdictions provide the majority of funding for public defense, about 97%, often leading to public defense programs having to negotiate with county commissioners to increase funding amid inflationary costs for court services.
“It’s inappropriate to rely just on local revenue to fund a constitutional right,” Young said.
The state’s Office of Public Defense administers the limited state funding given to counties and cities through a grant program. Since 2017, funding has remained stagnant — not surpassing 2% of the overall money spent by courts to provide public defense services, according to data from the Office of Public Defense. The funding is dispersed to counties in varying amounts based on population and caseload size.

County revenues collected from property and sales taxes make up the remaining funds, but in Washington, local governments can only increase their property tax revenue by 1% without voter-approved ballot measures, failing to keep pace with the rising costs of running a court.
“The money we get [from the state] wouldn’t even pay for one attorney,” said Jeremy Ford, director of the Chelan County public defender’s office. “The problem is that the millions of dollars that gets spread out proportionally based on the size of your county or city… means us rural counties get less resources, which is always the case.”
Last year, the Chelan County public defender’s office received $81,000 from the grant, amounting to just 2.2% of total costs. 
“The money they’re passing through isn’t really enough to do any substantial help for anybody,” Ford said.
Two identical House and Senate bills related to public defense funding died this session. Over a rolling basis, those bills would have made the state responsible for 50% of the costs associated with public defense services. 
“Budgetarily, I knew it would be a big ask,” said Rep. Strom Peterson, D-Edmonds and prime sponsor of the House bill, citing the state’s multibillion-dollar budget deficit. “I’ve been in the Legislature for 11 years and always kind of knew about the shortfall in public defense funding, but I didn’t quite realize how acute it was.”
Neither bill made it out of committee, but those involved say there was more support for public defense this year than previously.
“There has been proposed legislation for many years to increase the amount of state funding for local public defense, and this is the first time we’ve received more,” Johnson said. “It’s a constitutional right. We want to make sure it’s being done well no matter what jurisdiction it falls under.”
Peterson said he will continue to work with the Legislature to secure public defense funding across the state. 
“We can’t just pay for more police officers,” Peterson said. “We need to pay for the whole system to make sure it works.”
Gov. Bob Ferguson has until May 20 to sign or veto the new budget. If there is no action by then, the budget will become law.
“I think the governor, being the former attorney general, has a really good understanding of the criminal justice system,” said Mello, the Pierce County executive. “He understands the need for access to justice … which really increases our chances at this part of the budget being signed into law.”

(Submitted photo)The Indiana Capital Chronicle took home seven awards from the Society of Professional Journalists’ annual Indiana chapter banquet Friday evening — including a top recognition for Senior Reporter Casey Smith, who was honored as the Journalist of the Year.
SPJ board members cited Smith’s accomplishments as an education writer while announcing the award, as well as her investigative work into Jamey Noel, a disgraced former sheriff now serving time in prison for misusing public funds for private gain.
Judges also recognized Smith as likely being the first reporter to witness a state execution. Smith earned the trust of Joseph Cochran’s defense team and was invited as part of Cochran’s personal guest list.

That work earned Smith — and ICC Editor-in-Chief Niki Kelly — a first-place nod in the criminal justice category. Kelly has covered Cochran’s case since the beginning, when she was a courts reporter with the Fort Wayne Journal Gazette.
Smith also won a second-place finish for her environmental reporting on a 2024 bill seeking to exempt certain products from being defined as toxic PFAs “forever chemicals.”
The ICC’s four-person team won five other awards on Friday, including first place for best journalism website and third place for the publication’s daily newsletter, Fast Break.
Senior Reporter Whitney Downard nabbed a first-place win for her personality profile of Abbey Hall, a Hoosier who traveled to Illinois for an abortion after learning her daughter would be born with a detrimental birth defect. Downard also won second place in the Medical and Science Reporting category for her story about transportation troubles for adult day care recipients following a transition to managed care.

Larry Rhoden, points toward the property line of land in rural Lincoln County that had been surveyed for the purpose of constructing a men's prison. (John Hult/South Dakoa Searchlight. (John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)When the South Dakota Department of Corrections announced the site where it hoped to build a 1,500-bed men’s prison in 2023, it told the public it was the only usable site available.
The state had sent a request for information months earlier, hoping someone would offer up land for the project. No one who was willing to sell had exactly what the state was after, Corrections Secretary Kellie Wasko said. 
This week, department spokesman Michael Winder again wrote that “no formal submissions” met the criteria for the prison.
“The state continued to do outreach, get referrals, and conduct research” after the request was placed, Winder wrote, but “in the fall of 2023, the other sites the state was pursuing declined to sell.”
So the department transferred $8 million to the state Office of School and Public Lands, laying claim to 320 acres of farmland a few miles south of Harrisburg that had been leased to farmers for years. The lease proceeds were used to fund the state’s K-12 schools, and the $8 million went into the trust fund into which those lease payments had flowed. 


 The locations of potential men’s prison sites submitted to Project Prison Reset.
The site was a “gift from God,” Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden would later say. But its selection sparked fierce opposition, political activism and a lawsuit from neighbors. It also contributed to the Rhoden administration’s failure to push the $825 million project across the finish line during the 2025 legislative session. 
In March, the state sent out another request for information, this time as part of an effort to “reset” discussions on a correctional facility to replace the state penitentiary. 
In less than a month, more than a dozen options emerged. 
One of them, the former Citibank campus in northern Sioux Falls, was apparently available as an option back in 2023. 
Citibank had built a new headquarters on the south end of Sioux Falls in 2019. A representative for the company selling the land said they didn’t submit it as a possible prison site in 2023, but said the state didn’t reach out during the “outreach” phase of its site search.
“I don’t know what happened the first time around,” said Troy Fawcett of NAI Sioux Falls Commercial Real Estate.
New process wider in scope
Rhoden’s office wouldn’t comment on whether the former Citibank campus just north of the state penitentiary was under consideration in 2023, but spokeswoman Josie Harms did note its size in a statement to South Dakota Searchlight. 
In the first request for information, the state sought at least 100-200 acres of land or more for a 1,500 bed facility, based on a consultant’s report.
“The Project Prison Reset task force isn’t looking back — we’re moving forward,” Harms wrote to Searchlight. “With that said, the Citibank building is only 70 acres.”
South Dakota corrections work group formally backs need for new prison

Ryan Brunner, a policy adviser for Rhoden, presented the new options to members of Project Prison Reset during the group’s second meeting on Tuesday in Springfield. He told Searchlight after the meeting that several options may not have been for sale in 2023, and that the market in Sioux Falls has changed.
“We’ll have to do some analysis on these sites to see if they’re a fit or not,” Brunner said.
The parameters for a potential site are less restrictive this time around. 
The governor’s work group is exploring all options, including smaller facilities, multiple facilities and locations outside the Sioux Falls area. There’s a preference for sites within 20 miles of Sioux Falls in the newer request for information, but that’s not a requirement.
That easing of requirements made it possible for the state to field offers from Big Stone City, Aberdeen, Huron and Mitchell. Big Stone has an empty cheese plant on more than 100 acres. Huron has 100 acres in an industrial park. Mitchell has more than that, on land south of town near its landfill. Aberdeen has two options on two ends of the Hub City.
The newer parameters also put the Citibank site, with its 70 acres, in the running. That offer is the spendiest option by asking price, at $33.8 million, and the one with the smallest footprint.
It does offer some enticements the others do not, though. 
It has buildings that could be refurbished, rather than built from the ground up. It’s connected to water and sewer, and is less than a mile from the current penitentiary campus. The minimum and maximum security units on the current penitentiary grounds will remain, regardless of the future of the 1881 main penitentiary.

More options offer more wiggle room
Sen. Chris Karr, R-Sioux Falls, told South Dakota Searchlight that the work group’s Springfield trip, with its tour of the medium-security Mike Durfee State Prison and rundowns of the multiple vocational programs offered there to more than 1,000 inmates, was illuminating. It solidified his skepticism on the need for 100 acres or more.
The Mike Dufee campus, formerly a university, is smaller than 70 acres. The penitentiary in Sioux Falls is overcrowded by medium security inmates, Karr noted, not maximum security ones. The 1,500-bed proposal and its 100-plus acres were designed around maximum security housing units.
“I’m not convinced we need 100 acres,” Karr said. “I don’t think anybody is at this point.”
Karr’s not fully sold on any of the new proposals – there isn’t space at any of them for the ideal security perimeter, for example – but said the idea that Citibank is “almost turn-key” is appealing. 
Karr said the state should have worked harder to find sites back in 2023, instead of requesting information and waiting for offers. The work of site selection may have been more fruitful if it had included the kind of public forums now taking place with Project Prison Reset, he said.
“This is getting vetted and discussed the way it should have been the first time around,” he said.
Prison work group peppered with public testimony in first Sioux Falls meeting

Other options include multiple undeveloped properties with 100 acres or more in the Sioux Falls area, most presented for sale on a per-acre basis. 
There’s land at the intersection of interstates 29 and 90, a plot near Amazon’s Sioux Falls distribution center, and another near the Department of Correction’s West Farm site, home to a facility for juveniles in state custody.
The Sioux Falls Development Foundation has offered land near Worthing as another Lincoln County option, and the city of Canton pointed to tracts of land west of town.
Lt. Gov. Tony Venhuizen leads the Project Prison Reset work group. During the initial site discussions in 2023, he was still a Republican state representative for District 13 in Sioux Falls. 
He’s pleased to have so many offers, noting that the publicity surrounding the work group may have drawn more attention. 
Even so, he said, “we need to be realistic” about how the potential sales might go over with neighbors. The site obtained in 2023, he said, is still an option.
“I don’t find it particularly surprising that we have owners of land in some of these communities who are willing to offer it,” Venhuizen said.

(Photo by Julie Gammack)My mother loved pink azaleas. They had to be a particular shade of pink to be just right. Kind of a salmon color — not too pinky. On her birthday and holidays, Boesen’s the Florist would deliver just the right plant, with just the right color — unless there was a new clerk handling the order, someone who didn’t understand that the pink had to be exactly right, or there might be tears.
Growing up in Iowa, we couldn’t grow our own azaleas. They couldn’t withstand the frigid winters. So when I moved to Washington, D.C. and experienced spring — real spring, where azaleas bloom with abandon, or neatly trimmed, along sidewalks and in the yards of old neighborhoods — I was stunned.
They were everywhere. White. Deep red. And my mother’s favorite: a light coral pink.
As an aside, when I was a talk radio host, I once interviewed a U.S. senator and asked — just making small talk during a commercial break — if the azaleas were in bloom in D.C.
He fumbled. Didn’t know what an azalea was. Tried to fake it. Hysterical.
Right now, we’re in Annapolis, Maryland, living on a boat for a couple of weeks. I’m driving around running errands in this magical geography, where spring arrives earlier than it does in Des Moines. I’ve seen iris. Dogwood. And yes, azaleas — loads of them.
And in between stops, I found myself caught in the middle of a breakdown between two friends — longtime friends — and tried to mediate a fragile, unraveling relationship.
I failed.
They’re in different zones.
According to the 2023 USDA Hardiness Zone Map, Des Moines is in Zone 5b, where winter temperatures can dip to -15°F. That’s a harsh climate. Only the hardiest plants can survive there.
Annapolis, by contrast, is in Zone 8a. Here, the winters are softer. The growing season is longer. The soil more forgiving. Azaleas — my mother’s coral-pink azaleas — thrive here.
  (Photo by Julie Gammack)
Some relationships are like that. They need the right climate: the right light, the right soil, the right rhythm of warmth and cold. And some, like azaleas in Iowa — just won’t survive. You can try, but they won’t thrive. Not really.
Then sometimes, you move — or life moves you — and what once took great effort now grows all on its own. You look around, and love is blooming in yards and along sidewalks. It feels natural.
And sometimes… sometimes, you’re watching something wilt. A relationship struggling to survive the cold. The arctic blast of fierce emails sound colder than they were meant to. The texts land wrong — stripped of tone, they feel abrupt. Frigid.
Too frigid to survive.
I told one of them, “I wish I had a magic wand. I wish I could wave it and make peace between you.”
But I don’t. I just know what it’s like to experience life in both zones.

Demand for electricity in the Northwest could double by 2046, according to a new energy forecast from regional experts.
During the next two decades, demand could increase by between 1.8% and 3.1% annually, the Northwest Power and Conservation Council heard Tuesday. The projected growth will come primarily from companies building more data centers in the region, more electric vehicles on roads, electrifying buildings, computer chip manufacturing and the production of “green hydrogen” created by running an electrical current through water to split the molecules into hydrogen and oxygen.
 

Council staff presented the 20-year forecast for electricity demand in Oregon, Washington, Idaho and western Montana Tuesday to the council’s eight, governor-appointed members. Each state’s governor gets to appoint two representatives.
“The data centers, naturally in our forecasts, are the very early load growth driver here. They’re the big driver of near term demand,” Steven Simmons, senior energy forecasting analyst, told the council. Energy demand from data centers and from all electric vehicles in the region are expected to be equal by 2046, and demand from EVs is likely to surpass data center demand after 2046, Simmons said.
Residential and commercial demand, which includes forecasted energy demand for electric vehicle charging at homes and buildings, but does not include data centers, is expected to grow more gradually. Demand for residential and commercial energy in Washington alone will equal the combined demand from those sectors in Oregon, Idaho and Montana during the next two decades.
The energy forecast, part of the council’s forthcoming 9th Northwest Regional Power Plan to manage demand, does not yet include some possible variables that could reduce future demand, such as improved energy efficiency in cars, buildings and some industries as a response to demand, as well as growing adoption of rooftop solar on residential and commercial buildings.
But rapidly growing demand now means electricity grids in the Northwest and across the U.S. are encountering transmission constraints, and scaling infrastructure to meet demand has been slow due to supply chain delays and issues, staff said.
  Data centers 

Council staff expect the biggest growth in data center and computer chip energy demand will occur in eastern Oregon, eastern Washington, and the Portland and Boise metro areas, based on historical trends and announced projects.
There are more than 100 data centers in Oregon, according to the company Data Center Map, and there are more than 5,000 data centers throughout the U.S. according to Statista — the most in any country.
Oregon’s data center market is the fifth largest in the nation, according to Chicago-based commercial real estate group Cushman & Wakefield. Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and X, formerly named Twitter, have massive data centers in eastern Oregon as well as in The Dalles, Hillsboro and Prineville.
  What’s next 

To develop its next power plan, the council will evaluate supply side resources, including the potential for more regional windfarms, utility-scale and small-scale solar installations, better battery storage and more geothermal and fracked gas sources, among other options.
The council has published regional power plans about every five years since 1983, to lay out how the region will maintain an affordable and adequate power supply. A draft of the plan, an update from the last one that was published in 2021, is expected to be ready for public review and input by July 2026 and would be finalized by late 2026, according to council spokesperson Peter Jensen.
The Northwest Power and Conservation Council was formed in 1981 following passage of the federal Northwest Power Act. That act directed the four states to work collaboratively on regional energy planning and to stop the decline of native Columbia Basin fish species that have suffered massive population losses during the last century, primarily from the development of hydroelectric dams in the region.
Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek in February appointed two new Oregon representatives to the council: Margaret Hoffmann, of Bend, and Chuck Sams, of Pendleton. Hoffman is the former Oregon director of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Rural Development program and energy adviser to former Oregon Govs. John Kitzhaber and Kate Brown.
Sams, former executive director of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, was most recently director of the National Park Service. Sams briefly served on the council in 2021 before he was appointed to run the Park Service.

(Photo provided by Dan Hougentogler)When a poultry farm tests positive for bird flu, the clock starts.
Within the first 72 hours, farmers start depopulating, an industry term for killing contaminated flocks.
Despite the sweltering heat inside the barns, hired workers wear gloves, face masks and other protective equipment and repetitively pick up flailing, sick chickens and place them into a metal container filled with carbon dioxide. In a few minutes, the chickens are dead.
In other cases, workers seal the barn doors and crank up the temperature, causing the birds to die from heat stroke, or flood the barn with a suffocating foam. In a few hours, most of the chickens are dead and workers begin to haul thousands, if not millions, of lifeless caracasses out to dump trucks.
The stench of death seeps into workers’ clothes, sweat and even the water they’re supposed to shower in.
This is the business of killing chickens during the ongoing bird flu epidemic. And business is booming.
As the virus spreads and drives up grocery prices by shrinking the nation’s supply of eggs and meat, bird disposal companies, environmental waste businesses and large poultry producers have received millions of federal dollars to kill flocks, compost their bodies and clean barns across the country.
However, the scale and urgency of these recent depopulation events have left room for worker protections to fall through the cracks, Investigate Midwest has found.
A review of thousands of pages of state depopulation inspection records and conversations with dozens of people who work behind the scenes has revealed:


Underage workers, in some cases, have been hired to kill poultry flocks, handle dead carcasses and clean industrial poultry farms.
Workers sometimes lack personal protective equipment or receive damaged gear, despite the risk of the virus jumping from animals to people.
Dealing with a federal backlog, some farms have used killing methods considered inhumane because it can be quicker and cheaper.


“The biggest factor in agricultural safety is the urgency,” said Bethany Alcauter, director of research and public health for the National Center for Farmworker Health, a Texas-based nonprofit that advocates for worker safety and health. “Everything has to get done in a short amount of time and that really can be problematic because there’s not the same amount of time to adequately train workers.”
The current bird flu outbreak is also the first time in the nation’s history that the U.S. Department of Agriculture has put a single federal contractor in charge of responding to outbreaks when a business or state agriculture department can’t handle a farm’s depopulation request.

In the past, the USDA would train emergency response contractors across the country to deal with outbreaks in their state and region.
This practice changed with the most recent outbreak when the USDA awarded a contract to Patriot Environmental Services to be the single provider of federal depopulation services.
The use of a single federal contractor has caused delays when a farm requests assistance from the federal government to depopulate a flock, according to depopulation consultants, veterinarians and state agriculture agencies interviewed.
  An excerpt of an email exchange between reporter John McCracken and CDPHE spokesperson David Ellenberger regarding the results of a CDPHE farmworker survey.

No interpreters. No PPE. Just blood stains and feathers.
In July 2024, hundreds of workers descended on two poultry farms in rural Colorado, an hour northeast of Denver, to kill over 3 million egg-laying chickens.
Two of the state’s largest egg companies had tested positive for bird flu and their flocks needed to be destroyed.
Officials with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE), the USDA and the Centers for Disease Control were onsite at both outbreaks to monitor for symptoms of human exposure to the virus and to spot behavioral health concerns — that is, the psychological impact of performing high-volume animal killings in hazardous, often distressing conditions.
CDPHE forms obtained by Investigate Midwest through public records requests show agency workers interviewing primarily Spanish-speaking workers. A behavioral health worker wrote in a daily report that USDA staff approached farm management and asked if they could meet with full-time farm employees to discuss working conditions, to which management said “absolutely not.”

“They did not have the ability to go to the workers with us and did not have anyone who could be an interpreter for us,” the behavioral health worker wrote in a report, referring to USDA employees onsite.
A separate behavioral health official wrote that they witnessed workers with torn or missing PPE, PPE not being utilized, and saw “animal matter, including blood stains and feathers” on workers’ torn PPE.

The same behavioral health official noted that culling and disposal workers were required to shower at the entrance and exit of the barn, but workers said several people were not showering because the “water has a dead chicken smell” and “the horrible smell stays on the skin.”
One of the July 2024 outbreaks was at an Opal Foods commercial egg facility in Roggen, Colorado, where 1.8 million egg-laying hens were killed. Opal is a private company headquartered in Neosho, Missouri, and partially owned by Indiana-based Rose Acre Farms, the nation’s second-largest egg production company.
Opal Foods has received $24 million in payments from the USDA to cover the cost of the lost flocks since 2022, a federal response known as “indemnity payments.”
The other outbreak occurred at Morning Fresh Farms, half an hour away in Platteville, Colorado, where 1.2 million egg-laying chickens were killed. Morning Fresh is a subsidiary of Versova Holding, the nation’s fifth-largest egg-production company, which employs more than 2,000 people and purchased Morning Fresh in 2023.
Morning Fresh received nearly $7 million in indemnity payments in 2022 and 2023, but federal data does not list them, or their parent company as a recipient of funds in 2024.
Depopulation workers on both farms spent hours each day picking up chickens, putting them in metal rolling carts and filling the carts with carbon dioxide.
This process subdues and kills the birds in a few minutes but poses a danger to workers because of the repeated exposure chicken handlers have to sick birds, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association, a nonprofit that set guidelines for depopulation methods with the USDA in 2019.

Underage labor flagged during bird flu response in Colorado
Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment employees surveyed contract workers at both Colorado facilities to monitor for symptoms of bird flu and in a subsequent report, the Centers for Diseases Control showed workers self-identifying as young as 15.
The Colorado Youth Employment Opportunity Act prevents workers under 18 from performing hazardous work such as euthanasia and disposal of animal carcasses unless performed in certain programs, such as student-learning initiatives, agricultural education opportunities like 4-H, and work apprenticeship training, according to a department spokesperson.
The Colorado health agency confirmed with Investigate Midwest that workers under the age of 18 were present based on self-reported answers to survey questions and conversations with farm staff. The department did not provide the specific ages of workers, citing state privacy records laws.
Investigate Midwest also received records through the Freedom of Information Act for Occupational Health and Safety Administration, or OSHA, inspections done at both facilities in July and August 2024.
The records included the names of four contract labor companies interviewed by OSHA, two of which matched company names provided by the Colorado Department of Public Health.
All four contract labor companies denied using employees under the age of 18.
Aaron Garcia, owner of Atlas Labor and Staffing Solutions, which was hired during the Colorado outbreak, said his company and other contractors were working at both egg farms around the same time, given their proximity to each other and similar outbreak timeframes.
Garcia said he has heard of agriculture contract companies hiring underage workers throughout the bird flu epidemic, but his company has not done so.
He said his company, based in Iowa, was paid to provide laborers who cleaned and disinfected barns and provide laundry services for workers’ uniforms. For a few days, his crew picked up dead birds and placed them in disposal trucks. He said all of his workers’ ages were verified through federal E-Verify services.
“It’s illegal, in the first place, and it does affect the reputation of the guys that are actually trying to do it right and follow the laws,” he said.
Brian Mouw, a manager with D&H Poultry Services based in Sibley, Iowa, who was contracted to work at Opal Foods during the July 2024 outbreak, said all of their employees’ ages are verified before being hired.

“The other 200-275 people were with three other contractors hired by Opal, it could’ve been them,” he said in an email to Investigate Midwest. “They didn’t work under us.”
Khali Depardo, chief operating officer at 5280 Staffing, a Colorado-based staffing agency listed on OSHA documents as a contractor for Morning Fresh Farms, said his company “does not hire anyone under the age of 18, at any time.”
A spokesperson for Express Employment Professionals, an Oklahoma-based staffing agency also listed as a contractor in OSHA documents, said its Greeley, Colorado, office does contract work with Morning Fresh Farms but was not contracted to provide labor related to bird flu depopulation.
“Express Employment Professionals of Greeley, CO., has not employed individuals under 18 years old at Morning Fresh Farms,” the staffing agency spokesperson said in an email.

Investigate Midwest provided its findings of potential underage workers and their tasks to the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment. An agency spokesperson said it was unaware of any underage labor working on commercial egg farms.
“Without a full investigation, we are unable to definitively determine whether the work at issue was ‘hazardous’ under Colorado law, and if so was otherwise permissible, and we cannot opine on federal law as that is outside of our authority,” the spokesperson said.

Asked about the Colorado case, a U.S. Department of Labor spokesperson said it “is not clear” whether the specific case violates federal laws.

Federal child labor regulations prohibit workers under the age of 16 from conducting certain hazardous tasks while working on farms, such as working with pesticides and chemicals, but makes no mention of the gases and tactics used to kill poultry during depopulation.
The commercial egg companies behind culling events in July of 2024 denied the use of child labor as well as the hiring of contractors who used child labor.
“Morning Fresh Farms holds the highest standards for ensuring all employees are eligible to work,” a company spokesperson said in a statement provided to Investigate Midwest. “Our company has no awareness of any underage labor issues by contracting companies working on our farm during our response to highly pathogenic avian influenza.”
Versova Holdings, parent company to Morning Fresh Farms, did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
“Opal Foods, LLC is a separate, independent company in which Rose Acre Farms has partial ownership,” said a spokesperson for Rose Acre Farms, parent company of Opal Foods. “We do not know all the details nor can we speak to Opal Foods’ internal operations, but Rose Acre Farms is not aware of any instances of underage hiring at Opal Foods, LLC. You should however direct your questions regarding this issue to Opal Foods.”
Opal Foods did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
The USDA’s one-contractor system. Efficient or overloaded?
Over 168 million birds have been depopulated in the U.S. since early 2022, the majority of which have been at commercial operations. When a flock is killed, the USDA can compensate producers for the loss of revenue and the cost to depopulate.
Currently, operators are paid a flat fee for depopulation and disposal fees, regardless of whether the farm handles the killing on their own or hires a contractor. Producers are reimbursed $1.62 per bird for egg-laying chickens, $2.95 per meat chickens, $4.50 for turkeys and just over $5 per duck, as of February 2025, according to USDA documents.
When a farm doesn’t have the resources or money to kill a flock on its own, the state’s agriculture department is contacted. If the state does not have access to equipment or labor, a USDA-approved contract company steps in and kills the birds.
Patriot Environmental Services is the nation’s only federal contractor able to provide depopulation services when requested by the USDA.
The company is a subsidiary of the national environmental cleanup company Crystal-Clean and is headquartered in Los Angeles, California, with 18 locations across the country.
Parent company Crystal-Clean works with oil spills and waste management and is owned by the private equity firm J.F. Lehman & Company. Crystal-Clean was fined $1.1 million in 2023 by the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for failure to have proper permitting and handling of hazardous waste materials.

Patriot Environmental Services has received more than $18 million in USDA poultry depopulation contracts since the beginning of the most recent outbreak, a figure that accounts for nearly a quarter of all depopulation contracts, technical assistance payments, research and grant funding related to bird flu funded by the federal government.
This money has been paid to private companies, state agencies, universities and research groups related to poultry depopulation.
Federal contracts and grants related to poultry depopulation during the ongoing outbreak have exceeded the total amount spent during the 2014 to 2015 outbreak of bird flu, from $68 million to $73 million and counting.

In some states, poultry producers receive technical training from the state department of agriculture on proper depopulation methods and previously, the USDA would train emergency response companies across the country to handle outbreaks, according to Dan Hougentogler, an emergency response and depopulation consultant with nearly two decades of experience in the animal disease outbreak and research industry.
This practice changed with the most recent outbreak when the USDA awarded a contract to Patriot Environmental Services to be the single provider of federal depopulation services.
Hougentogler said this switch has caused a bottleneck when multiple farms need access to the federal services at the same time.
A common depopulation tactic is to fill barns with suffocating foam and Patriot Environmental Services is the only company that can access the federal foaming equipment, he said.

A state agency located in the same area as the national equipment has to wait for Patriot Environmental Services to deploy a team and use the equipment, even if they have staff trained to operate the equipment, he continued.
“Not having an expansive, trained network to operate this federal equipment, or allowing states to utilize the equipment that’s just sitting here with minimal people to use it, does cause some concern,” Hougentogler said.
The nation’s largest poultry companies do not typically use a third party for depopulation services, according to a spokesperson for the National Chicken Council, an industry advocacy group whose board members include executive leaders of several major poultry processors.
The U.S. Poultry & Egg Association, whose members include leadership at Rose Acre Foods, Versova and Cal-Maine Foods, said its members follow all guidelines set by the American Veterinary Medical Association and referred questions to the USDA.
The USDA, Patriot Environmental Services and Crystal-Clean did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
In some cases, the backlog has caused companies to use more controversial methods of depopulation because they do not have the equipment or labor on hand to complete the killings in the needed time frame.
Hougentogler said he was aware of turkey farms that used “less appropriate methods” when they couldn’t access the federal contracts in time. He noted an example where a turkey farm used ventilation shutdown and heat, referred to in the industry as VSD+, to depopulate a flock of commercial poultry.
VSD+ is a controversial method of killing animals, but is currently accepted by industry standards set by the American Veterinary Medical Association.
The USDA and the AVMA note that VSD+ is to be used only in “constrained circumstances,” but the majority of birds killed during the ongoing outbreak have been killed using ventilation shutdown.

Workers close off the circulation of air and seal entrances to barns with ventilation shutdown, oftentimes adding extra heating units to increase the temperature.

“Ultimately, the goal is to have the production system and the state veterinarian agree on what is best for both the production system and animal welfare,” Hougentogler said. “We are depopulating the animal regardless, but until they are unconscious, we should still take as much care for them as possible.”
Utah state veterinarian Amanda Price told Investigate Midwest that the state was able to receive help from the federal contractor Patriot Environmental Services when requested, but some instances were delayed by a few days. This resulted in farms using ventilation shutdown in an effort to stay within target time frames meant to prevent virus spread.
Crystal Heath, a California-based veterinarian and co-founder of Our Honor, a nonprofit group of veterinarian members that advocate against using ventilation shutdowns in the U.S., said that ventilation shutdown is a cruel method to kill flocks.
The practice is banned in the European Union and has been criticized for its cruelty to animals in both commercial pork and poultry depopulation.










“If producers are going to get bailout money, they should put plans in place to depopulate with less cruel methods.”


– Crystal Heath, veterinarian and co-founder of Our Honor


“If (producers) are going to get bailout money, they should put plans in place to depopulate with less cruel methods,” Heath said.
The American Veterinary Medical Association is currently reviewing proposals to update its depopulation guidance and is expected to announce changes later this year. The AVMA did not respond to a request for comment.
McDonald’s egg supplier kills millions of birds in Michigan with VSD+
Once a farm has depopulated its flock, the work isn’t over.
Carcasses, feed, eggs, manure, and other organic materials are gathered and composted or disposed of, a process that requires a fleet of equipment and workers.
Michigan, a state with 31 confirmed cases of bird flu in dairy cattle herds, has had 16 commercial poultry farms infected with bird flu since 2022, with more than 7 million birds killed.
Most birds killed in Michigan were at egg-laying commercial farms using the ventilation shutdown method, according to USDA data.
“Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) isn’t going to discuss details about the responses done on individual farms as most of that information is protected by Michigan law,” MDARD Director Tim Boring said in a statement provided to Investigate Midwest in response to questions about the use of ventilation shutdown.
“At every facility, we are balancing multiple priorities; including, but not limited to, stopping the spread of the disease, animal welfare, practicality given the structure, and of course safety of the people involved,” the statement continued.
Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development HPAI activity logs obtained via public records requests.
Documents obtained through records requests from the Michigan Department of Agriculture show Herbruck’s Poultry Ranch, the state’s largest egg-producer and supplier of eggs to McDonald’s, disposing of dozens of dump trucks filled with chickens by the day during a depopulation that occurred in April 2024.
Records referred to Herbruck trucks hauling caracasses to be composted at an outbreak site named “IO 02,” which is a reference to “Ionia 02.” This was the site of an April 2022 depopulation event that killed 2.1 million egg-laying chickens.
Herbrucks used ventilation shutdown to kill the flock, based on USDA depopulation data and references to renting and using “heaters” made in the daily logs filled out by staff on site.
Daily worker logs describe days where 55 loads of dead chickens and other material were hauled off the farms to be composted or sent to a landfill.
Contracted environmental waste companies, composting companies, labor and disinfecting crews hauled dead birds and contaminated materials to nearby landfills as well as composted the dead carcassess.
Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development HPAI activity logs obtained via public records requests.
Composting the bodies of birds infected with bird flu is a common practice in disposal and requires all organic material to reach an internal temperature of at least 130 degrees Fahrenheit for three days in order to kill the virus and other pathogens.
Contaminated feed, manure, bodies, eggs and other waste are stacked into large mounds, monitored for internal temperatures and eventually spread back onto land as fertilization.
Herbruck, which received $89 million in indemnity payments for the flocks killed by VSD+, was part of fast-food giant McDonald’s push for cage-free eggs and the decision to “prioritize the health and welfare of the animals,” according to a 2024 company press release.
Herbruck announced it was laying off hundreds of workers in Michigan a month after its 2024 bird flu outbreak.
Mohamed Mousa, Herbruck vice president, declined to answer questions about the company’s depopulation events and bird flu outbreaks. In an email, Mousa said the company does not have a media contact and is trying to “move on.”

State attorneys general are urging concerned customers to delete their data, while experts warn that state and federal laws may not fully protect their privacy. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The fate of more than 15 million customers’ genetic data remains in limbo after popular DNA testing company 23andMe filed for bankruptcy in March. The data is up for sale, stoking fears about how it might be used and prompting attorneys general from more than a dozen states to warn 23andMe users: Delete your data.
“Your genetic data is your most personal, confidential data, and you should be able to protect who has access to it,” North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson, a Democrat, said in a March statement.
“You have the power to delete your data now — please act quickly.”
Dr. Adam Brown, a Washington, D.C.-based emergency physician and the founder of a health care strategy firm, deleted his information on 23andMe as soon as he learned of the bankruptcy filing, he told Stateline.
For him, the bankruptcy begs a vital question that federal and state laws don’t fully address: What happens to your genetic data when the company holding it collapses?
Federal protections are flimsy. States have beefed up their genetic privacy laws in recent years, but many experts say they don’t go far enough.

“I urge Nevadans to access their accounts on 23andMe’s website and consider deleting their shared genetic data in order to ensure their privacy. 23andMe has indicated they will continue to honor such actions, and users should make use of this option as soon as possible.” – Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford, in a statement on March 26

23andMe has said the bankruptcy will not change how it stores, manages or protects its trove of sensitive customer information. In a news release issued shortly after the bankruptcy announcement, the company said any potential buyers would have to agree to comply with 23andMe’s consumer privacy policy and all applicable laws. When contacted by Stateline, the company declined to comment beyond what it has published in news releases and information it posted for customers on its website.
But once the data is in the hands of another company, that company could change its privacy policy at any time, experts noted.
“Once you get to the point of bankruptcy court, there may not be those same guarantees or the same ethos a new company may have around privacy protections for consumers,” Brown said.
“I want people to understand there actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.”
 HIPAA doesn’t help

Companies such as 23andMe offer their users potentially game-changing revelations about their health and ancestry. The process is simple: Mail in a saliva sample and the company uses it to build an individual genetic profile that can reveal not only a person’s family connections, but also health insights such as their risk of developing a disease like cancer or Alzheimer’s.
This valuable personal data underpins a direct-to-customer genetic testing market that was valued at $1.93 billion globally in 2023 and is expected to grow, according to market research firm Grand View Research.
23andMe was an industry giant until its stock price plummeted following a massive 2023 data breach that affected the accounts of nearly 7 million customers. Then came the $30 million class-action lawsuit settlement.
The company declared bankruptcy in late March of this year, and announced it’s up for sale.
States Battle Big Tech Over Data Privacy Laws

A flurry of alerts from state attorneys general around the country soon followed. AGs from states including Nevada, Alabama, Arizona, California, Kentucky, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Texas issued similar press releases that recommended customers ask the company to delete their genetic profile and destroy the saliva sample used to create it.
“I urge Nevadans to access their accounts on 23andMe’s website and consider deleting their shared genetic data in order to ensure their privacy. 23andMe has indicated they will continue to honor such actions, and users should make use of this option as soon as possible,” Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford, a Democrat, said in a March statement.
The fear is that a new 23andMe owner could choose to use or share sensitive personal genetic data in ways the company’s current privacy policy doesn’t allow. There’s worry it could be used, for example, to inflate people’s life insurance premiums or expose them to employment discrimination.
And there aren’t many guardrails to prevent that from happening.
HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, doesn’t apply to companies like 23andMe. The landmark federal law protects patients’ sensitive health information when it’s handled by doctors, hospitals and health insurers. But direct-to-customer companies such as 23andMe or Ancestry aren’t considered health care providers, and their non-invasive saliva collection kit isn’t considered a medical test.
The main federal law that protects people from discrimination based on their genetic information is nearly 20 years old. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) was passed in 2008, long before the rise of at-home testing kits. It applies to employers and health insurers, but not to life insurance companies, mortgage lenders and other non-health entities. And it doesn’t explicitly protect epigenetic information, which is information about the way a person’s genes — and by extension, health — are affected by outside factors such as smoking, disease or stress.
 What states are doing

In the past five years, at least 14 states have passed laws regulating direct-to-consumer genetic testing offered by companies like Ancestry and 23andMe. There’s variation, but generally the laws require companies to get customers’ express consent before using or sharing their data, and allow customers to request their genetic data be deleted and biological samples destroyed.
It’s a good start, but doesn’t go far enough, said Anya Prince, a University of Iowa law professor whose research focuses on health and genetic privacy.
Many of those state efforts were built around a model law developed by the Coalition for Genetic Data Protection, an industry group with two member companies: 23andMe and Ancestry.
DNA Databases Are Boon to Police But Menace to Privacy, Critics Say

As DNA testing kits exploded in popularity and attracted increased scrutiny from lawmakers, the coalition pushed to influence legislation and set industry standards. The privacy protections in the laws mirror what 23andMe and Ancestry were already doing with their own privacy policies, experts say.
“They do have some really sensible privacy protections,” said Prince. “It’s great that people can delete their genetic data, and it’s great that law enforcement needs a warrant to access it. But if a privacy advocate had written a model law, there would be the potential for more and broader protections.”
For example, she said, many of the state laws address privacy requirements just for direct-to-consumer DNA testing companies. If 23andMe’s data is bought by, say, a pharmaceutical company, those state laws no longer apply.
The coalition now appears to be inactive, its website defunct.
Since 2020, more than a dozen states have passed some version of a genetic information privacy law, including Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming, based on a Stateline analysis. This year, the Indiana legislature passed a bill that’s now headed to the governor’s desk. Bills have been introduced this year in other states, including West Virginia.
Prince said state laws rely too heavily on consumers to self-manage their data privacy. They’re expected to understand a company’s policy, when studies have shown the public often doesn’t read privacy notices nor fully understand how companies use their data. Further, many state laws don’t address how third parties, such as law enforcement, can access and use consumer genetic data.
It’s also not always clear how the laws will be enforced, or who’s responsible for oversight.
“In general, I think there’s a disconnect between how people think their privacy is protected and how it’s actually protected,” she said.
But a few states have enacted laws that are more robust. California, for example, has a genetic information privacy law, but also has a general data protection law, as well as a state version of the federal GINA law that extends genetic anti-discrimination protections into areas including housing, education and licensing.
Florida has beefed up its DNA privacy laws in recent years, making the using or selling of an individual’s DNA without informed consent a felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison and up to a $10,000 fine. Florida was also the first state to prohibit life, disability and long-term care insurance companies from using genetic information to determine coverage.

Missouri may become the first state with an income tax to exempt capital gains, but several states have considered tax cut proposals that would benefit the wealthy during this year’s legislative sessions. (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent)Missouri Republicans may take their tax-cutting efforts to new heights this year as lawmakers consider exempting profits from the sale of stocks, bonds and real estate from state income taxes.
Part of a broader push to eliminate the state income tax altogether, legislation making its way through the Capitol would provide an unprecedented benefit to the wealthy by excluding capital gains, the long-term earnings from the sale of assets. If approved, tax experts say, the legislation would mark the first time a state with an income tax has eliminated capital gains tax.
The Republican sponsors say the move would make the state more attractive for businesses and families.

“This bill is intended to energize Missouri’s economy,” Republican Speaker Pro Tem Chad Perkins said upon introducing the measure.
But state Democrats — and even some of their GOP colleagues — have criticized the measure as being overly favorable to the wealthy. Most states’ tax systems already put a higher tax burden on lower-income households. That trend only accelerated in this year’s legislative sessions, worrying advocates who want to see the rich pay a larger share.
“It is so egregious in just how grossly concentrated the benefits of the [Missouri] proposal would go to the richest people in the state and shift the state’s tax system to really privilege the owners of wealth over people who are earning a regular paycheck,” said David Cooper, an analyst at the left-leaning think tank Economic Policy Institute.
The institute advocates for progressive state taxes — those that put the proportionately largest tax burdens on the highest earners. While Cooper advises against eliminating state income taxes, he said the Missouri move would be more harmful than eliminating the income tax outright.
“If you’re wiping away the income tax altogether, there’s at least some tax benefit going to lower-earning folks who are still paying income taxes,” he said. “If you’re just eliminating capital gains income taxes, you are just giving away money to the wealthiest people in the state, period.”










It is so egregious in just how grossly concentrated the benefits of the proposal would go to the richest people in the state.


–  David Cooper, Economic Policy Institute analyst


Some Democratic-led states, including Maryland and Washington, have moved to increase taxes on the wealthy this year. But several states — including Kansas, Kentucky and Mississippi — have made more regressive tax changes.
Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, noted that states still prioritize progressive spending through social service programs aiding the most vulnerable residents.
He said states compete against each other for business and residents in much more immediate ways than the federal government competes against other nations.
“So states are very focused on the competitive advantages associated with a pro-growth tax regime,” he said, “and that has led to less of an emphasis in many states on achieving progressivity through the tax code.”
 ‘Generational change’ to taxes

While several states have enacted high-profile tax cuts this year, the momentum is actually slowing, Walczak said.
With booming economies and an influx of federal cash in recent years, conservative and liberal states alike passed significant tax cuts. Of the 43 states that have some sort of income tax, 28 have made rate reductions since 2021, Walczak said.
“In many states, lawmakers simply accomplished much of what they had set out to do,” he said.
Economic uncertainty and the prospect of reduced federal aid also have made many lawmakers more cautious this legislative season, he said.
But lawmakers in several states — including Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia — have continued their march to eliminate state income taxes.
“Taxing people’s wages is bad because it undermines liberty,” Oklahoma state Sen. Dusty Deevers, a Republican, said this month in support of a proposed income tax cut, the Oklahoma Voice reported. “It undermines people’s freedoms. If government controls income, then it controls your life.”
Cutting services or raising taxes: State lawmakers weigh how to fill big budget gaps

This session, Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear signed a bill cutting the state income tax rate from 4% to 3.5%. Republican lawmakers have been slashing rates for years with the ultimate aim of eliminating the income tax altogether, despite concerns that more reliance on sales tax would disproportionately burden the poor. To partially offset the income tax reduction, the legislature expanded sales taxes to more services in 2018.
And Republican lawmakers in Kansas overrode a veto from Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly to move away from the state’s graduated income tax toward a flat tax of 4% that will mostly benefit the highest earners.
Last month, Mississippi Republican Gov. Tate Reeves signed legislation granting another cut in the state income tax. Officials there aim to phase out the income tax altogether over the coming years with gradual rate reductions, which Reeves characterized as “a generational change” for the state.
The Mississippi law also reduces the sales tax on groceries and increases the gas tax. Though the governor is already celebrating the end of state income tax, the law provides for incremental reductions in the coming years only if the state hits certain revenue targets.
Republican state Rep. Trey Lamar, a legislative sponsor, said income taxes disincentivize work — a particular problem for the state with the nation’s lowest workforce participation rate.
“A tax on work is a tax on productivity,” he said.
The left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy says the law will make the state’s tax system more inequitable. Its analysis found that when fully implemented, the top 1% of households, who have average annual incomes of $1.4 million, will receive an average cut of $41,420, or roughly 3% of their annual income. But the bottom 20% of earners, who have average annual incomes of $13,400, would realize a tax cut of just $42 per year.
Lamar noted the legislation did not increase sales taxes across the board. With average sales tax burdens already lower than neighboring states like Alabama, he said the income tax elimination will only help Mississippi workers.
“We need more people working,” he said. “So if helping the working man is somehow seen as regressive, then I’d have to say I don’t fully understand that.”
Blue and red states slash taxes despite warnings of hard times ahead

Walczak, of the Tax Foundation, said the state can afford the initial rate reduction. But it’s unclear whether state revenues will hit the targets needed — and whether lawmakers will reassess the aim of eliminating income taxes.
As one of the nation’s poorest states, Mississippi is heavily reliant on federal funding and would be particularly vulnerable to an economic downturn.
“There’s not a guarantee that the state could afford that in the future, and Mississippi does not have a large budget to begin with, so that would be harder than in most other states if the economy slid,” he said. “It does require a willingness on lawmakers’ parts to be honest with themselves if the economy changes and decide whether a pause might be necessary.”
 An uneven tax burden

Economic uncertainty and slowing revenues have put many states into budget holes this year, forcing lawmakers to consider spending cuts or tax increases.
To close budget gaps, some conservative and liberal states have considered new or higher taxes on marijuana, tobacco and soda.
But some liberal-led states are looking to taxes more focused on the wealthy. In Rhode Island, Democratic Gov. Daniel McKee has proposed a 10% tax on digital advertising revenue.
In Washington state, lawmakers approved raising capital gains taxes and business taxes to close a looming deficit, though it’s unclear whether Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson, who has voiced skepticism, will sign off on those measures.
Maryland lawmakers, facing a $3 billion deficit, recently approved $1.6 billion in new taxes and fees. That includes two new high-income tax brackets and a new 3% sales tax on information technology and data services.
Child tax credits, long a liberal priority, find favor in Republican states

Moves like those that ask more of the wealthy could make some state tax systems more progressive, said Aidan Davis, the state policy director at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. But most state tax proposals approved this year have primarily benefited the highest earners.
That’s particularly concerning because most state systems already favor the wealthy. In 41 states, the top 1% of earners pay a lower effective tax rate than any other group, according to an institute study.
In Missouri, the fate of the first-of-its-kind capital gains tax elimination remains up in the air.
Though versions of the proposal have passed both chambers, there are differences between the Senate and House legislation. That means the bill could go back to conference committee for further negotiation or go on to Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe, who has identified capital gains among his tax cut priorities this year.
Missouri’s Department of Revenue estimated the exemption could cost $111 million per year. But an Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy analysis of IRS data projects the change could cost $600 million or more.
If approved, the top 5% of Missouri households — those making more than $273,000 per year — will receive more than 80% of the benefit from capital gains exemption, Davis said.
“Doing so would let wealthy people collect tax-free passive income while you’re continuing to tax middle class workers and people with savings,” Davis said. “It’s just a really extreme proposal.”

DemasMichigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson’s office made nearly 2,000 pages of election documents public Friday after providing them to a legislative oversight committee.
The Michigan Department of State materials include training newsletters sent to clerks, the clerk training accreditation manual and the Election Day “flip chart” manual used by election workers at the polls.
Combined with documents previously released to the committee, there are now more than 3,000 pages of election documents available on the department’s website.
A press release from the department said it will continue to release additional materials after reviewing them to redact any sensitive information that it says could compromise election security.
“Everyone at the Michigan Department of State is committed to transparency and openness to the people we serve,” said Khyla Craine, the department’s chief legal director. “We are also committed to protecting sensitive information which, if publicly released, could be used by bad actors to interfere with the chain of custody of ballots, tamper with election equipment, or impersonate a clerk on Election Day.”
But Rep. Rachelle Smit (R-Martin), who chairs the House Election Integrity Committee, said the documents provided so far have primarily been newsletters that do not match the training materials requested by legislators.
“Leave it to our Secretary of State to ‘transparently’ dump 1,900 pages of the wrong stuff on a Friday afternoon,” Smit said. “We will conduct a thorough review of everything her department released today. But, after sifting through the information for several hours, we’ve yet to see much of the substantive training materials we requested. Secretary Benson knows what we are asking for, and she [is] refusing to give us access anyway.”
Benson’s office says reviewing the documents has “required hundreds of hours and cost thousands of taxpayer dollars to review and produce.”
While the House Oversight Committee voted last month to issue a subpoena for the documents, the department says it will “continue to release additional materials to the Committee and on the public site once the department’s legal and election security teams are able to review them and redact any sensitive information that could compromise election security.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG_0978-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-04 08:04:22.884405

If you’ve ever heard someone make a flippant joke about not wanting their headstone to read that “she kept a clean house,” it may have gotten you thinking. You probably never have, on visits to a loved one’s monument, found references to a person’s career, hobbies or habits. Instead, it’s the human qualities within us that are cherished and remembered. This week’s featured poet, Ev Tower-Pierce of East Burke, celebrates the everyday moments of kindness, rather than the grand gestures, that bring us all together.Kindness, accidentallyEv Tower-Pierce, 17, East BurkeI did not know kindness isn’t always loud,not the grand gestures, not thethrow-the-coat-over-a-puddle –because sometimesit is simply someone sitting on the ground just because you did, even though there’s a perfectly good chairand they’re wearing white pants.Sometimes,it’s the way they swing your hand while walking, no rhythm,just something they can’t help, or it’s the way someone grabs your arm mid-laugh, like the joke was too big for one body,like joy needed somewhere else to go.Someone spinning while they’re waiting for the microwave,skipping stairs just to feel a second of flight,swaying in the kitchen with you,arms around your ribs, like there’s musiconly you can hear.It’sthe breath someone takes at an open window,like the sky has said their name.The way they pull their chair closer to yours,not because they can’t hear you,but because they want to.Someone waiting for your laugh before they keep talking,letting you hum, letting you be,someone asking if you’re okaywhen you’re crying on the phonein the middle of the street,reminding you you’re not invisible.It’s no big deal, just a hundred tiny thingsthat say, I see you, I see you, I see you,without making it a thing.And maybe you don’t notice at first,maybe you’re still unlearning how to flinch –but something in youstarts to relax.And suddenly,you’re laughing with your whole body,spinning in hallways,breathing deeper at windows,pulling your chair closer too.Maybe that’s the point.Maybe kindness isn’t the starring role –just the reasonthe story gets to keep going.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Young Writers Project: ‘Kindness, accidentally’.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ywp-Digger-5.5.25.jpg?fit=984%2C703&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-04 08:04:22.884405

The effort to make Canada the 14th colony had proved a failure. Although it was never a colony, Vermont, not Canada, would become the 14th state.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Then Again: Ethan and Ira’s Canadian debacles.","American General Richard Montgomery was honored with poems, pamphlets, monuments and paintings after his death at the Battle of Quebec in 1775. John Trumbull’s romanticized depiction of Montgomery’s death is in the collection of the Yale University Art Gallery. Photo via Wikimedia CommonsIf Ethan and Ira Allen had their way, Canada would have been America’s 14th colony. The Allen brothers were hardly alone in pushing to have Canada join the United States. In 1774, delegates to the First Continental Congress, including Benjamin Franklin and John Adams, published an open letter to the Province of Quebec, urging Canadians to join their struggle against the British government. All they heard back was crickets.So the following year, the Allens joined more than 3,000 other colonists to try a different approach with Canada — invasion. The belief was that if the colonists made a show of force, then French Canadians, who represented a majority of European settlers in the region, would rise up against their British overlords. This Canadian-American alliance would deprive Britain of a staging area for invading the United Colonies. (This was so early in the war that the name “United States of America” hadn’t yet been coined.) It would also significantly expand the landmass and population of the Colonies. The invasion, however, would turn disastrous for the colonists, and Ethan in particular. Ethan was full of confidence in 1775 — when was he ever lacking in confidence? — because in May he had led troops in America’s first offensive victory of the war by capturing Fort Ticonderoga on the New York shore of Lake Champlain. Actually, he jointly led forces that night — working beside Benedict Arnold, who was perhaps America’s most effective officer before turning traitor. Also, the fort was crumbling and only lightly defended by British troops who had no warning an attack might come. Still, this was an important American success and made the 37-year-old Ethan Allen a household name. After capturing the fort, Arnold acted on news that a British sloop was anchored at the north end of the lake near Saint-Jean (St. Johns), Quebec. He hoped to seize it before news of Ticonderoga’s fall spread. Boarding a schooner stolen from a prominent Tory, Arnold and his crew captured the sloop without firing a shot. For good measure, they burned several smaller boats and raided supplies from the fort at Saint-Jean. Arnold declared, “At present, we are Masters of the Lake.” As the main route between British Canada and the Colonies, the lake was strategically invaluable.Sailing south with their prize, Arnold’s force encountered a group of four boats paddling north. The 100 weary men aboard the boats had been hurriedly organized by Ethan, so hastily, in fact, that they lacked sufficient rations. Nevertheless, Ethan seemed eager to outdo Arnold, announcing that his motley crew would take the town of Saint-Jean. Arnold tried to talk Ethan out of this rash plan. He failed.“100 mad fellows are going to take possession of St. John’s,” Arnold later wrote in his journal. “… A wild, impractical expensive Scheme. Of no Consequence.”And little chance of success. Ethan’s flotilla reached Saint-Jean after dark. The exhausted men secured their boats and promptly fell asleep on the riverbank. By then, 200 British soldiers had reinforced the town. At dawn, Ethan’s men were jolted awake by the sound of cannons firing from the opposite shore. Clearly outnumbered and outgunned, Ethan and his men retreated, hastily. Leaping into their boats and paddling out of range, they abandoned three of their compatriots, one of whom was captured. The other two walked the 100 miles south to Ticonderoga. Ethan Allen, here depicted in a sculpture at the U.S. Capitol by Vermont artist Larkin Mead, was captured in 1775 while trying to seize Montreal with a small force. Photo via Wikimedia CommonsThat summer Ethan returned to Canada, this time as a scout for the American army. His Green Mountain Boys had transformed into the Green Mountain Rangers, a regiment in the Continental Army. As part of the reorganization, troops elected the level-headed Seth Warner to lead them. Perhaps fearing Ethan’s recklessness, they opted not to give him a leadership role. His brothers Ira and Heman, however, were named as officers.  Ethan proved effective as a scout, moving freely behind enemy lines, recruiting French-Canadians and members of the native population to fight the British during the coming American offensive. “I … have two hundred and fifty Canadians under arms; as I march, they gather fast,” Ethan reported to invasion commander Gen. Richard Montgomery. He sent most of the men to Montgomery, but still had nearly 100 with him when he decided to improvise — he would lead the capture of Montreal. Working with Major John Brown, who had about 200 recruits of his own, Ethan devised a plan to use their forces to simultaneously attack Montreal from opposite directions, even though Montgomery had given no such orders. In fact, the general thought Saint-Jean a more valuable target. The assault was a fiasco. On Sept. 25, Ethan’s force descended on Montreal from the north, but the signal from Brown indicating that his men were in position to the south never came. Gen. Guy Carleton, the governor of the province of Quebec, rallied a force of Canadian, British and native fighters and advanced on the invaders. Ethan and 38 of his men were captured. He would spend the next two and a half years a prisoner of war. “I thought to have enrolled my name in the list of illustrious American heroes,” Ethan later wrote of that day, “but was nipped in the bud.”Earlier that month, Ira Allen attained a position of trust, when Gen. Montgomery selected him to serve as a lieutenant on his staff. Ira was only 24 years old. At the time, Montgomery was beginning a siege on Fort Saint-Jean. Critical to the operation’s success was keeping Carleton’s forces trapped in Montreal, a task that fell partly to the Green Mountain Rangers. The commander of Fort Saint-Jean, realizing that reinforcements from Montreal would never arrive, surrendered on Nov. 3. The Americans quickly moved on to their next target, Montreal. Believing the town undefendable against this larger force, Carleton withdrew his troops and headed to Quebec City and its imposing citadel, located some 150 miles to the northeast. This time, the Americans took Montreal without a fight. Next, they would seize Quebec City.Ira traveled with the Continental Army to Quebec City along the St. Lawrence River. There Montgomery planned to rendezvous with Benedict Arnold and 1,100 Continental Army troops who were trekking to Quebec through the woods of what is now northern Maine. When Montgomery’s troops reached Quebec City on Dec. 1, a shocking sight awaited them. Having marched, rowed and portaged all the way from Boston, Arnold’s force was a shadow of its former self. Desertion, disease and death had thinned its ranks to about 600. Those remaining were ragged, hungry and desperately short of supplies. Anticipating that Arnold’s men would need resupplying, though perhaps not to this extent, Montgomery had brought winter clothing and provisions. Despite the poor condition of the troops and having only about 1,200 men to the Quebec citadel’s 1,800 defenders, Montgomery and Arnold stuck with the plan. When Carleton rejected a call to surrender, the Americans bombarded the town with the few mortars and cannons they possessed. Montgomery knew he couldn’t mount a successful siege; he lacked sufficient artillery and the frozen ground made it impossible for his men to dig trenches. So he planned an assault.Ira Allen, depicted here later in life, was a 24 year old when he served as an officer in the Continental Army’s invasion of Canada in 1775. Photo via the Silver Special Collections Library, University of VermontThe Americans wanted to attack on a snowy night to conceal their approach. But the weather refused to cooperate. Finally, on the night of Dec. 27, it began to snow. As the Americans assembled for the assault, however, the sky cleared and the moon lit up the night. Montgomery postponed the attack, but he had only days to act. Arnold’s troops’ enlistments were due to expire at midnight on Dec. 31, leaving the men free to return home and effectively cutting the American force in half.  It must have seemed a good omen when it began to snow on the afternoon of Dec. 30. At 2 a.m. on Dec. 31, the Americans gathered for the assault. By this point, however, the snowstorm had become a blizzard, with snow drifting to two and three feet. Ira Allen was one of two officers leading an attack on Cape Diamond, the southern corner of the town’s wall perched atop a steep bluff. But this was just a diversion. When his unit began its attack, Ira lit rockets to cue the main strike force, led by Montgomery, to launch its attack on fortifications in the Lower Town. After helping carpenters cut through a wooden palisade fence, Montgomery led his men forward, breaking into a run with his sword drawn. As the group rounded a turn in the street, the town’s defenders fired a cannon loaded with grapeshot at the attackers. A dozen men were killed by the hail of small iron balls, including Montgomery. One of the few members of the storming party to survive was Capt. Aaron Burr.With their leader dead, the Americans fell into disarray and retreated. The battle was a rout. Against the 19 British and Canadian casualties, the Americans had 60 men killed or wounded and more than 400 captured. The Americans hunkered down outside Quebec’s walls and waited through the bitter Canadian winter in hopes that the Colonies were sending reinforcements. Ira Allen remained in the American army camp until February. Then, seeing the futility of the situation, he began the trek home. Reinforcements arrived in May, but they were British troops. Their arrival persuaded the remaining American soldiers it was time to head home. They carried with them memories of a scarring defeat and a raging epidemic of smallpox that had erupted in the camp. The effort to make Canada the 14th colony had proved a failure. Although it was never a colony, Vermont, not Canada, would become the 14th state.Gen. Richard Montgomery’s death made him an international hero. Congress commissioned a memorial in his honor, pamphleteer Thomas Paine and poet Anna Eliza Bleecker wrote of him, and members of the British Parliament even praised his valour. In Vermont, Ira Allen honored him by successfully lobbying for a town to be named after him.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Then Again: Ethan and Ira’s Canadian debacles.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/The_Death_of_General_Montgomery_in_the_Attack_on_Quebec_December_31_1775-scaled.jpeg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-04 08:04:22.884405

The Legislature is maintaining its self-imposed climate obligations while simultaneously acknowledging that their proposed solutions are both impractical and too expensive.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Sec. Julie Moore and Commissioner Kerrick Johnson: Unfunded laws have only theoretical benefits.","This commentary is by Julie Moore, secretary of the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources, and Kerrick Johnson, commissioner of the Vermont Department of Public Service.Vermont’s Global Warming Solutions Act and Climate Superfund Act (Act 122) have created legal mandates, but — so far — the Legislature has not provided the necessary funding for this work. Without action from the Legislature in the near term, it is not clear how these laws can be implemented effectively, with potentially costly consequences. It is simply unwise to take a wait-and-see approach, as has been suggested by several legislators, knowing full well that more resources are needed to successfully execute the ambitious vision of these acts.In 2020, the Vermont Legislature passed the Global Warming Solutions Act over Gov. Phil Scott’s veto. This significant legislation created legal mandates to reduce climate pollution and established a “right of action” allowing special interests to sue state government if Vermont fails to meet these self-imposed obligations.Over the last two years, the Legislature identified two different policy approaches to raise the hundreds of millions of dollars needed to meet the mandates of the GWSA and directed the evaluation of both: a clean heat standard and a cap-and-invest framework. Unfortunately, independent, nonpartisan analyses found both schemes to be administratively complex, ill-timed and expensive.Given these concerns, legislative leaders have understandably been reluctant to move forward with implementing either policy. However, legislators have also not advanced — or even discussed — other approaches to supporting the work needed to meet the GWSA’s mandates. A bill, H.289, would have helped with these challenges, but has not been meaningfully addressed by the Legislature. In other words, the Legislature is maintaining its self-imposed climate obligations while simultaneously acknowledging that their proposed solutions are both impractical and too expensive.A similar pattern is evident with the Climate Superfund Act passed in 2024. This legislation was designed to allow Vermont to recover certain climate-related costs from oil companies. As required by the act, the Agency of Natural Resources and state treasurer delivered a report in January detailing the resources needed to advance this complex work: $1.2 million in contracted support and two additional staff positions dedicated to the work and anticipated legal challenges.Gov. Scott allowed Act 122 to become law without his signature and specifically acknowledged the report-back and the ability to reassess based on the feedback provided by ANR and the Treasurer’s Office. Despite receiving this report and supporting testimony, the House-backed budget did not include critical funding for this work.It is imperative that the Legislature either prioritize the full funding to complete necessary technical studies or repeal the mandates in Act 122. To date they have done neither, perhaps believing that funding this work is somehow optional. It is not.Failing to fund the work required by the GWSA and the Climate Superfund Act makes it more difficult to achieve the goals of the legislation. It also undermines confidence in public policy, increases climate anxiety, can lead to burnout, and diverts scarce resources from reducing climate pollution and improving resiliency to extreme weather to responding to litigation — litigation that has already begun.We are sympathetic to the position lawmakers are in — this was a bold approach and it’s hard to acknowledge that plans pushed through over a gubernatorial veto were too ambitious in schedule and unaffordable to implement.The principles that underpin GWSA and the Climate Superfund Act are important, and it is in the best interest of Vermonters to ensure that this work is successful. Realizing these outcomes, however, requires more than simply enacting idealistic laws — it requires working together to design achievable, properly funded initiatives rather than marching toward impractical requirements.Importantly, there are many concrete actions — including maintaining current, unprecedented levels of investments in things like weatherization and electric vehicle charging infrastructure — that can and should be undertaken this session. Action on these measures keeps Vermont at the forefront of climate action while avoiding the pitfalls of unfunded mandates, including those that leave space for unnecessary and counterproductive legal challenges.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Sec.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Leslie Burg: Rutland can’t afford to lose Head Start, or the programs that keep us together.","This commentary is by Leslie Burg of Manchester. She is a community member of the Rutland Head Start Policy Council and an emerita professor of literacy and disabilities at Northeastern University.Rutland is a city that represents the best of what it means to be American: hardworking, community-minded and resilient. But right now, we are facing a crisis that could upend the lives of hundreds of local families — and leave an already stretched community reeling. The Trump administration has proposed eliminating all federal funding for Head Start in its 2026 budget. If this budget moves forward, it will not only devastate Rutland County Head Start — it will also trigger a ripple effect across countless essential services in our region. Let me be clear: Head Start is not “just child care.” It is a lifeline. Our program currently serves 69 of Rutland’s most vulnerable infants, toddlers and preschoolers — all from families living at or below the poverty line. For $1.9 million in federal support, Rutland receives a comprehensive, wraparound support system that includes: • Family stabilization — Rutland County Head Start Director Donna Barrow has told me that 25% of our families are homeless and 50% are navigating mental health needs. • Developmental screenings — Barrow also says that 25% of children we serve receive special education support because we caught early warning signs. • Health and nutrition — Many of our children would not eat consistently without the meals and snacks we provide daily. • Job security for parents — Without our program, working parents — mostly in low-wage jobs — would lose their ability to earn an income. We’ve spent over 30 years building a program that works. It’s efficient, effective and deeply rooted in the needs of this community. If the proposed cuts go through, this entire system collapses overnight. And not just ours. Other local programs — those that support domestic violence survivors, provide mental health services, house the unhoused and deliver early intervention care — are also dependent on fragile federal and state funding streams. Many are already stretched to the breaking point. If one piece falls, others will be forced to fill the void with fewer resources and greater need. The cost will not only be measured in dollars, but in the toll on families, frontline workers and the long-term health of our city.We’re already seeing the warning signs: Families living in cars and tents. Parents with not enough food for their family. Children poisoned by lead, left untested until they show signs of learning delays. Teachers and staff — some of them parents themselves — facing the threat of losing their homes if our program disappears. This is not hypothetical. This is already happening. And without action, it’s about to get much worse. It doesn’t have to be this way. Rutland has the power to respond — together. We need our elected officials, local leaders, business owners, nonprofit partners and neighbors to come together and push back. We must tell our stories. Write letters. Make calls. Organize. Show the state and the country that Rutland will not stand by while its most vulnerable residents are abandoned. This is not just about Head Start. It’s about every program that helps keep our community whole. It’s about the belief that every child, regardless of ZIP code or income level, deserves a fair start. The attack on Rutland’s Head Start program is close and personal to us. However, we need to understand that this is taking place across our country. Programs intended to help our most vulnerable, children, families, the disabled and our elderly, are being defunded and strategically destroyed.Programs intended to benefit America’s middle-class — i.e. Pell grants so high school students who wish to can afford to go on to college, and, yes, Social Security — are being stripped and sold for parts. And the list goes on. The eroding of our institutions and programs that support the health and welfare of all Americans has but one objective — to weaken them until they ultimately collapse, taking our federal government with them, opening the door to an oligarchic dictatorship, erasing everything America has stood for over the past 250 years. Rutland has to speak out, opposing the elimination of our Head Start program, so essential to our community. However, we also have to recognize the danger to our country as a whole, and make our voices heard while we can. The kind of future those currently in power have for America will find us in a country we no longer recognize and don’t want to live in. We must speak out now, before we lose the rights we take for granted and our voices are silenced.This is not just about Head Start. It’s about every program that helps keep our communities and our country whole. It’s about the belief that every child, regardless of ZIP code or income level, deserves a fair start and that every American deserves a fair shake. If you’re reading this and wondering how to help — start by speaking up. Talk to your neighbors. Share this story. Contact your representatives.

Photo by Ian Kreinsen/The CitizenThis story by Ian Kreinsen was first published in The Citizen on May 1.Marianna Holzer leafed through a carefully bound photo book that tells her family’s story.On one side of her family, her Swiss grandfather passed the bookbinding tradition on to his son, who passed it on to her. On the other side, her German mother’s family resisted Hitler’s regime.Today, Holzer and her husband, Rik Palieri, run the Holzer Book Bindery from their basement in Hinesburg. For Holzer, bookbinding is more than just a business — it’s a bridge to the past and a way to safeguard a legacy of activism.“Preserving books means preserving our history, so it all ties together,” she said.Her Swiss grandfather, Ulrich Holzer, learned the trade in Italy. But during his time there, a wave of disease and anti-foreigner scapegoating forced him to flee.Ulrich fled on a boat bound for the Holy Land, but when disease broke out onboard, he was cast ashore along with the dead in Gibraltar. A passerby heard him crying for water, and he wound up on a different ship bound for Boston.Without speaking English or having any documentation, he gravitated toward a community of Italian speakers, who helped him establish a book bindery in Hyde Park. His son, Albert Holzer, later took over the business. Marianna Holzer spent her early childhood in the shop.Marianna Holzer presses gold onto a bookmark. Photo by Ian Kreinsen/The CitizenWhen the bindery closed in the 1960s, the family ended up in Putney. Then, Albert Holzer died when Marianna was just 11.Still, her mother understood the craft and helped pass it on to her daughter.“She started in a walkout basement, like this, binding books for friends,” she said. “She taught me some basic things.”Her mother, Christel Holzer, came from a family of Nazi resisters in Germany. At one point, soldiers burned her grandfather’s books on his lawn. She believes that her aunt — a fierce anti-Nazi — was murdered for helping her husband escape from a concentration camp.During that regime, Christel Holzer learned bookbinding as an act of resistance.“She decided to go into something that maybe Hitler couldn’t twist around. So, she studied arts and crafts,” Marianna said. “While she was doing that, she learned bookbinding.”After immigrating to America, Christel Holzer was hired by Albert Holzer’s bindery. The two later married.Like Christel Holzer, musician Rik Palieri also got swept up in the Holzer family business.When he and Marianna Holzer started dating, Palieri spent most of his spare time with her at the Brown River Bindery, where she worked before going independent.“I realized I not only needed to be a musician, but I also had to help out to make this relationship work,” he said.Marianna Holzer looks through a family photobook. Photo by Ian Kreinsen/The CitizenToday, Palieri is fully integrated into the bindery. Holzer handles the technical work — taking precise measurements and making repairs — while Palieri gravitates toward the artistic side of the trade.Holzer converted her basement into a shop in 2008 and opened the binding business in 2010. Fifteen years later, tarnished tools, sheets of gold leaf, and strips of leather clutter the workspace where she breathes new life into time-worn books.Yet, her shop is not just a curious relic from the previous century. Business is booming.“I don’t advertise,” she said. “But people keep finding me.”Customers particularly gravitated toward her during the pandemic.“People were going into their attics, finding old books, and thinking, ‘We should do something with this.’ They’d call me up, and I’d meet them outside, even in the winter,” she said.Holzer receives anything from used Bibles to cookbooks to beloved Harry Potter books. Often, they have notes scribbled in the margin, bits of food, and wine stains.“One of the weirder books I did was a mechanics manual from the sixties,” Palieri said. “It was all greasy, but it reminded him of working on cars with his father.”Rio Palieri, Marianna Holzer and their dog Dolina. Photo by Ian Kreinsen/The Citizen“Most of the books I work on are not valuable,” Holzer said. “We’re more about sentimental value.”Sentimentality extends beyond Holzer’s customers. Above her studio, she keeps a collection of professional books from her family and childhood, including a Brothers Grimm volume her father used to read to her as a child.Next to her bookcase, she keeps a sign reading “resist.” Inspired by her mother, Holzer often attends protests and voices her opinions about the current administration.For Holzer, the bind between books, memory, resistance and human connection is clear.“Books hold our history, hold information and enable people to imagine and see themselves as others when they feel isolated and alone,” she said.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Family’s bookbinding business a page turning story of resistance, resilience.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Marianna-Holzer.jpg?fit=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-04 08:04:22.884405

Meanwhile, 30 states remain under 70% compliant — with New Jersey’s rate being the lowest, at 17%, according to data collected by CBS News. Nearby New Hampshire has 62% compliance, Massachusetts has 57%, New York has 43% and Maine has just 27%, according to the CBS data. Although the REAL ID Act was passed two decades ago to set federal security standards for state-issued IDs, many Americans are still unprepared for its implementation. While the federal government says most air travelers already show compliant IDs, roughly 1 in 5 still do not, according to the Associated Press.Enforcement of the REAL ID Act has already faced multiple delays due to deadline extensions, and at least one state has requested another extension. However, Transportation Security Administration spokesperson Dan Velez told the Associated Press that he expects no further delays.Vermont has been promoting REAL ID since 2014. Because the majority of the state’s license holders are already REAL ID compliant, the department does not anticipate a large increase in appointment traffic as the deadline draws near, according to state DMV Deputy Commissioner Matthew Rousseau.To obtain a REAL ID, Vermonters must visit a DMV office in person and present proof of identity, a Social Security card, and two documents verifying Vermont residency, such as utility bills. Applying for an Enhanced Driver’s License requires proof of U.S. citizenship, such as a birth certificate or passport. Copies of birth certificates are not accepted, but a certified duplicate or original is accepted. Residents who still need the upgrade can start the process early by booking an appointment to avoid last-minute issues. The process typically takes about 15 minutes, according to Rousseau. Once approved, REAL IDs typically arrive by mail within 7-10 business days but can take up to 21 days.Read the story on VTDigger here:  92% of Vermonters have REAL ID-compliant licenses ahead of national deadline.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AP-REAL-ID-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-04 07:03:17.959337

New apartments reached almost 592,000 nationally last year, the highest number since 1974, with South Dakota and the Rapid City area approving new apartments at particularly high rates. (Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)More new apartments were built in 2024 than in any other year since 1974, but the Trump administration’s tariffs and deportations of potential construction workers, plus higher interest rates, could be a wet blanket on the boom.
A U.S. Census Bureau survey found almost 592,000 new apartments were finished last year, the most since the 1970s, when baby boomers sparked a construction surge as they moved out of their childhood homes. There were 693,000 new apartments built in 1974, when the country had about half as many households.
But there has been a steep slowdown in construction starts, as the newly completed apartments come online. The increased supply has lowered rents and increased vacancy rates, making new development less profitable. Some experts also say tariffs on construction materials and labor shortages caused by dips in immigration will create headwinds for new construction.
Apartment starts were down 27% in 2024 compared with 2023, and down 37% from a recent peak of 531,000 in 2022, despite the historic rate of completions. Apartment starts were at their lowest ebb since 2013.

Housing experts have long lamented that there aren’t enough apartments and single-family houses in the U.S. — at least not in places where people want to live and at prices they can afford. Estimates of the national housing shortage last year varied widely, from 1.5 million houses and apartments to 20.1 million; since then, another 1.6 million houses and apartments have been built. Most experts estimate a shortage of 1.5 million to 5.5 million, according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University.
Some states are building apartments faster than others, according to a Stateline analysis. Though completions aren’t tracked by state, permits that lead to new apartments have been granted at high rates in recent years in South Dakota, Utah, Arizona and Colorado. Rates are lowest in Mississippi, Wyoming, West Virginia, Rhode Island, Oklahoma and Alaska.
The massive jump in apartment construction has its roots in 2021 and 2022, when interest rates were low and rent growth was high, said Rob Warnock, senior research associate for Apartment List, a company that posts rental listings online.
“Those new apartments came online in 2023 and 2024, and while those deliveries are slowing down today, there are still many apartments in the pipeline,” said Warnock, who added that “supply and demand are coming back into balance.”
In response to greater supply, rents have fallen by about $50 per month (3.5%) from their 2022 peak, according to a report released this week by Apartment List. Apartment vacancy is at a 15-year high of 6.3%, keeping a lid on rents, but that could turn around as construction slows, according to an April report by Moody’s, a financial services company.
Apartment building has been a bipartisan priority as single-family home prices soar further out of the affordability range for young families. In South Dakota, the Republican-controlled legislature worked to prolong the building boom with grants and loans under the state’s Housing Infrastructure Financing Program. The program put $200 million of state and federal funding toward defraying the costs of development in new neighborhoods, such as roads, sewer lines and streetlights.
Republican state Sen. Casey Crabtree, sponsor of the proposal signed into law in 2023, told Stateline it was needed to address a housing shortage, especially in rural parts of the state.
“We have a drastic shortage of workers,” Crabtree said before a vote in 2023. “South Dakota businesses need more workers in our state. To get more workers, we need more housing.”
Armand Domalewski, co-founder of YIMBY Democrats for America, said overregulation is a barrier to housing construction in many areas that his party controls.
“A lot of blue-government areas and cities have extremely restrictive zoning, impact fees and other rules that make it very difficult to build housing,” said Domalewski. Another barrier is local opposition, he said.
“If it was just a free market, developers would want to build in the places like California, where prices are the highest and rents are the highest, because they’d make more money,” he added.
In California, the 2021 HOME Act was meant to spur more affordable housing and ease labor shortages, but it’s faced local opposition in some areas. At the end of last year, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed several measures that aim to streamline regulations and crack down on local resistance to the 2021 law.
South Dakota approved nearly 6,000 permits for apartment units in 2023 and 2024, which when completed would add about 1.4% to its 2023 total of 417,000 housing units. That’s the highest rate in the nation. By contrast, Mississippi during that same period approved about 660 apartment units — a fraction of 1 percentage point to its 2023 base of about 1.4 million housing units.

– Armand Domalewski, co-founder of YIMBY Democrats for America




Chas Olson, executive director of the South Dakota Housing Development Authority, said the full impact of the state infrastructure funding isn’t apparent yet, as many developments that received the help are still under construction.
Completions are still strong this year with about 39,000 apartments finished in March, not much different from the 41,500 in March 2024, which was the biggest March number since 1985.
Another impediment to apartment construction has been high interest rates, which make it harder to borrow money to build, said Danushka Nanayakkara-Skillington, an assistant vice president for forecasting and analysis at the National Association of Home Builders.
She expects apartment building starts to slow until later this year.
“We are going to be short of workers for a long time. That’s the way it is. And of course tariffs are going to have an impact,” Nanayakkara-Skillington said.

In the face of accelerating climate change, the scale and scope of resilience work is growing far beyond what policy makers in the late 20th century thought possible. The general risk of not acting at the needed scale far surpasses the downside risk of any single action negatively impacting an ecosystem.
The post Accelerating climate change demands ‘agile s[...]","THE UPHEAVAL of federal support for climate change work could not have come at a worse time.  Communities across Massachusetts and the US are generally under-prepared to handle the current impacts of climate change, let alone the far greater challenges projected for the years ahead. Here in New England, where rates of heavy rainfall have increased by approximately 60 percent since the mid-20th century, frequent flooding threatens neighborhoods and cities. Stormwater systems are unable to deal with the increased frequency and intensity of deluge rainstorms. Other socioecological systems essential to community well-being, including food, housing, energy, waste management, and drinking water, are also vulnerable. In areas experiencing more frequent extreme storms or wildfires, insurance is becoming both harder to obtain and significantly more expensive. This unavailability or unaffordability of insurance threatens the stability of real estate markets. Even before a catastrophic storm hits, communities are already experiencing the impacts of climate change through increased property risk and the potential instability of tax revenues. The future of Massachusetts and New England depends on reconsidering regulation that stifles innovative nature-based design and projects and scaling up effective adaptation to accelerating climate change. Effective adaptation will require system agility — the forward-leaning ability to adapt continuously to changing conditions. Massachusetts and neighboring states have been taking positive steps. Over the past decade, best-practice resilience planning incorporated powerful analytical tools to understand both climate change threats and the full scope of vulnerabilities, particularly those worsened by social inequities like poverty and racial disparities. By integrating climate impacts such as sea-level rise and extreme rainfall with social vulnerability assessments and nature-based risk reduction strategies, communities can secure a thriving future grounded in greater equity and health for both people and the environment.  In coastal Massachusetts communities such as Wellfleet, Nantucket, and Plum Island accelerating shoreline loss is taking homes and threatening vital infrastructure and high value natural habitat. Massachusetts is giving our 78 coastal communities extra funding to develop risk-based coastal resilience plans. Using advanced modeling tools developed from the explosive growth of information technologies, these plans assess risks to valuable habitats, critical infrastructure, and community recreational assets. Informed by data sensing and analytical tools, the strategic placement of near-shore, habitat-friendly structures can slow erosion rates and create opportunities to avoid using hard structures that deflect energy and cause erosion elsewhere. The design process requires getting extensive site-specific data and most recently developed with the aid of artificial intelligence. But, implementing these projects requires working within the existing outmoded environmental management system that was not built to address the accelerating impacts of climate change. Procedural overload — multiple reviews, siloed rules, and an overly risk-averse perspective — undermine timely progress. For example, innovative nature-based measures like floating wetlands or naturalized reef structures that can reduce the wave energy on a shoreline face regulatory burden that is often higher than what is required for sea walls and other more traditional but more destructive alternatives. It took years for regulators to embrace green infrastructure as the better way to address stormwater pollution. Communities don’t have years for coastal regulators to embrace nature-based strategies to address coastal erosion that threatens vital infrastructure and habitat.   In the face of accelerating climate change, the scale and scope of resilience work is growing far beyond what policy makers in the late 20th century thought possible. The general risk of not acting at the needed scale far surpasses the downside risk of any single action negatively impacting an ecosystem.  Eventually a fundamental rethinking of the environmental management system is crucial for building the resilience necessary to thrive in the coming years. Unfortunately, redesigning the national environmental management system is unrealistic in this political environment. But there is way forward. Community-based public-private partnerships are a tested approach to scale the level of projects needed to meet an environmental challenge.  The ingredients for this partnership model start with a long-term source of revenue.  The second ingredient is a planning framework that defines the scope of what must be done. The next ingredient is a local or regional government that creates a partnership with private firm and an engagement program that effectively recruits the input of stakeholders.  With the promise of a large number of green infrastructure projects, the firm procures the needed design and build services at a scale necessary to meet the performance goals defined in the planning and permit framework. Most importantly the firm takes on the legal responsibility for achieving the goals of the program.    Like the challenge to build green infrastructure at scale to address stormwater pollution and flooding, using the extensive resilience planning work to create nature-based infrastructure to address community resilience challenges is a problem of scale and implementation speed. Community-based public-private partnerships offer a solution that has been endorsed by the EPA and is available to states and local governments.  However, these partnerships will only work if regulators rethink how they regulate nature-based work. Climate change is progressing rapidly and unpredictably. An environmental management system that does not acknowledge this urgency does not effectively serve governments or their citizens. By adopting a systemic approach to resilience planning and aligning our environmental management programs with the urgency of the climate crisis, we can better prepare for and mitigate its impacts. Curt Spalding is the former regional administrator of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Executive Director of Save The Bay in Rhode Island.

,Mississippi Today,2025-05-04 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,How state law allows private schools to ‘double dip’ by using two public programs for the same students,Bobby Harrison,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/05/04/state-law-private-schools-double-dip/,"The Mississippi Legislature’s insistence of not requiring oversight has resulted in a way for private schools to “double dip,” or receive money from two separate state programs to educate the same handful of students.","The Mississippi Legislature’s insistence of not requiring oversight has resulted in a way for private schools to “double dip,” or receive money from two separate state programs to educate the same handful of students.
There is currently no mechanism in state law to allow state officials to determine whether double dipping is occurring. More importantly, there is nothing in state law to prevent double dipping from occurring.
So, maybe the private schools are double dipping and maybe they are not. And this is not an effort to demonize private schools — many of which are doing stellar work — but to point out the lack of state oversight and to question the wisdom of sending public funds to private schools.
There are two primary programs in Mississippi that provide public funds and state tax credit funds to private schools: the Education Scholarship Account and the Children’s Promise Act.
The programs overlap in terms of the children the private schools must educate to receive the state benefits. To receive money through an Education Scholarship Account of up to $7,829 per year to attend a private school, a student must be designated as a special needs student. The special needs designation could be the result of a physical, mental or emotional issue. An attention deficit disorder, for instance, could result in a special needs designation.
On the other hand, students who make private schools eligible to receive the Children’s Promise Act tax credit benefits must have “a chronic illness or physical, intellectual, developmental or emotional disability” or be eligible for the free lunch program or be a foster child.
No more than $3 million per year can be spent through the Education Scholarship Account while the Children’s Promise Act is capped at $9 million annually.
The bottom line is that state officials do not know how many students the private schools are serving through the Children’s Promise Act state tax credits.
The Mississippi Department of Revenue, which has a certain amount of oversight of the Children’s Promise Act funds, has said in the past it knew the number of children being served in the first year a school received the state tax credit funds, but the agency does not know whether the number of students being served in following years changes.
In short, there is nothing in state law that would prevent a private school from receiving the maximum benefit of $405,000 annually while enrolling only one child fitting the definition that would make the school eligible to receive the tax credit funds.
There is a little more oversight of the Education Scholarship Account funds, though that oversight has been slow and has only occurred after a legislative watchdog group pointed out the lax oversight.
If a school has fewer than 10 students receiving the ESA funds, the state Department of Education will not release the exact number, citing privacy concerns. But the Department of Education has released the amount of ESA funds each school received during the 2023-24 school year.
According to that information, multiple schools receiving those ESA funds but educating fewer than 10 ESA students also are receiving significant Children’s Promise Act tax credit funds. According to the Department of Revenue, as of January, six schools had received the maximum tax credit funds of $405,000 for calendar year 2024.
Three of those schools also received Education Scholarship Account funds for fewer than 10 students. For instance, one private school received $16,461 in Education Scholarship Account funds, or most likely money for two students.
If the students receiving the ESA funds were the same ones making the school eligible for the $405,000 in tax credit funds, that would mean the state was paying $210,730 per student whereas the average per pupil spending in the public schools is about $11,500 per pupil in state and local funding.
Of course, state law does not prohibit private schools from educating only one child with special needs and being eligible for the maximum tax credit benefit of $405,000 annually.
Perhaps it seems far-fetched that a private school would be educating only one child to be eligible to receive up to $405,000 in tax credit funds.
But it also seems far-fetched that for years the students receiving the Education Scholarship Account funds were mandated by state law to use the money to go to schools equipped to meet their special education needs. Yet, research by the Legislature’s Performance Evaluation and Expenditure Review Committee (PEER) found the students were going to private schools that in some instances did not have any special education teachers and in some cases the students were still getting those services from the public schools.
Perhaps the Legislature’s PEER Committee needs to do some more research to determine whether double dipping is occurring.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/07060230/FVES_Classroom.jpg,,,2025-05-04 08:04:22.884405

Vermont’s symbolic rebel is viewed by some as a legend and others as a lightning rod. On this month’s 250th anniversary of his Revolutionary War capture of Fort Ticonderoga, scholars are aiming to separate fact from fiction.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Ethan Allen has an image problem. Is the internet and present-day polarization to blame?.","Ethan Allen, as portrayed in a 1927 advertisement for Ticonderoga pencils. Photo courtesy Vermont Historical SocietyAs Revolutionary War leader of the Green Mountain Boys militia, Ethan Allen had seemingly no sooner captured Fort Ticonderoga from British troops on May 10, 1775, when he put quill pen to parchment to chronicle his effort.“I have,” Allen wrote, “taken the greatest care and pains to recollect the facts and arrange them; but as they touch a variety of characters and opposite interests, I am sensible that all will not be pleased with the relation of them.”Two and a half centuries later, that’s the one and only thing most people can agree on.“He has been accused of ignorance, weakness of mind, cowardice, infidelity, and atheism,” Henry Hall wrote in 1892’s “Ethan Allen: The Robin Hood of Vermont,” one of many books on the state’s love-him-or-hate-him symbolic rebel. “If Vermont is careful of her own fame, well does it become the people to know whether Ethan Allen was a hero or a humbug.”Search “Ethan Allen” online today and you’ll find more assertations of the latter, be it questions about whether he enslaved Black people or stole land from Indigenous populations.“He’s become a lightning rod for everyone’s feelings about that entire historical era,” Angie Grove, executive director of the Ethan Allen Homestead Museum in Burlington, said in a recent interview. “He gets all the credit and all the blame.”Historians say that divide is complicating efforts to mark next weekend’s 250th anniversary of his crossing of Lake Champlain and capture of Fort Ticonderoga — and, conversely, offering them the opportunity to separate fact from fiction.Ethan Allen, as sculpted in the U.S. Capitol’s National Statuary Hall. Photo courtesy Architect of the CapitolThe 2,000-acre Fort Ticonderoga historic site in Ticonderoga, New York, is set to present a reenactment of Allen’s raid between May 9 and 11, as well as educational stops in the Vermont towns of Sudbury, Orwell and Shoreham and a flyover by the Vermont Air National Guard.“Independence was not a foregone conclusion,” organizers note on their website. “Recovering the contingency of the American Revolution helps to underscore its profound significance.”For its part, the Ethan Allen Homestead Museum will offer free admission to Vermonters on May 10 in hopes of drawing visitors, be they curious or cynical.“I know that there are people who avoid the museum because they just assume Ethan Allen was a racist, Native American-slaughtering person,” Grove said.Then again, Grove has met others who swear Allen was a trail-blazing abolitionist at a time Vermont was drafting a 1777 constitution that would make it the first state to outlaw adult slavery. (Children wouldn’t be officially protected under the provision until 2022.)“Where did you get that information?” Grove will ask people expressing commendation or complaints.“Oh, it’s just well known,” she often hears in reply.But Grove — who holds a master’s degree in history from the University of Vermont — says it’s not so simple.Allen has been the subject of a slew of books, starting with his own in 1779. Then in 2014, the now late professors John Duffy and H. Nicholas Muller published “Inventing Ethan Allen,” an exploration of the historiography behind him.“How does the memory of Ethan Allen coincide with the reality of his life as well as much repeated supplemental legends and myths composed long after his death?” Duffy and Muller write in the prologue.The book notes, for example, that past authors often have emphasized or excluded facts to fit a particular narrative.“The story of Ethan Allen has been transformed since the 1830s to present a hero configured by comedic or tearful treatments in a consistently sentimental avoidance of events and actions that could otherwise have diminished his popular appeal,” Duffy and Muller write.Ethan Allen, as presented on a towering pedestal at Burlington’s Greenmount Cemetery.

Although scholars have found records of other family members using Black labor — the legal status of “free” or “slave” is rarely reported — they’ve yet to find any definitive proof whether Allen enslaved people.“In the absence of positive evidence, the question, ‘Did Ethan Allen ever own slaves?’ never appears in his biographies,” Duffy and Muller write.So why do people claim Allen did? Grove cites primary sources that show American Colonial society as a whole exploited marginalized populations — a fact that can lead some to extend the generalization to specific individuals.“We can make educated guesses, but we actually know very little about Ethan Allen’s political, social and moral relationship to slavery or Indigenous people that can be backed up with real evidence,” Grove said. “You can find claims online, but nobody has any sources for them. That isn’t to say we can’t find answers to these questions, but that research hasn’t been done yet.”Study, however, takes money.“Try as I might, I’ve found it challenging to convince people that research in general, and on Ethan Allen in particular, is worthy of investing in,” Grove said. “Anytime I mention anything about Ethan Allen, everyone says, ‘Nope, we don’t want to hear about him, we want to hear untold stories.’”Increasingly that’s leaving the internet to spin its own speculation.“In today’s climate, it doesn’t matter how much evidence or lack of evidence you have, people are going to feel the way they feel,” Grove said. “I always hope people are inspired by the idealism of the American Revolution — fighting for equality for all people, even though it didn’t give equality to all people. But I think it’s easier for some to blame certain figures of the past than to reckon with entrenched prejudices and inequalities in our society that have been passed down generation to generation.”The historian stresses she’s not taking sides, just in search of a truth not yet fully found. She hopes people will discover the homestead and its work — if only to take in one of the state’s oldest farmed areas, with a documented history dating back 600 years.“For better or for worse, Ethan Allen is the figurehead of Vermont,” Grove said. “It would be most responsible to invest in further research of him, particularly to see how well he represents the diverse state of today.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Ethan Allen has an image problem.

State attorneys general are urging concerned customers to delete their data, while experts warn that state and federal laws may not fully protect their privacy. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The fate of more than 15 million customers’ genetic data remains in limbo after popular DNA testing company 23andMe filed for bankruptcy in March. The data is up for sale, stoking fears about how it might be used and prompting attorneys general from more than a dozen states to warn 23andMe users: Delete your data.
“Your genetic data is your most personal, confidential data, and you should be able to protect who has access to it,” North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson, a Democrat, said in a March statement.
“You have the power to delete your data now — please act quickly.”
Dr. Adam Brown, a Washington, D.C.-based emergency physician and the founder of a health care strategy firm, deleted his information on 23andMe as soon as he learned of the bankruptcy filing, he told Stateline.
For him, the bankruptcy begs a vital question that federal and state laws don’t fully address: What happens to your genetic data when the company holding it collapses?
Federal protections are flimsy. States have beefed up their genetic privacy laws in recent years, but many experts say they don’t go far enough.










There actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses. 


– Dr. Adam Brown, emergency physician and founder of a health care strategy company


23andMe has said the bankruptcy will not change how it stores, manages or protects its trove of sensitive customer information. In a news release issued shortly after the bankruptcy announcement, the company said any potential buyers would have to agree to comply with 23andMe’s consumer privacy policy and all applicable laws. When contacted by Stateline, the company declined to comment beyond what it has published in news releases and information it posted for customers on its website.
But once the data is in the hands of another company, that company could change its privacy policy at any time, experts noted.
“Once you get to the point of bankruptcy court, there may not be those same guarantees or the same ethos a new company may have around privacy protections for consumers,” Brown said.
“I want people to understand there actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.”
  HIPAA doesn’t help 

Companies such as 23andMe offer their users potentially game-changing revelations about their health and ancestry. The process is simple: Mail in a saliva sample and the company uses it to build an individual genetic profile that can reveal not only a person’s family connections, but also health insights such as their risk of developing a disease like cancer or Alzheimer’s.
This valuable personal data underpins a direct-to-customer genetic testing market that was valued at $1.93 billion globally in 2023 and is expected to grow, according to market research firm Grand View Research.
23andMe was an industry giant until its stock price plummeted following a massive 2023 data breach that affected the accounts of nearly 7 million customers. Then came the $30 million class-action lawsuit settlement.
The company declared bankruptcy in late March of this year, and announced it’s up for sale.

A flurry of alerts from state attorneys general around the country soon followed. AGs from states including Alabama, Arizona, California, Kentucky, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Texas issued similar press releases that recommended customers ask the company to delete their genetic profile and destroy the saliva sample used to create it.
“We have robust state privacy laws that include data deletion rights, and I would encourage any Texan concerned about their data to exercise the right to have their data securely deleted,” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, said in an April statement.
The fear is that a new 23andMe owner could choose to use or share sensitive personal genetic data in ways the company’s current privacy policy doesn’t allow. There’s worry it could be used, for example, to inflate people’s life insurance premiums or expose them to employment discrimination.
And there aren’t many guardrails to prevent that from happening.
HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, doesn’t apply to companies like 23andMe. The landmark federal law protects patients’ sensitive health information when it’s handled by doctors, hospitals and health insurers. But direct-to-customer companies such as 23andMe or Ancestry aren’t considered health care providers, and their non-invasive saliva collection kit isn’t considered a medical test.
The main federal law that protects people from discrimination based on their genetic information is nearly 20 years old. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) was passed in 2008, long before the rise of at-home testing kits. It applies to employers and health insurers, but not to life insurance companies, mortgage lenders and other non-health entities. And it doesn’t explicitly protect epigenetic information, which is information about the way a person’s genes — and by extension, health — are affected by outside factors such as smoking, disease or stress.
 What states are doing

In the past five years, at least 14 states have passed laws regulating direct-to-consumer genetic testing offered by companies like Ancestry and 23andMe. There’s variation, but generally the laws require companies to get customers’ express consent before using or sharing their data, and allow customers to request their genetic data be deleted and biological samples destroyed.
It’s a good start, but doesn’t go far enough, said Anya Prince, a University of Iowa law professor whose research focuses on health and genetic privacy.
Many of those state efforts were built around a model law developed by the Coalition for Genetic Data Protection, an industry group with two member companies: 23andMe and Ancestry.

As DNA testing kits exploded in popularity and attracted increased scrutiny from lawmakers, the coalition pushed to influence legislation and set industry standards. The privacy protections in the laws mirror what 23andMe and Ancestry were already doing with their own privacy policies, experts say.
“They do have some really sensible privacy protections,” said Prince. “It’s great that people can delete their genetic data, and it’s great that law enforcement needs a warrant to access it. But if a privacy advocate had written a model law, there would be the potential for more and broader protections.”
For example, she said, many of the state laws address privacy requirements just for direct-to-consumer DNA testing companies. If 23andMe’s data is bought by, say, a pharmaceutical company, those state laws no longer apply.
The coalition now appears to be inactive, its website defunct.
Since 2020, more than a dozen states have passed some version of a genetic information privacy law, including Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming, based on a Stateline analysis. This year, the Indiana legislature passed a bill that’s now headed to the governor’s desk. Bills have been introduced this year in other states, including West Virginia.
Prince said state laws rely too heavily on consumers to self-manage their data privacy. They’re expected to understand a company’s policy, when studies have shown the public often doesn’t read privacy notices nor fully understand how companies use their data. Further, many state laws don’t address how third parties, such as law enforcement, can access and use consumer genetic data.
It’s also not always clear how the laws will be enforced, or who’s responsible for oversight.
“In general, I think there’s a disconnect between how people think their privacy is protected and how it’s actually protected,” she said.
But a few states have enacted laws that are more robust. California, for example, has a genetic information privacy law, but also has a general data protection law, as well as a state version of the federal GINA law that extends genetic anti-discrimination protections into areas including housing, education and licensing.
Florida has beefed up its DNA privacy laws in recent years, making the using or selling of an individual’s DNA without informed consent a felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison and up to a $10,000 fine. Florida was also the first state to prohibit life, disability and long-term care insurance companies from using genetic information to determine coverage.

(Hilary Scheinuk/The Advocate-Pool)A surprise amendment to what was a simple bill caused an appreciable rift among Republicans in the Louisiana Legislature this past week, but it might have helped advance Gov. Jeff Landry’s signature legislation to address the state’s insurance crisis. 
House Bill 148, sponsored by Rep. Jeff Wiley, R-Maurepas, began as a measure to require insurance companies to tell customers what their previous billing amount was whenever sending out a coverage renewal notice. Wiley said it would simply let customers quickly see whether their insurance rates have gone up or down. 
However, the legislation underwent significant changes Wednesday on the House floor. 
Wiley accepted an amendment from Rep. Brian Glorioso, R-Slidell, that effectively combined his bill with some of the major provisions from a separate proposal from Democrats Robby Carter of Amite and Chad Brown of Plaquemine. Their measure, which has the governor’s backing, would give the state insurance commissioner the power to strike down any insurance rate increase considered “excessive” or unreasonably high. 
Currently, the commissioner can only exercise that power after holding a public hearing in which someone proves the state insurance market lacks competition. 
The amalgamated bill was advanced to the Senate on a 68-34,

The Carter-Brown bill had opposition from several Republican lawmakers and Insurance Commissioner Tim Temple, who some speculate could become the governor’s scapegoat if the latest efforts to reduce coverage prices fail. 
The proposal would have also backed the commissioner into a corner, forcing him to choose between rates based on real market conditions and rates that are lowered as a form of political favors, Temple has said in previous interviews. 
Some Republican lawmakers made similar arguments Wednesday and challenged whether Glorioso’s amendment was germane to Wiley’s original legislation. Legislative rules forbid members from hijacking a colleague’s bill with changes that differ dramatically from the purpose of the original proposal.  
One opponent, Rep. Raymond Crews, R-Bossier City, asked House Speaker Phillip DeVillier, R-Eunice, to decide whether the Glorioso amendment departed radically from the Wiley bill. After consulting with the chamber’s parliamentarian, DeVillier said both proposals are related to the cost of insurance premiums.  
Rep. John Wyble, R-Franklinton, criticized the amendment for its lack of specificity in how the commissioner is supposed to determine whether a rate is unreasonable.
“So what’s an unreasonable profit — a 6% profit, a 4.5% profit, a 20% profit, a 100% profit?” Wyble asked.
Republicans Jay Gallé of Mandeville, Josh Carlson of Lafayette, Paula Davis of Baton Rouge and Chance Henry of Crowley also argued against the proposal, voting against the Glorioso amendment and the updated bill.

Rep. Gabe Firment, R-Pollock, who chairs the House Insurance Committee, also voted against both measures. He said he believes Glorioso’s amendment helped ensure the passage of the key provisions the governor wanted. 
Landry turned heads last month when he sat shoulder to shoulder with Brown at a committee hearing in support of the Democrat’s bill. The governor even drew praise from some of the state’s most liberal politicians after he railed against large corporations and called for stricter regulations on the insurance industry.
The Carter-Brown bill “was problematic for some Republican representatives,” Firment said in a phone interview Friday.
Moving the major provisions from that bill into a Republican-backed proposal was a way to try to ease the “heartburn” some conservatives were having, Firment said. 
The insurance commissioner is still lobbying against the revised bill. 
“I can’t speak to anyone’s motivation, but the only additional power this legislation gives me is the authority to deny rates for political, personal and other subjective reasons,” Temple said. “I’ve made that clear to the legislature and will continue working to help them understand what the bill does and why it is harmful to our insurance market.”
Wiley said he supported the amendment because of the special circumstances of the state’s insurance crisis. 
“I can just tell you that tough times call for tough decisions,” Wiley said.

March 4, 2025: Qatar to Connecticut 
In early March, sitting in his sister’s West Haven apartment, Sayed Rahim Rahim opened the small leather backpack where he carries his family’s documents for safekeeping. He pulled out certificates printed with Afghan and American flags that he received during the 12 years he worked as an automotive mechanic for the U.S. armed forces. 
On the rug, he spread out the Qatar Airways tickets and stack of passports that had helped get him, his wife, their son and four daughters across the Atlantic in a hasty departure less than a week earlier. 
The family’s arrival in Connecticut coincided with a chaotic new chapter for refugees coming to the United States, as the Trump administration halted new arrivals and began dismantling the services that once supported them. Funding cuts, an end to Temporary Protective Status for immigrants from countries like Haiti and Venezuela, and growing uncertainty for others about their future on U.S. soil have since become features of the national news cycle. 
In Connecticut, that chaos has shaken the refugee communities that have called the state home — and the resettlement agencies that have historically contracted with the federal government to lay the groundwork of a successful life in the United States.

Rahim’s family’s crisis-driven arrival may be a harbinger of how the new reality looks for refugees and Special Immigrant Visa holders like him, as support flounders and resettlement groups increasingly turn to private donors and volunteers to fill the gaps left behind.
The uncertainty began for the family in January, when they were readying to fly from a refugee camp in Qatar to the U.S. Along with more than 1,600 other Afghans, the family learned their flight had been abruptly cancelled, an action taken by President Donald J. Trump on Jan. 21, the day after he signed an executive order to indefinitely pause refugee resettlement.
The United States has ushered 200,000 Afghans to safety since the Taliban took control of the country after U.S. forces left in 2021, in what was widely considered a tragically botched exit. Afghans like Rahim, who had worked for the U.S. forces despite risks of retribution from the Taliban, had been promised a safe haven here through the pathway of Special Immigrant Visas (SIVs) for him and his family. In Rahim’s case, the cancelled flight came after an eight-year wait for his visa to go through, during which time the radius of his life constricted to keep him and his family safe. For a year, he and his family lived in a hotel room. 
Meanwhile, in West Haven, Rahim’s brother-in-law, Noorjan Omerkhel, was shocked when he learned the flight was off. The family began scrambling for a solution.
Rahim and his family were still approved to come to the U.S. as SIVs, and the short-term passports they’d been issued for the trip were valid for a few more weeks. They just needed plane tickets. Omerkhel had lost his job a few months before, but he logged on to Qatar Airways and emptied most of his savings — $6,845.07 — on seven plane tickets. 
It was a blow, but Omerkhel had reason to believe that, once the family arrived, they’d be greeted with the same robust support he’d received when he came to the U.S. nine years earlier. He remembered how New Haven-based Integrated Refugee and Immigration Services (IRIS) had taken care of everything, from preparing an apartment, to cooking a first Afghan meal, to enrolling his kids in school and scheduling medical appointments. 
But when Rahim’s family arrived on Feb. 26, they met a different reality. 
IRIS was in crisis. Omerkhel alerted the group that Rahim and his family were planning to come, but just a few days before they arrived. 
Omerkhel brought them back from the airport and took them into his small home with his wife — Rahim’s sister — and their three kids for the first few nights. But he was worried. 
“There’s no case manager for (Rahim), he’s seeking help for transportation, his wife is pregnant, and his daughter is having a dental issue.”
He wondered if buying the plane tickets had been a mistake. 
“Now it fills me with upset, too much upset inside,” Omerkhel said. “I’m not a governor or mayor … simply put, I’m not (a) financially stable person. I lost my job, and still I’m struggling to find a job.” 
Back in January, IRIS had planned to help the family. But those arrangements were made before the organization was thrown into turmoil: Federal contracts worth $4 million were abruptly cancelled, the group was laying off dozens of employees and making the painful decision to give up its primary physical office. 
“We were in the midst of heartbreaking meetings,” said IRIS Executive Director Maggie Mitchell Salem.
IRIS was struggling to make sense of its new reality. Over the years, the group had co-signed leases on over 100 apartments. But with the funding to help pay for those apartments gone, they were searching for new housing for clients and working with landlords to transfer the leases to their clients’ names. 
Anxious phone calls flooded in from families who had fled war and violence in their home countries, then spent years painstakingly building new lives: learning English, going back to school, finding jobs and friendships in a wildly unfamiliar place. But without citizenship, what might become of those lives? Many of their case workers had lost their jobs and could no longer give them answers. 
Amid these calls and meetings, a group of core IRIS staff met in Mitchell Salem’s office in late February to talk about Rahim and his young family. 
“I think initially I said, ‘No, we can’t help,’” Mitchell Salem recalled. Their remaining staff was spread thin, and much of their funding had been wiped out. But as they talked, Mitchell Salem began to question herself. This work, she reasoned, was what IRIS had been built to do. 
“It’s like — we can still do this. It is absolutely right to do it,” Mitchell Salem said. “The community will have our back, regardless of whether the federal government does.”
The mood seemed to lift. More Afghan families arrived — a total of four families and a single man — and the group put out a fundraising call.
Hewad Hemat, manager of resettlement services at IRIS, and Rona Rohbar, the head of the IRIS health team, were assigned to help the family. 
“It was kind of shocking, difficult,” said Hemat, who also came to the U.S. as a refugee from Afghanistan in 2014. “A family with five kids, no credit history, the mother is pregnant and the children are so young! And there is no government help. We were very worried.”

March 7, 2025: Where would they live? 
It had been nine days since the family had arrived in the U.S., and they had moved from Omerkhel’s home to stay with Rahim’s brothers and cousin in a cramped two-bedroom apartment in West Haven. 
Rahim had met with IRIS earlier that day, and he had signals that the organization was trying to help him, but the predominant emotion was still anxiety about a stack of unsolved problems. Most important among them: Where would they live? Rahim’s relatives had been generous, but it was a lot to ask the three men living on their own to take in a family of seven. 
Whatever the obstacles of the day, Rahim’s children always gave him and his wife, Madina, some comic relief. His youngest daughter, Asna, was still working on her walking skills, and she stumbled across the carpet and into his lap. She babbled, then giggled at the tired smile Rahim pasted across his face. 
Asra, 3, curled up on a cushion, peering into a YouTube video on a cell phone. Asia, 4, circled the small apartment, on the hunt for something to busy herself. Serwat, 11, and Alia, 6, sat quietly with calm smiles on their lips, listening to their uncle translate questions to their father in his native Pashto. Rahim was beginning to learn English, but he couldn’t speak fluently like his brothers, who had served as translators with U.S. armed forces. Without being asked, Serwat and Alia pitched in, putting away visitors’ shoes or distracting the baby when she cried. 
Rahim had met with IRIS for an intake interview. When he went to their office, they gave him a couple of books for the children to explore — a pop-up book with pictures of trucks, another with games and pages of butterfly and princess stickers. At the apartment, the younger kids pulled the books from each others’ hands, anxious to look through them. Asra peeled the bright stickers off the page and pasted them up and down her arms. 
It was Ramadan, and the adults were fasting until the evening. Rahim’s wife Madina, who asked not to be photographed, had been feeling weaker than she had during previous pregnancies. Rahim urged her to break the fast and eat during the day, and sometimes she did. 
So far, the family hadn’t seen much beyond the walls of their relatives’ apartments. It was chilly out, in the 40’s. In typical New England fashion, the sky vacillated from a blanket of gray to light blue. “They’re too naughty” to take outside, Rahim said of his children with a smile, through his brother’s translation. As in, he wasn’t up for venturing into the unknown with five young kids. 
The family had practice hunkering down together in a small space — they had spent an entire year living in a Kabul hotel before getting to the refugee camp in Qatar, confined to the room for their safety.
March 11, 2025: Signs of progress
A few days later, progress: The family had doctors’ appointments, and Rahim and Madina now had their own cell phones, given to them by IRIS, so they weren’t dependent on borrowing relatives’ phones to communicate. IRIS was pulling together money for a few months’ rent, plus the deposit, so they’d be ready when they found an apartment. 
His brothers drove for Uber, and the noise of the children sometimes kept them awake. It was time to get their own place. 
“IRIS should help us,” Rahim reasoned. His wife was pregnant. Who knew how long it would be before he’d be able to start working? 
But his brothers agreed that Rahim’s career as a car mechanic was a stroke of good luck under the circumstances — that particular set of skills transcended borders and language. First, he’d need a driver’s license and an automotive repair license. It was another set of bureaucratic hills to climb. 
Rahim spent hours cooking a meal of kabuli pulao, the Afghan national dish of lamb and rice with spices, to break the daily Ramadan fast. Once the family ate, the children curled up together in the corner of the living room, watching videos on his phone.

March 12, 2025: Setbacks and opportunities 
Rohbar was in charge of getting the family medical care. Just a few months before, she would have had 11 team members working for her.
“The whole team is gone. I’m the only one left,” Rohbar said. 
It was lucky for Rahim and his family that Rohbar was the one left. She was from the same city in Afghanistan — Khost — and she spoke the same dialect, a version of Pashto she said can be unintelligible to people from outside that region. 
Rohbar helped the family schedule their medical appointments, but she was spread too thin to stay while a registered nurse checked their hearing and drew blood. Instead, she showed Rahim the number to dial for an interpreter. The connection faded in and out — “Hello? Are you there?” — the nurse asked the voice on the other end of the line. Sometimes, she was. 
The kids explored the beds, the walls, the medical supplies, as two nurses examined them one by one. Everyone remarked on the large family — so many kids! Madina stayed at home, resting before her prenatal appointment later in the day. Asra, the 3-year-old, smiled through a hearing test. And somehow Alia, 6, smiled through her blood draw.

W hen all of them had been poked and measured, a weary Rahim led the children to the front of the clinic. Within 15 minutes, Rohbar had pulled up in a minivan to take them back to Rahim’s brothers’ apartment.
Rohbar was doing what she could for the family under the circumstances, but she understood the chasm between these services and what she did for refugees just months earlier. In fact, Rohbar herself came as a refugee from Afghanistan 22 years ago as a teenager, and those first moments of welcoming live as vivid scenes in her memory. At the airport, they got off the long flight and were fingerprinted by immigration authorities. “You cannot trust any stranger,” in those early days, but there was a representative there from the International Organization for Migration who helped them through the paperwork, and then gave them bus tickets and guided the exhausted family to their bus. In New Haven, IRIS staff greeted them as they walked into the dark September night.
“The case manager was there with two or three cars, and the apartment was ready. The lights were on. Our favorite meal — the Afghan traditional meal — was on the table. The feast was ready, you know, the Afghan feast. The fridge was loaded with food. I don’t have words to explain the excitement.” 
Rohbar kept walking around from one end of the apartment to the other. The beds were made, and the closets were full of clothes. She was fascinated by the food in packages. Back in Afghanistan, they shopped in markets — she’d never seen the boxes and clamshell plastic that fills American supermarkets. “To me that was so interesting! I couldn’t believe it was real.”
And the dish they’d prepared amazed her. It was kabuli pulao. Rohbar had spent years learning to make the recipe from her mother, but her attempts were met with criticism. She never got it quite right. Yet somehow, these strangers across the world knew how to make the dish. 
That night still ranks as the happiest of Rohbar’s entire life. 
“Whenever I’m upset, these memories keep me alive,” Rohbar said. “I can still feel the joy from that night.” 
When Rohbar looked at Rahim and his family — one man, one boy, a woman and four girls with another baby girl on the way — she felt a responsibility, and an excitement, to lead by example.
As a woman, “it’s so shocking to them that I’m speaking in English, I’m working, I’m driving and showing them places,” Rohbar said. In Afghanistan, girls are not allowed to go to school beyond sixth grade, women are generally not allowed to work, get driver’s licenses or even spend time in public spaces. When they do, they must fully cover their bodies and faces. 
Rohbar gives the same pep talk to all of the women she resettles from Afghanistan.
“I tell them, ‘You came this far, you better pick up all the goody bags from here. You came for education, work, and it will be useless if you don’t do anything, if you just do what you did back home. If you don’t take advantage after sacrificing everything — your home! — it will all be in vain for you.’”
In time, Madina would be able to participate in the women’s groups that Rohbar organizes. She could get help learning English and even enroll in adult education if she wanted to. But not yet.
“In the beginning, when they arrive, it’s overwhelming,” Rohbar said.

April 4, 2025: A new home — but what happens next? 
A little over a month since the family arrived in the U.S., they finally had their own apartment. It was a walk-up on the second and third floors of a house in New Haven, near the idyllic Westville neighborhood. IRIS helped them find the apartment with four small bedrooms, overlooking a cemetery, just a few blocks from Edgewood Park. 
Madina had pains in her belly the night before. They still had no furniture, just a few rugs and cushions for the living room floor and the hallway.
But the family seemed lighter. Rahim’s English was improving, and he could express himself without a relative at hand to translate. 
“Right now, I’m good. The only problem is work, my wife is sick, my daughters, my son (needs to) go to school,” Rahim said. He couldn’t get his family around without a driver’s license. “I have appointments … if some people is not busy they coming (to drive me). My brother, my cousin.” 
Mostly, the family stayed inside. 
But today, with the sun out, Rahim decided to take them to the playground while Madina stayed with Asma, the youngest, at home. Rahim wrapped Asia and Asra in thick black parkas. Serwat and Alia, the oldest, helped their siblings tie their shoelaces. Finally, the kids jumped down the stairs and onto the sidewalk. Serwat retrieved a double stroller, and Rahim convinced the youngest girls to ride.
Daffodils and the pink cherry blossoms, the first of the season, opened their faces to the sun. Suddenly, desperate tears were rolling down Alia’s face. She wanted to climb out of the stroller and pick flowers from a manicured bed. She quieted when her father handed her a small, purple flower.

May 1, 2025: First day of school in four years
Serwat got up early. He took a shower and sprayed himself with cologne, gelled his hair and combed it neatly to the side. Today would be his first day in a brick and mortar school in four years. 
After the exit of U.S. armed forces from Afghanistan in 2021, the region of Khost where the family lived fell to Taliban control. Rahim decided to keep Serwat, then 7, at home. His school was 10 kilometers away, and the route between had become too dangerous to risk the journey. He was able to take classes during the few months the family spent at the Qatar refugee camp, but today was different: a new desk all to himself in Lauren Bitterman’s fifth-grade classroom at the Mauro-Sheridan Interdistrict Magnet School in New Haven. 
Serwat had visited the school the day before with Alia, who would start one day after her brother. They’d met all of their teachers and brought home the red shirts that are part of the school’s uniform.

Serwat walked into school with Rahim and Jennifer Huebner, the volunteer who gave them a ride that morning. The students received breakfast as they walked through the door, and Serwat grabbed a box of soy milk. Perhaps he was nervous, but he said only that he was happy. 
At his desk, Bitterman explained the day’s schedule in English, and Serwat mostly didn’t understand. But by a stroke of good luck, there was another Afghan boy, also from Khost, who would be seated next to Serwat. Once he arrived at school, he helped translate. To speak to Serwat’s parents, Bitterman would use a translation app.
Soon they’d leave for French class (“Oh great, another language!” Huebner exclaimed), and later Serwat would get a Halal lunch in the school’s cafeteria. 
Rahim and Huebner said goodbye to Serwat and left the classroom. There were still big milestones to come. Rahim had gotten his driver’s license, and the interfaith group of volunteers Huebner was part of, Shoreline Refugee Resettlement, which works with IRIS, had gotten the family a used Honda, which mechanic Peter Palumbo volunteered to fix up, as he had for other families. Palumbo was also searching for a job for Rahim.
“It makes me really happy to know there are people that are helping, even though they don’t have to do it,” Rahim said through a translator.
Rahim borrowed $800 from the Afghan community in New Haven, a collection of families who help one another through difficult times, to buy a rug and the flat cushions, or toshaka, to furnish one room of the apartment. The contours of their life in this place — where they would live, work, study — were finally visible.

Even so, the new country around them was in a moment of deep uncertainty, economically and politically. Congress was weighing cuts to the programs helping them, like SNAP and Medicaid. On April 11, thousands of Afghans learned that their Temporary Protective Status would not be renewed. That didn’t apply to Rahim and his family as SIVs, but it did impact other IRIS clients.
Rohbar, the IRIS worker who helped them arrange medical appointments, imagined that the future would not be easy for the family. Usually, a single member of IRIS would be assigned to check in with them daily, to make sure they had anything they needed. But there weren’t enough staff to go around any more. Her thoughts centered on Madina, who was due at the end of May. She was having another girl. 
Madina knew what hospital to go to for the birth, but what would happen next? How would their life look in a few months if Rahim found work and Madina had six children at home? Back in Afghanistan, the family would have lived in a compound where aunts and cousins would have lent a hand supervising the kids. 
“Here, it’s gonna be a new life for her,” Rohbar said. “She’s gonna be taking care of a newborn, herself. She’ll have to manage to get her kids to bus stops for school and have a little baby with her,” along with the three other girls who hadn’t yet reached school age. 
After he dropped off Serwat, Rahim went back to the apartment to help Madina. He’d clean up, send Asia and Asra to different corners of the room when they argued. He’d make Asma giggle as she followed him around the apartment. He’d cook a meal. Then, he’d walk back to the school to pick up Serwat and hear about his first day.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025_0307_SR_RahmanFamily_007-edit-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-04 06:00:28.736479

The facility, as seen here in this 2021 photo, is located in Cottonwood Falls, Kansas. (Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)The story of Rosi Alvarado is a story about home.
The 42-year-old mother was lured from her residence in Pittsburg to an immigration office in Kansas City under the pretext of an interview for a green card application. Accompanying Alvarado to that April 23 appointment was her husband, a recently naturalized U.S. citizen, and their 20-year-old daughter.
The daughter, Carina Moran, said in social media posts that Alvarado — who has deep ties to her southeast Kansas home — was tricked by ICE agents.
“I am the daughter of two immigrants,” Moran posted. “My father was born in El Salvador and my mother was born in Guatemala. My dad recently became (a) citizen after a decade of hard work and multiple long drives to interviews and today was my mom’s turn to present herself for her first interview. For an entire week leading up to today I cried and prayed that my mom would stay home and that she was going to a routine interview, but unfortunately we were lied to.”
The family had brought with them documentation to show Alvarado’s life in Pittsburg, including testimonials from community members. Her husband, Nixon Moran, had been a citizen since March. They expected Alvarado, too, would eventually become naturalized, and they hoped the spousal interview would be the first step.
Instead, officials at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Office asked Nixon Moran, 44, to step outside. Alvarado was taken into custody. The family learned that Alvarado had a deportation order from failing to appear in court when she was a youth, in the 2000s, and another issued that morning.
Alvarado, who suffers from diabetes and hypertension, was soon on her way to the Chase County Detention Center at Cottonwood Falls, two hours away in east-central Kansas. It’s a town of about 900 in a pastoral county known for its historic courthouse. The entire population of Chase County is only around 2,600. It’s the kind of place known for its history, Friday night jam sessions at the local cafe and postcard-perfect prairie vistas.
So why are detainees sent to Chase County?
Because for years the 148-bed detention center, owned and operated by the county, has been a major source of revenue. Under a contract with ICE, the jail is filled mostly with foreign nationals from Mexico and Central and South America. When I wrote about the jail in 2021, county officials said the jail was self-sustaining and helped ease the local tax burden. Back then, the jail averaged 70-75 inmates a day, and received $62 for each from ICE.
Now the jail has 143 inmates.
Of those, 119 — or 83% — are listed as “deportable alien,” according to the detention center’s online roster as of April 30. The remainder are either held on unspecified charges or on charges unrelated to immigration, such as assault or robbery.
The entry for Rosemery Alvarado included her mugshot and the two deportation counts. No other charges were listed.
The separation has torn the family apart, Carina Moran said in a post.
“I will not get to hug my mom or say goodbye, my siblings won’t get to either and my dad has to take on all of her responsibilities alone,” she said. “I am heartbroken that she will not watch us graduate, she won’t be there during the most important moments of our lives and I won’t get to share my first experiences with her anymore.”
There’s an online video of the March 19 naturalization ceremony in which Nixon Moran became an American citizen, held at Johnson County Community College. He was among 352 candidates for citizenship presented to U.S. Magistrate Judge Angel Mitchell, who noted that most Americans are either immigrants or descended from immigrants.
The event was both joyful and solemn.
It included the singing of “God Bless America” and a PowerPoint showing the countries of origin of the applicants who, among other requirements, had successfully passed a citizenship test. An oath required the newly minted citizens to renounce foreign princes and potentates, to support and defend the Constitution, and to take up arms for America when required by law.
“We should never take these freedoms for granted,” Mitchell advised, “lest we lose them someday.”
Perhaps Rosi Alvarado was inspired to begin a path to citizenship because of the unabashedly patriotic ceremony. She may have been frightened by stories of other undocumented individuals and even international students being taken from the street and placed in vans. Or she may have just delayed taking the necessary steps for so long because of her poor English skills, as noted by her daughter in a social media post: English proficiency is a requirement for most applicants under the age of 50.
It is unclear from statements made by the family why Alvarado had not obtained a green card, which grants foreign nationals the right to live and work in the United States. But what is abundantly clear is that Alvarado had made a home in Kansas, that she has a family that took their responsibilities to America seriously, and that she had resolved to do the right thing under the law.
The amount of resources ICE invested in removing Alvarado from her family and whisking her away to the detention center at Cottonwood Falls seems disproportionate to any offense she appears to have committed. In a reasonable and just society, the fact that Alvarado was married to an American citizen and had a family here should have moderated the response. But we no longer live in a reasonable or just society, and people living peacefully but without authorization in the United State have become the victims of a thirst for misguided vengeance.

This kind of hatred of others is not new.
It’s been with us in one form or another since the founding of the country, but every lifetime or so the old poison is channeled anew. Slavery could not exist unless it was doctrine that Black people were racially inferior, antisemitism was fueled by lies about secret cabals for world domination, and discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community persists because of fear, lies and hatred. We have entered a new era of government-sponsored bigotry in which even the mention of equity, diversity, and inclusion is being scrubbed from the official record.
Part of the effort to whitewash America is the campaign against migrants who lack necessary documents to remain here legally. As a nation, we have always been more than happy to exploit their labor as farm workers and housekeepers. Now, by government decree and action, we are unwilling to treat them as human beings worthy of respect, a living wage, or a secure place to call home.
Where is Rosi Alvarado tonight?
Not in Kansas, unfortunately.
As of April 30, she was no longer listed on the Chase County Detention Center online roster. The same day, I filed a media request for her location with ICE officials. If the agency couldn’t tell me her exact location, I asked, could they at least confirm she was still in the United States? So far, I’ve received no response.
Carina Moran, however, posted Wednesday the family had received word Alvarado had been transferred to the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center awaiting deportation. Carina has set up a GoFundMe account to help with legal and medical costs related to her mother’s deportation. As of Friday, it had raised $18,430.
That Louisiana facility has become notorious in recent weeks as the location where Tufts University doctoral student Rumeysa Ozturk was held after being snatched by immigration authorities. Ozturk was accused of supporting terrorism by co-authoring an opinion essay in a student newspaper asking Tufts to “recognize Palestinian genocide.”
The Louisiana holding facility is also a for-profit prison, run by Geo Group.
The Marion County Record reported Thursday that Jay Whitney, the director of the Cottonwood Falls jail, said ICE had ordered her removed from the facility. He said he didn’t know the context of Alvarado’s arrest or “how this lady’s getting all this attention.”
A small group protested outside the detention center Sunday.
“I just have a contract to house her,” Whitney told the Record. “I don’t ask questions of how come you’re detaining her or how you’ve come to the conclusion to detain her. That’s on their end.”
It’s difficult to believe Whitney is unaware of Rosi’s case, considering 10 people were holding signs outside the facility over the weekend. But what is more disturbing is his lack of curiosity about the charges against those in his care.
Every jail — even a revenue-producing, tax-lowering enterprise like the Chase County Detention Center — has an obligation to ensure that inmates it is holding are not being denied basic constitutional protections. American law makes little distinction between citizens and noncitizens when it comes to basic rights such as free speech and due process.
Who is in jail and why is at the core of our system of law.
Habeas corpus is an ancient and foundational legal principle that means a person must be bodily presented before a judge on demand. It ensures that individuals are afforded due process and not illegally confined, held in secret prisons, or simply disappeared. While Congress and the courts have narrowed in recent years the ability of those in federal custody to seek relief under habeas corpus, it remains an essential safeguard to civil liberties.
I don’t know what Rosi Alvarado’s legal status is, whether she was given a chance to appear before a judge to protest her deportation, or why she had a failure to appear on her record. The family’s social media posts have been unclear and Carina, her daughter, has not responded to requests for an interview. Frankly, I’m not sure the family understands exactly what is happening. But if what Carina has posted is true, that her mother was lured to an immigration office in expectation of a green card interview and then whisked away in a white van, it raises disturbing and fundamental questions about ICE deportations.
In other cases, the government appears to be playing a sort of shell game with detainees, moving them quickly to jurisdictions far from their places of residence and then putting them on planes without sufficient due process. In at least one case, that of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the government appears to be defying a Supreme Court order to facilitate the individual’s return from a notorious El Salvadoran prison.
The toll of the second Trump administration’s first 100 days is long and loud. It includes economic chaos, civil unease, the unraveling of the federal government, our diminished standing on the world stage and a threat to the rule of law at home.
I have seen no evidence that Rosi Alvarado was a threat to her community. Judging from her daughter’s comments and social media posts, she seems to have been the kind of mother most of us knew, precious to her children, one who held her family close and who enjoyed simple things like watching her kids play football. I think of Rosi and it brings to mind my own mother, long dead now, but still vibrant in memory.
The story of Rosi Alvarado is a story not just of her home, but ours.
It is a snapshot of America in 2025, a glimpse of the place where we live now. Don’t like the surroundings? Then act to change them. As citizens, we have a duty to our neighbors to make sure the Constitution, the supreme law of the land, is observed. If we don’t, home will start to feel like less like a castle and more like a dungeon.

Sage advice on any topic, but especially when it comes to coverage of transportation.  A couple of recent stories illustrate my point.
Improved cell service on Metro-North
Gov. Ned Lamont and Connecticut Department of Transportation Commissioner Garrett Eucalitto held a media event recently in Stamford to promote the fact that AT&T has improved its cell coverage along the New Haven line.  


That telephone company spent $60 million installing 30 high-powered macro towers and small cell nodes, some of them on CDOT land, in a public-private partnership. Many are specifically aimed at dead spots in service on the trains.
This is good news… if you are an AT&T subscriber.  If you use Verizon or T-Mobile and find an area with no cell coverage on your commute, this won’t help you.  The AT&T enhancements are for its customers only. That means only about a third of cellphone using commuters will benefit by this enhancement.
There is no word from the other companies on how they might be filling holes in their service.  But… it’s a start.
However if you read the media coverage, you’d think every commuter’s cellphone coverage had been improved!  “Cellphone service to get upgrade on Metro-North rail line,” proclaimed the Hearst papers.  “Wireless service upgrades coming to New Haven line for CT commuters,” said WSHU public radio. “Gov. Lamont and AT&T launch $6M infrastructure project to improve wireless cell service for Metro-North commuters,” reports News12 TV.
Improved cell coverage is a crucial issue for commuters looking to be more productive during train-time.  But attention-grabbing headlines such as these may lead to a perception of better service.  The more you’re told “cell service is getting better” the more you’ll think it is.  Or so the pols hope. 
But… don’t believe the hype.
Faster than Acela?
In April another media event, this time at Grand Central, celebrated faster train service from New Haven:  three early morning (5 – 7 a.m.) super-express trains, one of them cutting ten minutes off its old running time, making that single train “faster than Acela.”
Great news… if you’re a pre-dawn-commuter from New Haven.  Again, kudos to Metro-North for much needed signal and infrastructure improvements.  But has the average commute to Grand Central really improved?  Not really.  The exception is not the rule.
With limited stops these super-express trains still average only 52 mph.  Regular express trains get about 46 mph and locals run just 38 mph.  Remember: the M-8 cars on Metro-North are capable of 80 mph.
How did the media portray these improvements?
“New Metro-North schedule, with shorter trips on New Haven line, now in effect,” trumpeted the Hearst papers. “Metro-North Is Faster Than Acela,” promised Bloomberg (quoting MTA chairman and CEO Janno Lieber).
The “faster than Acela” claim is technically true… for one Metro-North train.  Keep in mind that New Haven to Grand Central Terminal is 73 miles, but to Penn Station (on Amtrak) is 75 miles.  But not wanting to always sound like a grouch, I say good for Metro-North.
What worries me is the media coverage which over generalizes and lacks the caveats I’ve cited.  Telling commuters repeatedly that their trains are running faster, when they are not, may be persuasive, but it is not accurate.
So, take media coverage of transportation with a grain of salt.  The headlines don’t always tell the full story.  And don’t believe the hype.

(Matthew Perschall for Louisiana Illuminator)A lone legislative race and a smattering of local tax referendums around the state were put before Louisiana voters Saturday, when a sparse ballot had to compete with the usual spring schedule of festivals and events throughout the Bayou State
In East Baton Rouge Parish, a special election was held to fill the vacancy in Louisiana House District 67. The position became open when Larry Selders won a February election for the state Senate seat vacated when Cleo Fields won the 6th Congressional District race last year.


One notable item on Saturday’s ballot was the Lake Charles mayoral race, with Republican incumbent Nic Hunter losing to independent challenger Marshall Simien Jr.
Other highlights from Saturday’s results included a rejected property tax referendum for the East Baton Rouge Parish district attorney’s office. DA Hillar Moore had said the new millage was needed to bring his agency up to par in staffing and compensation with comparably large prosecutorial districts in Orleans and Jefferson parishes.
The 4-mill levy was projected to raise $24 million annually, with Moore projecting there would be enough revenue generated for his office to return millions to the parish government general fund. With the new tax failing, resources for the district attorney will continue to come from parish government.
In New Orleans, voters narrowly approved a property tax for the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office, which has the primary task of operating the city jail. The final vote tally saw the measure prevail by a margin of two votes out of more than 25,000 ballots cast. The results still have to be verified by the Secretary of State.
Although the sheriff’s tax has already been in place for years, opponents leaned into a “no new taxes” message in their campaign against the 2.46-mill, 10-year collection. The tax is expected to generate nearly $14 million in revenue for the sheriff’s office.
St. Tammany Parish voters approved a bond sale for its public school system with a ceiling of $325 million. The debt is not expected to result in an increase to existing property millages dedicated to the school district.
A property tax in Livingston Parish public schools was renewed for another 10 years. The 7 mills will generate nearly $5 million a year for the district.
Rapides Parish voters also renewed two property taxes for their public school system, totaling 9.58 mills combined, for the next 10 years. They’re forecast to generate more than $10 million annually.

The overall budget, which includes federal dollars and other special funds, is a 3.5% increase over the current two-year budget cycle.
“We managed to address all of our needs and some of our wants, and we did it without raising any taxes. We did it without borrowing any money, and we provided record (property tax) relief,” said Senate Majority Leader David Hogue, R-Minot.

The preliminary two-year budget for general fund spending for 2025-27 is $6.25 billion, an increase of 2.6% over 2023-25.
Though legislators started the 2025 session with excess revenue, they’re keeping a cautious eye to the future with the state’s growth projected to slow amid lower oil prices, declining oil tax revenue and uncertainty about tariffs. Lawmakers also funded investments that aim to spur new oil production and diversify the state’s economy.
Gov. Kelly Armstrong said he’s excited the Legislature passed a property tax package that includes a $1,600 primary residence tax credit and provisions to limit future property tax increases, an idea he pitched at the start of the session. Armstrong said he’s also pleased lawmakers adopted a “bell-to-bell” cellphone ban for public schools, another idea he championed.
“I think those two things will have an immediate impact,” Armstrong said early Saturday.
The property tax package is funded with earnings from the state’s $12 billion Legacy Fund. Armstrong said if lawmakers allow the fund to continue to grow, it could put most homeowners on a path to paying zero property taxes within a decade.
“What a legacy for our kids and grandkids, to be able to have a significant amount paid toward their property tax,” said House Majority Leader Mike Lefor, R-Dickinson.
House Minority Leader Zac Ista, D-Grand Forks, told his colleagues he’s glad they spent more time on the “real issues facing North Dakotans” this year than they had in recent years, referring to culture war issues that dominated much of the 2023 session.
“Let that be the start of a positive trend for our body, and let us commit to resisting the pull of polarization and extremism,” Ista said.

Some, including Armstrong, said the Legislature missed an opportunity to do more to address the state’s housing and workforce needs.
“But those are tough issues, so we always have more time for that,” Armstrong said.
State hospital, behavioral health
Legislators approved $300 million to construct a new State Hospital in Jamestown, which will replace an outdated facility. The project will provide 140 beds to serve people in need of acute mental health services. 
Rep. Jon Nelson, R-Rugby, who chaired the division of the House Appropriations Committee that handled the budget for Health and Human Services, said that project is critical for the state. Lawmakers had considered reducing the funding to $285 million, but ultimately approved $300 million. The Office of Management and Budget will oversee construction of the project.
“It was our highest priority in our section with the Human Service budget,” Nelson said.

Lawmakers approved other investments in regional behavioral health services, including nearly $13 million to create 24 new in-patient acute psychiatric beds in Grand Forks and $1.5 million for 10 beds in Williston.  
Legislators also fully funded the Free Through Recovery and Community Connect programs that help people with recovery support.
Prison overcrowding
The Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation budget includes $28.4 million for payments to county and regional jails, which are housing inmates due to crowding at state prisons. The department is looking to staff and operate unused space in Grand Forks County’s new jail expansion for some state prisoners. Armstrong’s administration secured a letter of intent from the Grand Forks County Commission to enter into an agreement, with terms still being finalized.

The budget also includes more than $35 million to complete the Heart River Correctional Center in Mandan, the first state prison designed for women. Another $8 million is dedicated for a temporary facility to add beds for the Missouri River Correctional Center and $20 million to design and plan a new medium-security prison that’s proposed to be built next to the State Penitentiary.
A group of three bills backed by the corrections department aims to keep people out of the criminal justice system and lead to a lower recidivism rate after inmates are released. 
The recidivism rate was a point of discussion as Attorney General Drew Wrigley backed what he called a truth-in-sentencing bill. Senate Bill 2128 sought to make sure inmates in the state prison system spend most of their sentence behind bars, but it was defeated in the House.
Education funding
K-12 education was a major topic for lawmakers, but proposals to establish private school vouchers or Education Savings Accounts did not survive the session. Armstrong vetoed one bill because it only affected private school students, and lawmakers defeated a more comprehensive bill, in large part due to the high price tag.
Lawmakers did approve a bill establishing public charter schools in North Dakota for the first time.
Legislators voted down proposals to provide free school meals to all students, an idea that was strongly supported by the public. 
Lawmakers did include $7.3 million in the Department of Public Instruction budget to make free lunch available to students from families within 225% of the federal poverty level. That’s an increase from 200% of the poverty line that was funded in the 2023 session. It means a family of four with an income of about $72,000 would qualify for free school lunches.
Free school lunch advocates call on Legislature to act 

The Together for School Meals coalition has said it’s deeply disappointed the Legislature did not pass universal school meals.
“Free school meals is a policy supported by 79% of North Dakotans and championed by over 80 local organizations committed to ending child hunger,” said Amy Jacobson, executive director of Prairie Action ND and a member of the coalition. “This bill had the power to put real money — an estimated $850 per child per year — back into the pockets of hardworking parents.” 
The overall Department of Public Instruction budget contains a 2.5% increase of the per-pupil payment for each year of the biennium, raising it to $11,349 in fiscal year 2026 and $11,633 the following year. The Senate advocated for 3% each year.
Legislation signed by Armstrong will make public K-12 schools phone-free, requiring personal electronic devices to be stowed and inaccessible during instructional time. The law takes effect Aug. 1.
Culture war bills
Lawmakers debated several controversial issues that ultimately failed. A resolution urging an end to same-sex marriage passed the House but later was defeated in the Senate.
Lawmakers also defeated a bill to require the display of the Ten Commandments in schools and public colleges and rejected a resolution that declared the kingship of Jesus Christ.
The Legislature spent a considerable amount of time on policing the content in public libraries and bathrooms at public schools. 
North Dakota governor vetoes controversial library content bill

Armstrong vetoed a bill that addressed content in public libraries and K-12 schools, which expanded on legislation approved two years ago. Failure to comply could have cost the library or school state funding and resulted in criminal charges. 
“The bill imposes vague and punitive burdens on professionals and opens the door to a host of unintended and damaging consequences for our communities,” Armstrong said in his veto message.
Armstrong signed a bill that prevents K-12 public schools from building new all-gender, multistall bathrooms. Lawmakers added an exemption for existing restrooms after schools complained they would have to spend millions to bring their facilities into compliance. Schools could be fined if they don’t comply with the bathroom policy and other regulations in the same section of code, including a requirement for schools and teachers to inform a students’ parents if they learn the child is transgender. 
The governor also signed a bill that amends Century Code to state “words used to reference an individual’s gender mean the individual’s sex,” a proposal some critics called discriminatory to transgender and intersex North Dakotans. 
Property rights
Landowner groups and local government officials argued with lawmakers this session to maintain local control, though frequently ended up on the losing side of the debate. 
House Bill 1258 gave the Public Service Commission more authority over setback rules on large electrical transmission lines, taking away authority from townships and counties.

Sen. Terry Wanzek, R-Jamestown, represents an area where a large power line is planned. A township created a half-mile setback from residences, and Wanzek said such rules hinder the project and threaten others like it across the state. 
House Bill 2321, which aimed to strengthen the position of landowners in negotiations with oil and infrastructure developers by helping them recoup legal fees, had support in the Senate but ultimately failed in the House. 
The bill was sponsored by Sen. Jeff Magrum, R-Hazelton, who represents an area where the controversial Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline is routed. His other bills to strengthen landowner rights and limit carbon capture development made little headway. 
On the final day of the session, lawmakers approved a bill that aims to keep North Dakota on the forefront of rare earth mineral development. The Northwest Landowners Association argued the bill is unconstitutional.
Loss of lawmaker
During the session, House members mourned the loss of Rep. Josh Christy, R-Fargo, who died in February at age 43. 
Last week, Armstrong signed two bills sponsored by Christy, who had developed a niche in the Legislature on the subjects of artificial intelligence and technology.

“While we continue to mourn, we celebrate the achievements he made and the legacy he left with his service,” Ista said.
As lawmakers closed out the session they also acknowledged Rep. Jim Kasper, R-Fargo, who was hospitalized late in the session.
Special session?
Lawmakers adjourned on day 74 of the session, which means they have six days remaining of their 80-day limit. 
Several expressed a desire to save days in case lawmakers need to return to address impacts on the state from cut federal funds.
“It’s highly likely that we’ll need to get called back,” said Sen. Judy Lee, R-West Fargo.
Lee, who chaired the Senate Human Services Committee, said she’s watching potential cuts to Medicaid or other human services funding that could require the state to respond.
“Without the money, the state has to be able to step up,” Lee said. “And we’re lucky to be in a position to know that we’re probably going to be able to do that.”

The state Democrats issued a statement warning of “misguided and chaotic national policies” that threaten local impacts. 
“Already we’ve lost promised funds for rural infrastructure, mental health care and even the care of disabled persons,” Ista said.
The governor can also call a special session, which would not have a time limit.
“We’ll wait and see where we’re at,” Armstrong said Saturday. “It costs money to bring everybody back. Obviously, if there’s a real reason to do it, we will do it.”

(Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)The Colorado House of Representatives passed a bill Saturday to expand the state’s existing protections for immigrants and further limit how local law enforcement can interact with federal immigration authorities.
Senate Bill 25-276 passed on a party-line vote, with Democrats in favor. The Senate, which approved it in April, needs to sign off on changes made in the House before the bill heads to Gov. Jared Polis’ desk.
“There is clarity in place of what happens when an (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) action takes place. Notice that I’m saying ‘when,’ because everyone here knows that there is zero sense of false hope, especially in our immigrant population. They know more than anyone here in this room that they are not living risk free,” Rep. Lorena Garcia, a bill sponsor and Adams County Democrat, said ahead of the vote.
“This bill is a declaration to our commitment to civil and constitutional rights in this state, for everyone who calls this state home,” she said.

The bill would prohibit local government officials and employees from sharing personal identifying information about immigration status with ICE and would also limit where ICE can go within a public school, child care facility, hospital and library without a warrant signed by a judge. A House amendment removed the inclusion of “surrounding areas” to those banned spaces.
Public officials who intentionally violate that data sharing provision would be liable for a $50,000 civil fine, which would go to the state’s immigration legal defense fund.
The bill would also prevent local sheriffs from delaying a person’s release from jail for the purpose of immigration enforcement, get rid of certain affidavit requirements for immigrants seeking in-state tuition or a drivers license, and allow immigrant defendants to ask that a guilty plea is overturned if they were not aware of immigration consequences of that plea when they made it.
“This bill does not provide immigrants with more rights than citizens, but it ensures equal treatment under the law,” bill sponsor Rep. Elizabeth Velasco, a Glenwood Springs Democrat, said.
Democrats framed the bill as a response to the Trump administration’s mass deportation efforts and increased detentions of immigrants without legal status, which they said are often imposed without the due process the bill tries to protect.
“When we violate due process, we violate justice,” Garcia said.
An Aurora apartment building was the site of a chaotic immigration raid earlier this year, and dozens of international students in Colorado have had their visas revoked. There have also been coordinated drug and immigration enforcement efforts at unofficial nightclubs in Adams County and Colorado Springs, and it is unclear whether the people detained in those actions have a criminal history warranting arrest.
“One of the reasons why I appreciate this bill so much is that it is one of few that is really taking seriously the crisis that the federal administration poses for immigrants in particular and for marginalized people generally,” Rep. Yara Zokaie, a Fort Collins Democrat, said.
Republicans, during the initial debate on the bill and on Saturday, argued that the bill could provoke the Trump administration to target Colorado and withhold federal money. On Friday afternoon, the Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against Polis, Attorney General Phil Weiser and Denver Mayor Mike Johnston to invalidate the type of “sanctuary” laws that prohibit coordination and information sharing between local officials and immigration authorities.
“This is super-sizing sanctuary policy,” Rep. Max Brooks, a Castle Rock Republican, said. “When we consider this bill, we ought to be looking at the downsides, not just the emotional stories to be able to support it, but we need to look at what could potentially be the harm and the downstream negative impact.”
Eric Maruyama, a Polis spokesperson, said in a statement Saturday that the “Governor’s office has expressed concerns about the original version of SB25-276, and has been working with legislators, as well as stakeholders, including law enforcement, throughout the process on amendments that would help gain the Governor’s support. Colorado is not a sanctuary state, and Governor Polis continues urging Congress to secure the border and do their job and pass comprehensive immigration reform.”
Once the bill is sent to Polis, he will have 30 days to sign or veto it. The legislative session ends Wednesday.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)LOUISVILLE — While most of Churchill Downs’ spectators watched thoroughbreds race the track, jockeying of a different kind unfolded in the stands.
The Kentucky Derby — the most famous sporting event annually held in the Bluegrass State on the first Saturday in May — draws a spate of celebrities and business executives. With the amount of influence in attendance, it’s no wonder Kentucky politicians come out to the races. 
Despite Saturday’s rainy weather, horse racing fans gathered at the track early to take their seats and place bets in ticket booths. Some high-profile guests, including Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear and his family, walked a red carpet to talk with local and national media outlets about the Derby. Others, like Democratic Lt. Gov. Jacqueline Coleman and  Republican U.S. Rep. James Comer shared photos from the red carpet and grandstand online.
U.S. Sen. Rand Paul said on X he planned to attend the Derby with his wife, Kelley, on Saturday. 
“While you’re enjoying mint juleps and hot browns like we are, remember to thank all of those working to make the Derby possible!” Paul said, referring to a classic Derby cocktail and a dish that orignated in Louisville.
Stephen Voss, a political science professor at the University of Kentucky said “there’s so many reasons” a politician may want to be seen at the Kentucky Derby. The event historically attracts many of the state’s power brokers, giving candidates and elected officials a chance to network “in a way that’s festive with the people whose support they need.” 
Beshear, the state’s top Democrat, said during his Thursday press conference that the Derby is “our premier day for talking to businesses that either are looking at Kentucky or could potentially look at Kentucky.” The governor added that the event brings a boost of tourism to the state. 
“I typically see about two races on Derby day — one if I’m just lucky enough to be standing next to the window and one, the Derby race itself,” Beshear said. “But I mean, this is a date where we don’t just see celebrities and athletes, which are great, it raises the profile of the event, but we see international CEOs enjoying the best of the best of hospitality.”

Beshear himself had a viral moment from during an interview he did at Churchill Downs earlier in the week. He told Louisville TV station WDRB that running for president in 2028 is “something I would consider” if he could be someone who could bring the U.S. together. That quote was picked up in national media reports. 
Ahead of the main race, Republican Attorney General Russell Coleman shared on X that the Derby is a “a tradition that brings the eyes of the world to the Commonwealth.”
“The Derby is more than a race. It’s a symbol of our history and culture,” Coleman said. “From the thundering hooves to the hats and hospitality, this day reminds us—there’s  no place like the Bluegrass.” 
Voss said one advantage for politicians who make news at the Derby is that media coverage of the event “reaches a lot of people who do not like politics and who basically avoid political news.” 
“This is a chance for those politicians to get name recognition with people who are usually very difficult or expensive to reach, and they’ll be reaching them for free. Well, minus the cost of attending,” Voss said.  “As political ads go, that’s cheap. What’s not to love, right? They get to go to this event, have a good time and they’re probably doing more for their political careers than they accomplished at the average boring or riskier outing.”
Former Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron, a Republican who is now seeking to replace Mitch McConnell in the U.S. Senate in 2026, made an appearance at Churchill Downs Thursday — also known as “Thurby.” While the Kentucky Derby is the last race on Saturday, horses run the track throughout the week at Churchill Downs. 
Politicians even celebrate the Derby outside of the Bluegrass State. On Thursday, McConnell held his annual Pre-Kentucky Derby Luncheon in the U.S. Capitol with a menu that included Kern’s Kitchen Derby-Pie, fried chicken and biscuits, fried okra and corn pudding. 
President Donald Trump issued a statement Saturday calling the Derby “an iconic American institution and an elegant celebration of our culture, customs, and unwavering competitive spirit.” The Republican last attended the races in 2022. 
The Derby also is an opportunity for politicians to be seen in a personable way, Voss said.  
“Sometimes we talk about it as the ‘Which candidate would you want to have a beer with?’ but it’s more general than that,” Voss said. “People trust more the representation they’ll get from a politician who seems more like them in certain ways, seems to have common sense, and being seen having fun, doing something like going to the Derby, makes the politician seem like less of a politician. Seems more like someone able to deliver the sort of representation a regular voter would like.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_3954-1024x694.jpg,,,2025-05-03 18:06:15.634988

Nikema Williams. Stanley Dunlap/Georgia Recorder Charlie Bailey, the former attorney general and lieutenant governor candidate, was elected as chairman of the Democratic Party of Georgia Saturday, replacing Atlanta U.S. Rep. Nikema Williams.
Bailey becomes the Georgia Democrat’s first full-time chair as the party intensifies its efforts to fundraise and campaign for candidates, and reenergize a base after setbacks following the 2020 historic elections for U.S. Sens. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff.
President Donald Trump’s return to the White House looms large as Georgia Democrats look ahead, which fueled questions about the role of party leadership in winning close elections. Trump’s narrow Georgia win played a key role in his return to the White House this year.
In the runoff election to lead Georgia Democrats, Bailey won 53% of the votes, with a margin of 116 votes to 98 votes over Wendy Davis, a former Rome City Commissioner and 2022 candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives.
Bailey was the Democratic nominee for attorney general in 2018 and lieutenant governor in 2022.
Top Georgia Democratic Party officials have endorsed Bailey, including U.S. Sen. Ossoff and U.S. Rep. Lucy McBath, a Marietta Democrat who delivered Bailey’s nomination speech on Saturday.
The new chair said he plans to hit the ground running by raising money for key races this year, and in next year’s election when Ossoff will be on the ballot. He’ll also need to focus on races for state legislative and statewide constitutional seats including governor.
Bailey will need to unite progressive and more moderate wings of Georgia’s Democratic base to get the party back in the win column.
“I only ask to be judged on my heart and on my work, and I think my work as a lawyer and in politics shows I’ve got a heart for democratic values,” Bailey said following the election. “We’re  going to support all of our people and get as many Democrats elected across the state as humanly possible.”
During his campaign for party chair, Bailey has cited his experience as an attorney who represented local officials seeking to stop last-minute rule changes made by the State Election Board that might have prevented the certification of the presidential election.
Bailey finished first among a field of party chair candidates that also included Gwinnett County state Sen. Nabilah Islam Parkes, former Augusta Mayor Hardie Davis, Nakita Hemingway of Atlanta, a former Democratic nominee for Agricultural commissioner and District 1 chairman Jay Jones from coastal Georgia, who finished third in Saturday’s election.
Bailey said that the state Democratic Party will have to win over voters by following the party’s long-held ideals for improving health care, education and the economy inequality.
Bailey said Georgia’s Republican Party is failing residents because of the closure of rural hospitals after the state GOP’s leadership resistance to full Medicaid expansion and lagging public school ratings.
“That is what they have given us, the people of Georgia,” Bailey said. “Democrats, independents, Republicans, they got full cause to be angry about that, and we’re going to make sure that they know what the Republicans have done, the choices they make, and what we stand for
  U.S. Rep. Lucy McBath delivered Charlie Bailey’s Democratic Party of Georgia chairperson nomination speech Saturday. Stanley Dunlap/Georgia Recorder
McBath said Bailey is the right person to lead the party because he knows the ins and outs of politics while also being able to raise the millions of dollars needed for campaigning.
“I’m not going to mince words about what’s happening in D.C. right now,” McBath said. “Our democracy is truly on the line, and it’s time that Georgians stand up. It’s time that we say enough is enough.”

Chairman Drew McKissick of Columbia won in the first and only round of voting needed Saturday at the state GOP convention. He was backed by 56% of the 907 delegates attending the Columbia Metropolitan Convention Center.

Former Sen. Lee Bright of Spartanburg County came in second with 41%, followed by Denny Floyd, longtime treasurer of the Anderson County GOP, at 3%.
“We’ve proven we know how to win in South Carolina,” McKissick told delegates gathered in South Carolina’s capital.
Chairman since 2017, McKissick has presided over a red wave that has given the Legislature its biggest Republican majority since Reconstruction.
A Democrat hasn’t won a statewide office in South Carolina since 2006, and Republicans hold six of the state’s seven U.S. House seats.
Nominating McKissick was 7th District Rep. Russell Fry of Murrells Inlet, who in November won his second term in the seat anchored by fast-growing Horry County.
“We need to keep mobilizing the grassroots and there’s no stronger person to do that than Drew McKissick,” said Fry, a former state legislator.
In the last eight years, 20 elected officials have switched parties from Democrat to Republican. The latest was Solicitor David Pascoe —chief prosecutor for Calhoun, Dorchester and Orangeburg counties since 2004 — who’s considering a 2026 run for state attorney general.
Others include freshman state Rep. Harriett Holman, who changed parties in 2022 while she was on the Dorchester County Council. She ousted a 20-year Democratic incumbent in the Statehouse last year — among 11 House seats and seven Senate seats flipped since 2020 — to become the Legislature’s only female Black Republican.
Holman, of Ridgeville, said she never would’ve been able to flip the seat held by Rep. Joe Jefferson for two decades if not for McKissick.
Other freshmen flipping a seat in November include state Sen. JD Chaplin of Hartsville, whose ousting of 22-year incumbent Sen. Gerald Malloy stunned even political observers. If not for McKissick, Chaplin told the crowd Saturday, that seat would still be blue.
“If it wasn’t for the support that Drew McKissick gave me, we would not have a supermajority in the Senate,” he said to applause.
But both Floyd and Bright, a firebrand former senator, argued the state has become too liberal. They argued the party needs to elect Republicans further to the right on the political spectrum.

The vote showed most of the party faithful disagreed.
Bright, a Freedom Caucus-like legislator before the hardline Republican caucus existed, lost a bid last year to regain the Senate seat he lost in 2016.
“One thing that’s so discouraging: People are so trusting that if I elect a Republican, I’m going to get conservative government, and we don’t,” he said.
McKissick was the national Republican Party co-chair for more than a year before announcing his resignation in February 2024.
His decision came as then-former President Donald Trump called for new leadership on the national level. Though he had not yet become the party’s official nominee, he’d won every state contest, including a 20-percentage-point win against former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley in her home state.
Trump’s picks as the new co-chairs of the Republican National Committee were Michael Whatley, chair of the North Carolina GOP, and his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump.

As McKissick was announced Saturday, one delegate in the crowd shouted, “He was fired by Trump.”
But McKissick said the suggestion that he has anything but a good relationship with Trump is false.
“People will try to mislead and lie to some folks about people coming into our party — trying to make it to be that they are more MAGA than someone else or they are more America First,” McKissick said to the SC Daily Gazette, referring to Trump’ Make America Great Again slogan.

(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The fate of more than 15 million customers’ genetic data remains in limbo after popular DNA testing company 23andMe filed for bankruptcy in March. The data is up for sale, stoking fears about how it might be used and prompting attorneys general from more than a dozen states to warn 23andMe users: Delete your data.
“Your genetic data is your most personal, confidential data, and you should be able to protect who has access to it,” North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson, a Democrat, said in a March statement.
“You have the power to delete your data now — please act quickly.”
Dr. Adam Brown, a Washington, D.C.-based emergency physician and the founder of a health care strategy firm, deleted his information on 23andMe as soon as he learned of the bankruptcy filing, he told Stateline.
For him, the bankruptcy begs a vital question that federal and state laws don’t fully address: What happens to your genetic data when the company holding it collapses?
Federal protections are flimsy. States have beefed up their genetic privacy laws in recent years, but many experts say they don’t go far enough.










There actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.


– Dr. Adam Brown, emergency physician and founder of a health care strategy company


23andMe has said the bankruptcy will not change how it stores, manages or protects its trove of sensitive customer information. In a news release issued shortly after the bankruptcy announcement, the company said any potential buyers would have to agree to comply with 23andMe’s consumer privacy policy and all applicable laws. When contacted by Stateline, the company declined to comment beyond what it has published in news releases and information it posted for customers on its website.
But once the data is in the hands of another company, that company could change its privacy policy at any time, experts noted.
“Once you get to the point of bankruptcy court, there may not be those same guarantees or the same ethos a new company may have around privacy protections for consumers,” Brown said.
“I want people to understand there actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.”
 HIPAA doesn’t help

Companies such as 23andMe offer their users potentially game-changing revelations about their health and ancestry. The process is simple: Mail in a saliva sample and the company uses it to build an individual genetic profile that can reveal not only a person’s family connections, but also health insights such as their risk of developing a disease like cancer or Alzheimer’s.
This valuable personal data underpins a direct-to-customer genetic testing market that was valued at $1.93 billion globally in 2023 and is expected to grow, according to market research firm Grand View Research.
23andMe was an industry giant until its stock price plummeted following a massive 2023 data breach that affected the accounts of nearly 7 million customers. Then came the $30 million class-action lawsuit settlement.
The company declared bankruptcy in late March of this year, and announced it’s up for sale.
States Battle Big Tech Over Data Privacy Laws

A flurry of alerts from state attorneys general around the country soon followed. AGs from states including Alabama, Arizona, California, Kentucky, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Texas issued similar press releases that recommended customers ask the company to delete their genetic profile and destroy the saliva sample used to create it.
“We have robust state privacy laws that include data deletion rights, and I would encourage any Texan concerned about their data to exercise the right to have their data securely deleted,” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, said in an April statement.
The fear is that a new 23andMe owner could choose to use or share sensitive personal genetic data in ways the company’s current privacy policy doesn’t allow. There’s worry it could be used, for example, to inflate people’s life insurance premiums or expose them to employment discrimination.
And there aren’t many guardrails to prevent that from happening.
HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, doesn’t apply to companies like 23andMe. The landmark federal law protects patients’ sensitive health information when it’s handled by doctors, hospitals and health insurers. But direct-to-customer companies such as 23andMe or Ancestry aren’t considered health care providers, and their non-invasive saliva collection kit isn’t considered a medical test.
The main federal law that protects people from discrimination based on their genetic information is nearly 20 years old. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) was passed in 2008, long before the rise of at-home testing kits. It applies to employers and health insurers, but not to life insurance companies, mortgage lenders and other non-health entities. And it doesn’t explicitly protect epigenetic information, which is information about the way a person’s genes — and by extension, health — are affected by outside factors such as smoking, disease or stress.
 What states are doing

In the past five years, at least 14 states have passed laws regulating direct-to-consumer genetic testing offered by companies like Ancestry and 23andMe. There’s variation, but generally the laws require companies to get customers’ express consent before using or sharing their data, and allow customers to request their genetic data be deleted and biological samples destroyed.
It’s a good start, but doesn’t go far enough, said Anya Prince, a University of Iowa law professor whose research focuses on health and genetic privacy.
Many of those state efforts were built around a model law developed by the Coalition for Genetic Data Protection, an industry group with two member companies: 23andMe and Ancestry.
DNA Databases Are Boon to Police But Menace to Privacy, Critics Say

As DNA testing kits exploded in popularity and attracted increased scrutiny from lawmakers, the coalition pushed to influence legislation and set industry standards. The privacy protections in the laws mirror what 23andMe and Ancestry were already doing with their own privacy policies, experts say.
“They do have some really sensible privacy protections,” said Prince. “It’s great that people can delete their genetic data, and it’s great that law enforcement needs a warrant to access it. But if a privacy advocate had written a model law, there would be the potential for more and broader protections.”
For example, she said, many of the state laws address privacy requirements just for direct-to-consumer DNA testing companies. If 23andMe’s data is bought by, say, a pharmaceutical company, those state laws no longer apply.
The coalition now appears to be inactive, its website defunct.
Since 2020, more than a dozen states have passed some version of a genetic information privacy law, including Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming, based on a Stateline analysis. This year, the Indiana legislature passed a bill that’s now headed to the governor’s desk. Bills have been introduced this year in other states, including West Virginia.
Prince said state laws rely too heavily on consumers to self-manage their data privacy. They’re expected to understand a company’s policy, when studies have shown the public often doesn’t read privacy notices nor fully understand how companies use their data. Further, many state laws don’t address how third parties, such as law enforcement, can access and use consumer genetic data.

It’s also not always clear how the laws will be enforced, or who’s responsible for oversight.
“In general, I think there’s a disconnect between how people think their privacy is protected and how it’s actually protected,” she said.
But a few states have enacted laws that are more robust. California, for example, has a genetic information privacy law, but also has a general data protection law, as well as a state version of the federal GINA law that extends genetic anti-discrimination protections into areas including housing, education and licensing.
Florida has beefed up its DNA privacy laws in recent years, making the using or selling of an individual’s DNA without informed consent a felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison and up to a $10,000 fine. Florida was also the first state to prohibit life, disability and long-term care insurance companies from using genetic information to determine coverage.

Roers expressed frustration early Saturday that the House and Senate could not reach an agreement on adding more transparency to campaign finance reporting. (Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)A stripped-down campaign finance bill failed in the Senate early Saturday morning after a prolonged disagreement between chambers.
House Bill 1377 was the last bill on the House and Senate floor for the 2025 legislative session. Some lawmakers hoped it would be a vehicle for ambitious changes in campaign spending transparency, as well as for streamlining financial disclosure regulations for candidates.
It would have taken effect at the same time as the launch of the North Dakota Secretary of State’s Office’s new campaign finance system.
“We had a real opportunity this year with the new software coming in to take a big step forward in our campaign finance transparency and unfortunately, we failed,” said Sen. Kristin Roers, R-Fargo, who sat on the conference committee appointed to workshop the bill.
North Dakota Legislature adopts ‘historic’ property tax bill on final day of session

A conference committee of six lawmakers met several times throughout the day to work out differences over the bill. The committee ultimately decided against including a handful of transparency-related proposals in the legislation.
Dissatisfied with what the committee advanced to the floor, Roers ultimately asked the Senate to reject the proposal when it got to the floor about 3:45 a.m. Saturday. It failed 5-39.
The House, meanwhile, gave the bill a favorable 65-25 vote. Rep. Dan Ruby, R, Minot, who sponsored House Bill 1377, said the bill deserved to pass even if some lawmakers wished it had done more for campaign finance transparency.
“This is still a good bill,” he said.
House Bill 1377 sought to incentivize campaign reporting compliance by increasing late fees and making info about late filers public online.
“If you are late with fines or amendments in the future, that information will be posted on the Secretary of State’s website,” said Rep. Vicky Steiner, R-Dickinson, who carried the bill on the floor Saturday morning.
Other changes highlighted by Steiner included inflationary adjustments to campaign contribution reporting thresholds, and updating state law to reflect an Attorney General’s Opinion related to federal political action committees.
The bill sought to revive some components of Senate Bill 2156, which failed upon its second visit to the Senate floor earlier this session after significant amendments by the House.
A Senate committee led by Roers had voted to fold elements of Senate Bill 2156 into House Bill 1377 — causing consternation among some lawmakers in the House. The Senate approved the changes, though the House voted last week not to concur with the amendments.
The conference committee discussed, though ultimately rejected, several transparency-related provisions.
One was to publicize candidates’ beginning and ending campaign fund balances. Lawmakers also considered making itemized campaign expenditures available to the public. North Dakota already makes campaign contributions above $200 public.
Some legislators on the committee were skeptical the additional information would be useful.
Steiner said during a Friday meeting that full campaign spending information should not be publicized because it can be weaponized against candidates  — especially in small communities.
“My rural legislators are concerned about someone saying, ‘You bought from Joe and you didn’t buy from me, Bill,’” she said during the meeting.
Rep. Steve Vetter, R-Grand Forks, said he doesn’t think the public is interested in a higher level of detail.
“Nobody’s asking to know which vendors I’m working with or those types of things,” Vetter said.
Rep. Emily O’Brien, R-Grand Forks, told her colleagues on the House floor she was disappointed with the direction the bill had taken. She said she didn’t understand why some lawmakers are reluctant to make more campaign finance data public.
“No one should have to ask,” O’Brien said.
Bill would require more frequent financial disclosure reporting from North Dakota officials

Gov. Kelly Armstrong, who spoke with reporters early Saturday about some of the final bills of the session, said he doesn’t think citizen lawmakers should be required to report the same level of financial disclosures as congressional candidates. But he said the items in House Bill 1377 seemed reasonable.
“I don’t think asking for beginning fund balances and ending fund balances and itemizing your expenses in a campaign are too much to ask of elected officials,” said Armstrong, a former state senator and U.S. House representative. 
“I think the more transparency you have, the more trust you get from the public,” he added. 
Armstrong last week signed a separate bill that will require North Dakota officials to file financial disclosure forms annually, rather than only when they are appointed or file to run for office.  House Bill 1469 also requires the secretary of state to publish the forms online.

U of M Health-Sparrow serves as the Office of the Medical Examiner for several counties in mid-Michigan, including Eaton, Ingham, Ionia, Isabella, and Shiawassee counties, annually compiling a drug report tracking trend in drug-related deaths.
In 2024, drug-related deaths fell to below 130 deaths in the five counties, a steep drop from the more than 180 drug-related deaths seen in 2023, according to the U of M report. Clinton and Livingston counties, which are also served by U of M Health-Sparrow’s medical examiner, saw declines in drug deaths as well.
Though the report remarks that most drug-related deaths recorded are due to more than one substance, year after year opioids, particularly fentanyl, are involved.
Statewide, Michigan’s state health department has remarked that efforts to reduce drug-related deaths, particularly fighting the opioid crisis, are working, with Michigan seeing a decline in overdose deaths from 2021 to 2023 that was almost five times greater than the decline seen nationally.  
2024-annual-ome-drug-report
President Donald Trump first declared opioid overdoses to be a public health emergency in 2017, after overdoses began to accelerate in the 1990’s.
The U of M report found that drug deaths peaked in 2018 in mid-Michigan counties, reaching more than 200 deaths, largely attributed to a stark increase in fentanyl-related deaths, with 27 more deaths being related to the opioid than in 2017.
Between 2023 and 2024, fentanyl-related deaths were cut nearly in half, the U of M report found.
Last week, in an effort to curb the distribution of fentanyl in Michigan, lawmakers in the Michigan state House bipartisanly passed legislation to set mandatory minimum prison sentences for those found distributing heroin, fentanyl or carfentanil.
Rep. Sarah Lightner (R-Springport) who is a sponsor on the legislation, House Bills 4255 and 4256, said in a statement last week that the package, which raised concerns with some over increasing incarceration, that it’s time for Michigan to get serious about getting drugs off the streets.
“Fentanyl has destroyed families, overwhelmed first responders, and turned every corner of our state into a potential crime scene,” Lightner said in the statement. “With this legislation, we are putting traffickers on notice: If you push this poison in Michigan, you will face serious time — no deals, no loopholes, no leniency.”

(Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)Two bills originally designed to protect Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen from losing office if he’s suspended for disciplinary conduct failed to pass the Legislature, one in the House and one in the Senate.
Knudsen is facing discipline for statements he and lawyers under his supervision made that disparaged the court and for defying a court order in a legal standoff in 2021.
House Bill 856 and Senate Bill 49, in its initial draft, offered different ways to shield the attorney general from a proposed punishment some viewed as unfair.
Lawyers since have indicated the attorney general may not need protection, but a decision on discipline is pending with the Montana Supreme Court, and Republicans in the Montana Legislature have been critical of the judicial branch.
Sen. Wendy McKamey, R-Great Falls, carried one of the bills, HB 856, in the Senate, and she said Friday she was disappointed fellow Republican senators didn’t lend enough support for it.
“They did not use the tools at their disposal to protect their Republican attorney general,” McKamey said.
McKamey also said she suspected some of the opposition might have been payback from Republican leadership in the Senate — an allegation the president and majority leader disputed.
Republicans in the Senate were split this session, and McKamey is among a group who has at times bucked leadership.
“It certainly appears to be some sort of retribution,” McKamey said.
One day earlier, Senate President Matt Regier, R-Kalispell, said he had opposed the bill because he felt uncertain about its impact, and Friday, he responded to the allegation of possible retribution.
“That’s absolutely false. Sen. McKamey has no influence on my vote either way,” Regier said.
In 2023, the Office for Disciplinary conduct alleged Knudsen broke rules of professional conduct for lawyers in connection with the standoff. The office oversees discipline against members of the bar.
The Montana Supreme Court is considering a unanimous recommendation from the Commission on Practice that Knudsen be suspended for 90 days for multiple violations of rules.
HB 856 and SB 49 presented different methods to protect the attorney general from disciplinary consequences.
HB 856 would have ensured Knudsen wouldn’t be at risk of losing office if he faces the full recommended suspension of 90 days.
Montana law states that an office becomes vacant if an incumbent generally fails to discharge their duties for three consecutive months, and HB 856 would have extended the period to four months.
In committee, sponsor and Majority Leader Steve Fitzpatrick, R-Great Falls, said he thought the idea that Knudsen could get thrown out of office if he ended up suspended for 90 days was unfair, so he proposed HB 856.
Fitzpatrick said the people of Montana had just elected Knudsen, and he had won by a large margin. Knudsen, a Republican incumbent, took 60% of the vote in November 2024.
“It didn’t seem right to me that a disciplinary official would be able to basically override the will of the people,” Fitzpatrick said.
Since then, Fitzpatrick learned that even if the Supreme Court imposes a penalty of 90 days, it may not translate into a loss of office.
At a hearing in March before the Montana Supreme Court, lawyers for Knudsen and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel agreed such a penalty doesn’t mean he needs to lose his elected office.
For example, the 90 days, if imposed, don’t need to run consecutively, or they can be counted inside of a three-month period.
Knudsen’s team made other arguments as well, including that the Montana Constitution allows for the removal of a judge, but not an officer of another branch.
In the legislative committee hearing, Fitzpatrick said he didn’t know if the bill would have any impact on the attorney general’s situation, but he viewed four months as more appropriate than three months regardless.
The bill made it through the House, and the second to last week of the session, it passed a significant vote in the Senate, 28-22, without debate.
However, three days later, it failed on a final 22-27 vote.
Some Republicans who have been critical of the courts voted against it on second and third reading, and some changed their votes from yes to no.
Thursday, Fitzpatrick described the result as “confusing.”
McKamey said Fitzpatrick asked her to carry the bill in the Senate, and she tried her best with it.
She said the Knudsen family is clearly important to Republican leadership, and she described the lack of support for the bill as “short sighted.”
Austin Knudsen is the attorney general, and his mother, Rhonda Knudsen, is a former Republican legislator who served as an advisor to Regier during the session.
Regier and Majority Leader Tom McGillvray, R-Billings, were among the senators who voted against it, both consistently, and Regier said he wasn’t certain the bill was even relevant by the time it ended up on the floor.
McGillvray said he didn’t find it to be a significant bill, proposing a shift from three months to four, he found the speech McKamey made on the floor “pretty weak,” and he cast his vote accordingly.
“I don’t speak for how other people vote, but I don’t do retribution,” McGillvray said.
McGillvray also said if the Montana Supreme Court wanted to impose a penalty that sought to push Knudsen out of office with a suspension, it could simply extend the penalty to five months if the legislature changed the duration to four.
On the floor, McKamey had said the bill initially came about because of news reports that said Knudsen might lose his office if he was suspended for 90 days, but she said supporters of the bill later learned that might not be the case, and the law might not apply.
“Nonetheless, four months is a more appropriate timeframe than three months and provides approximately 120 days before a person loses a job that they were elected to do,” McKamey said on the floor.
Senate Bill 49 failed earlier in the House.
Sponsored by Sen. Barry Usher, R-Billings, SB 49 would have granted immunity from discipline to lawyers who are also elected as Constitutional officers, such as the attorney general or governor.
An original draft protected only the attorney general.
A subsequent amendment, supported by Usher, moved the implementation date so it was not retroactive, a provision described as a “get out of jail free card” for the AG.
Usher was among the legislators who initially supported HB 856 in the Senate, but subsequently opposed it. He could not be reached for comment Friday.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Capitol_Night-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-03 13:09:15.909140

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota lawmakers set state funding for public broadcasting at $400,000 early Saturday, providing money for tower improvements after threatening to cut off Prairie Public funding completely earlier in the session. 
Gov. Kelly Armstrong had proposed $2.9 million in his preliminary budget for the 2025-27 biennium, with $1.7 million in one-time funding to assist with transmitter maintenance and replacement. 
A bill mandating that Prairie Public funding be eliminated advanced through the House but was defeated in the Senate. 
The Senate vote allowed lawmakers to restore funding in House Bill 1015. Some senators, however, advocated for cutting back on the Prairie Public appropriation. 
The bill was amended in the Senate to provide $850,000 for Prairie Public, but did not restore its $1.2 million base funding. A conference committee this week cut the funding to $400,000 for infrastructure. 
John Harris, president and CEO of Prairie Public, testified in a hearing that Prairie Public would be spending $4 million to $7 million in the next 18 months to upgrade facilities and buy transmitters. 
Prairie Public leaders testified that the organization could survive without state funding, but that it will mean less local programming. Other funding sources for Prairie Public include charitable gambling, endowment funds and investments.

(City of New Orleans livestream)NEW ORLEANS – When Congress passed the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) in March 2021, it allocated $350 billion in assistance to state and local governments – providing the largest infusion of cash to local governments since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. For New Orleans, that money represented a desperately needed lifeline.
The city had been hit particularly hard by COVID-19. It was an early hotspot for the virus. And Black residents, who comprise about 60% of the city’s population, were disproportionately impacted, accounting for more than 75% of COVID deaths in the first few months of the pandemic. As New Orleans went into lockdown, the city watched its economy grind to a halt. Festivals were canceled. Hotels emptied out. Restaurants closed their dining rooms. Thousands were laid off.
For the city government, this represented a multi-pronged disaster: With tourism all but halted, the city was receiving dramatically less from sales taxes than usual, straining its finances. At the same time, the needs of its citizenry were at an all-time high. The city took out a certificate of indebtedness, which basically provided a $100 million line of credit, and partially furloughed its entire workforce.
But shortly after Congress passed ARPA, city leadership expressed cautious optimism.
“This is by no means a silver bullet or a panacea, but this funding will literally buy us time,” Mayor LaToya Cantrell said in a March 2021 press release.

New Orleans would go on to receive nearly $388 million in ARPA funds – among the largest allocations in the country for a city of its size. The money was directly given to local governments and came with few strings attached. The recipient governments had to obligate all of the funding by the end of 2024 and spend it by the end of 2026.
The Cantrell administration would use that money not only to plug substantial holes in the city’s revenues and build up its financial reserves, but also to fund a variety of initiatives across the city – from public safety to health to economic mobility.
Cantrell will leave City Hall next year after nearly eight years as mayor. And a big part of her legacy will be about how she handled the pandemic. Not just the lockdown months, the mask mandates and the various phases of reopening, but the huge opportunity that this federal windfall represented for the city, and whether she took it.
“ARPA funds were absolutely transformational for New Orleans,” a spokesperson for the city of New Orleans said in an email, pointing to a slew of programs the city funded, from catch basin cleaning to workforce development to technological upgrades.
But not everyone agrees.
Nellie Catzen is the executive director of the Committee for a Better New Orleans, a nonprofit focused on civic engagement, especially regarding the city’s budget. She said that federal pandemic aid could have been transformational for New Orleans in meaningfully addressing inequities across the city, but city leadership decided to go another way.
“For me, the overarching legacy is one of missed opportunities,” Catzen said.
Helping city workers
About $187 million, or nearly half of the $388 million the city was allocated, went to “revenue replacement,” a purposely flexible spending category authorized in ARPA, which allowed local governments to shore up departments and services while tax revenues were down.
Dave Kamper at the Economic Policy Institute, a progressive think tank in Washington, D.C., said that for cities of New Orleans’ size, spending approximately half of ARPA money on revenue replacement is fairly typical.
“One of the great successes of ARPA is that they just let the local authorities make the decisions that made the most sense to them,” Kamper told Verite News.
Kamper noted that money used for revenue replacement was probably most impactful in its ability to maintain or even build the public sector workforce.
New Orleans City Councilman Joe Giarrusso, who chairs the council’s budget committee, agrees that revenue replacement played a key role in helping city workers.
Under the furloughs, enacted in late 2020, most city employees were being sent home without pay for one day per pay period. Some of them — political appointees often in managerial roles — were made to work through their unpaid furlough days.
“So, we were dealing with two issues: the tangible one of [city employees] making less money and then morale issues on top of that – because [employees] are being asked to work under psychological pressure, making less money and being in the pandemic, and being asked to serve the public while doing all of those things,” Giarrusso said.

The city used $32 million in ARPA money to unfurlough workers and pay them back for their lost wages, according to a 2022 report by the Bureau of Governmental Research. The money also allowed the city to raise the wages for city workers.
But Catzen said that far too much of that money went to the New Orleans Police Department, which, as it turned out, didn’t need it.
“I think the city of New Orleans, like many municipalities, leaned too hard on revenue replacement, specifically revenue replacement for the police department,” Catzen said.
In 2021, more ARPA dollars flowed to the New Orleans Police Department than any other city department, BGR found. The money allowed the city to increase the NOPD budget by $17 million, to $181 million from $164 million. The following year, $22 million in ARPA funds initially brought the department’s budget above $200 million, though it was later adjusted to about $170 million.
But the department, which had been bleeding employees and was at its lowest officer count in decades, ended up spending far less both years: $155 million in 2021 and $161 million in 2022, according to city budget reports.
Public safety
Catzen noted that the police department didn’t only receive federal money through revenue replacement. It also received tens of millions more for things like officer recruitment and police cars, all of which fell into the “public safety” ARPA expenditure category.
“We did not then – and I’m not even sure that we do now – have the officers hired to drive these vehicles,” Catzen said.
In fact, public safety was the city’s second most-funded category of ARPA expenditures — behind only revenue replacement — at  $95.29 million, or about a quarter of the city’s ARPA money. This was largely on account of some capital-intensive initiatives, including nearly $30 million toward the modernization of technology in the criminal justice system.
“The Sheriff’s Office was literally running their programs on MS-DOS,” Giarrusso said, referencing an operating system released in the early 1980s. “I think somebody said it was the same programming that gave us Donkey Kong.”
Giarrusso also noted that the city allocated about $26 million in ARPA funds for public safety vehicles, which paid not only for the new police cars, but also new ambulances.
“So many times, people focus on NOPD, but EMS really got a bunch of money for ambulances, like their fleet was in need of upgrading,” Giarrusso said.
The Mayor’s Office defended the decision to dedicate so much money to public safety.
“These investments are vital to ensuring that public employees can efficiently and effectively do their jobs,” a city spokesperson said. “Upgraded equipment, facilities, and vehicles directly impact their ability to respond quickly, operate safely, and serve the community, leading to better outcomes for residents and safer working conditions for frontline workers.”
Kamper, who has studied how different cities and states have spent ARPA money, said that, in his opinion, cities may have chosen to direct their money towards public safety and policing because that is where they are used to directing money.
“To spend it on public safety strikes me as a small-c conservative measure that probably doesn’t have as much of a return as getting money in the pockets of working families through housing help or premium pay or through things like setting up community grocery stores or assisting tenants or building housing,” Kamper said.
Addressing inequities
Getting money into working families’ pockets is precisely what a group of local nonprofits asked the city to do in April 2023.
At the time, the city had yet to allocate about $55 million in ARPA money. It was also sitting on about $300 million in surplus funds.
So three nonprofit groups — the Vera Institute of Justice, the Louisiana Fair Housing Action Center and the New Orleans Workers’ Center for Racial Justice — came to the council with a plan: They wanted the city to spend $147 million to build thousands of units of affordable housing, expand youth programming and offer free public transit, among other items.
“This was an opportunity cities could use to be inventive and transformative, to do things that they always had on their to-do list and never had the resources to do,” Kamper said. “I think upgrading vehicles and building new law enforcement facilities isn’t particularly inventive.”
Kamper pointed to a handful of examples elsewhere that he thought were particularly inventive uses of ARPA money. He said that Charleston, West Virginia, opened a community-run grocery store to address food insecurity. A county in Massachusetts used the federal money to make bus transit free, doubling ridership and cutting complaints in half. Austin, Texas, spent more than $100 million of its ARPA funding addressing homelessness and housing.

In New Orleans, the City Council did not adopt the groups’ $147 million plan.
However, the city did fund a number of equity-minded projects across the city, providing funding for community solar panels and batteries, guaranteed income pilot projects, free transit for youth, and medical debt relief, among other projects. City leaders also dedicated at least $5 million to reducing homelessness in the city, providing funding to close encampments, support low-barrier shelters and rapidly re-house individuals.
And the City Council made substantial investments in affordable housing. The council created a $30 million housing trust fund to help provide gap financing for affordable and workforce housing developments, using $8 million of ARPA money. Voters later approved an amendment to the city charter that made the housing trust fund permanent, this time using money from the general fund, not ARPA.
Despite the many wins, which Catzen happily acknowledges, she still thinks that the city didn’t do enough to involve residents in decision-making and address their fundamental needs.
“We had an opportunity to really flip that script and say in response to the major desperation that Black and brown people and working people were facing that we are going to invest in equity and choose to put our money towards lessening that disparity,” Catzen said. “They had the mandate in the federal policy to do that, and they had the data behind that. And the fact that they really didn’t do that meaningfully is a real missed opportunity.”
But Giarrusso added that everyone wanted a piece of the ARPA pie, and the City Council worked hard to include many different projects in its annual budget. He said that the council was hearing from people on all sides who had big ideas for the money, from poverty reduction to housing to infrastructure to even support for religious communities.
“[ARPA] felt like the Stanley Cup in that we had this money and it passed from stakeholder to stakeholder, because everybody had an interest in it,” Giarrusso said.
The legacy of ARPA
The impact ARPA had on New Orleans might be a little boring, Giarrusso admits, but it was still a boon for the city: Not only did the city avoid financial catastrophe, but it also managed to build up its financial reserves and bonding capacity.
“My view is that the city is as financially healthy as it’s ever been,” Giarrusso said, “which then for the next administration gives them way more runway to do bigger, more visionary capital project things and even nuts-and-bolts projects that just need to be done.”
But Rebecca Mowbray, president of the Bureau of Governmental Research, cautioned that some of the ARPA spending may have given residents the wrong impression about the state of the city’s finances. While she acknowledged that the city did avoid financial catastrophe, she said that it also used ARPA money to fund things it should’ve already been funding, like catch basin cleaning. And by funding so many new initiatives, the city may have created more financial obligations in the future, Mowbray cautions.
“It’s interesting that this program, which was supposed to give money out to local jurisdictions to help them stay liquid and insulate governments and residents from some of the risks of the pandemic, could actually end up creating some financial risk if we’re on the hook for new programs even if the city doesn’t have the money on a recurring basis,” Mowbray said.
But as New Orleans prepares for a number of challenges, including the potential withdrawal of federal funding by the Trump administration and threats of further attacks by the state government, Catzen said she hopes residents still feel empowered to advocate for how they want the city to spend the money it does have.
“This period of austerity means that what we do with our money that we raise here – and that we can do whatever we want with – will be all the more important,” Catzen said. “And so it is within the jurisdiction of the city and within their responsibility to spend the money that we have to meet the needs of the people.”

Rain is pelting the cherry orchards at Wunsch Farms on the Old Mission Peninsula.
Michal Peterson is wearing a full suit of rain gear. On the back of a flatbed truck are bee hives, stacked two or three high and dripping wet in the downpour. Peterson uses a Hummerbee forklift — “pretty much a forklift on steroids” — to offload them and drop them off around the rows of budding cherry trees.
He hands me a veil so I don’t get stung.

Peterson works for Hilbert’s Honey, Co., distributing beehives on orchards across northern Michigan, work he’s been doing for 18 years.
“The wild honeybees aren’t really around much. You got some butterflies, the monarchs and the bumble bees, but it’s just another extra pollination to insure the farmer,” he said.
Pollination is an essential part of many farming operations. That’s because pollinators — from bees to bugs to birds — are crucial for plant growth and reproduction.
Cherry trees, for example, need pollination in order to develop: More pollination means more fruit.
And the honeybees Peterson is setting up in northern Michigan are actually from Florida.
Commercial honeybees are considered livestock by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and shipping colonies to different crops around the country is a common practice. For instance, hundreds of thousands of colonies were sent to California’s almond orchards in 2017.
But the process comes with complications and concerns.
European honeybees are not native to North America, and can disrupt ecosystems and out-compete native species for resources. Non-native bees face a number of threats as well: pesticides, diseases and parasites, and weather. Some years have seen high mortality rates, including this year, when some commercial operations reported high losses.
Peterson said they coordinate with those running the farm to reduce their bees’ exposure to pesticides.
“He tells me when he’s done spraying, and I can put the bees in,” said Peterson. “Right now, they’re probably going to spray after it stops raining, for fungicide or whatever. That don’t really hurt the bees. It’s the poisons that they put out.”

Tens of thousands of bees teem inside one of the hives. Hilbert’s hives usually have between 30,000 and 100,000 bees. They generally try to place the hives in the orchards when it’s cool out — early morning or late evening — so the bees are less active. On a chilly, rainy day that’s less of a concern.
The cherry trees aren’t yet in bloom.
“By next week, you’ll start seeing them kind of popcorn out of their shell and have white buds coming out,” Peterson said. “So this is about the right time, as you can see, the rain don’t stop me. [The bees] have to go in a certain time so they can get acclimated to their surroundings.”
When Peterson began, he was in between jobs, and knew he wanted to work outside. His brother-in-law, a fifth generation beekeeper, reached out to ask him for help.
“I learned from the best, I feel,” he said.
Peterson clearly loves his job. “The view is amazing,” he said, though we couldn’t see much in the downpour.
“While I’m putting in bees, it’s really beautiful out here,” he said. “I always get excited when I have to put bees in the cherries.”

Hilbert’s Honey is based in Traverse City and LaBelle, Florida, and Peterson is trying to get back down to Florida to make a second trip — his second this season.
He and his family rear queen bees in Florida and help pollinate watermelon crops there as well.
“I have a list of pollinations to do, and I’m almost done with this one,” he said. “We do pollination up [US-31] and all the way up north of Northport. We try to stay local, try to help the local farmers. We also do almond pollination in the wintertime in California,” he said.
“The bees travel more than we do.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bee-hive-1024x743.jpg,,,2025-05-03 12:10:05.167085

Missouri may become the first state with an income tax to exempt capital gains, but several states have considered tax cut proposals that would benefit the wealthy during this year’s legislative sessions. (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent)Missouri Republicans may take their tax-cutting efforts to new heights this year as lawmakers consider exempting profits from the sale of stocks, bonds and real estate from state income taxes.
Part of a broader push to eliminate the state income tax altogether, legislation making its way through the Capitol would provide an unprecedented benefit to the wealthy by excluding capital gains, the long-term earnings from the sale of assets. If approved, tax experts say, the legislation would mark the first time a state with an income tax has eliminated capital gains tax.
The Republican sponsors say the move would make the state more attractive for businesses and families.
“This bill is intended to energize Missouri’s economy,” Republican Speaker Pro Tem Chad Perkins said upon introducing the measure.
But state Democrats — and even some of their GOP colleagues — have criticized the measure as being overly favorable to the wealthy. Most states’ tax systems already put a higher tax burden on lower-income households. That trend only accelerated in this year’s legislative sessions, worrying advocates who want to see the rich pay a larger share.
“It is so egregious in just how grossly concentrated the benefits of the [Missouri] proposal would go to the richest people in the state and shift the state’s tax system to really privilege the owners of wealth over people who are earning a regular paycheck,” said David Cooper, an analyst at the left-leaning think tank Economic Policy Institute.
The institute advocates for progressive state taxes — those that put the proportionately largest tax burdens on the highest earners. While Cooper advises against eliminating state income taxes, he said the Missouri move would be more harmful than eliminating the income tax outright.
“If you’re wiping away the income tax altogether, there’s at least some tax benefit going to lower-earning folks who are still paying income taxes,” he said. “If you’re just eliminating capital gains income taxes, you are just giving away money to the wealthiest people in the state, period.”
Some Democratic-led states, including Maryland and Washington, have moved to increase taxes on the wealthy this year. But several states — including Kansas, Kentucky and Mississippi — have made more regressive tax changes.
Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, noted that states still prioritize progressive spending through social service programs aiding the most vulnerable residents.
He said states compete against each other for business and residents in much more immediate ways than the federal government competes against other nations.
“So states are very focused on the competitive advantages associated with a pro-growth tax regime,” he said, “and that has led to less of an emphasis in many states on achieving progressivity through the tax code.”
 
‘Generational change’ to taxes
While several states have enacted high-profile tax cuts this year, the momentum is actually slowing, Walczak said.
With booming economies and an influx of federal cash in recent years, conservative and liberal states alike passed significant tax cuts. Of the 43 states that have some sort of income tax, 28 have made rate reductions since 2021, Walczak said.
“In many states, lawmakers simply accomplished much of what they had set out to do,” he said.
Economic uncertainty and the prospect of reduced federal aid also have made many lawmakers more cautious this legislative season, he said.
But lawmakers in several states — including Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia — have continued their march to eliminate state income taxes.
“Taxing people’s wages is bad because it undermines liberty,” Oklahoma state Sen. Dusty Deevers, a Republican, said this month in support of a proposed income tax cut, the Oklahoma Voice reported. “It undermines people’s freedoms. If government controls income, then it controls your life.”
This session, Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear signed a bill cutting the state income tax rate from 4% to 3.5%. Republican lawmakers have been slashing rates for years with the ultimate aim of eliminating the income tax altogether, despite concerns that more reliance on sales tax would disproportionately burden the poor. To partially offset the income tax reduction, the legislature expanded sales taxes to more services in 2018.
And Republican lawmakers in Kansas overrode a veto from Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly to move away from the state’s graduated income tax toward a flat tax of 4% that will mostly benefit the highest earners.
Last month, Mississippi Republican Gov. Tate Reeves signed legislation granting another cut in the state income tax. Officials there aim to phase out the income tax altogether over the coming years with gradual rate reductions, which Reeves characterized as “a generational change” for the state.
The Mississippi law also reduces the sales tax on groceries and increases the gas tax. Though the governor is already celebrating the end of state income tax, the law provides for incremental reductions in the coming years only if the state hits certain revenue targets.
Republican state Rep. Trey Lamar, a legislative sponsor, said income taxes disincentivize work — a particular problem for the state with the nation’s lowest workforce participation rate.
“A tax on work is a tax on productivity,” he said.
The left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy says the law will make the state’s tax system more inequitable. Its analysis found that when fully implemented, the top 1% of households, who have average annual incomes of $1.4 million, will receive an average cut of $41,420, or roughly 3% of their annual income. But the bottom 20% of earners, who have average annual incomes of $13,400, would realize a tax cut of just $42 per year.
Lamar noted the legislation did not increase sales taxes across the board. With average sales tax burdens already lower than neighboring states like Alabama, he said the income tax elimination will only help Mississippi workers.
“We need more people working,” he said. “So if helping the working man is somehow seen as regressive, then I’d have to say I don’t fully understand that.”
Walczak, of the Tax Foundation, said the state can afford the initial rate reduction. But it’s unclear whether state revenues will hit the targets needed — and whether lawmakers will reassess the aim of eliminating income taxes.
As one of the nation’s poorest states, Mississippi is heavily reliant on federal funding and would be particularly vulnerable to an economic downturn.
“There’s not a guarantee that the state could afford that in the future, and Mississippi does not have a large budget to begin with, so that would be harder than in most other states if the economy slid,” he said. “It does require a willingness on lawmakers’ parts to be honest with themselves if the economy changes and decide whether a pause might be necessary.”
 
An uneven tax burden
Economic uncertainty and slowing revenues have put many states into budget holes this year, forcing lawmakers to consider spending cuts or tax increases.
To close budget gaps, some conservative and liberal states have considered new or higher taxes on marijuana, tobacco and soda.
But some liberal-led states are looking to taxes more focused on the wealthy. In Rhode Island, Democratic Gov. Daniel McKee has proposed a 10% tax on digital advertising revenue.
In Washington state, lawmakers approved raising capital gains taxes and business taxes to close a looming deficit, though it’s unclear whether Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson, who has voiced skepticism, will sign off on those measures.
Maryland lawmakers, facing a $3 billion deficit, recently approved $1.6 billion in new taxes and fees. That includes two new high-income tax brackets and a new 3% sales tax on information technology and data services.
Moves like those that ask more of the wealthy could make some state tax systems more progressive, said Aidan Davis, the state policy director at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. But most state tax proposals approved this year have primarily benefited the highest earners.
That’s particularly concerning because most state systems already favor the wealthy. In 41 states, the top 1% of earners pay a lower effective tax rate than any other group, according to an institute study.
In Missouri, the fate of the first-of-its-kind capital gains tax elimination remains up in the air.
Though versions of the proposal have passed both chambers, there are differences between the Senate and House legislation. That means the bill could go back to conference committee for further negotiation or go on to Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe, who has identified capital gains among his tax cut priorities this year.
Missouri’s Department of Revenue estimated the exemption could cost $111 million per year. But an Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy analysis of IRS data projects the change could cost $600 million or more.
If approved, the top 5% of Missouri households — those making more than $273,000 per year — will receive more than 80% of the benefit from capital gains exemption, Davis said.
“Doing so would let wealthy people collect tax-free passive income while you’re continuing to tax middle class workers and people with savings,” Davis said. “It’s just a really extreme proposal.”

(Photo by Kreg Leymaster/Agricultural Research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture)It’s December 20th. And this story took place when my husband and I lived in town, but wanted to experiment with farming. So, we partnered with Joe and Lonna, a farming couple that lived just outside of Ames, Iowa at Onion Creek Farm. We decided to go all in and raise a handful of sheep together.
You know, Joe and Lonna have a history of putting up with crazy young people who want to experiment with different farming ideas. So, we thought, let’s do this.
And we decided to rent a ram, like we had done a couple winters in the past. We didn’t keep a ram year-round to breed our ladies. We just wanted to rent one for a few weeks every December, so we’d end up with lambs the next spring.
Joe is the DIY type of dude. He built his house with his own two hands. Joe and Lonna are vegetable farmers by trade, but they were really into the idea of letting livestock graze their veggie fields at certain times of the year to get that fertility, build up the soil, et cetera. It was a great partnership. It had gone smoothly for several years.
Well, this year, Joe and I took a livestock trailer, hauled it down to another farmer’s place to pick up this ram that we were renting. And, you know, hauling a livestock trailer is a whole feat in itself. And, honestly, the day had gone super smoothly. We were really proud of ourselves.
We dropped off some sheep at another farm on the way, and here we are picking up this ram to take back to Joe and Lana’s farm. Great, wonderful. It all went super smoothly.
By the time we got back, it was almost dark. And we backed the trailer up into the fenced-in pasture. The ladies are there waiting for their fellow. And we’re just so, so happy the day has gone really well.
We get out of the truck. As we open the back door to the trailer, this ram — whom I’m convinced has springs built into its hoofs — this ram soars over the fence that we have set up, disregarding the females waiting there to be bred.
No, it doesn’t matter. This ram soars over this fence like a reindeer pulling Santa’s sleigh.
It’s dusk. And luckily, the ram was white because we could see the white speck running into the woods, just getting further and further away from us. So, of course, I take a bucket of grain, but then again, these are grass-fed animals. They’ve never been trained to pellets or grain of any sort, but I do what I can.
I take a bucket of grain into the woods. I try to call this animal. I’m running through the woods at night. There’s no way. I cannot find this animal at all, so I decide I’ll be back first thing in the morning, crack of dawn.
And let’s hope that the ram is just standing at the fence line, smells the ladies ready to get back in, or better yet, has already jumped back in with the ladies. That’ll probably happen. I’ll come back in the morning.

After a sleepless night I show up, crack of dawn. There’s no ram in the pasture. There is no ram to be seen. This is when we realize, okay, this is going to be a little bit more serious of a situation than your average.
Like I said, this is right before Christmas. For the next six days, we are just on edge with trying to track this ram down. We do everything someone does when an animal escapes.
You call all the neighbors. You call the animal control of the county we were in and the next county over. We don’t know how far this thing’s going to get. We check Ames Facebook group incessantly to see if anyone’s had a ram sighting.
You know, we call our friends. We’re going to call the sheriff. We’ve got to report this animal so we can get this thing back. We spend our days searching through cornfields and forests around the farm, looking for this animal to see if we can find any sort of clues.
And then by the time night falls, we decide, all right, we can’t really look much more.
Let’s retire for the night, see what happens tomorrow. Maybe we’ll get a call.
Christmas carols don’t ease missing-sheep anxiety
A couple days before Christmas, we get invited to go over to sing Christmas carols in front of a fireplace at a friend’s house. And we thought, you know what, let’s get our minds off of this. This will be really nice to just go sing some Christmas songs.
So we get there. We’re drinking hot cocoa. We’re doing the things. We’re trying to forget about the circumstance. And we’re singing these songs and I realized that there’s like multiple Christmas carols that have the lyrics, shepherds watching o’er their flocks.
And I am like, okay, this isn’t helping and I need to leave. This is not fun for me anymore. So that didn’t work out.
We also realized family Christmas is canceled. Like we can’t get out town now. We have to stay. Can’t visit the family because we got this ram on the loose, and we don’t even own the ram, right? If we owned it, different story, I wouldn’t care as much, but we’re borrowing the ram.
Okay, so then we get a call. We get a call on December 23rd, a couple days before Christmas, that the ram has been spotted on a golf course north of town. Hallelujah, we drive straight to the golf course. Wonderful.
Ram plays through
And it’s great that this ram’s on the golf course. There’s still some grass to graze.
All the ponds are aerated, so the ram has water to drink. And I’m like, you know, it could live its whole life there, I guess.
We’re going to figure out how to get it. And so, of course, what do we do?
We call our friends. We get people to help us. We go get our mobile netting, like all of our rolls of net fencing. We’re just going to fence this ram and get it into the trailer and that’ll be it.
All right. We start to execute this plan and we realize that this ram has like the largest flight zone of any livestock I’ve ever worked with in my life. Usually a flight zone should be, oh, let’s say, 10 to 20 feet. This thing’s like 300 feet. And it is so skittish.
And there’s no way. There’s no way with a wall of human people. Are we going to get this ram? There’s no way with putting fencing around this animal.
The golfers on the golf course, on the other hand, they all think this is hilarious. They’re like, this is a new challenge for us. This is hilarious. We get to golf with the sheep and they’re laughing and they’re like, oh, are you the owners of the sheep?
And you know, I was not feeling the holiday spirit like these people were, but I’m glad it could provide some entertainment.
Then this is really when the spiral and the mad madness begins.
Lasso’s a no-go
I call the ISU rodeo Club. Iowa State University Rodeo Club.
Of course, they’re on Christmas break, okay? No one’s there to help lassoing.

Then I we have a friend who says, you know what, my dad grew up on a ranch in Colorado. He is a lasso master.
He dusted off his old trusty lasso and he came out to the field and we’re like, okay, this is it, this is it.
He said, “Let me go by myself. Let me try this.”
He’s very calm.
I am not calm at this moment.
So I stay in the parking lot.
He walks out with his lasso and he comes back very quickly after and says, “There’s no way I’m getting close enough to lasso this ram.
Okay, so that’s out.
Then I’m making a call to the sheriff, asking the sheriff if he can tranquilize this animal.
Sheriff tells me, sorry, ma’am, but if the ram is not deemed a danger to society, we cannot tranquilize within city limits.
Okay. So then the tranquilizer gun is that the top of my Christmas list? Didn’t expect that, okay? And they’re expensive. I’m looking into what I need to do to buy this tranquilizer gun.
Okay. So none of that worked.
Here we are Christmas Day. We do our thing in the morning. We celebrate Christmas, still don’t have this ram.
We get through the holiday and then the breakthrough happened, December 26th.
Ram busts into church
We get a call that the ram has now been spotted at the mega church across the street from the golf course.
We get the call and so does Joe, the farmer, who lives closer to the church.
We’re both on our way to the church.
Joe, somewhat unfortunately, gets there before us because we had just gone to the airport to pick up a friend who’s visiting us. We’re getting there as quick as we can.
And the janitor at this church day after Christmas is cleaning up. They had a bunch of people there the night before.
This is a huge church, so there’s these massive windows and massive glass doors.
And the janitor hears boom, boom, boom. And he thinks someone’s breaking into the church. I got to go see what’s going on. But it’s like morning time, daylight. He looks out the window and there’s a ram ramming its reflection in the window, probably about to bust through this window.
Turns out this holy lamb of God had been across the street at the golf course. Full-sized window there. He’d walked through a glass door there, completely shattered it already.
And this is the true Christmas miracle.
The janitor is also a farmer and somehow he goes outside and manages to hog tie the ram up. This ram is tied with its hoofs with some twine and rope, and it is now ready for pickup.
Joe, the farmer, gets there before we do, like I said, and he loads the ram up in the back of his truck and goes back to the farm.
Okay.
Visiting pal pukes
We are driving as fast as we can back from this airport with this friend. It is important to mention who the friend is. The friend is a photographer from LA. Artsy type. He is an Iowa boy, but he doesn’t spend much time on farms anymore. So, you know, he’s not used to chasing a ram on a farm.
We go directly from the airport to the farm as we’re speeding and bumping down the gravel road. We start to see Joe standing there next to a fence, and then we see the ram scaling the fence and starting to fly over it, and escape again.
And this time he’s running off towards the same woods with a rope dangling from the back of his hoof, and that’s when my husband just throws the car in park, and runs out sprinting.
I’ve never seen this guy run this fast, sprinting as fast as he can to capture by hand this ram, so he doesn’t escape again after he’s been on the loose for six days.
And then Rob, the photographer, decides to help, what else can he do? He starts sprinting. And okay, luckily, there was a loose piece of old barbed wire and the ram got caught up in it.
And at that moment, my husband Omar was able to just manhandle the ram, just lay flat his whole body weight on the animal, and then grab the rope and start tying him up again.
And we look back, Rob, the photographer, he’s vomiting. He’s puking all over the field because he didn’t expect this. I’m just standing there like I can’t quite see what’s happening in the woods with the ram and Omar.
I don’t know what to do.
Anyway, Omar emerges from the woods, carrying a ram who is squirming and trying to get away.
I will tell you that the heroes of this story are Omar and the janitor.
I have no idea what happened between the pick up at the mega church and the escape back at the farm. That doesn’t matter anymore. These details don’t matter. What matters is that we obviously realized that we’re not going to use this ram for breeding.
We’re not going to spread those genetics on.
Then we put that ram immediately in the back of the truck and we drove it back to its home farm. We returned that ram never to see it again.
And I do just want to say that, you know, it’s a true Christmas miracle that we got that ram back in one piece.
We did not have to sacrifice its life during this process.
And I also want to thank Joe and Lonna for allowing us to bring this madness to their farm.
And I want to thank all farmers who are willing to put up with a little bit of madness from young beginning farmers.

John Hughes, R-Sioux Falls, speaks with another lawmaker on the House floor during the Governor's Budget Address on Dec. 3, 2024. (Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota citizens have had the right to petition issues on to the ballot since 1898. Some legislators would like to put an end to that. 
The prevailing wisdom in the Legislature seems to be that voters here are suffering from “ballot fatigue.” They claim voters are just sick and tired of all the initiated measures and constitutional amendments on the ballot. 
In reality, “ballot fatigue” is just a legislative code phrase for “let’s make it so tough to get an issue on the ballot that citizens will just give up.” That was the impetus behind House Joint Resolution 5003, a constitutional amendment that’s already on the ballot for 2026. 
The measure was sponsored by an irony-impaired Republican representative from Sioux Falls, John Hughes. Hughes didn’t think it was at all odd to say that voters were “fatigued” by the seven 2024 ballot issues, all the while sponsoring his own constitutional amendment for the 2026 election. 
Lawmaker assertions about voter fatigue don’t stop them from sending four measures to the ballot

Hughes’ ballot measure calls for constitutional ballot issues to need 60% of the vote to be enacted. Currently those measures have to get just more than 50% to become part of the constitution. (There’s more irony to go around. Hughes placed his 60% amendment on the ballot in chambers where all he needed to do was convince just more than half of his colleagues it was a good idea. In 2026, if the 60% threshold is approved by voters, it will need just more than 50% of the votes cast.)
Lawmakers had quite a time with ballot issues during the 2025 legislative session. They may be suffering from their own version of ballot fatigue as they considered 11 ballot issues, ultimately placing four of them on the 2026 ballot. There’s another legislative session before the next election. That’s another chance for lawmakers to endorse even more ballot measures. 
A check of the Secretary of State’s website shows there are already six other ballot issues waiting in the wings for the 2026 ballot. Their backers will try to get them on the ballot the old-fashioned way: by collecting the signatures of registered voters. It takes 17,508 signatures to get an initiated measure on the ballot and 35,017 signatures before voters can consider a constitutional amendment. 
There’s a stark disparity between the relative ease that lawmakers have if they want to get a measure on the ballot and the drudgery of collecting thousands of signatures for citizen-led ballot efforts. 
If voters are suffering from ballot fatigue, perhaps lawmakers are suffering from “ballot envy,” an anguish rooted in the realization that there are people in the state with far more will and determination than they have when it comes to getting an issue before the voters. 
When they talk about ballot fatigue, lawmakers would have you believe that they want to protect voters from the chore of making a few extra choices on Election Day. The real definition of ballot fatigue is that lawmakers are tired of seeing issues appear and reappear on the ballot that don’t conform to their worldview. Given the current Republican super-majorities in both chambers, there’s no other way than through a ballot initiative for citizens to get issues like abortion and marijuana legalization in front of voters. 
For Republicans, it’s not the voting that’s tiring but the effort it takes every two years to fight off ideas that they find disagreeable. They point to the cavalcade of political commercials as a bad thing rather than celebrating the notion that political messages are just our free speech rights in action.
Of course ballot fatigue is a play on words, substituting the word ballot for battle. But South Dakotans are in a real battle to keep their access to the ballot. It’s a battle in which we can’t afford to get fatigued.

Liz Cheney, speaking at an Anchorage event on Thursday, had harsh words for much of her Republican Party but praise for a rare GOP member who, like her, is willing to criticize President Donald Trump: Alaska’s senior U.S. senator.
“I can’t be here in Alaska and not mention the incredible courage of Sen. Lisa Murkowski,” Cheney said near the start of her event, held at a packed theater in the Alaska Center for the Performing Arts.
“You see it almost every day. There are very few Republicans who will be consistently counted on to do the right thing. And she’s one of a very small group,” Cheney said.
The former U.S. House member from Wyoming – and daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney – spoke at a lecture hosted by the University of Alaska Anchorage and Alaska World Affairs Council. She took questions from veteran journalist Elizabeth Arnold, who teaches at UAA.
Like Murkowski, Cheney voted to impeach Trump for his attempts to overturn the 2020 election and opposed him in other ways.
Unlike Murkowski, who was reelected in 2022 over a Trump-backed challenger, Cheney lost her seat in the GOP primary to a Trump loyalist, Harriet Hageman, who now represents Wyoming’s single House district.
That was after Cheney co-chaired the congressional committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, riot and Trump’s role in it, and after she had been stripped of her GOP leadership role by fellow House Republicans because of her opposition to Trump’s actions.
She is aghast that Trump, now back in the White House, has pardoned those rioters, including those who attacked police officers – and that Republicans in office have gone along with those pardons.

	“When you hear the Republicans, any Republicans, saying that they are the party that supports law enforcement, you know, please go back and look at the videos of Jan. 6,” Cheney said. Remind those Republicans that Trump watched the events unfold on television for three hours without trying to stop the riot, she said.
“He watched police officers get brutally beaten by people who were carrying his flag; they were doing it in his name … And then, when he came into office, he pardoned all of those people,” she said.
The Republican Party as a whole — with a few exceptions like Murkowski – has betrayed its convictions and even the U.S. Constitution to become “a personality cult” loyal only to Trump, Cheney said.
Today’s GOP is “something we haven’t seen in this country before,” she said. “The party has walked away from the Constitution,” said the former House member, who noted that she grew up as a Republican and cast her first vote for President Ronald Reagan.
Cheney spent much of her speech calling out House Speaker Mike Johnson and other Republican leaders of Congress who she said have enabled Trump’s attacks on the rule of law and other bad actions.
“The problem with Mike is that he’s fundamentally dishonest,” she said.
And they have enabled rank incompetence and corruption in the Trump administration, the most serious of which is Trump’s attack on the rule of law.
Voters should take action to counter the cult-like devotion that has given Trump and his administration ”carte blanche,” Cheney said.

(Photo by James Evans/University of Alaska Anchorage)
 

	“That’s why it’s crucially important that in 2026, the Republicans lose the majority in the House and the Senate,” she said.
She also called on the audience and public at large to continue protesting Trump administration actions, writing letters to the editor, contacting members of Congress and state legislators and even consider running for office to replace bad officials.
It was a message embraced by the event audience. Many of those attending Cheney’s address had walked over to the theater after attending a May Day anti-Trump protest held a few blocks away on downtown Anchorage’s Park Strip. Several times during the event, the audience erupted in applause and cheers.
Cheney herself has continued to be politically active since losing her House seat.
She started a political action committee and has been supporting candidates she believes will counter the Trump movement – most notably, former Vice President Kamala Harris, who wound up losing the 2024 presidential election. She wrote a book, titled “Oath and Honor,” that details the confrontations she had with fellow congressional Republicans over the efforts to overthrow the 2020 election results. She has also been teaching at the University of Virginia and traveling the country to speak at events like that held Thursday in Anchorage.
Returning to elective office remains a possibility, she said. “I don’t know if I will end up being a candidate again myself. But it’s certainly not something that I’m ruling out,” she said.
That statement was greeted with enthusiastic audience applause, and some follow-up back-and-forth quips to close the evening.
“Clearly, I should move here to Alaska,” Cheney said in response to the applause.
“We have ranked choice voting,” Arnold said.
“And you have one good senator,” Cheney replied.
“We have room for one more,” an audience member called out.

Some are held there for months as they wait for an open bed at the Montana State Hospital. (Photo by Katheryn Houghton/KFF Health News)POLSON — When someone accused of a crime in this small northwestern Montana town needs mental health care, chances are they’ll be locked in a basement jail cell the size of a walk-in closet.
Prisoners, some held in this isolation cell for months, have scratched initials and the phrase “love hurts” into the metal door’s brown paint. Their pacing has worn a path into the cement floor. Many are held in a sort of limbo, not convicted of a crime but not stable enough to be released. They sleep on a narrow cot next to a toilet. The only view is a fluorescent-lit hallway visible through a small window in the door.
Lake County Attorney James Lapotka stood at the cell’s center talking about the people he helps confine here. He stretched out his arms, his fingertips just shy of touching opposite walls. “I’m getting anxiety just being in here,” Lapotka said.
Last year, a man sentenced for stealing a rifle stayed in that cell 129 days. He was waiting for a spot to open at Montana’s only state-run psychiatric hospital after a mental health evaluator deemed he needed care, according to court records.
A man in the next cell around the same time was on the same waitlist roughly five months. He faced near-daily stints in the jail’s emergency restraint chair — a steel contraption wrapped in foam with straps for his shoulders, arms, and legs. He regularly saw the jail’s mental health doctor. Still, Joel Shearer, a Lake County detention commander, said the man routinely experienced psychotic episodes and asked to be locked in the chair when he felt one coming on and stayed there until his screams subsided.
“Somebody who’s having a mental health crisis — they don’t belong here,” Lapotka said. “We don’t have anywhere else.”
Lake County’s two, roughly 30-square-foot isolation cells are an example of how communities nationwide are failing to provide mental health services — crisis care, in particular. Nearly half of the people locked in local jails in the U.S. have a mental illness.
More than half of Wyoming’s 23 sheriffs told lawmakers there that they were housing people in crisis awaiting mental health care for months, WyoFile reported in January. Nevada has struggled despite a $500 daily fine for each jailed patient whose treatment is delayed. Disability Rights Oregon has said delays in that state continue after two people died in jail while on the state’s psychiatric waitlist.
In Montana, counties are jailing mental health patients they’re not equipped to handle when the Montana State Hospital is at capacity. Few local hospitals have their own inpatient psychiatric beds. As a result, people arrested for anything from petty theft to felony assault can be jailed for months or longer as their mental health worsens. Many haven’t been convicted of a crime.
Montana officials have known for years they have a problem. State officials have said they don’t have space for all the people ordered to the hospital. The psychiatric hospital has 270 beds, with 54 for people in the criminal justice system. Staffing shortages can shrink that capacity further.
The Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services backed two bills this legislative session that would shield the state from liability for delays when the Montana State Hospital is full. Ahead of the bills, the agency wrote the hospital has “struggled to maintain appropriate levels of care” due to money and staffing constraints, a lack of community-based services, and having no control over the flow patients Montana courts send its way.
The agency also announced April 23 that $6.5 million was available through one-time grants to help set up jail-based mental health stabilization services.
Officials have said patients deserve care closer to home, in less restrictive settings. But counties say the local services needed don’t exist.
“You have to do the hard things first,” said Matt Kuntz, executive director of the Montana chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness. “You have to build the beds.”
Health advocates have backed a proposal that would require the state to pay for community commitments. That measure is headed to Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte after passing the state House and Senate. Another bill that was still pending would create a new psychiatric hospital for people in the justice system. But implementing those ideas could take years.
The number of inpatient beds for people with a serious mental illness nationwide has plummeted. At one time, that drop was intentional, part of a movement away from locking people up in state-run mental hospitals. But the intended fix, local homelike centers, hasn’t filled the void.
One of Montana’s biggest providers, Western Montana Mental Health Center, had to close some of its crisis sites because of money problems, said Western’s CEO, Bob Lopp. That includes a facility less than a mile from the Lake County jail.
“If that’s not where the funding is, you can’t just do it for the sake of argument and hope that it comes,” Lopp said.
Gianforte has promised to pour money into rebuilding the state’s behavioral health system. Mental health workers in small towns find such promises hard to trust after seeing local services come and go for years.
Health department spokesperson Holly Matkin said the agency is proud of its work to fix “systems that have been broken for too long” and that it will improve services for people who need inpatient care in their communities.
Lake County is known to outsiders as an Instagram-worthy stop on their way to Glacier National Park. It overlaps with the Flathead Indian Reservation, land of the Bitterroot Salish, Upper Pend d’Oreille, and Kootenai tribes. It’s home to a slice of the Rocky Mountains and a gateway to millions of acres of wilderness. Polson, the county seat and site of the jail, is a town of 5,600 on the southern shore of Flathead Lake, one of the largest lakes west of the Mississippi River.
Vincent River has worked as the jail’s sole mental health clinician for 25 years. He said he’s not always available because he’s the only psychologist in four northwestern Montana counties evaluating whether a person in jail needs psychiatric care.
Some are released without care if they linger too long on the state hospital’s waitlist.
“I talk to these family members. I hear them plead with me with their fear in their voices and tell me all that’s been going on for days or weeks or months,” River said. “And then I can’t get people into the hospital. That is a giant crisis.”
It’s not just the state hospital. River said he can’t get people into any psychiatric bed in Montana because there are too few. Instead, he tries to stabilize people while they’re jailed. That has shortfalls.
The jail can’t force someone in psychosis to take medication without a court order and a qualified doctor on hand to administer the prescription. Lake County’s aging facility has faced lawsuits because of poor conditions amid overcrowding, and River has to see patients wherever there’s room.
There isn’t even space for the jail’s restraint chair. Jail workers leave strapped-down prisoners in a hallway or locker room.
River said many gradually get better and leave isolation. Some don’t.
“They languish there, psychotic and lonely,” he said, “at the mercy of what the voices are telling them.”
Locals are working to fill some gaps. A mobile team launched in February is staffed by people who have lived with mental and substance use disorders to provide peer support. But someone truly in crisis has only two options — jail or an emergency room.
The room reserved for people in crisis at Providence St. Joseph Medical Center in Polson leaves patients both isolated and without privacy. The locked door’s thick glass looks onto a busy emergency room hallway.
Those who deteriorate enough to be deemed dangerous to themselves or others are sent down the road to jail.
Rebecca Bontadelli, an ER physician, said patients can be housed in the room for days as hospital staffers scour Montana and nearby states for an open psychiatric bed. Some reject care in the meantime.
“We’re not really helping them,” Bontadelli said. “They feel like they’re in prison.”

(Photo courtesy of America's Public Television Stations)Should public media be spared the budget cutting axe of President Donald Trump and the congressional allies of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE?
I’m not going to directly answer that question myself, because I’m not an unbiased observer: I’ve worked for years as a reporter and contractor for Alaska Public Media, Anchorage’s public radio and television station. I also have close friendships and working relationships with many of the reporters across the state whose jobs could be at stake.
I do, however, feel confident in saying that there’s another, related question that’s objectively interesting and less problematic for me to try to answer, which is: Will Alaska’s elected officials vote to buck Trump and preserve public media’s federal funding?
That question has become increasingly urgent with the Trump administration plan to end the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, or CPB.”
That nonprofit organization, in turn, grants money to both NPR and PBS, as well as to stations across the country — including more than 20 in Alaska, from Utqiagvik on the North Slope to Ketchikan near the Canadian boarder.
Alaska’s stations received more than $12 million from CPB last year, which can amount to 40% or more of their annual budgets.
NPR, which Trump and his allies have attacked as biased towards liberals, derives roughly 1% of its budget from CPB, though it also collects money from individual stations that run its programs.
Alaska’s public media leaders told me they believe Trump’s proposal is more likely to pass the Republican-controlled U.S. House.
They’re counting on the U.S. Senate — where only a few GOP votes would be needed to sink the plan — to be their firewall.
They describe Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski as a rock solid ally in preserving the funding. And they expect Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan, a longtime supporter of public media, to come to their defense, too.
But they also say they won’t know for certain until the votes are cast.
“I don’t want to say that I’m fully confident of their votes,” said Tom Abbott, general manager of KFSK in the Southeast Alaska fishing town of Petersburg, which gets some 30% of its budget from CPB.
But, Abbott added: “We’ve had very strong support from both of our U.S. senators, for several years now.”
I was curious to know where Sullivan, Murkowski and Alaska’s sole member of the U.S. House, Republican Nick Begich III, stood on what’s reported to be an impending proposal from Trump to rescind $1.1 billion, or two years of funding, for CPB.
I asked each of their offices Wednesday.
Begich’s spokesperson didn’t respond by my deadline. Murkowski’s spokesman, Joe Plesha, was unequivocal, saying that she is a “fierce advocate for Alaska’s public broadcasting and vehemently opposes this reported rescission.”
“While the administration might be targeting NPR and PBS by rescinding this funding, the real casualty will be local public broadcasting, which is vital for Alaska,” Plesha said.
Sullivan’s spokesperson, Amanda Coyne, also sent a statement: “While Sen. Sullivan believes that NPR has become overly partisan and has veered far from its mission to include a diversity of voices in its coverage, he understands that Alaska’s public radio stations are essential to our state, especially in rural areas.”
Sullivan has also, in recent days, responded to constituents who have emailed in support of public media funding, saying in a form letter that he “will continue to work with the current administration to stress the importance of public broadcasting in Alaska and nationwide.”
Sullivan’s position is particularly interesting because of his politics: Unlike Murkowski, he’s rarely publicly criticized Trump’s policies.
But while Trump’s White House has ripped into public media — saying this monththat “the NPR, PBS grift has ripped us off for too long” — Sullivan has long recognized its value, at least as far as the services it provides in rural communities.
In 2020, he accepted a “champion of public broadcasting” award from a coalition of public television stations. He also joined with Murkowski in recommending an Alaskan, Diane Kaplan, for a seat on CPB’s board of directors, and former President Joe Biden appointed her in 2022.
Kaplan is now in the news this week for a lawsuit she and CPB filed against Trump, alleging that the president is illegally attempting to fire her and other board members.
Begich’s vote will be interesting to watch, as well.
The representative, who’s just a few months into his first term, has aligned himself closely with Trump.
But he’s also sent constituents correspondence about public media funding that references the challenge of communication and information sharing in Alaska’s rural communities, saying that public media plays a “crucial role” in residents’ access to news and emergency alerts.
“I support fiscal responsibility and efforts to reduce wasteful government spending,” he said in one recent message. “I also recognize that certain investments provide valuable returns to our communities. I will continue to advocate for policies that enhance infrastructure, improve broadband access, and support communication networks that serve all Alaskans, including those in our rural communities.”
Republicans have targeted federal funding of public media for years. But those efforts have never gained as much traction as they’re getting now.
Abbott, in Petersburg, describes the current threat to federal funding as “by far, the most serious” in his 28 years as general manager. With the proposal from Trump expected, though still not yet introduced, “it puts us all in an uneasy position.”“We’re kind of waiting for the ax to drop,” he said.

The third had raped and killed a 15-year-old girl.
Wassenaar’s only regret was that he didn’t kill more.
“Child molesters: I wanted to kill them all. That’s all I can say,” he told the Arizona Mirror in a recent phone call.
But he did say more.
“The taxpayers no longer have to pay for them,” he continued. “I’m paying my debt to society.”
The Arizona Department of Corrections, Rehabilitation and Re-entry is investigating what happened that day. No charges have been filed yet, and a spokesperson for the Pima County Attorney’s Office said that Corrections has not yet referred its investigation to their office. The Corrections Department has not commented on the matter, other than to condemn the violence and note that it was quickly curtailed.
Wassenaar, who is known in prison as “Rooster,” is already serving 16 life sentences for his part in a 2004 jail-break attempt that ended in a 15-day hostage stand-off at the Lewis Prison in Buckeye. He has spent 38 of his 62 years in Arizona prisons, with just a four-month stint on the outside. And the Pima County Attorney, Laura Conover, has written newspaper op-eds declaring her aversion to the death penalty.
Wassenaar also claims he killed a fourth prisoner last November because he didn’t want to share a cell. He says he strangled the man with his bare hands, but Corrections didn’t believe him and the autopsy conducted by the Pima County Office of the Medical Examiner could not definitively determine that the man — also a sex offender — was murdered.
Nonetheless, he insisted that he killed the man, telling an investigator from his last trial and a prison advocate who relayed the information to Corrections that he would kill anyone else they assign to his cell.
“You’ve got to give him an ‘A’ for effort,” said Carlos Garcia, the president of the Arizona Correctional Peace Officers Association.
The Corrections Department was playing chicken with Wassenaar, Garcia said: “He told them he was going to kill someone. They didn’t listen, and he did it.”
 ‘I’m a killer now’

I last spoke to Wassenaar 20 years ago, while he was defending himself in trial for the attempted escape and prison takeover. I distinctly recall the sheriff’s  detention officer escorting me to a holding cell, locking me in with Wassenaar and then leaving.

Like many accused and convicted criminals I have interviewed, Wassenaar was a paradox: a grab-bag of hatreds and loyalties, with a strict code of honor despite his lawlessness.
On the day I interviewed him, he fretted over the fact that it was my wife’s birthday; shouldn’t I be home with her? He talked about his own mother, how he wanted to be imprisoned close enough to his native Michigan so that she could visit him. And when she died, he told me, he wasn’t sure he still wanted to stay alive. He is still close to his sister, Rhonda, who talks to him regularly, and who was herself convicted of a conspiracy to spring him from custody when he was to be transferred to Ohio to serve his sentence.
What I remember most vividly is his account of why he was sent to Lewis Prison in the first place.
In 1986, Wassenaar was arrested for armed robbery and aggravated assault. I know nothing about those crimes, but after 10 years, he was released on home arrest and was staying with a family in Tucson.
He had a whole list of people he was angry at when he got out, and he told me the anger buzzed in his head like a hive of bees.
He had been out more than four months when he walked into a Tucson video shop with the intent of renting a pornographic video. The shop clerk asked him for a phone number and Wassenaar didn’t want to give the only number he had, which belonged to the people he was staying with.
The clerk ridiculed him. So, the next night, Wassenaar came back with a gun and held up the shop. Then he took off in a car and led police on a high-speed chase that ended in a crash.
Wassenaar said he woke up on a hospital gurney. There was a TV set right above him showing the evening news and flashing his photograph. Suddenly, the buzzing had stopped, he told me, and he realized he was going back to prison.
Last week, during our phone call, I reminded him of our earlier conversations.
“I was a whole different person then,” he said. And when I asked him how so, he answered, “I’m a killer now. I was never a killer before.”
 The 15-day siege

In January 2004, Wassenaar almost escaped from prison. But instead of making it outside the prison walls, he and his prison mate ended up starting the longest ever hostage situation at a prison.
He had worked in the prison legal library and felt he was discriminated against by prison management in ways he was punished, a belief that has been a running theme throughout his prison life.
He now worked in the kitchen as a cook, and he put together a plan with another inmate in the kitchen, Steven Coy. On a January morning, when they knew the mess hall would be understaffed, they sprung the plan. Wassenaar overpowered a correctional officer, handcuffed him and took his uniform. He shaved off his own beard to more closely resemble a correctional officer. He asked the other prisoners in the cafeteria if they wanted to join him, but they refused. So, he headed out the door to a nearby guard tower. The guard tower was a short stop on the way to the prison administration building and a door outside of the prison to freedom.
One of the guards on duty in the tower, Jason Auch, mistook Wassenaar for the officer he had overpowered and buzzed him in. Wassenaar pulled his cap down until Auch reached him, then pulled a metal paddle from one of the kitchen’s industrial mixers out of the pocket of his cargo pants and smacked Auch across the side of the head, knocking him nearly senseless. The second guard in the tower, Lois Fraley, charged him, but he subdued her and handcuffed her. Then, taking an automatic rifle from the tower, he went to see what was holding up Coy.
Wassenaar later said he knew little about why Coy had been in prison. Coy was a convicted rapist, and while Wassenaar was taking the tower, Coy was raping a female civilian worker in the kitchen. Otherwise, they might have pulled off an escape.
When Wassenaar stepped out of the tower, other correctional officers had Coy spread-eagled on the ground. Wassenaar sprayed bullets over their heads. One of them asked who he was shooting at, to which Wassenaar answered, “You!” The officers retreated and Wassenaar pulled Coy into the tower.
The next 15 days were high drama as Wassenaar negotiated with prison officials and other law-enforcement agencies. At one point, during a whispered phone call, Wassenaar told negotiators that he had sent Coy to the tower where they could get a shot at him. Sharpshooters drew a bead on a person in the tower they thought was Coy, then held fire when they realized it could be Auch. Wassenaar made demands for Philly cheesesteaks, Coke, cigarettes and meatball subs, and raged if he didn’t get them. He screamed at the hostage negotiators, once while he held a shotgun to Auch’s head and another time when he threatened to cut off one of Fraley’s fingers.
Coy raped Fraley. Wassenaar was also charged and convicted of sexual assault for an incident that took place during the early hours of the siege. They were on the floor of the tower, below the windows to avoid the snipers, and Wassenaar was pulling off Fraley’s pants to give them to Coy to wear as a disguise. Her underwear came off with her pants, and Wassenaar allegedly put his finger in her vagina at that moment and made remarks. He denied it happened, but the jury concluded that it did.
Eventually, Coy and Wassenaar surrendered after getting assurances that they would be transferred to prisons out of Arizona. They had a last meal with a couple of beers before they left the tower.
 Courtroom drama

The trial began a year and a day after the start of the siege. It was a circus. Wassenaar chose to defend himself, and he was well matched by the prosecutor, Deputy Maricopa County Attorney Jeanette Gallagher, a tough-talking Chicagoan with a glare and a growl that was just as intimidating as Wassenaar’s.
Coy had already pleaded guilty and was sentenced to seven consecutive life sentences, to start after the 185 years he was already serving. He was whisked off to a prison in Maine.
Wassenaar had attended the pretrial proceedings in shackles and jail stripes. But during the trial, he was dressed out in civilian clothes with a stun belt under his shirt and nylon bands binding his legs to his chair.
At times it was amusing, and admittedly, the media who attended the overflow courtroom was at times charmed by Wassenaar. Once, when he took the witness stand before the jury came in, Wassenaar grabbed the microphone and pretended he was a club DJ, asking for song suggestions and then saying he was going to play the Lynyrd Skynyrd song “Free Bird.” On multiple occasions, Gallagher would storm out of the courtroom and utter angry epithets that journalists could not report.
When Judge Warren Granville asked Wassenaar how far he had gone in school. Wassenaar answered, “DOC documents will tell you I have a GED. Others will tell you I have a Master’s Degree in being a dumbass.”
Auch, the male correctional officer taken hostage, withered on the stand under Wassenaar’s questioning. Fraley, however, was confident and unyielding. She told the jury how Wassenaar would make her mop blood and urine off the floor. She fantasized about dumping the buckets over his head and jumping from the tower.
“A couple of broken legs, I would have been satisfied with,” she said.
On another day, Wassenaar’s withering gaze was countered by Maricopa County Sheriff’s Sgt. Kip Rustenburg, who had been one of the hostage negotiators during the siege. When Wassenaar said something offensive, she flashed her eyes and smiled at him slyly, without saying a word. He had to turn away, half laughing, but clearly intimidated.
And though he denied the sex assault charges and attempted murder charges for shooting at correctional officers, the jury found him guilty of 19 counts. He was sentenced to 16 life sentences, a harsh enhancement for committing the crimes while he was already in prison.
Wassenaar was sent to a prison in Ohio. He was later transferred to New Mexico, out of sight and out of mind, before coming back to a prison in Tucson in 2016, and housed in a sex-offender unit. In Wassenaar’s mind, he was sent back because Charles Ryan, then the Corrections director, “Wanted his pound of flesh.” Wassenaar had embarrassed the department. Ryan, he said, “wanted revenge before he died.”
 ‘I wanted to kill them all’

Much of the following account comes from my recent conversation with Wassenaar. He was calling from prison, limited in time. The phone cut off in mid-sentence. Other information comes from court records and from conversations with Donna Hamm, of the prison advocacy organization Middle Ground. Hamm has spoken to various people with knowledge of the events. None of it, other than the victims’ names, has been confirmed by the corrections department or the Pima County Attorney’s Office.
Wassenaar told Hamm that he didn’t want to share a cell with another prisoner. When they moved Joseph Desisto into the cell, Wassenaar told Hamm he tried to block the door to keep him out.
Desisto, 81, had been convicted of multiple counts of child sex abuse and sexual conduct with a minor.
Desisto was found dead in the cell on Nov. 5, 2024, which Wassenaar made a point of reminding me was Election Day. Wassenaar said he strangled Desisto.
“I choked him with an arm bar, and then with my hands,” he told me. And he said that he was dripping sweat all over Desisto from the effort, something he told Hamm as well, and said he left DNA evidence on Desisto’s body.
Desisto’s autopsy noted Wassenaar’s allegation, but the medical examiner found no signs of strangulation: there were no marks on Desisto’s neck and his hyoid bone — an indicator of strangulation if broken — was intact. He had broken ribs, according to the report, a common injury that occurs during CPR, and Wassenaar volunteered that prison EMTs had in fact broken Desisto’s ribs.
The cause of death was inconclusive.
Wassenaar told Hamm and me that he got the equivalent of a 30-day time-out even though he confessed to killing the cell mate.
He called his former trial investigator. He called Hamm. He wanted to be implicated in Desisto’s death. He thought Desisto’s family would want to know what happened to him.
Hamm asked him, “Why would you kill someone if you’re so concerned about their family?”
He said he just wanted to be alone. But he insisted on his guilt. “I gave a detailed account,” he told me.
He told Hamm he had made it clear to his keepers that, if they put anyone else in his cell, he would kill them, too.
“He wants to do his time the way he wants to do it,” she said.
In the meantime, in December, on the anniversary of his mother’s death, he said, he picked out a good-sized rock from the prison yard and saved it in his cell.
By the morning of April 4, prison authorities had put an inmate named Saul Alvarez in Wassenaar’s cell. Alvarez had kidnapped a 15-year-old girl in 1998, raped her and killed her. Hamm had been told that Wassenaar suffocated him and stabbed him to death with a shank and arranged Alvarez’s body on his bed to make it look like he was asleep. He took the rock he had saved and put it in his fishnet laundry bag and headed out to the prison yard.
In the yard, other prisoners were starting to assemble in line for breakfast. Outside the mess hall door was a long passageway enclosed in chain-link fence that the prisoners call “the cage.” Wassenaar came in and started swinging his rock.
He felt he had jumped the gun.
“If I had waited until they were all locked in that cage, I would have killed ten or twelve,” he said.
Instead, he killed two, Thorne Harnage and Donald Lashley, both of whom were serving life sentences for sexual conduct with a minor. Another prisoner tried to stop him, and Wassenaar said he stabbed him.
He was overpowered before he had finished, he told me.
“I wanted to kill them all.”

New apartments reached almost 592,000 nationally last year, the highest number since 1974, with South Dakota and the Rapid City area approving new apartments at particularly high rates. (Photo by Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)More new apartments were built in 2024 than in any other year since 1974, but the Trump administration’s tariffs and deportations of potential construction workers, plus higher interest rates, could be a wet blanket on the boom.
A U.S. Census Bureau survey found almost 592,000 new apartments were finished last year, the most since the 1970s, when baby boomers sparked a construction surge as they moved out of their childhood homes. There were 693,000 new apartments built in 1974, when the country had about half as many households.
But there has been a steep slowdown in construction starts, as the newly completed apartments come online. The increased supply has lowered rents and increased vacancy rates, making new development less profitable. Some experts also say tariffs on construction materials and labor shortages caused by dips in immigration will create headwinds for new construction.
Apartment starts were down 27% in 2024 compared with 2023, and down 37% from a recent peak of 531,000 in 2022, despite the historic rate of completions. Apartment starts were at their lowest ebb since 2013.


Housing experts have long lamented that there aren’t enough apartments and single-family houses in the U.S. — at least not in places where people want to live and at prices they can afford. Estimates of the national housing shortage last year varied widely, from 1.5 million houses and apartments to 20.1 million; since then, another 1.6 million houses and apartments have been built. Most experts estimate a shortage of 1.5 million to 5.5 million, according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University.
Some states are building apartments faster than others, according to a Stateline analysis. Though completions aren’t tracked by state, permits that lead to new apartments have been granted at high rates in recent years in South Dakota, Utah, Arizona and Colorado. Rates are lowest in Mississippi, Wyoming, West Virginia, Rhode Island, Oklahoma and Alaska.
The massive jump in apartment construction has its roots in 2021 and 2022, when interest rates were low and rent growth was high, said Rob Warnock, senior research associate for Apartment List, a company that posts rental listings online.
“Those new apartments came online in 2023 and 2024, and while those deliveries are slowing down today, there are still many apartments in the pipeline,” said Warnock, who added that “supply and demand are coming back into balance.”
In response to greater supply, rents have fallen by about $50 per month (3.5%) from their 2022 peak, according to a report released this week by Apartment List. Apartment vacancy is at a 15-year high of 6.3%, keeping a lid on rents, but that could turn around as construction slows, according to an April report by Moody’s, a financial services company.
Apartment building has been a bipartisan priority as single-family home prices soar further out of the affordability range for young families. In South Dakota, the Republican-controlled legislature worked to prolong the building boom with grants and loans under the state’s Housing Infrastructure Financing Program. The program put $200 million of state and federal funding toward defraying the costs of development in new neighborhoods, such as roads, sewer lines and streetlights.
Republican state Sen. Casey Crabtree, sponsor of the proposal signed into law in 2023, told Stateline it was needed to address a housing shortage, especially in rural parts of the state.
“We have a drastic shortage of workers,” Crabtree said before a vote in 2023. “South Dakota businesses need more workers in our state. To get more workers, we need more housing.”
Armand Domalewski, co-founder of YIMBY Democrats for America, said overregulation is a barrier to housing construction in many areas that his party controls.
“A lot of blue-government areas and cities have extremely restrictive zoning, impact fees and other rules that make it very difficult to build housing,” said Domalewski. Another barrier is local opposition, he said.
“If it was just a free market, developers would want to build in the places like California, where prices are the highest and rents are the highest, because they’d make more money,” he added.
In California, the 2021 HOME Act was meant to spur more affordable housing and ease labor shortages, but it’s faced local opposition in some areas. At the end of last year, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed several measures that aim to streamline regulations and crack down on local resistance to the 2021 law.
South Dakota approved nearly 6,000 permits for apartment units in 2023 and 2024, which when completed would add about 1.4% to its 2023 total of 417,000 housing units. That’s the highest rate in the nation. By contrast, Mississippi during that same period approved about 660 apartment units — a fraction of 1 percentage point to its 2023 base of about 1.4 million housing units.
Chas Olson, executive director of the South Dakota Housing Development Authority, said the full impact of the state infrastructure funding isn’t apparent yet, as many developments that received the help are still under construction.
Completions are still strong this year with about 39,000 apartments finished in March, not much different from the 41,500 in March 2024, which was the biggest March number since 1985.
Another impediment to apartment construction has been high interest rates, which make it harder to borrow money to build, said Danushka Nanayakkara-Skillington, an assistant vice president for forecasting and analysis at the National Association of Home Builders.
She expects apartment building starts to slow until later this year.
“We are going to be short of workers for a long time. That’s the way it is. And of course tariffs are going to have an impact,” Nanayakkara-Skillington said.

(Photo by Tanner Johnson and provided by Jenny-Marie Stryker)Alaska’s branch of the Democratic Party announced Friday that it has hired Jenny-Marie Stryker, currently the political director for the Alaska Center, as its new executive director.
The announcement follows the resignation of former executive director Lindsay Kavanaugh and a decision by the national party to increase its contributions to state-level party organizations, particularly those in Republican-controlled states. The executive director serves as the party’s top paid staff member in the state.
State party chair Eric Croft called her “an excellent addition to our team.”
Stryker, 30, moved to Alaska in 2017 and has been active in politics during her time in the state.
“I thought about it so, so much, and felt like there’s very few things that I could do that would be more impactful to create the Alaska that I want to live in,” she said about her decision to apply for the executive director job.
Stryker said she remembers canvassing for Barack Obama’s first presidential campaign long before she was old enough to vote. She became a registered Democrat in California, her birth state, as soon as she could.
“I think what’s really inspiring to me is the values that we all hold, which is an economy that works for everyone and uplifts everyone. You know, we have such a polarized society, such a giant wealth gap, and giant wealth spread. And I think the Democrats were very clearly, to me, are the party that has an inspiring vision for how to solve that,” she said.
After Democratic incumbent Rep. Mary Peltola lost her U.S. House seat to Republican Nick Begich in last year’s U.S. House election, the Democratic Party has named Alaska’s House race as one of the ones it plans to focus on in 2026.
Democrats will also seek to unseat Republican U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, who has been a reliable supporter of President Donald Trump.
“2026 is going to be a massively consequential year for Alaska,” she said.
Stryker said it’s important to remember that there also are municipal elections this fall and in the spring.
“We don’t get the benefit of an off year in Alaska,” she said.
Stryker will start her work with the state party in June and said she would have more insight into her future plans at this point.
“From what I’ve been learning, we have to be laser-focused on increasing Democratic voter registration, increasing Democratic turnout, investing in our regional party infrastructure,” she said.
“We’re a massive state, and the regional party infrastructure is so, so important for us to succeed. It’s not the Anchorage party, it’s the Alaska party, and we think about it statewide, and our plans are statewide, and I think that’s really important for folks to know,” Stryker said.

Shadrach Minkins, already separated from his family, escaped from the Norfolk, Virginia, home, where he was enslaved. He made his way to Boston, where he did odd jobs until he began working as a waiter at Taft’s Cornhill Coffee House. 
Months later, Congress passed the Fugitive Slave Act, which gave authorities the power to go into free states and arrest Black Americans who had escaped slavery.

“The outlook revision to negative reflects our view that there is at least a one-in-three chance we could lower the rating within the two-year outlook if potential project cost escalations and uncertain timing of future federal reimbursements weaken the authority’s ability to sustain financial metrics at levels comparable with those of peers as it finances the reconstruction of the Francis Scott Key Bridge and its $5.1 billion capital improvement program,” S&P Global Ratings credit analyst Andrew Stafford said in a statement.
The Standard & Poor’s announcement warned: “We could lower the rating if actual financial performance trends negatively, and is materially weaker than currently forecast due to construction cost escalations, project delays, or softening demand.”
“We do not anticipate raising the rating over the two-year outlook period, given MDTA’s relatively high debt burden and additional borrowing plans,” the credit rating agency said.
Currently, the authority has $2.1 billion in outstanding debt. In fiscal 2026, which begins in July, that amount is expected to “increase significantly” to $2.6 billion, according to an analysis by the Department of Legislative Services.
Outstanding debt is projected to increase to $3.3 billion in fiscal 2027, before peaking at $3.8 billion in fiscal years 2029 and 2030 — an amount just under the authority’s statutory borrowing cap, according to the legislative analysis from February.

Bond ratings determine the interest rate governments pay on money borrowed for buildings, roads and other infrastructure projects. Lower ratings ultimately cost governments – and taxpayers —more.
Revenue bonds issued by the authority are separate from the state’s general obligation bond borrowing.
A year ago, Moody’s reaffirmed the state’s coveted AAA rating on general obligation bonds but downgraded its outlook from stable to negative, citing concerns about looming structural deficits driven by programs including the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future education reforms.
In March, Moody’s issued another report citing concerns about cuts to federal employment and other concerns. The firm said Maryland is at greatest risk from those cuts.
Moody’s, along with Standard & Poor’s and Fitch are all expected to meet with state officials this month. From those meetings, the three agencies will issue updated annual bond ratings in advance of a scheduled June bond sale.
There are rumblings in corners of Annapolis about a potential downgrade of the state’s creditworthiness from one or more of the rating agencies.
The state has held the coveted “triple, triple-A” rating for more than three decades. Maryland got its first triple-A rating from Standard & Poor’s in 1961, followed by Moody’s 12 years later and Fitch in 1993.
The authority operates eight toll facilities including the Fort McHenry and Harbor tunnels, the Bay Bridge, the Gov. Harry W. Nice/Sen. Thomas “Mac” Middleton Bridge and the Intercounty Connector. It also operated the Key Bridge and is in charge of its replacement.
Tolls charged by the authority at those facilities are pledged to repay its borrowing.
A Maryland Transportation Authority spokesperson, in an emailed statement said the agency will continue to meet its debt payment obligations.
“The Maryland Transportation Authority (MDTA) recognizes that the negative ratings outlook reflects the uncertainty associated with a mega project the size of the Key Bridge Rebuild and uncertain timing of when federal funding will be received,” the spokesperson wrote. “Despite the loss of the Key Bridge and temporary loss of associated revenues, the MDTA expects to remain in compliance with all board directed financial policies and trust agreement covenants.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The negative outlook comes a year after the catastrophic collapse of the bridge. The span over the Patapsco collapsed after a pier was struck by the Dali, a fully laden 984-foot cargo vessel that lost power. Six people working on the bridge died in the incident.
The allision remains under investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board.
“The State of Maryland continues to pursue the DALI’s owner and manager for all the damages caused by their negligence and incompetence – including the cost to reconstruct the Francis Scott Key Bridge – so that the parties responsible for this tragedy pay for the damages they caused,” the MdTA spokesperson wrote. “The American Relief Act, 2025, provides that if any additional funds are required to build the new bridge beyond the compensation paid by the DALI, the federal government will provide that funding.”
Those federal lawsuits are complicated and ongoing. Final resolution could take years of litigation.
Standard and Poor’s issued a bond opinion immediately following the incident. In that opinion, the bond rating agency said “disruption and damage from the recent collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge … is not expected to have immediate credit implications for its ratings” on the authority, Baltimore City or the state.
“However, the long-term financial impact, particularly for MDTA, will likely be unknown for some time,” according to the Standard & Poor’s 2024 opinion.
Moody’s ratings issued its own updated opinion that same month. In it, the agency downgraded the authority’s outlook from stable to negative on $2.2 billion in outstanding debt.
The company cited “uncertainty around the Francis Scott Key Bridge’s … replacement project’s costs, including their funding, and timing. Any negative impact from the replacement project would be on top of financial metrics that were expected to narrow from capital investments prior to the loss of the bridge.”
Maryland officials mark one year since collapse of Key Bridge

A replacement is expected to cost at least $1.7 billion. Officials hope to complete the new span by 2028.
State officials continue to rely on promises of full federal funding for a replacement made by then-President Joseph Biden (D) just hours after the span collapsed. But that promise is less certain since the election of President Donald Trump (R).
Trump has made good on his campaign promise to slash government spending and employment. In March, he said he would block plans for a new FBI headquarters in Greenbelt — a project Gov. Wes Moore and others lauded as an economic boon to the state and Prince George’s County.
Trump’s election also cast doubt on the likelihood of federal funding for an east-west Red Line transit project in Baltimore. Moore made construction of the line a signature campaign promise.
For now, the authority said it does not expect to speed up a projected toll increase, though one is coming.
“MDTA’s current financial plan indicates that toll increases are not needed before FY 2028. This action by S&P is not likely to change the projected timing of that need,” the agency spokesperson wrote.
In January, a Department of Legislative Services analysis highlighted the authority’s own projection of “fiscal challenges on the horizon,” including increases in outstanding debt between fiscal 2026 and 2030. That legislative review noted “the need for action, such as implementing a toll increase to maintain the debt service coverage ratio by fiscal 2028.”
The projected need for an increase is a year sooner than the timeline projected in a 2024 analysis.
“Compared to the prior forecast, the current forecast has significant forecasted increases in capital expenditures related to the rebuilding of the Francis Scott Key Bridge,” analysts wrote in their review.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/13697971305_08ce56a830_o-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-03 07:58:22.106221

They are fascinatingly one of the youngest geographical features on the planet, most  only between 6,000 and 10,000 years old, which is a blink compared to the rest of Earth’s  history.
Although the wetlands just got here, they have locked tons of ancient carbon into their sediment  and plants, and they’re still doing work as our emissions continue to grow. They have tons of  other benefits, like filtering our water, providing a place for fisheries to continue their life cycle,  and acting as a soaking buffer when the storm surge rises.

Wetlands also attract biodiversity, which  underpins human health and nutrition, and we all know health is true wealth.
Unfortunately, the space that wetlands occupy is on the decline, globally decreasing between 3%  and 7% each year. This is due to human impact, such as development on wetlands, but also the ever-rising sea levels pushing them inland. Wetlands may be able to survive if they are able to  migrate inland, but with human development impeding their movement, they are becoming  fragmented and eventually can die.
When wetlands die, their work stops, which exacerbates climate change issues.
Maryland as a state has a rich maritime heritage, and is affected by its water bodies, like the  Chesapeake, the Pocomoke and the Atlantic. The blue crab is an icon, beautiful to look at and  culturally significant to eat and protect. For a place that finds the water to be significant,  wetlands need to be a part of that narrative.
There is hope, with many initiatives that would allow these ecosystems to thrive far into the  future, but we have to lean into it as a society and focus on policy that will benefit generations  long after we are gone. We have to reshape how we think of these wetlands, because with the  inevitable future of sea level rise and climate change, they could save our beloved coasts.
Chances are there is a wetland right in your backyard or around the corner.
If you sit silently in a wetland, you’ll start to discover all of its secrets and how much life it  holds while we humans are busy. Small terrapins poking their heads out of the water, soaking up  the sun. A bald eagle soaring overhead, searching for the next fish to catch. Sunlight hitting the  puddles of water through the loblolly pines. Horseshoe crabs crawling up banks to take a rest from the tides. Cordgrass swaying in the wind as the hairs on your arms pick up on the change in  direction.
If we grow to understand these places, and love them, we will want to protect them. So on your  next free weekend, choose to visit one of your local Maryland wetlands.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/4831334400_6f7db35780_o-1024x680.jpg,,,2025-05-03 07:04:57.465789

(Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)As states rush to address falling literacy scores, a new kind of education debate in state legislatures is taking hold: not whether reading instruction needs fixing, but how to fix it.
More than a dozen states have enacted laws banning public school educators from teaching youngsters to read using an approach that’s been popular for decades. The method, known as “three-cueing,” encourages kids to figure out unfamiliar words using context clues such as meaning, sentence structure and visual hints.
In the past two years, several states have instead embraced instruction rooted in what’s known as the “science of reading.” That approach leans heavily on phonics — relying on letter and rhyming sounds to read words such as cat, hat and rat.
The policy discussions on early literacy are unfolding against a backdrop of alarming national reading proficiency levels. The 2024 Nation’s Report Card revealed that 40% of fourth graders and 33% of eighth graders scored below the basic reading level — the highest percentages in decades.
No state improved in fourth- or eighth-grade reading in 2024. Eight states — Alaska, Arizona, Delaware, Florida, Nebraska, Nevada, Utah and Vermont — scored worse than they did a year or two prior in eighth-grade reading.
Five — Arizona, Florida, Nebraska, South Dakota and Vermont — saw dips in their fourth-grade reading scores.
In response to these troubling trends, a growing number of states are moving beyond localized efforts and tackling literacy through statewide legislation.
New Jersey last year mandated universal K-3 literacy screenings. Indiana lawmakers this month passed a bill that would allow some students to retake required reading tests before being held back in third grade; that bill is en route to the governor’s desk.
Oregon and Washington are weighing statewide literacy coaching and training models, while lawmakers in Montana introduced a bill to allow literacy interventions to cover broader reading and academic skills, not just early reading basics.
Mississippi, a state seen as a model for turnaround in literacy rates over the past decade, seeks to expand and require evidence-based reading interventions, mandatory literacy screenings and targeted teacher training, and to explicitly ban the use of three-cueing methods in reading instruction in grades 4-8.
Together, these efforts signal a national shift: States are treating literacy not as a local initiative, but as the foundation of public education policy.
“Literacy is the lever,” said Tafshier Cosby, the senior director of the Center for Organizing and Partnerships at the National Parents Union, an advocacy group. “If states focus on that, we see bipartisan wins. But the challenge is making that a statewide priority, not just a district-by-district hope.”
 ‘It’s the system that needs fixing’

Before he was even sworn in, first-term Georgia Democratic state Sen. RaShaun Kemp, a former teacher and principal, had already drafted a bill to end the use of the three-cueing system in Georgia classrooms.
This month, the final version focused on the science of reading passed the state legislature without a single “no” vote. GOP Gov. Brian Kemp signed a similar bill into law Monday to outlaw three-cueing.
Sen. Kemp said his passion for literacy reform stretches back decades, shaped by experiences tutoring children at a local church as a college student in the early 2000s. It was there, he said, that he began noticing patterns in how students struggled with foundational reading.
“In my experience, I saw kids struggle to identify the word they were reading. I saw how some kids were guessing what the word was instead of decoding,” Kemp recalled. “And it’s not technology or screens that’s the problem. It’s what teachers are being instructed on how to teach reading. It’s the system that needs fixing, not the teachers.”
Sen. Kemp’s bill requires the Professional Standards Commission — a state agency that oversees teacher prep and certification — to adopt rules mandating evidence-based reading instruction aligned with the science of reading, a set of practices rooted in decades of cognitive research on how children best learn to read.
“Current strategies used to teach literacy include methods that teach students to guess rather than read, preventing them from reaching their full potential,” Sen. Kemp said in a public statement following the bill’s legislative passage. “I know we can be better, and I’m proud to see our legislative body take much-needed steps to help make Georgia the number one state for literacy.”
In West Virginia, lawmakers have introduced similar bills that would require the state’s teachers to be certified in the science of reading.
Cosby, of the National Parents Union, said local policy changes can be driven by parents even before legislatures act.
“All politics are local,” Cosby said. “Parents don’t need to wait for statewide mandates — they can ask school boards for universal screeners and structured literacy now.”
Still, some parents worry their states are simply funding more studies on early literacy rather than taking direct action to address it.
A Portland, Oregon, parent of three — one of whom has dyslexia — sent written testimony this year urging lawmakers to skip further studies and immediately implement structured literacy statewide.
“We do not need another study to tell us what we already know — structured literacy is the most effective way to teach all children to read, particularly those with dyslexia and other reading challenges,” wrote Katherine Hoffman.
 Opposition to ‘science of reading’

Unlike in Georgia, the “science of reading” has met resistance in other states.
In California, legislation that would require phonics-based reading instruction statewide has faced opposition from English learner advocates who argue that a one-size-fits-all approach may not effectively serve multilingual students.
In opposition to the bill, the California Teachers Association argued that by codifying a rigid definition of the “science of reading,” lawmakers ignore the evolving nature of reading research and undermine teachers’ ability to meet the diverse needs of their students.
“Placing a definition for ‘science of reading’ in statute is problematic,” wrote Seth Bramble, a legislative advocate for the California Teachers Association in a March letter addressed to the state’s Assembly Education Committee. “This bill would carve into stone scientific knowledge that by its very nature is constantly being tested, validated, refuted, revised, and improved.”
Similarly, in Wisconsin, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers in March vetoed a bill that would have reversed changes to the state’s scoring system to align the state’s benchmarks with the National Assessment of Educational Progress, a federal assessment tool that has recently been hit with funding cuts and layoffs under the Trump administration. Evers said in his veto that Republican lawmakers were stepping on the state superintendent’s independence.
That veto is another step in the evolution of a broader constitutional fight over literacy policy and how literacy funds are appropriated and released. In 2023, Wisconsin lawmakers set aside $50 million for a new statewide literacy initiative, but disagreements over legislative versus executive control have stalled its disbursement.
Indiana’s legislature faced criticism from educators over a 2024 mandate requiring 80 hours of literacy training for pre-K to sixth-grade teachers before they can renew their licenses. Teachers argued that the additional requirements were burdensome and did not account for their professional expertise.












A student's likelihood to graduate high school can be predicted by their reading skill at the end of third grade.


– Mailee Smith, senior director of policy at the Illinois Policy Institute




In Illinois, literacy struggles have been building for more than a decade, according to Mailee Smith, senior director of policy at the Illinois Policy Institute. Today, only 3 in 10 Illinois third- and fourth-graders can read at grade level, based on state and national assessments.
Although Illinois lawmakers amended the school code in 2023 to create a state literacy plan, Smith noted the plan is only guidance and does not require districts to adopt evidence-based reading instruction. She urged local school boards to act on their own.
“If students can’t read by third grade, half of fourth-grade curriculum becomes incomprehensible,” she said. “A student’s likelihood to graduate high school can be predicted by their reading skill at the end of third grade.”
Despite the challenges, Smith said even small steps can make a real difference.
“Screening, intervention, parental notice, science-based instruction and thoughtful grade promotion — those are the five pillars, and Illinois and even local school districts can implement some of these steps right away,” she said.
“It doesn’t have to be daunting.”

(Photo illustration by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)A session that started under the lingering shadow of a bitter yet short-lived argument over immigration came sputtering to an end Friday with no agreement on a new state budget, the one bill the Legislature is constitutionally obliged to pass.
Senate President Ben Albritton and House Speaker Daniel Perez on Friday announced an extended session with lawmakers slated to return to Tallahassee on May 12.
Acrimony over Senate President Ben Albritton and House Speaker Daniel Perez’s inability to reach an accord spilled over from fiscal to substantive policy, with snits breaking out in a number of areas. The Senate’s proposed state fiscal year 2025-26 budget is  $117.3 billion.
 The House’s proposed FY 25-26 budget is $112.9 billion.  
In the past few days, legislators did pass some high-profile bills, including measures designed to mitigate a crisis for condominium owners and set up new guardrails against developments in state parks – that one a rebuff to Gov. Ron DeSantis. Last summer, his administration briefly considered a plan to establish golf courses and hotels at several state parks but retreated in a hail of public outrage.

The Republican-controlled Florida Legislature also approved a bill that will make it more difficult for citizen-led constitutional amendments to make it on the ballot.
“This is the most important bill that we will be hearing in this chamber,” said Democratic Senate Leader Lori Berman on Wednesday. “And as you’ve heard, it’s going to greatly restrict the access of the citizens of the state of Florida to be able to address the system.”
The Legislature agreed to eliminate a 35-year ban that prevented some people from pursuing wrongful-death lawsuits against physicians and hospitals, a top priority for Perez. 
Lawmakers, during the last week of session, agreed to roll back a law passed in 2023 that would’ve forced schools to push back their start times in 2026, leaving the decision up to schools. 
Legislators filed 1,951 bills for consideration during the 2025 session. As of Friday, just 243 had passed, a Senate bill report showed. 
Here’s a list of some of the bills that didn’t make it through the session.
 Working and the economy

Rural Renaissance: SB 110 is a top priority for Albritton. It steers infrastructure investments to rural parts of the state. Despite unanimous support in the upper chamber, the House did not take it up during the 60 days lawmakers were in town. Instead, the $200 million bill will be a topic when lawmakers reconvene in the coming weeks. 
E-Verify: DeSantis has repeatedly lambasted the House this session, stating that the chamber opposed everything he supports. But the House passed one piece of legislation DeSantis has pushed for, to require all employers to use the E-Verify system to check that new hires can legally work in the country.
However, the Senate never took up bills that would have brought thousands in penalties for employers who hire people unauthorized to work. Under existing law, only public agencies, their contractors, and companies with more than 25 employees have to use E-Verify. 
“I’m sure he’s gonna be pretty upset that the Senate isn’t willing to move on E-Verify,” Perez told reporters on April 24.
Employment: Florida voters went to the polls in 2020 to raise the minimum wage ultimately to $15 an hour by 2026, yet a proposal by Lee County Republican Sen. Jonathan Martin (SB 676) called for certain workers to “voluntarily” agree to work for below the minimum wage in work-study, internship, or apprenticeship programs.

The proposal passed through two committees in the Senate before being temporarily postponed on April 16, and it never came back — something Albritton was fine with.
“I don’t love it, to tell you the truth,” Albritton told reporters last month. “I think if someone works, whether they’re being an apprentice or whatever, the minimum wage is in the [state] Constitution for a reason.” When asked at the time whether the measure was dead for the session, he said, “I would expect so.”
Lawmakers have bounced around reducing protections for young Floridians in the workforce, including allowing them to work overnight and full-time hours during school weeks. 
Orlando Weekly reported that the bill was pushed by the DeSantis administration. The Senate bill, SB 918, did not make it to a second committee, while the House passed a version of the bill, HB 1225, off the floor last week that would keep overnight hours during the school year off limits for young people. The bill died. 
Property insurance: The House inserted an amendment awarding attorney’s fees to the winning party in insurance litigation into a Senate bill extending (SB 832) new legal protections to phosphate mining companies. Still, the Senate refused to move forward on the changes amid heavy pushback from DeSantis, insurance companies, and the state’s insurance regulator. The bill died on Friday after the Senate took out from it the property insurance provisions. 
Albritton told reporters on Monday that he believed in the changes lawmakers enacted in 2022 and 2023 to discourage lawsuits that insurance companies blamed for high rates were working.
“It’s only been a couple years, maybe. We’re still wanting to make sure we’re watching very closely what that is yielding,” Albritton said. “You’re right, there’s lots of new capital coming into the state. There’s new companies, rates are beginning to bend down pretty well, which is good news.”
The Office of Insurance Regulation reported an 0.7% drop in insurance costs in the fourth quarter of 2024. Twelve insurance companies have entered the state’s market, according to an announcement from the Office of Insurance Regulation on April 7.   
 Education 

Baby Olivia: The chambers were at odds over mandated viewing of the “Baby Olivia” video to teach embryologic development to public school students. That provision was included in HB 1255, one of the bills lawmakers battled on until the end of session.
Seeking agreement from the Senate, the House removed the Baby Olivia language Friday night. What’s left of the bill requires parental consent for schools that use corporal punishment.
Various bills to put university presidential searches into the sunshine and remove Board of Governors involvement in those searches never made it to the finish line.
Meanwhile, in his budget proposal, DeSantis proposed transferring the Ringling Museum from Florida State University to New College of Florida, his evolving “Hillsdale College of the South.” That proposal has gone nowhere in the Legislature so far, with stakeholders from the museum organizing against such a transfer. 
 Health

Parental consent: Exceptions that protect minors’ privacy with health care providers will remain in Florida statute. Senators didn’t take a final vote on a bill (HB 1505) requiring minors to obtain parental consent before receiving treatment for sexually transmitted infections and diseases. The bill also would have removed a provision letting physicians prescribe birth control to a minor if their medical opinion is that the patient would suffer health hazards otherwise.
In the proposal’s last committee stop in the Senate, Stuart Republican Sen. Gayle Harrell teared up while she talked about her late husband’s work as an OBGYN treating young women.
“He would roll over in his grave right now. I’m a no,” she said on April 21.
THC products: One of the biggest fails of the session has to be the Legislature’s inability to regulate hemp-derived THC products for the third year in a row.
  State Sen. Colleen Burton via Florida Senate
Perez assembled a 24-member workgroup that began meeting during the first week of session to “gain knowledge and understanding of the subject matter.” They came up with two main conclusions – that they didn’t want to do anything that might kill what has emerged as a billion-dollar industry in the state, but they also determined to change the status quo of how the product is being regulated – or not being regulated – in Florida.
The bills in the Senate sponsored by Polk County Republican Sen. Colleen Burton and in the House by Panhandle Republican Michelle Salzman did have some significant differences, which apparently in the end were too great. That’s despite the fact that those measures were approved unanimously in all committees that heard them. 
“We will continue to debate how hemp affects public health and our economy,” Salzman told the Phoenix. “There are legal gaps we need to address in the future and I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure these products are safe and protect consumers, while still allowing Florida farmers to thrive.”
 Politics and law

Sovereign immunity: Rep. Fiona McFarland once again has fallen short in her efforts to increase sovereign immunity limits for people injured by the government or its political subdivisions. Her bill, HB 301, never saw movement in the Florida Senate, which stood firm against it.
“I’m very disappointed,” McFarland told the Florida Phoenix Friday. She promised she’d sponsor the bill during the 2026 session. 
No fault repeal/PIP: The Florida House also championed legislation (HB 1181) to repeal the state’s no-fault automobile insurance laws and replace them with a fault-based system. It was one of several pieces of legislation the House advanced this session that would allow for more litigation, prompting Insurance and Banking Committee member Rep. Mike Caruso to opine, “Maybe we should call this the Insurance and Trial Attorneys Subcommittee because I feel like we’re doing a lot just for the benefit of trial attorneys.” The Senate agreed and never advanced the bill. DeSantis had already vetoed a PIP repeal once and opposed this year’s effort. The Senate companion (SB 1256) was never considered.

Wrongful death of fetuses: For a second year in a row, a bill (HB 1517) creating a legal avenue for parents to claim damages in the wrongful death of a fetus at any stage of development didn’t make it out of the session. This time around, the House approved the proposal, which reproductive rights advocates warned would establish fetal personhood. 
 Culture and Society

Guns: For the third year in a row, the Florida House voted to repeal the provision of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Public High School Act that raised the age to purchase a long gun in Florida from 18 to 21. And for the third year in a row, the Florida Senate opted not to move a companion measure.
Just as disappointing for Second Amendment advocates is that another year went by without the Legislature allowing Floridians to openly carry firearms. Once dubbed the “Gunshine State” for being at the forefront of such pro-gun laws as “Stand Your Ground,” gun-rights groups and Gov. Ron DeSantis himself called earlier this year for Florida to join the other 45 states that allow for “open carry.” 
But that legislation went nowhere in either chamber this year. Senate President Albritton made it known well before the session started that he was “super consistent” in standing with law enforcement, which, in the case of the Florida Sheriffs Association, has consistently as an organization opposed that policy change.  
And a proposal that would have extended concealed-carry rights to Florida colleges and universities (SB 814), filed by now-former Brevard County GOP Sen. Randy Fine, failed in committee, with Miami-Dade Republican Ileana Garcia joining three Democrats to reject the measure. The shootings at Florida State University last month didn’t help the cause.
Hands-free driving: Florida was behind the curve when it finally voted in 2019 law banning texting while driving. With widespread complaints that the way that law was written makes it essentially unenforceable, there’s been a push in the past few sessions for Florida to join the now 30 states with bans on handheld cellphones in autos, according to the Governors Highway Safety Association.
Southeast Republican Sen. Erin Grall’s proposal along these lines passed the full Senate on April 9. Its House companion, however, filed by Democrat Allison Tant, was never debated in either of the two committees it was assigned to this year.
Finally, SB 110, dubbed the Rural Renaissance, a top priority for Albritton, would steer infrastructure investments to rural parts of the state. Despite unanimous would support in the upper chamber, the House did not take it up during the 60 days lawmakers were in town. Instead, the $200 million bill will be a topic when lawmakers reconvene in the coming weeks.

The post Togwotee Pass grizzlies attract vexing highway hazard appeared first on WyoFile .","Grassy Wyoming roadsides can be enticing to grizzly bears, especially mothers with cubs, and many people can’t resist stopping to marvel at the charismatic critters. 
“Everybody wants to see a bear. That’s the picture you want to take home from your vacation,” said Wyoming Highway Patrol Sgt. Andy Jackson. 
Stopping to view wildlife can be done safely, but in the heat of the moment, the trooper has written tickets to motorists for stopping in the middle of the road, leaving their car doors flung open and standing a hundred yards down the highway to take pictures. 
“I ask them, ‘Would you do this where you live?’ And they go, ‘Well, no,’” Jackson said. “And I go, ‘Well why would you do it here?’”
As bears come out of hibernation, the snow melts and grass greens up along roadsides, Jackson and his colleagues with other local, state and federal agencies are gearing up to attempt to steer humans toward safer habits when it comes to viewing wildlife. 
Togwotee Pass tees up a particularly vexing mix of grizzlies, wildlife watchers, steep grades, blind corners, high speeds and troubling behavior. Local, state and federal agencies put out a joint call last week for people to follow “ethical wildlife viewing and photography practices” on Togwotee Pass. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Wyoming Game and Fish Department and U.S. Forest Service have jointly stepped up patrols and are asking the public to heed their directions to minimize traffic jams and ensure safety for humans and bears.

Retired U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service special agent Steve Stoinski knows what a hazardous — and sometimes volatile — mix can be found on Togwotee Pass after spending the summer of 2021 trying to solve the problem. Stoinski came out of retirement to work, under contract, for the Fish and Wildlife Service to intensively haze Grizzly 863, also known as Felicia, away from the roadside. Stoinski was already familiar with the grizzlies of Togwotee Pass, having previously investigated reports of drones harassing the federally protected threatened species. Although hazing briefly deterred the mother grizzly, Stoinski saw that it didn’t have a lasting effect. 
“The takeaways I had for managing grizzlies near the road,” he told WyoFile, “the bears are just going to hang out on the road.”
Roadside bears
Grizzlies have reasons to be next to the road, whether to forage for food or for their own safety, he said. Male grizzlies tend to stay away from the highway, and female grizzlies tend to avoid male grizzlies to protect their cubs, he said. 

“I only saw one boar griz that whole summer,” Stoinski recalled. “At that time, Felicia, Bear 863, she headed out of that area as soon as she got wind of that bear and bolted across the highway. We had to stop traffic to get her across the highway.” 
Wildlife managers no longer have Bear 863 marked, according to Game and Fish Large Carnivore Supervisor Dan Thompson. Out of an abundance of caution, Thompson didn’t want to say for certain whether the sow and two cubs frequenting the Togwotee Pass area this spring are Felicia and her offspring. 
“Over the years, we’ve started to wonder if 863 has turned into a different bear that just likes the road,” Thompson told WyoFile. 
Regardless, there’s a sow with two cubs that frequents the area. Game and Fish caught and marked one of the cubs last summer. 
“We definitely have a bear that is very observable, and it’s unfortunate we have to go back every year and remind everybody [of] etiquette and ethics when it comes to viewing them,” Thompson said. 

In recent weeks, state and federal agencies have reported significant bear jams and poor wildlife viewing ethics on Togwotee Pass, including people getting too close to bears. Never approach bears. People should maintain a distance of at least 100 yards from bears and wolves, and 25 yards from all other wildlife. (Jason Wilmot/U.S. Forest Service)
Ethical, and legal, viewing practices include not approaching bears, maintaining 100 yards between yourself and a bear, stopping in paved pullouts — not on the shoulder — and not feeding wildlife. Though Wyoming Highway Patrol typically responds to traffic complaints, they also get called to Togwotee Pass for confrontations over bear viewing. 
“At times, some of the Game and Fish, some of the biologists, get harassed by the people that are bear watching,” Trooper Jackson said. 
Already this spring, Thompson said, “we’ve had some pretty nasty confrontations from some members of the public, basically telling us we can’t tell them what to do.”
Human nature 
Those tensions motivated multiple agencies to come together to ask the public to follow directions from law enforcement and wildlife managers. 
Stoinski also got an earful from bear watchers and photographers in 2021 when he hazed bears away from the road. 
“They were pretty belligerent,” Stoinski said at the time. “They got in our faces, were poking me in the chest.”
But eventually, they overcame those initial conflicts and worked together to promote bear and human safety, he said.  
The Bridger-Teton National Forest is leaning heavily into education and cooperation to improve safety for bears and people on the highway, which is a designated scenic byway. 
Along with the Bear Wise Jackson Hole program and other agency partners, the national forest is asking “the public, photographers, and wildlife tour groups to lead by example.”  
“We get that there’s a lot of opportunities to see wildlife all over the forest,” Bridger-Teton spokeswoman Mary Cernicek said. As new vegetation sprouts along roadsides, attracting bears, “we’re so excited to see them and probably having unintended consequences.”

Originally, Togwotee didn’t see a heavy management presence along the highway, but as bear jams escalated, wildlife managers responded with attempts to change both bear and human behavior. Game and Fish still hazes grizzlies, when possible, away from the Togwotee highway.
“It’s been an ongoing effort to try to keep something worse from happening,” Thompson said. 
If it is Felicia along the road, she has been hit by a car before, he said. 
Last fall, world-famous Grizzly 399 was fatally struck by a vehicle on the highway through the Snake River Canyon south of Jackson. The matriarch bruin had raised her cubs roadside in Grand Teton National Park for nearly two decades. 
Visitors save up and come from around the world to see Wyoming wildlife — a phenomenon not limited to national parks.
Striking a balance 
In Wyoming, it’s illegal to park on the shoulder of a highway unless it’s an emergency, Trooper Jackson said, and people are supposed to use designated pullouts. But enforcing that law isn’t so easy.
He points to the hamlet of Wilson at the base of Teton Pass, where a moose can be seen most summer days from the shoulder of Highway 22. 
“All summer long, we get people stopping, taking a picture of the moose in Fish Creek,” Jackson said. Wyoming Highway Patrol fields frequent complaints from people who want the cars out of there. 
“And I’m going, ‘These people came 2,000 miles to see this,’” Jackson said. “We try to have a good balance of what’s common sense.” 
The Teton County Sheriff’s Office also enforces traffic laws and gets called to help out on Togwotee Pass. Sheriff Matt Carr said the county used to offer overtime pay to a deputy who lived in nearby Buffalo Valley to patrol the area more frequently. 
“The key problem is people stopping,” Carr said. “It’s really not the tourists as much as it is the professional photographers.”
Carr said he no longer has that deputy or the budget to help as much as the county has in the past. 
“We’re trying to watch budgets very seriously this year with the revenue losses we’re seeing from property tax reductions,” Carr said. 
Grizzly speed limit?
Looking back on his summer managing the mayhem in 2021, Stoinski sees human nature as a major driver of behavior that can’t be overlooked. 
“People coming from across the country to visit the parks, or to visit Wyoming, and they see a grizzly bear for the first time in their lives, they just can’t help but stop,” Stoinski said. “There’s got to be a balance between letting people enjoy the bears while they’re near the road without getting too close.”
One thing that authorities can control is the speed limit. For his part, Stoinski would like to see variable speed limits deployed when grizzlies are in the area and bear jams become unavoidable. 
“Maybe we ought to consider having a grizzly bear speed limit.”Steve Stoinski, retired USFWS Special agent 
Wyoming has variable speed limits for blizzards along the interstate, he noted. Why not take the concept for a test drive along Togwotee? 
“Maybe we ought to consider having a grizzly bear speed limit, you know when the bears are around the highway,” he said. “Slow traffic down just for people’s safety.”
Already, electronic signs posted along the highway tell people not to stop on the road to view bears.

While the rest of the state is deep into its unofficial festival season, about 75 incarcerated men take part in a rodeo that’s not your traditional apple pie, bucking broncos and fancy horses event.
Its critics describe it more like a sordid gladiator exhibition from peak Roman Empire times. They say this exploitation of inmates reflects outdated views on incarceration in Louisiana, a state where more than 1,000 of every 100,000 residents are behind bars according to the Promise of Justice Initiative.
But the rodeo also has its supporters – and some of the most ardent are the inmates who are part of the show. Reporter Piper Hutchinson attended the event last month and heard why they see the rodeo as a key part of positive prison culture. Read more about her visit to “The Wildest Show in the South.”

State attorneys general are urging concerned customers to delete their data, while experts warn that state and federal laws may not fully protect their privacy. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The fate of more than 15 million customers’ genetic data remains in limbo after popular DNA testing company 23andMe filed for bankruptcy in March. The data is up for sale, stoking fears about how it might be used and prompting attorneys general from more than a dozen states to warn 23andMe users: Delete your data.
  NC Attorney General Jeff Jackson (Photo: NCDOJ)
“Your genetic data is your most personal, confidential data, and you should be able to protect who has access to it,” North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson, a Democrat, said in a March statement.
“You have the power to delete your data now — please act quickly.”
Dr. Adam Brown, a Washington, D.C.-based emergency physician and the founder of a health care strategy firm, deleted his information on 23andMe as soon as he learned of the bankruptcy filing, he told Stateline.
For him, the bankruptcy begs a vital question that federal and state laws don’t fully address: What happens to your genetic data when the company holding it collapses?
Federal protections are flimsy. States have beefed up their genetic privacy laws in recent years, but many experts say they don’t go far enough.










There actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.


– Dr. Adam Brown, emergency physician and founder of a health care strategy company


23andMe has said the bankruptcy will not change how it stores, manages or protects its trove of sensitive customer information. In a news release issued shortly after the bankruptcy announcement, the company said any potential buyers would have to agree to comply with 23andMe’s consumer privacy policy and all applicable laws. When contacted by Stateline, the company declined to comment beyond what it has published in news releases and information it posted for customers on its website.
But once the data is in the hands of another company, that company could change its privacy policy at any time, experts noted.
“Once you get to the point of bankruptcy court, there may not be those same guarantees or the same ethos a new company may have around privacy protections for consumers,” Brown said.
“I want people to understand there actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.”
HIPAA doesn’t help
Companies such as 23andMe offer their users potentially game-changing revelations about their health and ancestry. The process is simple: Mail in a saliva sample and the company uses it to build an individual genetic profile that can reveal not only a person’s family connections, but also health insights such as their risk of developing a disease like cancer or Alzheimer’s.
This valuable personal data underpins a direct-to-customer genetic testing market that was valued at $1.93 billion globally in 2023 and is expected to grow, according to market research firm Grand View Research.
23andMe was an industry giant until its stock price plummeted following a massive 2023 data breach that affected the accounts of nearly 7 million customers. Then came the $30 million class-action lawsuit settlement.
The company declared bankruptcy in late March of this year, and announced it’s up for sale.
A flurry of alerts from state attorneys general around the country soon followed. AGs from states including Alabama, Arizona, California, Kentucky, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Texas issued similar press releases that recommended customers ask the company to delete their genetic profile and destroy the saliva sample used to create it.
“We have robust state privacy laws that include data deletion rights, and I would encourage any Texan concerned about their data to exercise the right to have their data securely deleted,” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, said in an April statement.
The fear is that a new 23andMe owner could choose to use or share sensitive personal genetic data in ways the company’s current privacy policy doesn’t allow. There’s worry it could be used, for example, to inflate people’s life insurance premiums or expose them to employment discrimination.
And there aren’t many guardrails to prevent that from happening.
HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, doesn’t apply to companies like 23andMe. The landmark federal law protects patients’ sensitive health information when it’s handled by doctors, hospitals and health insurers. But direct-to-customer companies such as 23andMe or Ancestry aren’t considered health care providers, and their non-invasive saliva collection kit isn’t considered a medical test.
The main federal law that protects people from discrimination based on their genetic information is nearly 20 years old. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) was passed in 2008, long before the rise of at-home testing kits. It applies to employers and health insurers, but not to life insurance companies, mortgage lenders and other non-health entities. And it doesn’t explicitly protect epigenetic information, which is information about the way a person’s genes — and by extension, health — are affected by outside factors such as smoking, disease or stress.
What states are doing
In the past five years, at least 14 states have passed laws regulating direct-to-consumer genetic testing offered by companies like Ancestry and 23andMe. There’s variation, but generally the laws require companies to get customers’ express consent before using or sharing their data, and allow customers to request their genetic data be deleted and biological samples destroyed.
It’s a good start, but doesn’t go far enough, said Anya Prince, a University of Iowa law professor whose research focuses on health and genetic privacy.
Many of those state efforts were built around a model law developed by the Coalition for Genetic Data Protection, an industry group with two member companies: 23andMe and Ancestry.
As DNA testing kits exploded in popularity and attracted increased scrutiny from lawmakers, the coalition pushed to influence legislation and set industry standards. The privacy protections in the laws mirror what 23andMe and Ancestry were already doing with their own privacy policies, experts say.
“They do have some really sensible privacy protections,” said Prince. “It’s great that people can delete their genetic data, and it’s great that law enforcement needs a warrant to access it. But if a privacy advocate had written a model law, there would be the potential for more and broader protections.”
For example, she said, many of the state laws address privacy requirements just for direct-to-consumer DNA testing companies. If 23andMe’s data is bought by, say, a pharmaceutical company, those state laws no longer apply.
The coalition now appears to be inactive, its website defunct.
Since 2020, more than a dozen states have passed some version of a genetic information privacy law, including Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming, based on a Stateline analysis. This year, the Indiana legislature passed a bill that’s now headed to the governor’s desk. Bills have been introduced this year in other states, including West Virginia.
Prince said state laws rely too heavily on consumers to self-manage their data privacy. They’re expected to understand a company’s policy, when studies have shown the public often doesn’t read privacy notices nor fully understand how companies use their data. Further, many state laws don’t address how third parties, such as law enforcement, can access and use consumer genetic data.
It’s also not always clear how the laws will be enforced, or who’s responsible for oversight.
“In general, I think there’s a disconnect between how people think their privacy is protected and how it’s actually protected,” she said.
But a few states have enacted laws that are more robust. California, for example, has a genetic information privacy law, but also has a general data protection law, as well as a state version of the federal GINA law that extends genetic anti-discrimination protections into areas including housing, education and licensing.
Florida has beefed up its DNA privacy laws in recent years, making the using or selling of an individual’s DNA without informed consent a felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison and up to a $10,000 fine. Florida was also the first state to prohibit life, disability and long-term care insurance companies from using genetic information to determine coverage.

The Kansas resident received 25 years with no chance of parole.
The reason? Jessica’s Law, which Kansas lawmakers passed in 2006.
Kansas was one of the first states to follow Florida’s initial enactment of Jessica’s Law 20 years ago in response to the rape and murder of 9-year-old Jessica “Jessie” Lunsford in Homosassa, Florida. Forty-four other states have followed, altering how America polices, punishes and paroles pedophiles.
Although the law differs in some details from state to state, it generally directs judges to sentence people convicted of sex crimes involving children to a minimum of 25 years. Jessica’s Law also monitors offenders’ movements after prison and strives to keep them away from places where children congregate, such as schools and parks.
Many policymakers, prosecutors, defense attorneys and judges have protested key aspects of the law. They are particularly opposed to its strict minimum sentencing guidelines, which they’ve described as oversimplified and counterproductive.
Proponents, however, point to the law’s origins: Jessica’s February 2005 abduction, rape and murder by a repeat, convicted sex offender. They maintain the crime, which riveted the country for months and sent the third grader’s father, Mark, on a national child protection crusade, exposed deep-seated flaws in law enforcement and the legal system that made children around the country vulnerable to sexual assault.
Jessica’s Law remains mostly intact throughout the country. But it has come under scrutiny and has undergone changes. As a journalism professor who directed a documentary about Lunsford’s efforts to persuade politicians to pass the law that bears his daughter’s name, I’ve kept up with its trials and tribulations.
Twenty years after Florida introduced the law, the jury is still out on whether America’s children are safer as a result.
 
‘Jessie’s Dad’
In making “Jessie’s Dad,” I filmed Lunsford visiting state capitals and Capitol Hill and interviewed many of his allies and detractors. I also reviewed interrogation footage and newsreels, attended the trial of John Couey — Jessica’s killer — and pored over proposed and passed bills, court transcripts and police records.
The resulting 2011 documentary highlights the law’s major perceived pros and cons.
The most glaring of the legal system’s shortcomings before Jessica’s Law, according to Lunsford and other activist groups, was lax treatment by the police and courts. That, they said, allowed many sex offenders who target children to roam free.
As Lunsford hopscotched from state to state to push for the law’s passage, he often noted that prior to raping and killing Jessie, Couey was convicted twice of molesting children but served only fractions of his sentences.
“One time they gave him (Couey) a 10-year sentence; he did two years,” Lunsford told me. “One time, he (Couey) broke into a house and assaulted a child, and he would’ve gotten more time had he stolen their silverware.”
Most of the states that have enacted Jessica’s Law direct judges to sentence child rapists to a minimum of 25 years in prison.
Besides mandatory minimum sentencing, most states that have passed Jessica’s Law require sex-offender parolees to wear a GPS monitor — something Couey never did.
Lunsford repeatedly pointed out that an electronic ankle bracelet, which tells the police the location of the person wearing it, could have led the police to Couey’s room in his sister’s trailer across the street from the Lunsford’s mobile home. That’s where Couey kept Jessie for three days before burying her alive in a backyard grave.
 
‘Romeo and Juliet’ provisions
In 2007, soon after Ohio passed its version of the law, Lunsford’s son Josh faced felony charges for fondling his 14-year-old girlfriend. The girl’s mother, who disapproved of their relationship, turned him in as soon as he turned 18 and became an adult in the eyes of the legal system. Josh ended up being charged with a misdemeanor, to which he pleaded guilty. He served 10 days in jail and 12 months under supervised release.
Reeling from this incident, the elder Lunsford advocated amending Jessica’s Law with so-called Romeo and Juliet provisions. These stipulations typically exempt most young adults from harsh sentencing when the age difference between them and their romantic teen partners adds up to fewer than four or five years.
Pennsylvania, the second state after Florida to pass Jessica’s Law in 2006, became the first to add a Romeo and Juliet provision in 2011.
Today, 44 states have likewise adopted similar provisions.
Legal challenges, too, have revamped parts of Jessica’s Law in some states. In 2015, for instance, California’s Supreme Court ruled the law violated the U.S. Constitution by infringing offenders’ liberty and privacy.
The law did so, the court determined, by universally ordering registered sex offenders to stay at least 2,000 feet away from schools and other places where children congregate. That meant they could not live within 2,000 feet of a school or places where children gathered.
Prior to the ruling, the Jessica’s Law residency restriction left many of California’s registered sex offenders with few viable housing options. It thus forced scores of them onto the streets and contributed to the Golden State’s homelessness crisis.
Critics have also noted it is difficult to monitor homeless pedophiles.
Although the California Supreme Court ruling technically applied only to San Diego County, it has spurred other parts of the state to restrict residency on a case-by-case basis.
 
Electronic tracking
Another divisive Jessica’s Law stipulation, however, may be too complex to simply modify.When included in the original Florida law, electronic tracking appeared to hold great promise.
Today, 38 additional states electronically monitor sex offenders. Yet many accused and paroled sex offenders wearing ankle bracelets have nonetheless harmed children.
For instance, David Renz broke free of his GPS monitor in 2013 while awaiting a child pornography trial in New York and raped a fourth grader. He also killed the 10-year-old girl’s protector and school librarian, Lori Bresnahan.
While others harmed children after cutting off their ankle bracelets, some, like Arkansas resident Leontarius Reed, committed sex crimes while wearing GPS devices. Reed was wearing the device after a previous nonsexual offense.
Critics claim electronic monitoring numbs society into a misleading state of comfort. Others argue it’s better than losing track of sex offenders. They also say it deters crime and has saved countless lives.
Despite the widespread adoption of Jessica’s Law, comprehensive research is still needed to measure its impact. Such a project would examine whether America’s children are truly safer now than they were on May 1, 2005.

Dick Anderson, R-Willow City, talks to a colleague on May 1, 2025, in the House chamber. (Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)A bill that intends to keep North Dakota on the forefront of rare earth mineral development is on its way to the governor after lengthy debate Friday. 
Rep. Dick Anderson, R-Willow City, the sponsor of House Bill 1459, said the bill is needed to position North Dakota for a facility to process rare earth minerals, which can be embedded with coal that is already slated for mining. He said there could be federal funding for such a facility.  
The bill passed the House 63-26 and then the Senate 27-19.
China supplies most of the rare earth minerals needed for electronics. Scott Meyer, R-Grand Forks, supported the bill in the interest of national security and not being reliant on China.
For many opponents, a major sticking point on the bill was language that set a royalty payment for mineral rights owners at 2.5% on the rare earth minerals found within a coal seam. That would be on top of the royalty payment that had been negotiated in the coal lease. 
Sen. Brad Bekkedahl, R-Williston, said the bill denies the rights of mineral owners to negotiate with coal companies.
“I would want to have the ability to negotiate another lease,” Bekkedahl said. 
Rare earth minerals seen as a rare opportunity in North Dakota

The Northwest Landowners Association, which represents property owners with coal leases, argued that the royalty provision was unconstitutional. 
Several House members agreed with that sentiment when the conference committee report was presented on the House floor Thursday morning. The bill was sent back to the conference committee for more work. 
Members of the conference committee said the royalty was in the best interest of mineral owners to ensure they get some compensation for the rare earth minerals. 
Sen. Dale Patten, R-Watford City, said the rare earth minerals are part of the coal. 
He said the royalty provision “is a way for that mineral owner to realize revenue,” and without it they may get nothing.

Patten noted that coal companies can make the legal argument that the coal leases already cover development of rare earth minerals. 
Language was added to the bill at the recommendation of Rep. Lawrence Klemin, R-Bismarck, who is an attorney, specifying that mineral owners and the coal companies could renegotiate the terms of the lease. 
Klemin said the change addressed some of his concerns but not all of them. He said the bill retroactively changing existing leasing was troubling. 
Anderson said the technology is improving to extract rare earth minerals from the ash of coal that has already been burned, known as fly ash. 
While that process is more expensive, he said if that happens, the mineral owners could get nothing. 
“If you get too greedy, you lose,” Anderson said in a conference committee meeting Friday. 
Rep. Todd Porter, R-Mandan, said litigation was “inevitable” but passing the bill helps frame the issues for the court system and “provides clarity and certainty to industry” that will make them more likely to invest in rare earth mineral processing in the state.

Craig Headland, R-Montpelier, speaks on the House floor during debate on a property tax bill on May 2, 2025. (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota House and Senate compromised on a property tax package Friday amounting to a $1,600 primary residence credit, more than triple the amount homeowners receive now.
But one House member said he plans to promote an initiated measure for the November 2026 ballot that would aim to cut taxes for other property types.
House Bill 1176, sponsored by Rep. Mike Nathe, R-Bismarck, and backed by Gov. Kelly Armstrong, passed on the final day of the session with a unanimous vote in the Senate and 86-4 vote in the House.
Lawmakers identified property tax reform as a top priority for the session after voters initiated a ballot measure last year that sought to eliminate property taxes based on assessed value. Although the measure failed, lawmakers said they heard from voters that they expect property tax cuts in the future.

The bill uses earnings from the state Legacy Fund to pay for the program, with the idea that lawmakers could consider even greater property tax relief in the future as the fund grows. Armstrong’s vision is that eventually most homeowners would be on a path to paying zero property taxes.
“This bill provides real relief and real reform for taxpayers,” Armstrong said in a statement Friday. “It’s responsible, affordable and durable. It creates Legacy Fund buy-in, and it’s the single most impactful thing we could do for North Dakota citizens this session.” 
The legislation also seeks to slow the growth of property tax increases with a 3% cap on how much local governments can increase the taxes annually.
The total amount of property tax relief in the package is estimated at $473 million for 2025-27, Tax Commissioner Brian Kroshus said. The bill also includes more money for a disabled veterans tax credit and a renters refund.
“This is truly a landmark bill when it comes to property taxes,” Nathe said after the conference committee agreed on a final version of the bill. “Probably historic.”
Donnell Preskey, government and public affairs specialist for the North Dakota Association of Counties, said counties were not in favor of the caps, but the bill includes an opt-out provision that would allow residents in a taxing district to vote to be exempted from the caps for four years.
“That’s one of the elements we worked really hard to get in there,” Preskey said. She added there are still concerns about what local budgets will look like with 3% caps over the next two years.
She said the association hopes to educate counties on the new property tax rules, how it will impact their budgets and some of the flexibility options available.
The bill also caps how much school districts can raise property taxes. It contains a provision that if the cap on schools forces some districts to drop below the state-mandated local education contribution level, the Department of Public Instruction would administer gap funding to make the districts whole. An additional $30 million is set aside for that gap funding.
  Rep. Scott Louser, R-Minot, speaks on the House floor during debate on a property tax bill on May 2, 2025. (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)
Lawmakers removed a so-called “skin-in-the-game” provision the Senate advanced that would have required homeowners to pay at least 25% of their property tax bill. The Legislature defeated two other property tax proposals that also would have benefited owners of agricultural land, commercial property and centrally assessed properties. 
Rep. Scott Louser, R-Minot, sponsored House Bill 1168, a competing property tax bill that would have had the state pay 100% of public school funding as a way to deliver property tax relief. Louser said he plans to advance that proposal through an initiated measure. He said he plans to gather signatures with the goal of getting it on the November ballot.
“I was taught to always fight for what I believe in and, members of the assembly, this may be something you believe in, too,” Louser said.
Rep. Craig Headland, R-Montpelier, chairman of the House Finance and Taxation Committee, expressed frustration with the potential ballot measure.
“For a legislator to come on and talk about how he’s going to lead a petition because he doesn’t like the outcome of the property tax relief that the majority of the assembly decided was the way to go is a bit over the top,” Headland said.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)The Florida Legislature went home from their 60-day legislative session on Friday night without passing a budget, but did vote to extend the regular session until June 6, or until they complete their work.
The Senate and House voted on a resolution (HCR 1631) that lists 16 bills that they will consider when they return, likely beginning in the week of May 12, with only bills related to the budget on the agenda.
Senate President Ben Albritton said on the floor of the Senate that the House and Senate had reached a framework for a budget plan, which will include $2.8 billion in tax relief, “the most historic tax relief package in the history of our state.”
“Floridians expect and deserve a balanced budget that reduces state spending, lowers per capita spending, and reduces the growth of state bureaucracy,” he said. “I am committed to working with our partners in the Florida House to pass a budget that reduces debt, accounts for significant, broad-based tax relief, and maintains historic state reserves for emergencies.”
There remains about a $4 billion gap between the proposed budgets passed by the House and Senate last month. The new fiscal year opens on July 1.
Friday’s session included several hour-long breaks sprinkled throughout the day as lawmakers worked to prepare bills that could still win approval in both chambers. In some cases, they couldn’t find common ground, and those bills died on the floor.
Hurricane recovery
One measure they did pass on Friday (SB 180) is aimed at strengthening hurricane relief and recovery and enhance response efforts in Florida. Pinellas County Republican Nick DiCeglie, the bill sponsor, cited the ways local governments in his district handled (or mishandled) recovery efforts following the devastating one-two punch of Hurricanes Helene and Milton last fall.
The bill prohibits local governments from increasing building permit or inspection fees for six months after a hurricane or tropical storm emergency declared by the governor or federal government.
It requires local governments to develop post-storm permitting plans that provide for special building permits and inspection procedures. It also says that local governments must ensure sufficient personnel are prepared and available post-storm for “expeditious building inspections, permitting and enforcement tasks.
Local governments must lay out multiple locations where building permit services will be offered in person during regular business hours at a minimum.
“Multiple major hurricanes ravaged Florida last year, leaving extensive damage statewide,” said DiCeglie.
“After a storm, Floridians need a clear path to recovery. We’re fighting for families to focus on rebuilding without additional delays or burdens, especially for those who sustained damage or lost their homes. Working with our state and local emergency responders, we can streamline restoration efforts and improve emergency response coordination, fortifying and strengthening our communities before the next storm.”
Earlier in the day, the Senate quickly voted on one of the most controversial bills of the session — making it more difficult for citizens to place constitutional amendments on the state ballot. The two chambers had bounced the bill back and forth between them for three days before passing it mostly along party lines (with newly independent Sen. Jason Pizzo joining the Republicans in supporting it).
The Senate voted final passage at 1:44 p.m. The governor signed it at 7:57 p.m., according to legislative records.
“The Speaker said that good things come to those who wait,” said House Democratic Leader Fentrice Driskell. “Well, Floridians have been waiting an awful long time, and they want us to get property insurance costs under control. They want us to make sure that they have housing affordability, affordable healthcare costs.”

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)On Friday, the Alaska Senate’s finance committee finished work on a draft state operating budget for the coming year and sent the draft ahead to a vote of the full Senate.
Senators is scheduled to begin debating amendments on Monday, with a vote on the draft expected later in the week.
The committee’s draft is $384 million less than a version passed by the House in April and $1.7 billion less than Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s proposal for the fiscal year that starts July 1 and runs through June 30, 2026.
Most of the cuts came from the 2025 Permanent Fund dividend. Dunleavy proposed a payout of about $3,900 per recipient, and the House reduced that to about $1,400. The Senate’s latest draft has it at $1,000.
The budget arrived in the finance committee with a substantial deficit, and it leaves with a surplus of between $100 million and $200 million, using only numbers in various budget bill drafts to date.
That surplus is almost certainly an illusion, the committee’s two leading members warned.
Sens. Lyman Hoffman, D-Bethel, and Bert Stedman, R-Sitka, said that lawmakers next year are likely to face a significant deficit, somewhere between $300 million and $600 million at current estimates.
“We argue that this is sort of a transitional budget, getting prepared for the headwinds that we’re going to face,” Hoffman said.
The upcoming budget is based on a state forecast from March that predicts North Slope oil prices will average $68 per barrel in the coming fiscal year. Since that forecast was released, futures markets have plummeted, so much so that the Department of Revenue later approached the co-chairs with concerns, Hoffman said. When spending exceeds revenue, lawmakers must make up for it with a supplemental budget bill in the next legislative session.
“It may be as low as $64, which will mean a potential supplemental (bill), if that’s the case, of an additional $150 million, estimated,” Hoffman said.
On top of that are several large union contracts that remain under negotiation. Pay and benefit increases are expected after a salary survey found significant numbers of state employees are underpaid. 
“They may be between $100 million and $300 million,” Hoffman said.
Then add the federal government programs cut because of DOGE, Hoffman said. That White House office has been slashing federal programs and spending. If the state were to lose 5% of its federal funding, keeping programs alive would cost as much as $300 million.
Then there’s fire season to consider, he added.
“If it’s higher than an average year, which may happen, we could see a substantial hit on the state’s coffers. So you know, I and others in the Senate are concerned,” Hoffman said. 
He added that there’s yet another area of concern.
“We’re using north of $100 million in one-time funds in this year’s budget that aren’t going to be available next year,” Hoffman said. “So that is why we may have a gap of between $300 million and $600 million next year.”
Legislators have removed the possibility of closing the budget gap with new revenue — opposed by some key House members — or spending from savings, opposed by Senate leaders who say it wouldn’t be sustainable. 
Stedman referred to the temporary budget surplus as a “buffer” that likely would be consumed by expected cost increases. “We’re a little cautious,” Stedman said.
Some of that buffer could be consumed later this year as members of the House negotiate with the Senate on a budget compromise that integrates parts of the Senate and House drafts.
Stedman said he hopes there will be few items added back into the budget.
“The fact of the matter is,” Hoffman said, “at some point, the message needs to be that we can’t continue as we are.”

May Day is recognized by many countries and organizations as International Workers Day, and hundreds of thousands of people across the U.S. and the world took to the streets to protest, with many condemning the Trump administration, the administration’s aggressive rhetoric toward other countries, fears of global economic turmoil, and hostility toward immigrants’ rights. 
In Alaska, protests took place in at least 21 communities according to reports on social media, on Thursday and others planned through the weekend, from the Arctic region to Southeast Alaska. 
Organizers in several communities spoke with the Alaska Beacon after rallies wrapped up on Thursday, and expressed hope in the unified protest effort and great concern for the impacts of firing federal workers and threatened cuts to essential services, like health care. 
In Petersburg, an estimated 75 people rallied downtown around noon, according to Chelsea Tremblay, one of the organizers with the community group, Petersburg Friends and Neighbors. She said speakers focused on the importance of workers rights, and demonstrators called on Alaska’s congressional delegation to do more, “to stand up for our communities and to keep the separation of powers strong,” she said. “By fighting for the funds that have been allocated to come to our communities, and to stop the loss of jobs.”

Tremblay said Petersburg has been impacted by the federal firings and budget cuts to the U.S. Forest Service in the Tongass National Forest, Head Start, and the end of federal telework options, as well as particular concern around further cuts to the National Weather Service. “That’s a safety issue, right? Or potential funds being withheld from public broadcasting that have already been dedicated, but that’s how people stay connected with the community when they’re out on the boats,” she said. 
She said the group also raised funds for local homelessness services. “We’re stronger together,” she added. “So it feels good to be in solidarity with so many other communities.” 
In the Matanuska-Susitna Borough, an estimated 200 people gathered for a rally in Wasilla, said organizer Dave Musgrave, with the activist group Mat-Su United for Progress. “This was really to lift up unions, and show that we are standing with working families,” he said.
There were speeches, a hot dog roast and a live band that played union songs. “And then people stood along Parks Highway with their signs protesting various things from the (Trump) administration. I’d say the overwhelming concern was the threat to democracy, and our Constitution.”

Musgrave said Mat-Su residents are deeply concerned about federal cuts, particularly any proposed cuts to health care through Medicaid, as about one-third of all Alaska residents rely on the program. 
“That includes pregnant women, that includes single adults, it includes kids,” through the related Denali KidCare program, he said. “And the fallout is going to be for all Alaskans, because it’s not just those on Medicaid. This will cripple our health care system, including hospitals, medical clinics – our whole medical infrastructure is under threat right now.”
On the Kenai Peninsula in Soldotna, organizer Michele Vasquez with the activist group Many Voices said residents are also extremely concerned about job cuts and threats to health care, including for those whose jobs don’t provide them with insurance.
“The folks in between. They work. They work one, two, three jobs, but they’re still working, and they’re still on Medicaid,” she said. “So the impacts to Alaska overall could be very, very devastating.” She said the region is feeling the impacts of job losses, and threatened cuts to services like libraries and public radio sow more uncertainty. “There have been a lot of devastating losses of jobs, and any loss of jobs in Alaska is detrimental.” 
The May Day rally drew an estimated 140 people in Soldotna Creek Park, she said, “in support of workers, union and nonunion.” She said speakers highlighted the importance of supporting disability rights, reproductive health care, and uniting together to push back against the Trump administration. The crowd also raised funds and gathered donations for the local food bank.

Vasquez said some Republicans and Trump voters have joined their protest events over the last month. “Surprisingly,” she said, “It was just shocking to me that they were willing to admit it. And I don’t mean that in a bad way. I think it depends on who they are, what their status is,” she said.
“Mainly, I’ve talked to seniors who are of all political stripes, who are terrified of losing Medicare, of losing their Social Security or their veterans benefits. My husband and I fall into that category, so I can clearly understand why everyone would be fearful,” she said, adding her husband is a retired veteran and disabled. 
“All across political spectrums, we’re all a little scared,” Vasquez said. “Because they’re worried, you know? We’re worried about what happens to our house if we can’t make the mortgage payments? What if we can’t buy food? It’s just, it’s kind of a commonality.”
In Talkeetna, organizer Sandra Loomis said a group of 54 people rallied for May Day, and to protest the Trump agenda. “We marched down Main Street and got a nice picture right there on the river, where you can see Denali behind and did a nice chant, ‘8647,’” she said, referring to the anti-Trump chant to “86,” or reject, the 47th president. 
“People are fed up and just tired of this, all this open corruption from the White House,” Loomis said. “And taking away all our services, taking away our libraries, taking away research, taking away our rights, taking away economic equity. People are fed up and tired of it. It’s way, way, way beyond the pale, and too far, and the blatant disregard of the Constitution and the Supreme Court orders.”

Loomis said Talkeetna residents are also concerned around the federal firings, cuts to programs like Medicaid and the recent cut to Americorps. She expressed outrage and frustration at the Trump administration threatening the press, law firms and universities. Of special concern was Trump’s recent refusal to acknowledge that an image of alleged gang tattoos on a man deported to El Salvador was Photoshopped, “blatantly lying to everyone, right to our faces and like, we know they’re lying!” 
She said the actions go against the core values and principles that the country was founded on. “My family, multiple generations of my family, have fought for the freedoms that we’ve enjoyed,” she said. “One of the things that has made America such an amazing place to live — it’s because we have diversity. It’s because we accept all religions and respect each other.” 
In Juneau, roughly 400 people gathered in front of the Alaska State Capitol, despite the rain, for speeches, calls to protect workers, unions and essential social services, and a performance by the Woosh.ji.een Dance Group. “Get up! Get down. Juneau is a union town!” the crowd chanted, before marching to Marine Park by the cruise ship dock. They also collected donations for the Southeast Alaska Food Bank.  
Organizers said residents are continuing to make regular calls and emails to the state’s congressional delegation, particularly U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who they said has been responsive to their concerns. 
Different groups nationally have said the next national day of action is a People’s Parade planned for June 14, Flag Day.

Initial reactions to the order from the Nebraska federal delegation have been mixed.,"The headquarters of Nebraska Public Media on the University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s East Campus. (Courtesy of Nebraska Public Media)LINCOLN — President Donald Trump signed an executive order late Thursday seeking to end federal funding for public media. 
It marks the White House’s latest escalation in its political battle with the media, as Trump and some congressional Republicans fulfill a pledge to cut funding to the organizations. Unlike other executive orders that he signed in public ceremonies, Trump signed this one behind closed doors, while flying on Air Force One, Politico reported. 
Initial reactions to the order from the Nebraska all-Republican federal delegation have been mixed. U.S. Reps. Mike Flood, who represents eastern Nebraska’s 1st Congressional District, echoed Trump’s criticisms of NPR’s national bias but defended the unique value Nebraska Public Media provides locally. U.S. Rep. Adrian Smith, who represents the largely rural 3rd District and U.S. Sens. Deb Fischer and Pete Ricketts had no immediate comment Friday. U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, who represents the Omaha-based 2nd District, highlighted how crucial Nebraska Public Media remains to the state. 
Gov. Jim Pillen also offered no immediate comment through a spokeswoman while visiting Washington, D.C., to see the president this week. If Trump’s order withstands promised legal challenges, PBS could lose nearly 15% of its annual revenue and NPR could lose 1% of its budget. While federal funding is a fraction of the budget for the national independent public news organizations, federal funding does help smaller, often rural, local affiliate stations of both afford to operate in places the free market might not serve as well. 
Closer to home, the impact could be significant. Nebraska Public Media could lose up to 16% of its annual budget, which could put essential services at risk, including emergency alert systems. The timing creates a budget hole that the state might be hard-pressed to fill during a budget shortfall.

Trump’s order calls for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, a private nonprofit corporation authorized by Congress to receive federal funds and distribute them to support public broadcasting, to “cancel existing direct funding to the maximum extent allowed by law and … decline to provide future funding” to the news organizations.
“Which viewpoints NPR and PBS promote does not matter,” the order reads. “What does matter is that neither entity presents a fair, accurate or unbiased portrayal of current events to taxpaying citizens.” 
Trump also has claimed that NPR and PBS produce “biased and partisan news coverage.” 
The heads of NPR and PBS have defended their federal funding and coverage before a U.S. House Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, subcommittee meeting in March.
Bacon said, “he respects the great job that NPR and PBS have done in Nebraska.” 
Congress allocates more than $500 million annually to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and specifies its intended use. The funding is administered in two-year cycles, scheduled in advance, a structure designed to shield public media from political pressure. 
CPB officials questioned the legitimacy of the president’s new order. The private nonprofit is already suing the Trump administration over another executive order seeking to fire three of its five board members.
PBS and NPR have called the order unlawful, saying it infringed on the freedom of the press. Both plan to challenge it in court. 
Order ‘limits Nebraska Public Media’
Nebraska Public Media, which is responsible for all public TV and radio stations in the state, receives approximately $4 million in federal funding, representing roughly 16% of its annual budget. NPM General Manager and CEO Stacey Decker said that while the station is still evaluating the impacts of Trump’s latest executive order, NPM is “deeply disappointed.” 
“It limits Nebraska Public Media’s ability to make independent and locally focused decisions about the programming and resources we provide to Nebraskans,” Decker’s statement reads.  “It also severs the strong local-national partnership that is the backbone of public media, delivering trusted, valued and essential programming and services to all Americans.”
The state funds roughly 44% of the NPM budget, according to information published on the NPM website. Nebraska Public Media is tasked with live-streaming the legislative session and public hearings on bills. NPM also is among the few Nebraska news organizations staffing the State Capitol with reporters daily during the session. 
“Even during this challenging time, we are steadfast in our commitment to provide every Nebraskan with trusted, valued and essential programs and services,” Decker said. “Just as we have for more than 70 years.” 
NPM’s ‘unique value’
Flood said the Trump executive order is “an opportunity for America to scrutinize the work of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to stop the liberal bias that has infected National Public Radio, and to rethink how federal funding works for local public broadcasting networks.” 
But Flood, who runs his own private media company that includes News Channel Nebraska,  emphasized Nebraska public media’s “unique value” for rural communities in the state and how it “operates independently of CPB.”

“[NPM] is the backbone of our state’s emergency alert system, and they have gone all-in on delivering quality coverage of youth sports,” Flood said. 
Nebraska Public Media broadcasts and streams local high school and college sports, including from the Nebraska School Activities Association and the University of Nebraska and Creighton University. It also issues essential vital alerts for severe storms and other emergencies. A cut in federal funding could jeopardize those services, according to the NPM website. 
Flood added that he would “ensure [Nebraska] public broadcasting network remains strong” by visiting with NPM leaders to discuss how the order impacts them. 
The Legislature’s Appropriations Committee has a proposal to increase the funding of the Nebraska Educational Telecommunications Commission, the state agency responsible for overseeing and licensing the public television and radio stations that make up Nebraska Public Media, for the next two years. 
Still, the state budget shortfall has grown by $190 million, and lawmakers have less than a month to balance the budget. The committee this week made attempts to close the gap by taking another $135 million from cash funds held by various state agencies and reducing the funding state agencies would get for the next two years.
If NPM loses funding, Bacon said, their “absence” would “leave a void.”

On April 25, the House voted 37-0 to approve a resolution calling for readiness.
House Joint Resolution 15, by Rep. Ky Holland, I-Anchorage, is slated for a hearing on Friday in the Senate Resources Committee.
“House Joint Resolution 15 came about from an early awareness this winter about the very dry conditions that we were witnessing in Southcentral Alaska,” said Holland, speaking to the House.
“A really key part of this resolution is a recognition of how important it is that we do the outreach and we encourage the preparation by residents to be able to be more aware of what they can do to protect their own homes through the Firewise program,” he said.
He added that it’s particularly important for Alaskans to be aware that many of the state’s residential areas have a single way in and out.
“That single route is all that’s going to be available for both our fire response apparatus to get in, as well as for anyone who’s trying to evacuate to get out,” he said. “And we only have to look back at some very tragic, large fires we’ve seen in the last five years that have been exacerbated by these problems of the limited ingress and egress routes to realize how important it is for us to assess those areas.”

A Williams County child who was not vaccinated is believed to have contracted the illness from an out-of-state visitor, the department said Friday. The child is in isolation at home.
Health officials are contacting people who may have had contact with the child and advising people who are not vaccinated to quarantine.
The threat to the public is low due to a majority of North Dakotans being vaccinated against the disease, according to the department.
Molly Howell, immunization director for HHS, said vaccination is the most effective defense against contracting measles.
“Measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccination is safer than risking measles illness,” Howell said. “The MMR vaccine has been safely used in the United States since 1973.”
Symptoms of measles include fever, cough, runny nose, eye irritation followed by a body-wide rash.
“Anyone with symptoms consistent with measles should call ahead before visiting a clinic to avoid exposing others,” she said.
The department said there is no specific medical treatment for measles, but antibiotics may be used in cases that have developed a secondary bacterial infection.  
People who were vaccinated as children and adults born before 1957 are considered protected.
The department said two doses of the MMR vaccine are about 97% effective at preventing infection. The vaccine is recommended for children at 12-15 months and a booster between 4-6 years old.
The department also recommends that families and individuals consult with their health care provider to discuss immunizations.
North Dakota has an 81% MMR vaccination rate among toddlers, and a 90% rate among kindergarten students for the 2024-2025 school year. 
According to public health data, a 95% vaccination rate is generally needed to prevent wider spread in communities.

(Photo provided by Brian Gabriel)Last summer, a quiet revolution unfolded on the shores of the Kenai Peninsula. A group of setnet fishermen — barred and facing economic ruin from their traditional fishery to protect dwindling king salmon — stepped into a new role: scientific collaborators. Testing set-beach seines as an alternative to gillnets, they proved something remarkable. Not only did they catch abundant sockeye; but, without exception, every king salmon encountered swam away unharmed.  
This wasn’t just conservation — it was partnership. These fishermen didn’t just follow protocols; they refined them in real time, applying generations of knowledge about tides, fish behavior, and gear mechanics. The results? A resounding proof of concept that protecting kings and harvesting sockeye need not be mutually exclusive.  
Yet today, this breakthrough risks becoming a footnote. The Alaska Board of Fisheries insists more data is needed before expanding the program — a cautious stance that ignores both the urgency of the crisis and the ingenuity at hand. Here’s what they’re missing: This experiment isn’t just about science. It’s about survival — for fish and fishermen alike. 
Two tests, one solution
The set-beach seine trials face twin imperatives:  

 Biological success – does it spare kings? Early data: emphatically yes.  
 Economic viability – can fishermen earn a living doing it? Unknown — to be determined.  

This second question is where bureaucracy fails. The options being considered by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game for the continued experiments treat economic outcomes as an afterthought, as if conservation can succeed without buy-in from those who work the water. Setnet families have already sacrificed their fishery for kings. Now they’re being financially pressed even more as they strive to build its replacement. The board recently failed to take prudent action. Despite conclusive data, it failed to adopt a viable regulation, asked that more data be collected, and yet refused, when asked by fishermen, to provide any enabling guidelines to the Department of Fish and Game regarding how to proceed to gather that data.  The confusion created by the board has left the department in a delicate predicament: stating it can issue permits but must restrict, or even prohibit  the sale of fish — which flies in the face of common sense, not to mention, elementary economics! 
A ready workforce, a wasting opportunity
The solution is staring us in the face. Work with the fishermen who have brought this concept to the table. Implement their creative solutions to expand the study and allow the sale of fish sufficient to recover the expenses of doing the hard work of continuing the set-beach seine study. Six to eight permit holders working in groups for the next two seasons could definitively:   

increase by many times the data on live king release success and  survival;  
pioneer efficiency tweaks only fishers would spot; and  
document real-world methods to use, problems to solve, costs and profits — the make-or-break metrics. 

Without this, we’re conducting half an experiment. If the economics don’t work, this is just academic theater. We’ve got the skills to make it viable. But for that to happen, we would have to be given the chance.  
The clock is ticking
Every summer without action deepens two crises:  

ecological – kings continue to decline while a proven alternative gathers dust and  
human – fishing families sell permits, leave the industry and take their irreplaceable knowledge with them.  

Gov. Mike Dunleavy and Fish and Game Commissioner Doug Vincent-Lang could:  

 Issue six to eight experimental set-beach seine permits to organized fishermen groups. Action would have to be taken now; there is little time left for the fishermen to prepare for this vital work this season. 
 Allow the commercial sale of sockeye catch by the fishermen to pay for the cost of doing the work and demonstrate the true viability for the future.  
 Formalize co-management, embedding fisher expertise in study design.  

This isn’t about relaxing conservation — it’s about accelerating it with the people who matter most. The kings need allies. The fishermen are ready. All they need is permission to get back to work.

(Photo courtesy of the House of Representatives)In a near-unanimous vote, the Florida House gave final approval Friday to a bill tightening restrictions against state employees’ participation in political campaigning.
The bill, HB 1445, is narrower than what the Florida House first proposed. The lower chamber wanted to bar state employees from soliciting contributions for political parties, committees, or candidates during working hours.
The Senate changed that language, replacing it to prohibit contribution solicitations that are coercive, explicitly stating that state employees suggesting someone make a political donation is OK under the bill.
The language lawmakers agreed upon also stops state employees from participating in any political campaign, not just those for elective offices, when they’re supposed to be working.
Throughout the legislative session, the involvement by state officials in Gov. Ron DeSantis’ political campaign against last year’s failed ballot initiatives to legalize recreational marijuana and restore abortion access prompted legal challenges came under scrutiny.
The move to restrict politicking from state employees came after NBC News first reported that state employees in the governor’s office called lobbyists to request donations for a political committee aligned with DeSantis as he and First Lady Casey DeSantis hinted that she was considering a run for governor.
Although the proposal from Republicans Rep. Debbie Mayfield of Melbourne and Sen. Erin Grall of Vero Beach is on its way to the governor’s desk, DeSantis has already said he would veto it.
“They’re pulling it out of their rear ends and trying to jam it through this process. Over my veto pen,” DeSantis said of the proposal during an April 15 press conference in Pensacola.
DeSantis’ main criticism of the bill at the time involved a provision requiring agency heads to live in Tallahassee, which the governor referred to as a “swamp.” However, the final version cuts off reimbursement for agency heads to travel to Tallahassee. For example, state Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo lives in Pinellas County.
Final passage of HB 1445 came well into the evening of the 60th day of the legislative session and with little debate. Mayfield reminded the chamber that the sole vote against the bill when the chamber first passed it on April 16 came from Delray Beach Republican Rep. Michael Caruso, a staunch DeSantis ally.
Caruso was also the sole vote against the bill on Friday.
Two provisions that remained intact in the compromise between the House and Senate require people appointed to universities’ boards of trustees and the board that oversees Florida’s public higher education institutions to live in the state or have graduated from the specific school they serve, or from any state university for the statewide board.

May 2, 2025. (Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — Construction is expected to begin this fall on the new La Plaza de la Raza, a pocket many call the heartbeat of South Omaha’s historic commercial district.
But that’s just the start of a $25 million-plus public investment on the main business corridor of a community known historically as a landing place for the state’s immigrant population.
Leaders of the Adelante II initiative gathered Friday at the 24th and N Streets plaza and offered a progress report, this time sharing a stage with a host of elected officials and business representatives and reinforcing a theme of collaboration.
“Together we’re bringing the heart of our community forward — adelante,” said Itzel Lopez, CEO of the Latino Economic Development Council, a lead partner on the project.

Currently a paved parking lot that shifts to fiesta grounds on certain occasions, the plaza is to be transformed via a $25 million state award from the North and South Omaha recovery grant program. Its projected opening is in 2027.
Douglas County and the City of Omaha each committed $500,000 from pandemic funds to the effort as well.
Key features include an amphitheater, stage, playground areas, open lawn, shaded family gathering area and signature art. 
The plaza makeover is the anchor of the Adelante initiative, which includes other components:

Before the year’s end, project leaders expect to have secured a site in the district for a multi-tier parking garage, with ground floor retailers, that will more than replace parking currently at the plaza lot. 
Following that will come new sidewalk, streetscape and wayfinding improvements along the main 24th Street corridor to help create a uniform vibe from Q to F Streets, Lopez said.

Lopez said her organization is hoping to raise additional funds for other improvements to the corridor, including a building that would house the LEDC, employment and other programming.
Overseeing the Adelante II redevelopment is Canopy South, a nonprofit that calls itself a “community quarterback.” 
In addition to the 24th Street area improvements, Canopy South is leading the Q Street Collaborative initiative, which received a separate $39 million from the North and South Omaha recovery grant program for several other projects in South Omaha. 
In all, the Nebraska Department of Economic Development in January 2024 awarded 130 groups and businesses a total of nearly $235 million through the North and South Omaha grant program. 
Cesar Garcia, CEO of Canopy South, said the City of Omaha is handling the acquisition of Adelante’s new garage site that is to offer parking for shoppers and workers of the area. He said choices have been narrowed to a few and negotiations are ongoing.
He said the plaza is a city-owned public space and will remain so once the plaza is revamped. Programming at the plaza likely will be a collaboration between the city and community organizations, Garcia said, though details are being worked out.

Also speaking at the Friday event was Douglas County Board Chair Roger Garcia; Omaha Mayor Jean Stothert; Omaha Public Power District CEO Javier Fernandez; South Omaha Business Improvement District President Ross Pesek; Nebraska Department of Economic Development’s Javier Saldaña and LEDC President Armando Salgado.
Nebraska State Sen. Dunixi Guereca, former State Sen. Tony Vargas and Mexican Consul Jorge Ernesto Espejel Montes were among several dozen people who gathered at the plaza for entertainment by Mariachi music and dancers. 
Among others were City Councilmen Pete Festersen and Ron Hug;  U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb.; Denise Powell, who has announced her candidacy for Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District as a Democrat; merchants and community members.
“The Latino community is at the heart of South Omaha’s story, and today we celebrate that legacy,” said Canopy South’s Garcia, stressing that the improvements are for all of Omaha and tourists to enjoy. 
“This is about investing in places that create the future we want for generations to come.”

Seven candidates are competing for the Democratic Party of Georgia chair and plan to deliver speeches in Atlanta seeking support for their bid to lead a party that recently enjoyed historical success with two Democratic senators winning the 2020 election as well as the state’s pivotal role in putting former President Joe Biden in the White House.
The field of candidates hoping to lead Georgia Democrats includes Gwinnett County state Sen. Nabilah Islam Parkes, former Augusta Mayor Hardie Davis and Rome City Councilwoman Wendy Davis, and perceived frontrunner Charley Bailey, a former candidate for attorney general and lieutenant governor.
The current party chair Matthew Wilson said Democrats are excited about the state committee meeting on Saturday. 
He said they have seven great candidates running for chair, a treasurer’s race, and other votes to determine key strategies. 
“The party is primed to stand up against Republican policies rolling out from Washington, D.C.“The benefit to being a big tent party like the Democratic Party is  that we have lots of different voices from all corners of the political spectrum. We’ve got conservatives, we have moderates, we have liberals, we have progressives, and it is going to be a big job for the new chair to make sure that we are united moving forward in a strategy that centers, again, what matters most, and that’s electoral victories,” Wilson said.
The 2026 election will include races for the 236-member General Assembly, U.S. Senate as well as constitutional officers including governor after Republican Brian Kemp is ineligible for a third term.
University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock said there is a built-in advantage for incumbent state officials since 2023 legislation allows top Georgia lawmakers to set up their own political action committees during the legislative session.
Democrats have signaled the importance of the next chair by making it a full-time role, especially with many statewide positions and key Senate races up for grabs in Georgia, Bullock said.
The success of Democratic candidates will depend on their ability to coalesce behind a strong candidate and avoid bitter primaries, he said. 
“Its potentially going to be a big year in Georgia giving  Democrats a shot at winning some of the statewide constitutional offices,”. “They haven’t won an open seat statewide constitutional office in this century.”
Bailey is the perceived favorite to become the next party chair because he has experience running in statewide elections and an ability to rally donors by not having certain skeletons that would be easy for Republicans to take advantage of, Bullock said.
“He can learn from the challenges that he had to overcome as a candidate,” Bullock said. “ He is advising others who maybe have not had the kind of scrutiny that a person gets when they start running statewide so he can give advice in terms of here’s some things you don’t want to say you believe in.”
Brian Robinson, a Georgia Republican strategist, said Democratic candidates will need to overcome the perception that Georgia is well-run by Republicans. Democrats could sway voters by taking advantage of national issues such as Trump’s poor approval ratings on the economy as he’s followed through on plans to impose steep tariffs. 
A new Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll found that a majority of registered Georgia voters currently disapprove of Trump’s policies on the economy, tariffs, NATO and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion programs. The poll, however, revealed the support for Trump’s policies were sharply partisan, with 85% of surveyed Republicans approving compared to 97% of Democrats opposed.
“Republicans in Georgia are going into 2026 with a lot of things out of their control,” Robinson said.  They’re going to  nee focus on the things they can control: get out to vote, raise money, and pick candidates who can win. But we know that there’s a headwind for the party in the White House.”
“If Trump’s approval rating is the low 40s or high 30s, that’s a prime opportunity for Democrats in the state, if they can have discipline to pick good candidates who don’t scare the middle, don’t scare independents, and can win (support) from some swing voters in the metro Atlanta area,” Robinson said.
The big question for 2026 is whether Kemp enters the GOP field of potential challengers to Ossoff’s re-election bid.
“Is Brian Kemp heads and tails the best choice for Republicans as the most competitive candidate?” Robinson asked. “Yes, absolutely and anybody who says different is not a serious person to talk about politics.”
“But that second tier of GOP candidates will become the first tier at that juncture,” Robinson said. “They will get nominated, and they will have a lot of money behind them from a lot of organizations.”
State Senate Minority Leader Harold Jones, an Augusta Democrat, said the next party chair needs to be able to work closely with the local parties. 
“I think the key is to work with the county parties and make sure you have a good brand name as far as 2026 is concerned,” the Augusta Democrat said. “ I think all of them are basically committed to that.”
Sandy Springs Democratic Sen. Josh McLaurin is optimistic about the party having a groundswell of support for officials fighting for party ideals. 
“They want to see energy, the Democratic base does, from its leadership, because what we don’t want is to treat this like it’s just normal politics, like the Trump deportations and the tariffs and all of this is just kind of business as usual,” McLaurin said.

Community groups, labor unions, student and faith communities rallied across Vermont and around the nation on May Day, commemorated as international workers’ day in a demonstration of mass solidarity.

Photo by Auditi Guha/VTDiggerWILLISTON — Immigrant rights, trans rights, worker rights and support for Palestinians were forefront at a May Day rally in Williston Thursday evening. Organizers estimated 2,500 people marched to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s facility on Harvest Lane and then to Hannaford Supermarket in a peaceful protest that condemned recent actions of President Donald Trump’s administration.“I’m here because I believe in social justice and human rights,” said Joanna Cole, a former state representative who lives in Shelburne. She came to participate in the rally with her partner, Sarah Flynn, outside the ICE facility.“I do not want any immigrants forced out, especially illegally,” she said, referring to recent student arrests and ICE raids in Vermont. “I think it’s horrible so many people are being kidnapped off the street and being thrown in jail.”“It smacks of Hitler in Germany and of McCarthyism in the U.S. and I don’t want to be any part of it,” Cole added.Community groups, labor unions, student and faith communities rallied across Vermont and around the nation on May Day, commemorated as international workers’ day in a demonstration of mass solidarity.From the ICE data center in Williston to the Statehouse in Montpelier and beyond, Vermonters denounced “billionaire profiteers” and actions of the Trump administration that has launched a concerted effort to dismantle government and the rights of workers, immigrants and other vulnerable groups nationwide.As Cole spoke, drumbeats and chants on Williston Road heralded the arrival of a large march organized by Migrant Justice joined by multiple labor and advocacy organizations. “An injury to one is an injury to all,” read the handmade banner held by three people up front flanked by another three people holding Palestinian flags and one waving the stars and stripes.“We are here at ICE, the same people who took our brother Mohsen, who we freed yesterday,” said an organizer wearing a red and white kaffiyeh, a scarf often worn to show solidarity with Palestinians.During a speech she called for “No ICE and no deportations” amid loud cheers outside the red brick federal building where a handful of federal workers stood guard in full uniform with marked cars during the peaceful rally.Student supporters, hospital union leaders, a representative from Vermonters for Justice in Palestine and another from the FreeHer campaign gave short speeches in front of the federal building, punctuated by drum beats, chants and cheering from the large group.Jacob Berkowitz, president of UVMMC Support Staff United at the University of Vermont Medical Center, said he joined the rally to “stand up and speak for those that cannot,” such as immigrant workers, those who are poor and those who face violence everyday.
While Trump has been in power for just more than 100 days, his mass deportation plan has had significant impact in Vermont, from the recent arrest of eight migrant dairy workers at Berkshire and the detainment of a Palestinian student in Colchester to revoking the legal statuses of some resettled groups, freezing funding for refugee support and jeopardizing local jobs. And it continues to try to prevent a detained Tufts student’s return to Vermont.“This lays bare a fundamental truth. Prisons and police have always been weapons of class warfare,” said Jonathan Elwell, an organizer from FreeHer Vermont, a prison abolition group, in a brief speech. “No matter how hard the goons who run them try to frame prisons as apolitical tools of public safety or spout progressive promises of rehabilitation, we know the truth. They are always deployed against those who are dispossessed, differentiated or dissident.”Protesters waved signs signaling their opposition to Trump, ICE, prisons, capitalism, the muzzling of free speech and democracy: ‘Power to the workers, not the billionaires,’ ‘ICE is terrorism,’ ‘Respect the Constitution.’ ‘Good dogs eat fascists,’ read a cardboard sign attached to a brown dog’s harness.“I’m making it a point to go to a lot of protests just because I do not like what the Trump administration is doing. I am especially upset about deportations without a trial,” said Monica Hawkes, who came from Jeffersonville to join the Williston protest.Continuing on, the march ended around the boundaries of the Hannaford Supermarket on Marshall Avenue around 8 p.m., with Migrant Justice advocates and allies demanding the grocery chain join the Milk With Dignity campaign in a continued effort to fight for the rights of farmworkers.Migrant Justice launched the campaign in 2019 to promote fair wages and dignity on farms and demands that Hannaford improve conditions on the farms that supply its dairy products. The nonprofit representing immigrant farmworkers statewide filed a complaint in the Netherlands last month outlining human rights violations in Hannaford’s supply chain. The U.S. grocery chain is a subsidiary of Ahold Delhaize, a Dutch-Belgian multinational company. “I think a huge place that unites us is that we are all working people and we are powerful if we are in solidarity,” said Bex Love from Northfield.Love sported black-and-white cow print and helped hold up a towering makeshift white cow, made to support Milk With Dignity, with her friend Izzy de Buy Wenniger, of Burlington, at the picket line near the grocery store. There, security guards blocked marchers from going on the property.On the sidewalk outside, speakers once again lined up to share their thoughts.Thousands in Williston marched in support of immigrant and farmworker rights on May Day 2025.

Her comments, spoken in Spanish, were translated by Will Lambek, a spokesperson for Migrant Justice. Despite working long, hard hours, farmworkers like herself are not given the dignity of a fair wage, health care or safe housing, Maribel added, and corporations like Hannaford continue to exploit them.As she called for solidarity on the packed sidewalk in the fading light of the waning day, allies applauded, a child drummed on an upside down paint bucket, and a passing car honked in support.Read the story on VTDigger here:  From ICE to Hannaford: Vermonters rally on May Day for human rights and social justice amid escalating Trump administration attacks, rollbacks.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/May-Day-2025-1-1.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-02 20:03:59.962112

Tim Mathern, D-Fargo, talk while walking in the hall of the Capitol on May 1, 2025. (Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota lawmakers on Friday approved an Ethics Commission budget full of major policy changes — though they abandoned a controversial proposal that would have imposed a deadline for ethics complaints.
The budget, totaling nearly $1.4 million, was forwarded to both chambers for a vote that morning following final amendments from a six-member conference committee. The Senate approved the budget by a 44-2 vote, while the House passed it 71-19.
The Ethics Commission sought money in Senate Bill 2004 for a fourth staff member for the 2025-2027 budget cycle, which the Legislature ultimately rejected. That employee would have focused on education and communications. The Senate initially approved the request, setting aside $250,000 for a two-year salary, benefits as well as other costs. The House later axed this funding — a move the conference committee sustained.
Legislators did agree to fund a $50,000 case management system to help the commission track filings, which staff say will help them work more efficiently.
Other noteworthy provisions in the budget include a handful of changes intended to fix bottlenecks in the Ethics Commission’s complaint process.
Some lawmakers who worked on the budget this session complained that the commission sometimes takes years to resolve complaints. Some complaints are more than two years old.
Meanwhile, the commission has received a flood of new filings since Jan. 1. As of April 28, the board had received 68 complaints since the start of 2025. That’s more than the commission received in all of 2024.
Some, though not all, of the policy changes in the budget were originally proposed in bills that died earlier this session, like House Bill 1360 and House Bill 1505.
Generally, the Ethics Commission is opposed to adding policy into the budget bill, said Executive Director Rebecca Binstock. She said she worries some of the provisions will add red tape to the commission’s work, though she expects at least a few to help the board’s work go more smoothly.
“The commission’s position has always been that we prefer a clean budget,” Binstock said.
Ethics commissioners say bill would impose an arbitrary cutoff for investigations

One provision in the bill approved Friday would allow the commission to informally settle ethics complaints directly with the accused. Previously, the commission could only act as a mediator to broker informal resolutions between the accused and the filer — which sometimes doesn’t work if that filer’s demands were unrealistic. The commission must attempt to mediate between both parties first, however.
Another requires the commission to develop time management standards for processing complaints, which Binstock said the commission supports and wanted to pursue anyway.
Until Thursday, the budget included a mandate for the Ethics Commission to dismiss complaints after 180 days. It was added as part of an amendment brought by Rep. Mike Nathe, R-Bismarck, who said it is needed to make sure the commission’s investigations don’t drag on indefinitely.
“It’s just a matter of fairness to the accused,” Nathe said previously. “They shouldn’t have to sit there with this hanging over their head for years at a time.”
The Ethics Commission opposed the six-month window as a threat to its work, arguing that many complaints cannot be effectively probed within that timeframe and that it would incentivize people accused of ethics violations to obstruct investigations to run out the clock.
In place of the deadline, the conference committee added a clause that states an individual accused of a violation may petition the commission at any time to dismiss the complaint against them. The Ethics Commission will have to draft a policy implementing this language.
Some lawmakers said the root of the commission’s backlog of complaints stems from a lack of resources, and that the budget does not address this problem.
Sen. Tim Mathern, D-Fargo, unsuccessfully brought a budget amendment to more than double the commission’s staff, arguing that the funding is necessary for the body to do its job effectively.
“I think the activity thus far indicates that we have a lack in that we don’t have another staff person,” Mathern said on the floor Friday. “However, we’ve made some progress, and hopefully by the next time we meet next session, we can get that other staff person to help us all do a great job.”
Voters created an ethics commission in North Dakota. Then the Legislature limited its power.

A separate amendment brought by Rep. Karla Rose Hanson, D-Fargo, requires the commission to publish an annual report providing details about its work, including the number of complaints filed and what the commission has done to resolve them.
The bill also allows people accused of violations to discuss complaints against them.
Another section protects lawmakers from being prosecuted with a conflict of interest crime for voting on bills so long as they observe the proper legislative conflict of interest rules or heed the informal advice of an Ethics Commission staff member.
The bill advances to Gov. Kelly Armstrong for his consideration.

Nevada was awarded about $15 million in funds for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) this year, but had not received the remaining 10% of its allocated funding before the Trump administration fired every employee responsible for administering the funds.
The Department of Health and Human Services announced Wednesday they would release the nearly $400 million in LIHEAP utility assistance funding that had not yet been distributed to states by Thursday.
“I am committed to ensuring that our programs run efficiently. With today’s announcement, all available LIHEAP funding for this fiscal year will be released. We will continue to work with our state, tribal, and territorial partners to ensure this funding reaches eligible families,” said Andrew Gradison, Acting Assistant Secretary for Children and Families.
Utility advocates and Democrats in Congress raised the alarm about last month, warning that the gutting of federal workers and the program could leave the funds in limbo.
After news of the mass firing last month, Nevada Sen. Jacky Rosen and several other Democratic senators sent a letter to HHS demanding the agency release all of the LIHEAP funds that Congress has appropriated.
“By terminating all 23 employees tasked with overseeing LIHEAP, it is now unclear how these funds will be administered. In our view, that is unacceptable,” read the letter. “Failure to disburse these funds constitutes an illegal impoundment of bipartisan, congressionally appropriated funds and will put the health and well-being of some of the most vulnerable people in America at risk.”
Nevada’s Energy Assistance Program received more than half its funding from LIHEAP last year, making it a vital source of utility assistance funding for the state.
Last year, Nevada received more than $17 million in LIHEAP funding to help 12,000 low-income households in the state keep their power on. A portion of those funds were also used to help low-income households pay for upgrades that improve energy efficiency and lower power bills in the long term.
The Nevada’s Energy Assistance Program paid out another $13.8 million in benefits last year from state revenue generated from Nevada’s Universal Energy Charge which helped another nearly 6,000 households pay their utilities. 
Still, as temperatures rise there is a growing demand for utility assistance funding in the state. Nearly 32,000 Nevadans had their power disconnected by NV Energy for nonpayment in 2024, according to data from the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada.
In Southern Nevada, where temperatures reached 100 degrees or higher for 64 consecutive days in 2024, air conditioning is a life-saving necessity.
The state’s ability to provide energy assistance could be reduced even more in 2026, as LIHEAP was among 60 programs President Donald Trump asked Congress to defund in a budget request Friday.
Nevada’s Energy Assistance Program begins July 1st and applications are accepted through June 30th. Applications are evaluated year round or until funding is exhausted. Eligible households receive an annual, one-time per year benefit customarily paid directly to their energy provider.
Those interested in applying for LIHEAP can visit energyhelp.us or call the National Energy Assistance Referral (NEAR) hotline toll-free at: 1-866-674-6327.  
Households can easily identify if they may be eligible for assistance by using the LIHEAP Eligibility Tool on energyhelp.us.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/thermostat-1024x735.jpeg,,,2025-05-02 20:03:59.962112

‘Penguin Day’ returns to the Capitol
Just before gaveling into session on Monday, state lawmakers had a chance to meet with a delegation of visitors from South Africa — by way of Mystic.
Green/blue and Blue/blue, two African penguins from the Mystic Aquarium, served as animal ambassadors for the aquarium’s annual “Penguin Day” at the state Capitol. The names of the pair derive from colored beads on their wings that staff use to identify individual birds.
Each of the penguins took turns with a caretaker outside of their mobile enclosure, posing for pictures with staff and lawmakers. Petting was not permitted, for the animal’s safety. State Rep. Mary Welander, D-Orange, beamed as she leaned in for an up-close greeting with Green/blue. “What a great day,” she exclaimed.
Welander said her eldest son, who recently graduated high school, is planning to study marine biology in college. “If I missed Penguin Day, he’d never forgive me.”
The penguins’ visit also offers aquarium staff a chance to engage with lawmakers about various legislative issues and to raise awareness for their animal rescue program. Lobbyists for the aquarium were also on hand, answering questions and snapping photos.
“We advocate for a lot of the positive environmental measures, things like decreasing plastic pollution, public education, encouraging public advocacy and responsible environmental stewardship along the coastlines,” said Allison Tuttle, the aquarium’s chief zoological officer.
While wild penguins live almost exclusively south of the equator, Mystic’s animal rescue program fields over 100 calls each year for stranded seals, sea turtles and other marine animals in Rhode Island, Connecticut and New York.

Special Education
The Special Education Committee on Tuesday approved two identical bills that would adjust the funding model for special education across the state and provide more oversight of the programs.
The bills are the newly formed committee’s signature pieces of legislation this session and aim to address what districts say is a lack of state investment in special education and problems for students in the programs. The committee passed a House and Senate bill, which will next be considered by the Education Committee. Lawmakers will decide later which is the best avenue for passage.
The bills had some changes following a public hearing last month. The Office of the Child Advocate would have a bigger role in oversight of special education programs and cost-setting. The costs would also be set on an individualized rate rather than a universal rate. A previous moratorium on new special education providers has been removed, and there is a requirement for the state to conduct randomized audits of restraint and seclusion use for special education students.

Gun violence prevention
U.S. Sens. Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal held a press conference Friday after President Donald Trump removed federal funding for programs supporting gun violence prevention. Though Connecticut gun reform and mental health organizations are not currently on the list of programs that are receiving the funding cuts, Murphy and Blumenthal expressed concern that funding removal could affect Connecticut.
“You are not serving any constituency by cutting funding to these groups,” Murphy said, adding, “We are going to litigate this issue.”
They were joined by Hartford Mayor Arunan Arulampalam, Rev. Henry Brown of Mothers United Against Violence, a gun violence support group, and Andrew Woods and Johanna Schubert of Hartford Communities that Care, a nonprofit focused on community support and violence prevention.
“This is a defunding of public safety in communities like Hartford,” Arulampalam said, adding “any one shooting in the city is too many.”

Contraception for minors
The House of Representatives on Thursday passed a bill enabling minors to receive contraceptives, prenatal care and pain management during labor without the consent of an adult. The bill has undergone significant changes since its original draft, which was met with fierce criticism by organizations like the Family Institute of Connecticut. Originally, the bill would have removed state regulations on abortions and abortion clinics — which, among other things, required doctors to report data on abortions to the state, prohibited third trimester abortions and allowed healthcare providers to refuse to perform an abortion for moral or religious reasons. All of these provisions were removed.
“There is no longer anything about abortion in this particular bill,” Democratic Rep. Cristin McCarthy Vahey of Fairfield, co-chair of the Public Health Committee, said Thursday. McCarthy Vahey cited the 2023 Connecticut school health survey, which shows that 28% of high schoolers have had sexual intercourse. While over half used a condom, only 1 in 10 used both a condom and some form of contraception.
Rep. Nicole Klarides-Ditria, R-Seymour, said the goal of the bill was to ensure that young people could get medical care without being afraid of repercussions. “I would venture to say this bill is going to prevent pregnancies. It will prevent abortions because it’s going to enable our minors to get contraception to prevent pregnancies,” she said.
The bill also precludes medical personnel from sharing information about the services a minor received without the consent of the minor patient. Rep. Craig Fishbein, R-Wallingford, said the bill’s open-ended language could open the door to preventing doctors from sharing information about other issues. He proposed an amendment that would require a parent or guardian — or, in some cases, another trusted adult over the age of 21 — to be notified after a minor received an abortion. The amendment was rejected, and the bill was adopted 117-27.

Birthing centers
The House this week voted to pass a bill that requires the state’s Office of Health Strategy to craft a strategic plan for increasing the number of birthing centers and hospitals in areas with high percentages of Medicaid recipients and limited access to facilities.
The OHS commissioner must report to legislators by Jan. 1, 2027 on recommendations and state appropriations needed to stand up more birthing centers and hospitals in underserved areas.
An amendment adopted during the bill’s debate eliminated a mandate that the state Department of Social Services increase Medicaid reimbursement for doulas as part of the Connecticut’s bundled maternity payments.
The issue of maintaining or adding birthing services in underserved areas has received considerable attention. In late 2023, state officials approved the closure of Windham Hospital’s labor and delivery unit, ending a three-year saga that pitted community members against one of Connecticut’s largest health systems. A study this year concluded that opening a freestanding birthing center in that area is not feasible because there isn’t enough demand to sustain it.
In 2023, the legislature passed a law to allow freestanding birth centers in the state, and to date there is just one, located in Danbury. Each center needs about 115 annual births to break even and 500 births to be financially viable, according to industry benchmarks.

McCoy, 37 — who has been staying off the streets by sleeping in a blue bus offered by the Nomad Alliance, a nonprofit that helps unsheltered Utahns — said he was recently diagnosed with a lung disease called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. He’s been told that he has maybe five to 10 years left to live, “and there’s no cure for it,” he said, so all he can do is focus on medical treatment that helps him stay comfortable through the remainder of his life.  
“If I were to lose my Medicaid, pardon my language, but there’s no way in hell I’d be able to afford any of that,” he said. “I’ve been on the streets my entire adult life. … I have a hard enough time trying to feed myself.” 
Friday’s public hearing at the Multi-Agency State Office Building in  Salt Lake City was the first of two scheduled as part of a 30-day public comment period the state officials are required to hold before submitting a proposed waiver to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), in June. 
Advocates sound alarm as Utah looks to impose work requirements on Medicaid expansion

That waiver, as currently drafted, would ask President Donald Trump’s administration to allow Utah to reinstate work requirements on the state’s Medicaid expansion program. Currently, about 75,000 adult Utahns are enrolled in the state’s expansion program, which allows Medicaid eligibility to Utahns whose annual income is up to 133% of the federal poverty level (roughly $20,800 for an individual or $42,760 for a family of four, according to national thresholds). 
The waiver would permit a list of exemptions to the work requirement, excluding those working at least 30 hours a week, those who are 60 or older, pregnant, physically or mentally unable to meet the requirements, parents with a child dependent under the age of 6, among others. And it would allow Medicaid recipients to claim “good cause” for circumstances not on the exemptions list, such as hospitalization or a death in the family, according to state officials. 
However, of those 75,000 adults enrolled, an estimated 7,900 would not fall under an exemption and would be subject to work requirements if the state submits the waiver and it’s approved by federal officials. That means those 7,900 could lose their Medicaid coverage if they don’t start working or submit documentation to the state that they’re applying for at least 48 jobs during a three-month period. 
Along with McCoy, concerned Utahns and low-income advocates came to Friday’s public hearing to express concerns about the Utah Department of Health and Human Services’s decision to re-submit the Medicaid work requirement waiver. 
Previously, when the state’s first waiver was submitted in 2020, the work requirement was approved at the time under Trump’s first administration, but just months later it was suspended amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Then, in 2021, when Utah’s waiver was up for renewal, former President Joe Biden’s administration required the state to remove that work requirement.

Now, with Trump back in the Oval Office, Utah DHHS agency leaders have decided to resubmit it. The move adds Utah to the list of states looking to impose work requirements on certain Medicaid recipients under a Republican-controlled Congress and Trump, wanting to encourage people to find work and reduce their reliance on public assistance. 
However, several low-income advocates told state officials during Friday’s hearing that mandating work requirements on vulnerable populations — especially those who are medically frail or experiencing homelessness — would at best saddle them with unnecessary paperwork they don’t have time for and at worst cause them to lose their medical care. 
Kseniya Kniazeva, founder and president of Nomad Alliance, said many of the homeless Utahns her nonprofit helps rely on Medicaid coverage. 
“Without Medicaid, they would suffer,” she said, worrying that imposing work requirements would mean the difference between life and death for many of Utah’s homeless. 
“The population that I serve cannot work 30 hours a week while they’re on the streets,” she said. “If they could, they would get a job and they would get health care through their job. That’s why Medicaid is here, it’s for people who cannot work because they have chronic health conditions or mental health conditions.”  
Kniazeva said for many Utahns experiencing homelessness, almost all of their energy is spent on dealing with keeping a roof over their head and staying safe and healthy — not looking for a job or jumping through administrative hoops to keep health care coverage.

“We cannot remove crucial health care for this population,” she said. “Forcing them to apply to 48 jobs in a three-month period? … When their whole entire life is consumed by trying to find food and water and a bathroom today, how are you supposed to think about applying for jobs so you can keep your medical care?” 
Most of them don’t even have phones, she said, let alone access to a computer. 
“For the love of God, please,” Kniazeva said. “This is not what Jesus would do.”
Stephanie Burdick, consumer representative on the state’s Medical Care Advisory Committee, said even though the state’s proposed waiver includes a list of exemptions, still requiring Utahns to prove they qualify for an exemption creates too many administrative obstacles for vulnerable populations. 
“This mass surveillance of poor people and mass surveillance of sick people, it infringes on basic American rights,” Burdick said, her voice straining with emotion. “Why should they have to prove to you that their health conditions meet your definition (of qualifying for a work requirement exemption)?”
Burdick questioned why the Utah DHHS is moving forward with re-submitting the waiver when it has not received a new mandate from state legislators to do so. If state leaders really want to increase employment for Utahns, she said they should focus on voluntary job programs, not make health care coverage contingent.
“Do not force this kind of government bureaucracy on Utahns’ health care,” she said. 
Jennifer Strohecker, the state’s Medicaid director, repeatedly thanked those who attended Friday’s meeting and said their input would help inform the final version of the state’s waiver application. 
“These enrich our process and allow us to really consider multiple angles when evaluating this policy proposal,” she said. 
Friday wasn’t the only opportunity for Utahns to weigh in to the proposed waiver. There’s another public hearing scheduled for May 14 at 4 p.m.. at the Multi-Agency State Office Building, located at 195 N. 1950 West in Salt Lake City. Utahns can also submit comments on the state’s website or email them to Medicaid1115waiver@utah.gov.

Former Illinois Gov. George Ryan died Friday morning at 91, more than two decades after leaving office for the last time and 12 years after his release from federal prison.

He died just one day after being put into hospice care in his native Kankakee.

Ryan, a Republican, served  one term as governor from 1999 to 2003, and spent the last decade or so of his life speaking about and ultimately writing a book on his 2000 decision to put a moratorium on Illinois’ death penalty and then commuting the sentences of 167 death row inmates in the state’s prison system to life sentences.

“I can’t really believe that there’s ever gonna be a system devised where an innocent person couldn’t be executed,” Ryan told Capitol News Illinois in a 2020 interview. “You gotta have a perfect law if you’re gonna have ... death as a penalty. So I just figured the best way to do it was to do away with that opportunity.”

But Ryan’s time as governor — and his entire 35-year career in politics — was ultimately overshadowed by his time as secretary of state in the 1990s. During his two terms leading that office, Ryan oversaw a license-for-bribes scheme that led to the deaths of six children in a fiery vehicle explosion and 79 federal indictments, including his own.

Before that, Ryan served as lieutenant governor alongside Gov. Jim Thompson, whose law firm would later represent Ryan pro bono in his corruption case. He also spent two years as Illinois House speaker, capping a decade in the General Assembly.

A pharmacist by trade, Ryan began his political career in the late 1960s on the Kankakee County Board.

License-for-bribes conviction

The former governor spent nearly six years in prison and on home confinement after his 2006 conviction on corruption charges stemming from an investigation into a freak accident on a Milwaukee expressway in 1994.

The Willis family, who’d been driving from Chicago to a vacation in Wisconsin, were engulfed in flames when their minivan exploded after a taillight fell off a semitrailer truck and punctured the van’s fuel tank. The explosion killed the six Willis children, while the Rev. Duane Willis and his wife Janet were badly burned.

An investigation into the crash revealed that other motorists had tried to warn the semi driver about the dangling vehicle part, but he didn’t understand English, even though federal law requires truck drivers be proficient in English to get a commercial license.

After Wisconsin authorities passed along the information to the Secretary of State’s office, an internal investigation found the truck driver may have paid a bribe to get his license. But Ryan squashed the probe and fired the investigators.

The feds, however, picked up the investigation while Ryan was running for governor, finding a systematic operation in which bribes paid for commercial driver’s licenses were funneled into Ryan’s campaign fund.

Even as secretary of state employees were being indicted in what came to be known as Operation Safe Roads, Ryan claimed to know nothing about the scheme and was elected governor over Democratic then-U.S. Rep. Glenn Poshard in 1998.

But as the investigation reached a fever pitch and the cloud of suspicion over Ryan grew, he chose to not run for a second term as governor in 2002. That paved the way for Democrat Rod Blagojevich’s victory over Republican Jim Ryan, who suffered from sharing a surname and party with the then-governor.

Ryan was indicted in 2004, convicted in 2006 after a lengthy trial and went to prison in 2007 following a monthslong appeals process, making him the third Illinois governor to serve time. Several years later, Blagojevich would follow.

Death penalty moratorium

Since his 2013 release from prison and subsequent stint on home confinement, Ryan dedicated the last years of his life returning to a subject he’d become passionate about as governor: the death penalty.

Ryan parlayed his speaking engagements into a book, co-authored with a former Chicago Tribune reporter and published in 2020. The book, titled “Until I Could Be Sure: How I Stopped the Death Penalty in Illinois,” detailed the former governor’s debates and deliberations leading up to his decision to put a moratorium on the state’s death penalty in January 2000.

Just before leaving office three years later, Ryan commuted the death sentences of 167 Illinois prisoners, which garnered international attention.

Ryan’s ascent to the governor’s office coincided with emerging DNA evidence technology and a wave of exonerations across the country, including in Illinois. The state would later become known as an outlier for false confessions and exonerations. But at the time, Ryan’s stance was controversial in a tough-on-crime era of politics.

In his 2020 interview with CNI, Ryan said the majority of his staff tried to dissuade him from making moves on the death penalty, which wouldn’t be officially abolished in Illinois until 2011.

But Ryan said the uncertainty of decisions made under the death penalty system bothered him, especially in the wake of the exoneration of death row inmate Anthony Porter in February 1999, when Ryan was a month into his term as governor. Porter was freed after journalism students at Northwestern University uncovered evidence of his innocence.

“The whole system was just prone with error,” Ryan said. “It’s just — you got error in every corner.”

Former Illinois House GOP Leader Jim Durkin, who in 2023 stepped down from the post Ryan held decades before, told CNI he’d gotten to know the former governor better in his later years through Ryan’s son Homer.

Durkin said when he’d meet up with the Ryans in Kankakee while campaigning for fellow House Republicans, their lunches would often be punctuated by locals who'd wanted to say, “‘Hello, governor’ — not ‘Hello, George’ ... They loved him.”

“He made a mistake and he did his time,” Durkin said. “And he didn’t express or show any bitterness toward anyone involved in his case. Just wanted to get on with his life. That shows a strong man who takes responsibility.”

Illinois Senate Minority Leader John Curran, R-Downers Grove, echoed Durkin’s accolades that Ryan was a “master of bridging the gap” both between Republicans and Democrats and between organized labor and management.

“He was a bold leader who wasn’t afraid to reach across the aisle and bring people together for the greater good,” Curran said. “His investments in infrastructure, technology, and education to help create a brighter future for Illinois will long be remembered.”

State attorneys general are urging concerned customers to delete their data, while experts warn that state and federal laws may not fully protect their privacy. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The fate of more than 15 million customers’ genetic data remains in limbo after popular DNA testing company 23andMe filed for bankruptcy in March. The data is up for sale, stoking fears about how it might be used and prompting attorneys general from more than a dozen states to warn 23andMe users: Delete your data.
“Your genetic data is your most personal, confidential data, and you should be able to protect who has access to it,” North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson, a Democrat, said in a March statement.
“You have the power to delete your data now — please act quickly.”
Dr. Adam Brown, a Washington, D.C.-based emergency physician and the founder of a health care strategy firm, deleted his information on 23andMe as soon as he learned of the bankruptcy filing, he told Stateline.
For him, the bankruptcy begs a vital question that federal and state laws don’t fully address: What happens to your genetic data when the company holding it collapses?
Federal protections are flimsy. States have beefed up their genetic privacy laws in recent years, but many experts say they don’t go far enough.
23andMe has said the bankruptcy will not change how it stores, manages or protects its trove of sensitive customer information. In a news release issued shortly after the bankruptcy announcement, the company said any potential buyers would have to agree to comply with 23andMe’s consumer privacy policy and all applicable laws. When contacted by Stateline, the company declined to comment beyond what it has published in news releases and information it posted for customers on its website.
But once the data is in the hands of another company, that company could change its privacy policy at any time, experts noted.
“Once you get to the point of bankruptcy court, there may not be those same guarantees or the same ethos a new company may have around privacy protections for consumers,” Brown said.
“I want people to understand there actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.”
 HIPAA doesn’t help

Companies such as 23andMe offer their users potentially game-changing revelations about their health and ancestry. The process is simple: Mail in a saliva sample and the company uses it to build an individual genetic profile that can reveal not only a person’s family connections, but also health insights such as their risk of developing a disease like cancer or Alzheimer’s.
This valuable personal data underpins a direct-to-customer genetic testing market that was valued at $1.93 billion globally in 2023 and is expected to grow, according to market research firm Grand View Research.
23andMe was an industry giant until its stock price plummeted following a massive 2023 data breach that affected the accounts of nearly 7 million customers. Then came the $30 million class-action lawsuit settlement.
The company declared bankruptcy in late March of this year, and announced it’s up for sale.
A flurry of alerts from state attorneys general around the country soon followed. AGs from states including Alabama, Arizona, California, Kentucky, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Texas issued similar press releases that recommended customers ask the company to delete their genetic profile and destroy the saliva sample used to create it.
“We have robust state privacy laws that include data deletion rights, and I would encourage any Texan concerned about their data to exercise the right to have their data securely deleted,” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, said in an April statement.
The fear is that a new 23andMe owner could choose to use or share sensitive personal genetic data in ways the company’s current privacy policy doesn’t allow. There’s worry it could be used, for example, to inflate people’s life insurance premiums or expose them to employment discrimination.
And there aren’t many guardrails to prevent that from happening.
HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, doesn’t apply to companies like 23andMe. The landmark federal law protects patients’ sensitive health information when it’s handled by doctors, hospitals and health insurers. But direct-to-customer companies such as 23andMe or Ancestry aren’t considered health care providers, and their non-invasive saliva collection kit isn’t considered a medical test.
The main federal law that protects people from discrimination based on their genetic information is nearly 20 years old. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) was passed in 2008, long before the rise of at-home testing kits. It applies to employers and health insurers, but not to life insurance companies, mortgage lenders and other non-health entities. And it doesn’t explicitly protect epigenetic information, which is information about the way a person’s genes — and by extension, health — are affected by outside factors such as smoking, disease or stress.
 What states are doing

In the past five years, at least 14 states have passed laws regulating direct-to-consumer genetic testing offered by companies like Ancestry and 23andMe. There’s variation, but generally the laws require companies to get customers’ express consent before using or sharing their data, and allow customers to request their genetic data be deleted and biological samples destroyed.
It’s a good start, but doesn’t go far enough, said Anya Prince, a University of Iowa law professor whose research focuses on health and genetic privacy.
Many of those state efforts were built around a model law developed by the Coalition for Genetic Data Protection, an industry group with two member companies: 23andMe and Ancestry.
As DNA testing kits exploded in popularity and attracted increased scrutiny from lawmakers, the coalition pushed to influence legislation and set industry standards. The privacy protections in the laws mirror what 23andMe and Ancestry were already doing with their own privacy policies, experts say.
“They do have some really sensible privacy protections,” said Prince. “It’s great that people can delete their genetic data, and it’s great that law enforcement needs a warrant to access it. But if a privacy advocate had written a model law, there would be the potential for more and broader protections.”
For example, she said, many of the state laws address privacy requirements just for direct-to-consumer DNA testing companies. If 23andMe’s data is bought by, say, a pharmaceutical company, those state laws no longer apply.
The coalition now appears to be inactive, its website defunct.
Since 2020, more than a dozen states have passed some version of a genetic information privacy law, including Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming, based on a Stateline analysis. This year, the Indiana legislature passed a bill that’s now headed to the governor’s desk. Bills have been introduced this year in other states, including West Virginia.
Prince said state laws rely too heavily on consumers to self-manage their data privacy. They’re expected to understand a company’s policy, when studies have shown the public often doesn’t read privacy notices nor fully understand how companies use their data. Further, many state laws don’t address how third parties, such as law enforcement, can access and use consumer genetic data.
It’s also not always clear how the laws will be enforced, or who’s responsible for oversight.
“In general, I think there’s a disconnect between how people think their privacy is protected and how it’s actually protected,” she said.
But a few states have enacted laws that are more robust. California, for example, has a genetic information privacy law, but also has a general data protection law, as well as a state version of the federal GINA law that extends genetic anti-discrimination protections into areas including housing, education and licensing.
Florida has beefed up its DNA privacy laws in recent years, making the using or selling of an individual’s DNA without informed consent a felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison and up to a $10,000 fine. Florida was also the first state to prohibit life, disability and long-term care insurance companies from using genetic information to determine coverage.

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerIdaho is not a place, as far as I know, that comes up in the Vermont Statehouse all that often. But the House Transportation Committee has been considering a proposal first enacted in that state — and that supporters here say would make it safer to ride bicycles in busy areas.Rep. Phil Pouech, D-Hinesburg, is urging his fellow committee members to add language into this year’s miscellaneous motor vehicle bill that would allow cyclists to treat stop signs like yield signs — essentially, letting them coast through intersections when no drivers or pedestrians are present. The policy is often called an “Idaho stop,” because the Gem State (yes, that’s what they call it) was the first in the country to put such an idea on the books. Today, 11 states have enacted similar laws, according to Local Motion, a Burlington-based advocacy organization for cyclists.Pouech’s amendment would also allow bikers to follow pedestrian signals, instead of normal traffic lights, at intersections. Both that measure, and the “Idaho stop,” were part of companion House and Senate bills introduced earlier this year that have not advanced on their own. The motor vehicle bill, S.123, has already cleared the Senate and is now being considered in House Transportation. On Friday, the panel heard from several witnesses who said they support tacking Pouech’s proposal onto the DMV bill, which is one of the “must-pass” bills each year. Jonathon Weber, programs director for Local Motion, told the committee many cyclists already do what the amendment proposes to legalize because they know that it makes them safer.Following pedestrian signals allows cyclists to clear through intersections before vehicles start moving, reducing the likelihood of crashes, he said. Meanwhile, he said, letting cyclists avoid stopping at an intersection — and in many cases, avoid having to unclip their shoes from their pedals as a result — would also reduce the time that they spend in such crash-prone areas. Weber pointed to research published last year by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, an arm of the U.S. Department of Transportation, which found that existing stop-as-yield laws were associated with reduced crash rates, particularly at intersections in suburban communities.“We believe that Vermonters shouldn’t have to break the law in order to perform a safe and helpful behavior out on the streets,” he said Friday.Much of the language in the annual DMV bill is proposed by the state Agency of Transportation — and the legislation contains many relatively minor changes to motor vehicle laws. The agency isn’t taking a position either for or against Pouech’s proposal, he said Friday.House Transportation is expected to take up the issue again Tuesday, he said, when it could vote on his amendment and then on the bill as a whole.— Shaun RobinsonIn the knowAbout 95% of people incarcerated in Vermont will one day leave prison.

It also puts in place a new state-led flood buyout program to replace or add onto the flood buyouts from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Another provision would allow communities to keep a larger percentage of their local options tax, 75% rather than 70%, Waszazak said.

At an ecosystem meeting, officials explain that progress and decisions about continued protections have been put on hold pending confirmation of Brian Nesvik, Trump’s nominee to lead the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.  
The post Yellowstone grizzly managers — dispersed and reduced by DOGE — shine little light on delisting battle appeared first on WyoFile[...]","CODY—Two days of discussion about the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem’s grizzly population passed before anyone inquired about the status of the species the meeting was focused on. 
Under a court order in January, the Biden administration’s Fish and Wildlife Service proposed continuing with Endangered Species Act protections in the Yellowstone region and all other portions of the Lower 48 where grizzlies reside. Shortly thereafter, pro-delisting leadership was installed by the Trump administration: Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Brian Nesvik, a former Wyoming Game and Fish Department director who’s now nominated to lead the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 
For months, there’s been little official word about what’s going on with Fish and Wildlife’s proposal, though the agency delayed the deadline for the public to provide feedback. In Cody this week, the topic was barely broached at the Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee’s semi-annual Yellowstone Ecosystem Subcommittee meeting. It only came up because a member of the public, local resident Dewey Vanderhoff, asked “where we’re at in the overall picture with delisting” during the meeting’s closing minutes.

Hilary Cooley, Fish and Wildlife’s grizzly bear recovery coordinator, pointed out the proposal on the table — and said she couldn’t say much more. 
“As far as what happens with that proposal, we’re waiting for leadership to be installed,” Cooley said. “Acting leadership is not interested in making decisions right now.” 
As of Friday, 27 pending nominees appeared above Nesvik on the U.S. Senate’s Executive Calendar, which suggests the wait could drag on. The Trump administration also appointed another Wyomingite — mule deer advocate Josh Coursey — to a high Fish and Wildlife Service post, albeit one that doesn’t require Senate confirmation. 
Even if expected Fish and Wildlife Service leaders don’t attempt to pull back the existing continued-listing proposal administratively, legislative efforts are underway to delist grizzly bears, including from Rep. Harriet Hageman.

The gathering of Yellowstone Ecosystem grizzly bear managers in Cody differed from typical meetings because of the turmoil and turnover the Trump administration has brought to the federal government via its Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency. Most federal members of the committee attended remotely due to travel and spending restrictions. There were also new faces, goodbyes and discussion about what the diminished Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team can realistically accomplish going forward. 
“One way or another, the USGS is not going to have the resources they’ve had in the past,” Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks Administrator Ken McDonald told the group. “At the November meeting, we better have a plan for the following spring.”
Biologist Matt Gould, the study team’s new leader, told the group that, despite changes in capacity, the committee’s science arm will continue with grizzly monitoring, data collection and administering the new population model to assess bear numbers — last estimated at 1,050 in the ecosystem’s core.

The Cody meeting was the last as a full-time employee for Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team Leader Frank van Manen. The longtime federal biologist retired earlier than expected, though he is staying involved in an emeritus role. He helmed the group for 13 years.
“I know there are some challenges ahead, but keep up the good fight,” van Manen told the group. “This endeavor has been successful for 50 years, for a good reason: Agencies working together.”

(Getty Images)Advocates for people held in an immigration detention center in Estancia, N.M. say sewage is again backing up into their cells, and they do not have access to clean drinking water.
The Town of Estancia, where the prison is located, posted on social media on Monday asking residents to conserve water. The well serving the community is not producing enough to meet demands, Torrance County Manager Jordan Barela said in a statement on Thursday.
Tiffany Wang, an attorney with the Oregon-based Innovation Law Lab who regularly speaks with people held inside the Torrance County Detention Facility, told Source NM they’ve reported since Monday there has been “absolutely no access to water,” leaving them unable to flush toilets or take showers and exacerbating illnesses and hygiene issues.
“Several reports indicate that stagnant human waste has sat in sites across the facility and that people are resorting to desperate measures such as fasting in order to avoid defecating and defecating on paper plates to put into the trash instead of using toilets, which they are unable to flush,” Wang said.
In addition to detaining migrants, the Torrance County lockup holds people facing federal charges and serves as the county’s jail. It’s owned and operated by private prison company CoreCivic. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement contracts with the county to provide space to hold detained people, and Torrance County contracts with CoreCivic to facilitate the agreement with ICE. President Donald Trump is rapidly expanding immigration detention through billion-dollar contracts with CoreCivic and other private prison companies, Stateline reports.
Spokespeople for CoreCivic and the county government on Friday acknowledged a shortage of water, but denied allegations that the prison doesn’t have any or that sewage is flooding the cells.
Ryan Gustin, senior director of public affairs for CoreCivic, told Source NM any claim that Torrance has been without running water since Monday “is completely false.”
While the prison changed its operations to reduce water consumption, Gustin said, drinking water is always available in the cell pods and staff have given people bottled water. Wang told Source inmates have told her that this is limited to two bottles per day.
“At no point have those in our care been without drinking water,” Gustin said. He said laundry and showers have been “placed on a schedule” but remain available to everyone.
The ongoing conservation measures are meant to ensure the town doesn’t reach critically low levels in its water storage tank, Barela, the county manager, told Source NM. She said the prison’s water tank “has never been empty,” people held there “have had enough water to meet basic water needs during this time,” and the well is being repaired.
Wang said the possibility that some limited amount of water remains in the facility’s tank “does not change the truth that people detained inside TCDF say they have now gone since Monday without running water to meet their basic needs.”
CoreCivic, county deny evacuation
Innovation Law Lab on Tuesday informed ICE El Paso Field Office Director Mary De Anda-Ybarra about specifically where the problems are happening inside the prison, according to emails the group shared with Source NM. De Anda-Ybarra responded the same day by asking for more information and then the next morning, told them “we are looking into the matter.”
Wang said following the law lab’s letter to the ICE field office, the detained men told her officials  evacuated them from one dormitory with a history of sewage flooding. She said prison staff are making detained people clean the feces themselves without personal protective equipment.
CoreCivic and the county also deny these allegations. A spokesperson for ICE did not respond to an emailed request for comment.
“There are also no sewage flooding issues, nor have we had to relocate any residents,” Gustin said.
Barela said she is unaware of any “systemic issues” when it comes to sewage backups in the prison, and maintenance issues are addressed as they come up. “To my knowledge, TCDF has rectified all building maintenance issues within a reasonable time frame after becoming aware of the concerns,” she said.
Wang said Torrance has a “well-documented record of failing plumbing infrastructure,” and shared a map of flooding issues in nearly every cell pod.
“Claims that CoreCivic and Torrance County are unaware of systemic sewage flooding issues are disingenuous and false,” she said.
In interviews with legal advocates and researchers, people detained inside Torrance have described cells “inundated with dirty water” in 2024; entire cell pods flooded with raw sewage in 2023; and broken sinks and water fountains in 2022. New Mexico’s Congressional delegation cited these issues and others when they repeatedly asked former President Joe Biden to close Torrance, but he refused.
‘A public health crisis’
Wang said people detained in Torrance already have various illnesses that would be exacerbated by a lack of potable water, including a gallbladder infection requiring an operation, epilepsy, vision issues and diabetes.
Gustin said CoreCivic hasn’t received any reports of incarcerated people or staff becoming sick as a result of the water problem.
Wang said the county and CoreCivic’s comments “fly in the face of numerous testimonies from detained individuals and their families stating that the facility has been without water for flushing toilets or showering since Monday.”
“It is remarkable, but unfortunately not surprising, that CoreCivic and Torrance County officials are currently attempting to claim that plumbing and water issues are unfounded or have been resolved,” she said. “It speaks to the impunity and dishonesty with which CoreCivic, ICE, and Torrance County collaborate to operate TCDF.”
Wang said it’s shameful that CoreCivic and the county “continue to profit at the expense of the health of detained individuals and the wellbeing of the town of Estancia.”
“ICE and CoreCivic should halt further transfers of people into TCDF, which is in the midst of a public health crisis, release all the people currently detained inside, and finally shut TCDF down,” she said.

(Photo of black bears in North Carolina by NC Garry Tucker/ USFWS)Several black bears spent the winter tucked into dens in northeastern Iowa, which wildlife experts say is a “step up the ladder” toward an established breeding population of bears in the state. 
Black bear sightings in the region have been fairly regular over the past decade or so, but with the prospect of more bear sightings to come, Vince Evelsizer with Iowa Department of Natural Resources said he wants to make sure Iowans “get off on the right start.” 
“That starts with all of us having a better understanding of bears, and what motivates them,” Evelsizer said. 
DNR met with police departments, sheriff’s offices, conservation boards and other officials in northeastern counties, to help prepare them in the event of a bear-related call. 
Evelsizer said this type of education around bears will lead to a better understanding of how to deal with bears, “for the sake of the bear and for human safety sake.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The department has also partnered with the organization BearWise, to provide messaging on how to live with bears. Bear Wise, which was developed by state agency bear biologists, has basic tips for residential and outdoor bear interactions. 
People in residential areas in “bear country” can do things like take down bird feeders, secure any food left outside, including pet food and garbage, and clean their outdoor grills when bears are active, from spring through fall. 
Bears have incredibly strong senses of smell and can smell a tasty snack from more than a mile away, according to BearWise.
Loud noises and big arm movements are the best way to scare a black bear away if it turns up in a yard or across a hiking trail.
Black bear attacks are “extremely rare” according to BearWise, but Evelsizer said it’s best to “give black bears space.” 
Over the years, he said the department has reported a handful of instances of bears hit by cars or shot in the state. 
There are no legal protections for bears in Iowa, though a bill was introduced in the House this year to create a program for hunting and trapping black bears, and establish penalties for the unlawful taking of a bear. 
“It is up to the people of Iowa to decide if they would like to see protection (for the bears) or not,” Evelsizer said. 
A natural resurgence 
Black bears, which can be cinnamon, brown, blonde or black in color, were once common across all of North America. European settlement in the country eliminated much of the population, and drove the bears to more remote areas, away from human settlements. 
Gradually, however, the populations have come back. Iowa’s neighbors to the north, Minnesota and Wisconsin, are now home to an estimated 16,000 and 24,000 black bears, respectively. 

Bear fact: Bears are not considered “true hibernators” because their body temperature only drops about 12 degrees during their winter slumbers, according to BearWise. During the 4-6 months the bears spend snuggled in a den, they do not eat, drink or go to the bathroom. The National Park Service reports that during a bear’s torpor, they can still wake suddenly if they sense danger. 

Evelsizer said the bears began to reside in the driftless region of the two states, which is why some have wandered into Iowa. 
“It’s interesting that this is actually going on in our modern world,” Evelsizer said. “After so many years … the book is still being written.” 
Black bear visits in past years have mostly consisted of males crossing over during mating season and then looping back up to Wisconsin or Minnesota. Evelsizer said the handful of black bears that stuck around this year through Iowa’s winter have already emerged from their winter torpor. 
Evelsizer said overwintering females would be the next step toward an established breeding population in Iowa. 
Iowa is still dealing with individual bears at this point, with an average of about five bear sightings a year and eight sightings last year. 
“My hunch is that they’re more adaptive than we think, and that we may see more than we thought we ever would,” Evelsizer said.

Flood-related expenses and lost revenue could resound for years — and not just in Barre.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  As Barre voters prepare to weigh in on this year’s budget, flood woes from years past still linger.","Kaycen Hedges tries to clear mud from Third Street in Barre on Thursday, July 11, 2024, after overnight flooding. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerThe most fateful decision made about Barre City’s fiscal future might not be made by voters at its Town Meeting Day election on May 13. Rather, it’s the decisions made by state lawmakers, federal agencies and the Trump administration at large that have already affected Barre’s coffers as it slowly pulls itself up from two major flood events. “Our recovery and the impacts (are) not felt across just one year. We need sort of an off-ramp, and we need multiyear assistance,” Barre City Manager Nick Storellicastro said. “I mean, that obviously didn’t translate to this year.”Voters will soon decide whether to support the $14.8 million 2026 budget proposal, representing a property tax rate increase of 5.87%. Barre City voters moved its Town Meeting Day to May in 2024 to better fit the back end of the state Legislature’s calendar. The budget Storellicastro helped to prepare this upcoming fiscal year had to work without the roughly $1 million in state flood aid that the city received in 2024. Barre City was one of the hardest-hit communities in Vermont during the 2023 flood event, and was hit again, less hard, the following year.So far, the city has received only $50,000 in direct operational assistance for this upcoming fiscal year, which runs from July 1 to June 30, from the state. “We’re never going to turn down money from the state. But obviously, the difference between $50,000 (and) a million is a big deal,” he said. “We probably could have used a number with six figures in it, it would have been something more meaningful.”Barre City officials ultimately chose to make up its budget deficit by cutting its bulky waste removal service, leaving positions unfilled and raising certain city fees and taxes, among other measures. The city also benefited from a small boon: Longtime Barre resident Eugene Cozzi bequeathed a large trust to the city upon his death in 2024, $75,000 of which will be used this year to help support cemetery operations, Storellicastro said. However, the fate of a bill that would provide flood-affected municipalities some fiscal relief is still up in the air. H.397, currently in the Senate Government Operations Committee, has a variety of measures geared toward helping communities keep as much of their revenue as possible. Rep. Teddy Waszazak, D-Barre City, said that as the state’s financial situation has gotten worse due to Trump administration cuts across the country, he worked on H.397 to “put smaller pieces” of funding together for municipalities. He said the bill would create a new state-led flood buyout program to replace or add onto the flood buyouts from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. “We need to build up our state systems,” he said. “We can’t assume FEMA will be there,” as the Trump administration has cut back on key FEMA programs. The bill would also create a new “municipal grand list stabilization fund,” which for five years would reimburse municipalities for lost property taxes on flood buyouts, since properties purchased by communities for flood mitigation or recovery represent a loss in potential property tax revenue.Storellicastro told the Senate Committee on Government Operations on Tuesday that 60 Barre property owners have applied for buyouts. Of those, Barre has approved only 27. “Barre City is four square miles,” he said. “Anytime we give up a parcel to a FEMA buyout, that is gone forever from property tax revenue, from development, from housing, from whatever you want to call it. So we only decided to move forward with very targeted buyouts of clusters along the river because those properties have mitigation value to the city as a whole.”Another provision in the bill would allow communities to keep a larger percentage of their local options tax, 75% rather than 70%, Waszazak said. The remaining portion goes into a state fund that provides tax relief to municipalities for state-owned property.Town officials beyond Barre support those changes, while acknowledging they have limitations. Tom Leitz, municipal manager for Waterbury, said the extra 5% in local options tax would mean an additional $60,000 in revenue for the town. “I think we’ll be back asking the same questions of the Legislature in a year or two, but I’m still really happy to get an additional 5%,” he said. “That’s a big win for us.”Liz Scharf, Middlessex Select Board chair, said the town was in the process of approving 12 buyouts that could translate to a loss of $60,000 in property tax revenue per year. “It’s not something we can rely on in perpetuity,” because of the five-year time limit, she said. “But it obviously would be helpful to have that.”Yet the town’s challenges go well beyond buyout funds. Middlesex is still waiting on more than $5.4 million in FEMA reimbursement for the emergency repairs it made for the 2023 flood. The money has been coming in “at a snail’s pace,” she said. The delay has left Scharf with a daunting fiscal bind. “Usually, a town like us would have $200,000 to $400,000 of reserve funds, just for things, right? Like, ‘Oh, yeah, this broke down and we didn’t have the money for it.’ We have zero reserve funds,” she said. Meanwhile, “everything in our town is falling apart,” she said: the town hall, the town shed, a town-owned truck. Just recently, she got a picture from the town’s foreman of a road that appears to be sinking toward a gorge, the kind of damage that could cost thousands to repair. The town has been borrowing funds to keep up, but Scharf is worried its credit will max out soon.“I don’t know what to do in the next storm,” she said. “I don’t know how we’re going to pay for the next road repairs, because we just don’t even have the money to front it.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  As Barre voters prepare to weigh in on this year’s budget, flood woes from years past still linger.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/barre-storm-folo-9-20240711.jpg?fit=1024%2C676&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-02 19:06:08.418813

Tucked in between the conservative, rural north Georgia mountains and the more liberal Atlanta suburbs, Cherokee has a relatively large population that is relatively conservative, which makes it a gold mine for Republicans running statewide races. Last fall, Cherokee voters gave now-President Donald just under 70% of their ballots, more than 112,000 in total, helping him flip the state back for Republicans after it narrowly went to former president Joe Biden in 2020.
That’s why it was a little unusual to see top Georgia Democrats like Senate Majority Leader Harold Jones and state Sen. Jason Esteves, who recently launched his 2026 gubernatorial campaign, speaking to large crowds at events in Cherokee Thursday.
Getting Shigley with it

Jones, who represents Augusta, made the trek to downtown Canton to show support for the woman he hopes will be his newest colleague. He was joined by other top Democratic senators including Sens. Josh McLaurin, Elena Parent and Sheikh Rahman as well as state Rep. Shea Roberts.
Debra Shigley, a Harvard-educated attorney, small business owner and mom of five announced Thursday she is running to replace Republican state Sen. Brandon Beach, who was picked by Trump to become the next U.S. Treasury Secretary.
Shigley said her campaign will emphasize honesty, transparency and kitchen table issues.

“That’s the voice I’ll bring to the state senate, a voice that knows what it’s like to juggle diaper changes with Zoom calls and soccer practice, a voice that understands struggle, believes in solutions and refuses to give up on Georgia families,” she said.
But before Shigley can deliver her first floor speech, she’ll have to fight off the winner of a crowded Republican primary. The candidates so far include Cherokee County Commissioner Steve West, trucking company founder Jason Dickerson, Army veteran and small business owner Grant McGarry and firefighter Brice Futch.
The eventual GOP primary winner will enter the general with a distinct advantage – the district, which includes parts of Cherokee and north Fulton counties, heavily favors a Republican. Beach, a stalwart conservative and Trump ally, won the district with around 70% of the vote last year.
Democratic leaders say despite that disadvantage, they feel good about Shigley’s shot.
That’s because it’s an off-year, special election, which will likely take place during summer vacation season. That is likely to mean a low turnout race, and Democrats are betting their base, peeved at the news out of the federal government, will be more energized to cast their ballots.
“I think the way the winds of the country are blowing right now, and also in Georgia, is to see that the Republicans are really not about helping families and doing things for people,” Jones said. “So, number one, I think that’s the reality, and then number two, we have a great candidate. So when we put those two things together, I really do believe it’s flippable.”
Where’s Barry?
  Congressman Barry Loudermilk
Democrats have held rallies with crowds numbering in the hundreds in south Cherokee, including outside the Woodstock office of Republican Congressman Barry Loudermilk.
On Thursday evening, Cherokee Democrats and the Atlanta-North Georgia Labor Council hosted a mock town hall in Loudermilk’s name at a Woodstock church. The congressman’s place was taken by a cardboard cutout of Waldo, the elusive red and white stripe-wearing fellow from the Where’s Waldo books, with Loudermilk’s face pasted on, the joke being that Loudermilk can’t be found by his constituents.
More than 200 people packed into the Allen Temple AME Church to ask questions, not of Loudermilk, but of Esteves and McLaurin as well as fellow Democrats Sen. Sonya Halpern and Rep. Lisa Campbell.
The questioners came from a left-of-center perspective, largely expressing fear and anger at federal policies ranging from immigration and economics to health care and the environment.
A major theme was the demand that lawmakers do more to counter Trump’s agenda.

Shawn Kwak, a naturalized citizen and former Republican, said even though he served in the U.S. Navy, he cannot prove his citizenship because he doesn’t have a birth certificate, which impacts his ability to vote and get a driver’s license.
“I don’t see the fight in the Democratic Party,” he said. “I’m holding back a lot of anger right now. My family and thousands of people across this nation are right now struggling to hold on, to hide, to keep themselves out of the line of fire. I’m not afraid to stand up. I fought for this nation. I was a Republican. I am armed and I’m military-trained. We are out there this weekend fighting again. I don’t see you guys out there with us. I hear you talk a lot of talk, but I don’t hear the issues that are important, that we are getting attacked right now. I’m afraid that if they question my rights, I can’t prove my citizenship anymore.”
Speaking after the event, Esteves acknowledged the frustrations some Democrats have with the party and said he will focus his campaign on policies that will help Georgians.
“The Democratic Party is not on the ballot, Jason Esteves is on the ballot,” he said. “So I’m going to focus on my race. I’m going to focus on making sure that we have candidates up and down the ballot that are focused on the issues that Georgians care about. And ultimately that comes down to keeping and growing of hard-earned money in people’s pockets. And I’m not going to focus on what’s happening at the national level. Obviously what’s happening in D.C. with Donald Trump and Elon Musk is causing a lot of chaos down here. And we’re going to have to navigate through that. But at the end of the day, what Georgians want is someone who’s going to focus on them.”
Dems moving north?
  Sen. Jason Esteves. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Esteves said he was encouraged by the big crowd in Cherokee and that he sees chipping away votes in red counties as critical for Democrats running statewide.
“What we have to do is make sure that we’re meeting voters where they are across the state, regardless of what the vote totals were in prior elections and talk to people about the issues that they care about,” he said.
Democrats like Biden and Sens. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff who have won statewide races racked up big numbers in Atlanta and its suburbs like Cobb County, Cherokee’s neighbor to the south.
Once a Republican stronghold, Cobb has moved more to the left over the last few decades as younger people and more minorities moved in seeking good schools and affordable homes within reach of Atlanta’s jobs and amenities.
That same dynamic could be just getting under way in Cherokee, said Nate Rich, chair of the Cherokee County Democratic Party.
“Cherokee’s definitely a slower burn because we are like that next layer of counties out beyond the north metro arc, right? So I don’t know that Cherokee’s gonna be this dramatic collapse of dominoes that Cobb was back in ‘16 and ‘18, but we’re doing the work now in preparation. We’ve got a lot of organization, we’ve got a lot of good energy, we’ve got some great candidates, so we’re feeling really good about it.”
University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock said that cautious optimism may be warranted.
“Looking at what’s happened over the last, not quite a generation, in terms of presidential voting, virtually all the precincts in the southern third of Cherokee have become a little more Democratic,” he said. “It’s not so consistent in gubernatorial elections from 2010 to 2022, but still, generally, South Cherokee is becoming a bit more democratic now. Still, it is, overall, a huge win for Republicans, but yeah, Democrats are showing some strength in the southern part of the county.”
Speaking to reporters at the Democratic town hall, Woodstock Republican Rep. Charlice Byrd said not so fast. She said it’s true that a lot of new people are moving into areas like Woodstock, Acworth and Canton, but the county still has a strong Republican majority and will for the foreseeable future.
“It shifts to the left, it shifts  to the right, then it comes back to the middle, then it goes one way or the other again,” she said. “I feel very confident that Cherokee County will remain red for quite a while yet. I mean, we haven’t seen anything drastic. There was a drop in when we did the redistricting, the lines changed a little bit, but it’s still pretty red. And as I see it now, whoever is running as a Republican, they need Cherokee County.”
  Woodstock Republican Reps. Charlice Byrd and Jordan Ridley. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Byrd and fellow Woodstock Republican Rep. Jordan Ridley, who are seen as on the more conservative side of the House GOP, sat in the front row for the Democratic town hall.
“Their big thing is like, ‘Barry, why are you hiding?’ We want to make sure no one thought we were hiding,” Ridley said. Ridley added that he doesn’t think that is a fair assessment of Loudermilk.
Ridley echoed Byrd’s assessment of the parties’ future chances in Cherokee and predicted Shigley will have a more difficult race than she and Senate Democrats might think.
“That’s going to be a hard hill to climb, and if for some reason they do catch lightning in a bottle, they get extremely lucky, we come back to a full election cycle in ‘26, and they’re not going to hold that seat,” he said. “So if they do get lucky, they’re gonna lose it in 12 months. They know that, we know that, so I don’t see them putting a lot of money in – let’s just be realistic, if you’re winning by 70% the other party’s not going to hold it, it’s going to flip right back.”

“There is nothing more personal than an individual’s genetic information,” said Idaho’s Republican Attorney General Raúl Labrador in a March 24 consumer alert, “and allowing that to be sold off to the highest bidder raises serious consumer protection concerns for privacy. I want to make sure that 23andMe customers in Idaho have every opportunity to protect their genetic data.”
North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson, a Democrat, agreed in a March statement.
“Your genetic data is your most personal, confidential data, and you should be able to protect who has access to it,” Jackson said. “You have the power to delete your data now — please act quickly.”
 What state and federal laws protect the privacy of your genetic data?

Dr. Adam Brown, a Washington, D.C.-based emergency physician and the founder of a health care strategy firm, deleted his information on 23andMe as soon as he learned of the bankruptcy filing, he told Stateline.
For him, the bankruptcy begs a vital question that federal and state laws don’t fully address: What happens to your genetic data when the company holding it collapses?
Federal protections are flimsy. States have beefed up their genetic privacy laws in recent years, but many experts say they don’t go far enough.












There actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.


– Dr. Adam Brown, emergency physician and founder of a health care strategy company




23andMe has said the bankruptcy will not change how it stores, manages or protects its trove of sensitive customer information. In a news release issued shortly after the bankruptcy announcement, the company said any potential buyers would have to agree to comply with 23andMe’s consumer privacy policy and all applicable laws. When contacted by Stateline, the company declined to comment beyond what it has published in news releases and information it posted for customers on its website.
But once the data is in the hands of another company, that company could change its privacy policy at any time, experts noted.
“Once you get to the point of bankruptcy court, there may not be those same guarantees or the same ethos a new company may have around privacy protections for consumers,” Brown said.
“I want people to understand there actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.”

The process is simple: Mail in a saliva sample and the company uses it to build an individual genetic profile that can reveal not only a person’s family connections, but also health insights such as their risk of developing a disease like cancer or Alzheimer’s.
This valuable personal data underpins a direct-to-customer genetic testing market that was valued at $1.93 billion globally in 2023 and is expected to grow, according to market research firm Grand View Research.
23andMe was an industry giant until its stock price plummeted following a massive 2023 data breach that affected the accounts of nearly 7 million customers. Then came the $30 million class-action lawsuit settlement.
The company declared bankruptcy in late March of this year and announced it’s up for sale.
A flurry of alerts from state attorneys general around the country soon followed. AGs from states including Alabama, Arizona, California, , Idaho, Kentucky, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Texas issued similar press releases that recommended customers ask the company to delete their genetic profile and destroy the saliva sample used to create it.
“We have robust state privacy laws that include data deletion rights, and I would encourage any Texan concerned about their data to exercise the right to have their data securely deleted,” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, said in an April statement.
Labrador similarly encouraged Idahoans to look at all genetic testing companies to see if they store a customer’s data.
Consumers may use the Consumer Reports App to request that direct-to-consumer genetic testing companies, including 23andMe, delete any personal data, the Idaho attorney general’s consumer alert said.
“Consumers who have submitted genetic samples to other companies should determine if their genetic information has been stored by that company,” the alert said. “If your data has been stored, you may request the company destroy any stored information either through the Consumer Reports App or through the company itself.”
The fear is that a new 23andMe owner could choose to use or share sensitive personal genetic data in ways the company’s current privacy policy doesn’t allow. There’s worry it could be used, for example, to inflate people’s life insurance premiums or expose them to employment discrimination.
And there aren’t many guardrails to prevent that from happening.
HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, doesn’t apply to companies like 23andMe. The landmark federal law protects patients’ sensitive health information when it’s handled by doctors, hospitals and health insurers. But direct-to-customer companies such as 23andMe or Ancestry aren’t considered health care providers, and their non-invasive saliva collection kit isn’t considered a medical test.
The main federal law that protects people from discrimination based on their genetic information is nearly 20 years old. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) was passed in 2008, long before the rise of at-home testing kits. It applies to employers and health insurers, but not to life insurance companies, mortgage lenders and other non-health entities. And it doesn’t explicitly protect epigenetic information, which is information about the way a person’s genes — and by extension, health — are affected by outside factors such as smoking, disease or stress.

 What states are doing to regulate genetic testing

In the past five years, at least 14 states have passed laws regulating direct-to-consumer genetic testing offered by companies like Ancestry and 23andMe. There’s variation, but generally the laws require companies to get customers’ express consent before using or sharing their data, and allow customers to request their genetic data be deleted and biological samples destroyed.
It’s a good start, but doesn’t go far enough, said Anya Prince, a University of Iowa law professor whose research focuses on health and genetic privacy.
Many of those state efforts were built around a model law developed by the Coalition for Genetic Data Protection, an industry group with two member companies: 23andMe and Ancestry.
As DNA testing kits exploded in popularity and attracted increased scrutiny from lawmakers, the coalition pushed to influence legislation and set industry standards. The privacy protections in the laws mirror what 23andMe and Ancestry were already doing with their own privacy policies, experts say.
“They do have some really sensible privacy protections,” said Prince. “It’s great that people can delete their genetic data, and it’s great that law enforcement needs a warrant to access it. But if a privacy advocate had written a model law, there would be the potential for more and broader protections.”
For example, she said, many of the state laws address privacy requirements just for direct-to-consumer DNA testing companies. If 23andMe’s data is bought by, say, a pharmaceutical company, those state laws no longer apply.
The coalition now appears to be inactive, its website defunct.
Since 2020, more than a dozen states have passed some version of a genetic information privacy law, including Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming, based on a Stateline analysis. This year, the Indiana legislature passed a bill that’s now headed to the governor’s desk. Bills have been introduced this year in other states, including West Virginia.

Prince said state laws rely too heavily on consumers to self-manage their data privacy. They’re expected to understand a company’s policy, when studies have shown the public often doesn’t read privacy notices nor fully understand how companies use their data. Further, many state laws don’t address how third parties, such as law enforcement, can access and use consumer genetic data.
It’s also not always clear how the laws will be enforced, or who’s responsible for oversight.
“In general, I think there’s a disconnect between how people think their privacy is protected and how it’s actually protected,” she said.
But a few states have enacted laws that are more robust. California, for example, has a genetic information privacy law, but also has a general data protection law, as well as a state version of the federal GINA law that extends genetic anti-discrimination protections into areas including housing, education and licensing.
Florida has beefed up its DNA privacy laws in recent years, making the using or selling of an individual’s DNA without informed consent a felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison and up to a $10,000 fine. Florida was also the first state to prohibit life, disability and long-term care insurance companies from using genetic information to determine coverage.

krisanapong detraphiphat/Getty Images) A central Iowa investment advisor accused of defrauding investors in a million-dollar Ponzi scheme is appealing the revocation of his business licenses.
Des Moines investment advisor Cory J. Dawkins of Elite Wealth Partners is asking a Polk County judge to review and overturn a decision by the Iowa Insurance Division to revoke his license and registration as an investment advisor and insurance producer.
Dawkins is also seeking an immediate stay of the license revocations, at least until a final decision is rendered in the case, to avoid “substantial and irreparable harm” to his business and reputation.
In court filings, Dawkins says he has spent his entire professional life in the insurance, banking and financial services industry.
“Since the Iowa insurance commissioner’s investigation began, my business has suffered an approximate 87% revenue drop,” he told the court. “Several negative articles about me have appeared online since the commissioner’s investigation began. These articles present a distorted view of the situation by falsely suggesting that clients have lost all their money and portraying me as the mastermind behind the investments.”
Dawkins said there is a “significant possibility his clients many recover their investments” and that he had “no decision-making authority in the underlying investments at issue.” He adds that if he is barred from the securities industry, efforts to recover his clients’ money  will be “substantially curtailed.”
Without court intervention, he argues, he will be forced to close his business, will be unable to pay the $2.3 million in restitution ordered by the division, and will have to file for bankruptcy protection.  He adds that with his professional identity being “intrinsically linked” to his role as a financial advisor, the revocation of his license “would cause me severe psychological distress that extends far beyond financial considerations.”
A hearing in the matter is now scheduled for May 30, 2025. The Iowa Insurance Division is seeking dismissal of the case, arguing that by statute Dawkins had 30 days to seek judicial review of its decision, but filed his case after 33 days had passed.
SEC said business was ‘actually a Ponzi scheme’
In 2022, the Iowa Insurance Division formally charged Dawkins, Elite Wealth Partners and EWP Permian Basin Fund II with securities fraud; performing unregistered activity as securities agents; committing acts that constituted grounds for discipline as investment advisors; and fraud or dishonest conduct as demonstrated through incompetence, untrustworthiness and financial irresponsibility.
According to the Iowa Insurance Division, Dawkins offered high-risk, unsecured investment opportunities that were not in his clients’ best interests. The division alleges the scheme was launched sometime before May 2019 when Dawkins spoke to a Polk County couple about investing in EWP Permian Basin Fund II, whereby the couple’s money would be used to back a company that was purportedly purchasing oil wells.
According to the division’s findings of fact, EWP was not actually buying wells and had no assets to secure the notes that were issued to investors. The representations made to the Polk County couple and to other subsequent investors by Dawkins were “untrue” and amounted to securities fraud, according to the division.
EWP, the division found, was set up as a vehicle through which people could invest in an entity called the Heartland Drilling Fund. Dawkins failed to review Heartland’s financial statements and “exhibited significant uncertainty” as to which oil and gas interests were actually held by Heartland, the division found.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the division noted, would later conclude that promised returns to investors “were little more than an illusion and were actually a Ponzi scheme.”
Dawkins and Elite Wealth collected thousands of dollars in fees related to their investment transactions. Dawkins, however, had a conflict of interest by acting as both an investment advisor and a self-interested promoter of EWP, the division concluded. He also was alleged to have steered investors to a “very high risk” entity called the Carson Oil Field Development Fund II without disclosing all of the risks involved.
By 2021, the division found, Dawkins and Elite Wealth should have known they were recommending investments “that had numerous characteristics of a fraudulent Ponzi scheme,” with initial investors being paid from proceeds generated by newer investors.
Division cites ‘heartbreaking’ effect on investor
One of the alleged victims in the scheme was a 19-year-old Iowa State University student whose father had recently died of cancer. The division said it found her subsequent testimony about her dealings with Dawkins to be “simply heartbreaking.”
The young woman, whose name is redacted from public filings in the case, had invested $188,000 of her father’s money with Dawkins, according to the division.
“We needed money to pay for a funeral,” the woman testified at a hearing. “We simply had my dad’s body in a freezer for two weeks. So, we were really struggling, and we owed a whole bunch of our family members money. And we just kind of proceeded because we were so desperate for funeral money to pay for his gravestone and to pay the mortgage on our home … I guess my dad already chose that investment. So we just kind of went with whatever he had … And if he trusted Cory with that market on that, then I just went ahead with it.”
Dawkins, the division found, later accepted no responsibility for steering the student toward the high-risk investment, stating that Dawkins “absurdly claimed” that although he was a fiduciary, his introduction of the EWP investment opportunity to the student was not a recommendation of any kind.
In its findings of fact, the division said it found Dawkins’ testimony at a hearing on the matter to be “wholly untrustworthy, leaving us with the unmistakable impression that Dawkins was willing to say practically anything” to avoid accountability.
The division stated that losses by 15 investors, including interest, totaled $2,371,618.
Iowa Insurance Commissioner Douglas Ommen revoked the investment advisor registrations of Dawkins and Elite Wealth, revoked the insurance producer licenses of Dawkins and Elite Wealth, and permanently barred EWP from issuing or offering securities of any kind in Iowa.
Ommen also ordered EWP to pay $2.3 million in restitution, with $1.9 million of that amount payable immediately, and the remaining $400,000 payable no later than March 31, 2026. Ommen’s order also specifies that Dawkins and Elite Wealth are also held liable for the $2.3 million in restitution.
Dawkins has not responded to requests for comment from Iowa Capital Dispatch, but SEC records indicate he, Elite Wealth and EWP have denied all of the division’s allegations.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/gavel-cash.jpg,,,2025-05-02 18:07:50.593998

(Photo courtesy the Doña Ana County Clerk's Office)Money can’t buy you love, but it can get you a $55 New Mexico marriage license this summer.
New Mexico Marriage license fees will more than double next month from the current $25 fee thanks to Senate Bill 290, sponsored by Sen. Linda Trujillo (D-Santa Fe) during the legislative session held earlier this year. Out of the total new charge, the county clerk’s office keeps $20; another $20 will go to the state’s Children’s Trust Fund; and $15 will benefit each county’s general fund.
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signed the bill on April 8 and the fee increase goes into effect on June 20. 

According to the fiscal impact report, the fee increase is estimated to bring in an additional $195,000 in revenue each year – including about $32,500 for the Children’s Trust Fund, which currently receives most of its revenue from special license plate sales. The fund is administered by the Children, Youth and Families Department’s Family Services Division. Trust fund grants are awarded to “community-based organizations” throughout the state working to help prevent or treat child abuse and neglect. 
Doña Ana County Clerk Amanda López Askin told Source NM that the marriage license fee has not increased since the 1990s, and previous efforts to pass an increase failed. 
“This is my seventh year that I’m starting [as county clerk]. We have been pushing for an increase that was, I think, reasonable, but also would be impactful for each of the counties in terms of their funds,” López Askin said. However, she noted: “It’s not just about increasing revenue. It’s also about collectively supporting children across the state.”
New Mexico’s license fee will still be on the lower side, compared to neighboring states such as Texas and Arizona, which both charge over $80, according to the Doña Ana County Clerk’s Office. Doña Ana County Chief Deputy County Clerk Caroline Zamora said many people from El Paso, Texas travel to her office for marriage licenses because of the cheaper fee.

David Wasinger watches the Missouri Senate on the first day of the 2025 legislative session (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).The Missouri Senate appears on the verge of rekindling a 50-year-old fight over the role of the lieutenant governor, triggered in part by the five hours of budget debate this week.
At the start of Thursday’s session, Lt. Gov. David Wasinger recognized himself to speak, then quoted state Sen. Joe Nicola expressing his frustration at the short time allowed to read and understand the $49.7 billion spending package.
Wasinger said he was traveling in the state during the budget debate and heard similar complaints. 
“The perceptions of the folks are the same perception that the senator has outlined,” Wasinger said. “So to give you a heads up, I will be, either yet this session be taking a far more active role, or it may happen next session, because I think some rules need to be changed within this chamber.”
Wasinger did not mention during his speech that his office budget was cut in the Senate Appropriations Committee, chaired by state Sen. Lincoln Hough of Springfield, who Wasinger defeated in the 2024 GOP primary. He lost one of the eight staff positions in his office, which is already the smallest of all statewide elected officials.
 Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin, R-Shelbina, speaks during a March GOP press conference at the midpoint of the legislative session (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
Friday morning, Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin — who by the rules holds the power to choose committee members, refer bills and decide parliamentary questions — used a social media post to slap back at Wasinger’s remarks.
Wasinger was out of line giving a speech in the Senate chambers, O’Laughlin said, because that is  “a right reserved for senators.”
“He advised that he would be introducing new rules maybe next session,” O’Laughlin wrote. “Uh…..no. He does not have the authority to do this because he is not a senator. He also advised that he would be using the senate caucus staff. Also no.”
If Wasinger wants change, she wrote, “one way to be helpful is to not insult the entire Senate body in a five-minute speech.”
Wasinger, like Nicola, never held public office before winning election in November. His campaign promised he would be “challenging the Jefferson City establishment” if elected but he has not attempted to exercise the kinds of powers generally inherent in the job of presiding over a parliamentary body.
In his speech from the dais, Wasinger said that while he ran as an outsider, he had remained silent because he wanted to observe the chamber.
“I didn’t want to come in and, you know, begin throwing hand grenades,” Wasinger said.
If Wasinger tries to exert some sort of authority over the Senate, he would run headlong into a five-decade old Missouri Supreme Court ruling that diminished the already meager role of the lieutenant governor. 
 “Full-time Phelps” case

In 1972, Bill Phelps was elected lieutenant governor, the first Republican to win the office since 1928.

He promised he would be a “full-time” lieutenant governor, despite the lack of actual responsibilities in the office. Along with being ready to take over upon the death, disability or impeachment of the governor, the officeholder is “ex officio president of the senate.” In that role, the Constitution says, the lieutenant governor may join in Senate debate when it sits as a committee of the whole and cast the deciding vote in the case of ties.
As Phelps took office in 1973, the Senate changed its rules to put all substantive powers of the presiding officer in the hands of the president pro tem, elected from the members. The rules even allowed the president pro tem to dismiss the lieutenant governor from the dais.
And when then-state Sen. Bill Cason took the gavel from Phelps over his objections on the final day of the 1973 session, Phelps took the case to the Missouri Supreme Court.
At first, the case was only over the rule allowing the pro tem to relieve the lieutenant governor of the gavel. That rule, the 6-1 court said, was unconstitutional.
The pro tem must yield, Judge James Finch wrote, when the “lieutenant governor is present and desirous of exercising his role as presiding officer of the senate.”
That didn’t end the controversy.
The opinion was issued in November 1973, just before the start of the 1974 session. The courts were forced to issue a clarification when Phelps also contended the rules giving the pro tem the power to name committees, assign bills and rule on parliamentary questions were invalid.
The court quashed that argument. The lieutenant governor may hold the gavel if he or she wishes, but cannot use any power inherent in the role of presiding officer because those duties had been assigned elsewhere under the rules.
The Senate has the power to write rules to govern its proceedings, subject only to limits in the Constitution, the court decided.
“The powers and functions referred to…are not given to the lieutenant governor in (directly by the constitutional) or anywhere else in the Constitution,” the unanimous court ruled.
In a statement Thursday afternoon, Wasinger said he hopes to reduce the amount of time “wasted on the senate floor” where “arcane senate rules stall progress on or completely block good legislation that would improve the lives of Missourians.”
His goal, he said, is to remove those impasses.
“Many other states have made reforms to their senate rules, and it is time Missouri does so as well,” Wasinger said. “This isn’t about any individual senator – it’s about a system in Jefferson City in much need of common sense reforms.”
O’Laughlin, in her response to his speech, said Wasinger needs to learn the lesson she learned, that it takes more than certainty about the wisdom of an idea to accomplish anything in the Senate.
“Lesson One: Develop a personal relationship with each senator and offer to help navigate what is an extremely complicated system,” O’Laughlin wrote. “This is how you get something done. Ultimately it’s the ONLY way.”
A mocking voice from the rank and file of the Senate showed Wasinger will have more, not less, work to do after his speech. As he closed his speech, he invited members to contact his chief of staff, Katie Ashcroft, with any ideas for reforming the rules.
State Sen. Mary Elizabeth Coleman, a Republican from Arnold, responded in kind on social media.
“If you have any ideas how @davidwasinger could do his job better,” she wrote, “please let Karen in my office know.”

(Photo By Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)What began as a session focused on how to spend Virginia’s projected multi-billion surplus has ended with Gov. Glenn Youngkin yanking nearly $900 million out of the state budget — bracing for the economic aftershocks of President Donald Trump’s new administration.
At the start of the 2025 legislative session both Youngkin and members of Virginia’s General Assembly had their eyes on how best to use the windfall. But after Trump took office in late January, Youngkin announced Friday that he was setting aside a $900 million cushion to prepare for potential federal impacts. 
A good portion of the money stems from cutting one-time capital projects at colleges and universities and other public facilities which Youngkin said are still in the planning stages and haven’t yet entered construction. 
Amid Trump’s cuts to federal workers, congressional plans to trim federal funding, and fresh tariffs rattling international trade, Youngkin has repeatedly emphasized “short-term risks” and “short-term disruptions” as reasons to hold back spending. 
“As President Trump rightfully resets trade imbalances and restores fiscal responsibility in DC,” Youngkin said as he announced he was signing the state budget on Friday. “Those short term disruptions, I think, require us to be responsible and not spend 100% of this forecasted surplus today.”
House Minority Leader Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, commended Youngkin’s actions as “prudent” in a statement issued on Friday. He added that “Virginia is better positioned to weather whatever comes next.”
Senate Majority Leader Scott Surrovell, D-Fairfax expressed frustration in a call with reporters Friday afternoon. 
“I’m glad to see the governor is finally agreeing with us that the Virginia economy has some serious risk due to the actions of President Trump and Elon Musk,” Senate Surovell said on the call following Youngkin’s announcement. 
However, he criticized Youngkin for not conferring with lawmakers on his budget cuts. 
“He should have had a dialogue with us during the session so he could try to reach a mutual understanding or compromise about it, instead of showing up at the last minute, $900 million out of our budget,” Surrovell said. 
 Signed and vetoed bills 

Meanwhile, the governor may have pleased many lawmakers by deciding to sign bills he had previously tried to alter.  
When the legislature convened last month to review his amendments, they chose not to accept many of the amendments or substitutions he proposed when they sent the bills back to him for final signature or veto. They’d also accepted his recommendations in part on some of the bills as well.
“There are a lot of bills that I think are very interesting that I hadn’t seen before that we tried to make a little better,” Youngkin said. “Didn’t get the amendments passed, but I’m going to sign them because I think they actually are pretty decent bills.” 
For instance, Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico saw several of his returned bills signed to include an overhaul of Standards of Learning testing procedures and a bill to require social media companies verify the age of users and place time limits for minors under 16. Delegates Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax and Josh Thomas, D-Prince William, respectively carried the House versions of the bills.
The governor also vetoed bills that had been sent back to him with his amendments rejected. 
Such was the case with proposals from Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Chesterfield, and Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News, that would create a right to contraception in Virginia. The lawmakers have stressed in recent years that state-level protections could be needed if two U.S. Supreme Court cases upholding contraception rights were overturned. 
After the fall of Roe v. Wade, the federal case that had protected abortion access, Justice Clarence Thomas expressed interest in revisiting the court’s previous contraception rulings. While his counterparts have not signaled similar interest, some states have sought to restrict contraception, while others have worked to shore up protections. 
Like last year, Youngkin tried to amend Hashmi and Price’s bills to line up with the Supreme Court, which the lawmakers  said “gutted” the bills and missed the point. The Democratic-controlled legislature rejected his substitute, and he later rejected their bills altogether — just as he did this year. 
 Other budget bits

Meanwhile, on Friday, Youngkin celebrated some of the ways the state budget will support people, including investments in maternal health, which drew cheers from attendees. Both Youngkin and Democratic lawmakers had emphasized the need for legislation and funding to address maternal health disparities in the state, and the governor has already backed several bills carried by Democrats as well. 
The budget also includes $50 million for disaster response relief in Southwest Virginia and $50 million for community flood protection funding. A years-long effort — which had previously failed — to budget $50 million to overhaul Richmond’s combined sewage overflow system survived this time around. 
Following Richmond’s water crisis earlier this year, when water treatment plant failures left the region with unsafe drinking water for nearly a week, Youngkin also announced  plans to invest $25 million in drinking water infrastructure. 
He received applause from the audience when he mentioned the budget’s investment in education — $834 million in public education, which includes lifting support caps, investments for English language learners, investment in special education, and $7.5 million earmarked to help reduce child care waitlists. There’s also $134 million, he said, to fund “much deserved bonuses for our teachers.” 
Youngkin also emphasized that the budget includes funding for Medicaid — a program that may still face some jeopardy in the state amid federal actions. Should congress cut federal spending, Virginia’s 2018 expansion, which affects roughly 630,000 people, could be at risk. 
Some lawmakers have suggested that a special session might be needed to figure out how to cover those costs if that happens, while Youngkin said Friday he believes there are ways to streamline the program’s operations in the state to look for “waste, fraud and abuse.” 
As it’s his final year as governor, Youngkin said he plans to address his cuts to capital projects in a “caboose budget” later this year. In that proposal he can outline what he envisions the legislature with as they head into the  2026 legislative session under whoever the new governor ends up being. 
“We can postpone the final appropriation for these very worthy projects and enable the General Assembly to take it back up in January,” Youngkin said. “I would really like to include them in my introduced caboose budget, and then the General Assembly can get to work.”

Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) on Friday described President Donald Trump’s May 1 executive order eliminating funding for NPR and PBS.
Entitled “Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Biased Media,” the order directs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to cease current and future direct and indirect funding “consistent with my Administration’s policy to ensure that Federal funding does not support biased and partisan news coverage.” It also directs the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services secretary to determine whether PBS or NPR “(or any successor organization)…are complying with the statutory mandate that ‘no person shall be subjected to discrimination in employment . . . on the grounds of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex.’ In the event of a finding of noncompliance,” the order continues, “the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall take appropriate corrective action.”
Luján, the ranking member of the Commerce Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Media, said in a statement the “unlawful” order, signed “in the dark of night,” will “strip New Mexicans of vital access to public programming that educates, entertains, and keeps us safe. For decades, NPR and PBS have delivered news, entertainment, and much more to New Mexicans, especially in rural and Tribal communities. Public media, like NPR, PBS, and their local affiliates, provide critical information to New Mexicans in all corners of the state — including during disasters and emergencies when our rural communities rely on public media the most.”
Moreover, Luján’s statement noted, “this illegal executive order is an attempt by President Trump to strip New Mexicans of vital public services that thousands rely on day-to-day. The President is disregarding CPB’s authority and working to prevent New Mexicans from accessing free news, educational programming, and emergency alerts. Defunding NPR and PBS will leave New Mexicans in the dark when they need information the most.”
Local NPR affiliate KUNM General Manager Richard Towne, in a statement provided to Source, agreed with Luján’s characterization of the order, writing:
“In my view, the EO does not have the legal basis for enforcement.  This is because CPB is an independent non-profit corporation, not a government agency.  The Public Broadcasting Act of 1967 protects CPB against political meddling through Congressional funding for two years of funding.”
Towne notes that the CPB is currently funded by Congress “with White House approval” through Sept. 30, 2027, so Trump’s executive order bypasses Congress.
Trump’s order impacts approximately $540,000 in CPB funding for KUNM over the next two years, he said. For public radio and television together, the impact is more than $11 million over the next two years, he noted, adding: “This is not chump change.”
New Mexico PBS General Manager and CEO Franz Joachim sent Source a similar comment, also noting that Trump’s EO “is a clear violation of the 1st amendment and the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, which created the Corporation for Public Broadcasting as a firewall against federal interference how our federal funding is used.” Federal funding of public media, he added, “is essential and irreplaceable. Government should fund the free distribution of information that saves lives and changes lives. 
Towne also shared a letter he received Friday afternoon from CPB President and CEO Patricia Harrison that says while Trump’s executive order “is concerning, we believe it has no effect on CPB, since CPB is not a federal agency subject to the President’s authority.” As such, “CPB will not be adding any additional conditions or restrictions on our Community Service Grants. Payments will continue to go to our grantees per their grant agreements.”
Harrison’s letter also noted that a few days prior to the executive order, the Trump administration “sent emails to three members of CPB’s Board of Directors stating they are fired effective immediately. We immediately filed a lawsuit to say the Administration has no authority to terminate any of CPB’s board members. A U.S. District Court Judge ruled in favor of holding a hearing on our motion for a temporary restraining order, which seeks to block the president’s actions until the case can be fully heard. The hearing is scheduled for May 14. 
That being said, Harrison acknowledged rumors that the administration intends to try to pull back $1.1 billion from CPB’s forthcoming budget,. The CPB board met Friday to discuss these issues.
“I am proud of the resilience and dedication I have seen across the system,” Harrison’s letter concludes. “Your efforts ensure that public media remains a cornerstone of our shared democracy. Together, we will navigate these challenges, guided by our shared commitment to service, education, and community.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/kunmdj-1024x473.jpg,,,2025-05-02 18:07:50.593998

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — The state’s attorney general called Friday for Oklahoma’s commissioner of mental health to be fired, a day after the agency she oversees warned lawmakers that it will not be able to pay its employees later this month.  
Attorney General Gentner Drummond said the governor needs to fire Commissioner Allie Friesen, who heads the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services, after legislators revealed they had learned that the agency expected to run out of funds as early as Wednesday. On Friday, they said the agency shifted that payroll shortfall date to May 21.
The payroll issue is the latest in a series of reports of financial disarray and shortfalls at the agency, which has an annual budget of about $610 million and slightly more than 2,000 employees. The agency is the subject of a handful of probes, including from lawmakers, the state auditor and inspector, and a “special investigator” who will be appointed by Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt.
The agency reported a $43 million deficit and requested $6.2 million to make ends meet through the end of the fiscal year, but officials haven’t been able to explain how they reached these numbers or publicly answer questions about their payroll costs, drawing the frustration of state lawmakers.

Drummond on Friday called the disarray at the mental health department a “financial meltdown” and “nothing short of government malpractice.”
“Gov. Stitt should have fired his failed agency head months ago when we first learned of her incompetent leadership,” he said in a statement. “I am calling on Gov. Stitt to immediately terminate Commissioner Allie Friesen and seek guidance from industry experts so he can appoint a new leader who is up to the job.”
Stitt appointed Friesen to the role in January 2024 and said Friday that she continues to have his support. Friesen has blamed many of the financial issues on her predecessors.
Stitt said in a statement Friday that Drummond should focus on prosecuting criminals rather than those he has “targeted as political enemies.”
“I’ve tasked Allie Friesen with the difficult job of shining a light on an agency that has operated in darkness for far too long,” he said. “Anytime bureaucracy is disturbed, those committed to the status quo will try and stop (the) truth from being revealed. The same thing is happening to President (Donald) Trump as he tries to clean up the bureaucracy in D.C. Commissioner Friesen is going to continue to do this work.” 
In a later statement, he said the issues emerging from the agency are the result of “years of mismanagement” and did not happen overnight. Stitt outlined a plan of action in a letter to legislative leaders, including bringing in a “highly respected, independent financial expert” from outside the agency to temporarily take control of the department’s finances, officially naming a special investigator, and directing the head of the Oklahoma Health Care Authority, along with mental health agency officials, to conduct a “top-to-bottom review of all Medicaid and federally funded functions within the agency.”
Friesen did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Drummond’s call for her termination, but said in an earlier statement that agency leaders are working with Stitt’s office and state leaders to “navigate a difficult but necessary period of operational and fiscal reform” and ensure continuity of services and stability of the workforce. 
“This process, while challenging, is essential to strengthening financial systems, improving oversight, and ensuring operational integrity,” Friesen said. 
Payroll issues
Rep. Mark Lawson, R-Sapulpa, said he received a call Thursday afternoon from the agency’s legislative liaison informing him officials don’t have enough money to make payroll next week.

Lawson, who chairs a special House committee investigating the agency’s finances, said Friday that payroll issues have just now surfaced as a result of “significant mismanagement” or “unique budget practices” within the department. 
“So tracing money, where it’s coming from and where it’s going, has been challenging and problematic for staff,” he said. “And as they’ve continued to do their work, they’re discovering more problems, and being unable to meet payroll is just the most recent one.” 
The payroll shortfall will likely affect how hundreds, if not thousands, of state employees feed their families, Lawson said. He said based on his understanding, the payroll issues only affect state employees and not provider contracts. 
Lawmakers previously pointed out that in the last year, the agency hired 20 employees with salaries of $100,000 or more. Another 12 had their salaries raised to that level and 13 were hired with salaries under six figures. The average employee at the mental health department earns just under $52,000. 
Lawson said his committee plans to meet Monday morning in light of the payroll shortfall to question mental health leaders. He said it is possible the Legislature could make an emergency appropriation, but to do so would require support of two-thirds of the House and Senate. A recommendation could come after Monday’s hearing and after Republicans and Democrats meet privately to assess interest and need. 
The special House committee Lawson chairs has now met three times to probe the agency’s disarray and has questioned the qualifications of its interim chief financial officer and why the financial issues exist. 
He said it’s unclear if the $6.2 supplemental appropriation the agency has requested will be enough to get them through the fiscal year, which ends June 30. 
“You know, we’ve got a lot of questions on if we appropriate this money,” he said. “Is it indeed the right amount? Does that indeed get us through the rest of the fiscal year?”
The House wants “good and accurate” information, which can take time, Lawson said, but he’s glad the department proactively reached out.

“The last thing I want is to make a bad situation worse and ask a department who has identified budget problems to make rash decisions or quick decisions that are not good decisions and give us more bad information,” Lawson said. “I do feel like there’s a lot going on at that department to make good decisions, but unfortunately, I think it’s going to take a lot of time.” 
House Speaker Kyle Hilbert wrote that he’d had a previous meeting with agency leadership and was assured there would be no cash flow issues before the end of May, according to an email sent Thursday night to House lawmakers, which was obtained by Oklahoma Voice.
He wrote that Friesen first learned of the payroll shortage at 3 p.m. Thursday. 
“We are out of time and will not accept any more delays. Individuals at ODMHSAS have known about this shortfall for months yet it is the final month of (the) legislative session and we still do not have answers. This is unacceptable,” he said Friday in a statement. “We will get to the bottom of how this happened and who is responsible. The people of Oklahoma deserve better than this dysfunction. Our top priority remains maintaining vital services while also being good stewards of taxpayer dollars.”

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Kate Zanger has worked in higher education for 49 years, more than half of that time at Clarke University in Dubuque. The vice president for student life is set to retire at the end of the spring semester.
In her career working at universities in Washington, D.C., and New York, Zanger said she has never seen actions taken against international students like the mass changes to Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) statuses and visa revocations that swept across the U.S.
This is a “time of fear” for international students, said Zanger, the principal designated school official at Clarke working with the Student and Exchange Visitor program. While many students’ statuses have been restored at this point, officials working with impacted students say there will be social and economic consequences down the road.
“For U.S. citizens, this time is kind of frightening, because of everything that you hear that’s going on with the government,” Zanger said. “Imagine being an international student trying to figure this out.”
Iowa universities confirm more than a dozen impacted students
Of the 40 Iowa public universities, community colleges and private institutions contacted by the Iowa Capital Dispatch and the 28 that responded, 13 acknowledged having some number of university students or recent graduates with changed SEVIS statuses.
The only state university to provide specific numbers of international students was the University of Northern Iowa, reporting two students with terminated — and reinstated — SEVIS statuses. Representatives from the University of Iowa and Iowa State University both stated there were students at their institutions who have seen their status change, but declined to say how many students and how many have been reinstated.
At least four UI students have been impacted by student status revocations, and are suing the Department of Homeland Security for the actions taken against them. According to reporting by the Iowa State Daily, at least two ISU students have seen their visas revoked.
Other colleges confirming impacted international students include Coe College, Clarke University, Eastern Iowa Community Colleges, Mount Mercy University, Luther College, Graceland University, Des Moines Area Community College, Southeastern Community College and St. Ambrose University.
All respondents saw either one or two student statuses change, and all but two students across all of the institutions have seen their statuses restored.

Some students have also seen their visas revoked with much more aggressive language than in the past, said Karen Edwards, Grinnell College dean for International Student Affairs and principal designated school official.
Grinnell College refused to give specific numbers of impacted students, however, Edwards said around 20% of the student body, or around 340 students, are international, and some have seen both their SEVIS status change and their visa canceled.
While Edwards said F1 student visa revocation as a result of criminal activity is nothing new, and because these visa holders have “duration of status benefits,” they are not required to immediately leave the country if their visa is revoked, but they will have to reapply for a visa if they do travel abroad.
In the past when students were notified of their visa revocation, Edwards said information would be included explaining all of this. Now, language on these notices is “harsher,” she said, warning the holder that they are subject to detention or deportation to a country not their own.
Edwards said the termination of SEVIS records is incredibly troublesome, as it is the record giving international students lawful status to study and complete other requirements and enabling information access and sharing for universities when needed.
“When a SEVIS record is terminated, for example, someone who’s here can’t record their address update, or can’t reduce their course load in their final semester, or can’t submit other applications, a transfer to a new program or graduate level,” Edwards said. “So it really does immediately mean they can’t function as a lawful F1 student here.”
Even alumni who have continued to stay in the U.S. lawfully under their visa and SEVIS status have been impacted, Edwards said.
Uncertainty and fear for students
Moving away from campus. Trying to find legal representation. Missing a commencement ceremony and having to figure out how to retrieve an earned degree. These are some of the hardships endured by international students with terminated SEVIS statuses and revoked visas, according to university officials.
At St. Ambrose University in Davenport, two students saw a change in their SEVIS status and chose to leave the campus. Ricki Grover, international student advisor and study abroad coordinator, said in an email the university provided financial support to the students through its student emergency fund, helped them connect with legal resources and ensured they’d be able to complete their coursework over the summer.
While these statuses have now been reinstated, Grover said the students have not returned to campus.
Some universities have legal experts on hand to help impacted international students, Zanger said, but smaller colleges like Clarke don’t. She said she reached out to larger institutions to see if an attorney would be available to represent the one Clarke student who saw their status terminated, but no one had the time. It can be difficult to find an immigration lawyer who has the expertise to work with students, she said.
Students have told her they’re choosing to stay in the U.S. for the summer out of fear that they won’t be let back in to finish their studies, and Zanger said she’s recommended all international students carry with them the correct documents when traveling.
Others have said if they can’t reenter the country, then they don’t really want to be here anyway.
“We try to assure them that we want you here at Clarke, we want you to graduate from Clarke, you bring a lot to our campus community,” Zanger said.
The one student at Graceland University in Lamoni who saw their visa revoked was supposed to walk in the university’s commencement ceremony on April 27, but couldn’t, despite their visa being reinstated that weekend. Graceland spokesperson Shane Adams said in an email the university will work with the student to ensure they still receive their degree.
“We were disappointed that the student was not able to walk with their classmates on Sunday,” Adams said in his email.
National actions could cause drop in international enrollment
International student enrollment in U.S. universities has been increasing over the past few years, with the 2024 Open Doors Report citing an increase of more than 25,000 students between the 2023-2024 and 2024-2025 academic years.
The U.S. has traditionally been viewed as a welcoming and supportive space for students, which Edwards said has made the country a higher education destination for those wishing to study abroad. She worries about how actions taken against international students will impact what she called the country’s fifth-largest export — higher education.
“I think right now, given the climate in the U.S. … if I was coming from another country, I might think twice about studying in the U.S.,” Zanger said, “which is very sad, because our international students bring a lot to each of the campuses they are part of.”
According to data from nonprofit NAFSA: Association of International Educators, in the 2023-2024 academic year alone, international students supported more than 378,000 jobs and contributed $43.8 billion to the U.S. economy. International students in Iowa have contributed nearly $272 million to the state economy and close to 1,900 jobs.
Beyond any economic impact these actions could have, Edwards said the diplomacy, goodwill and innovations that come with international students and the global perspectives and connections they bring will most likely be damaged.
“If we are less viewed as an education destination, that really places our whole way of thinking and learning at risk and it turns us into an isolationist space, as opposed to a global space with thinkers from all over the world,” Edwards said. “That’s what drew me to the field. That’s what makes me passionate about what I do and I see it at work here, because students from all over the world sit in the same classroom, (and) whether they’re talking about English literature or whether they’re doing a science project, it just brings a new voice to the table that helps everybody.”

The suit accuses the companies of receiving personal information through California’s state health insurance exchange.


One day after an investigation by CalMatters and The Markup, LinkedIn and Google were hit with a proposed class-action lawsuit alleging they improperly received confidential data from trackers on California’s health insurance exchange website. 
A California congressman, citing the investigation, then called on the federal Health and Human Services Department to investigate the exchange’s sharing of data to LinkedIn.
In the article, published this week, CalMatters and The Markup revealed how trackers on the website, coveredca.com, sent information on visitors to LinkedIn through a tool called the Insight Tag. As visitors filled out forms on the site, the trackers sent LinkedIn information about them, including whether they were pregnant, blind, transgender, or had experienced domestic abuse. The trackers also monitored information on visitors’ searches for medical providers and how often those visitors used prescription drugs.

How the state sent Californians’ personal health data to LinkedIn 
April 28, 2025April 27, 2025 




The government entity that operates the exchange, Covered California, has since removed the trackers. A spokesperson said they had been used as part of an advertising campaign that began in February 2024.
The lawsuit, filed in the Northern District of California, cites forensic testing by CalMatters and The Markup, as well as research by the plaintiff, to allege that LinkedIn and Google received health data from web trackers on coveredca.com without the knowledge or consent of users. The plaintiff in the suit is an anonymous California woman who alleges she filled out information on Covered California around June of last year, and had that information sent to LinkedIn and Google.
A proposed class action, the lawsuit seeks to represent everyone who had information transmitted to the tech companies by Covered California. The firm representing her, Bursor and Fisher, has a speciality in class-action suits, including in data privacy, and touts receiving a $100 million settlement from Google for alleged privacy violations in 2022. 
“LinkedIn and Google intentionally intercepted sensitive and confidential communications between Covered California and its customers,” the suit, which seeks to represent others similarly situated, reads. “LinkedIn and Google failed to receive consent for these interceptions.”
“LinkedIn and Google failed to receive consent.”Proposed class action lawsuit filed in federal court over sharing of sensitive data from California’s health insurance exchange.
The suit alleges that the tracking runs afoul of California and federal laws, including the California Invasion of Privacy Act, which requires consent before “communications” can be sent to third parties. The companies made similar violations under the federal Electronic Communications Privacy Act, according to the suit.
Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
A LinkedIn spokesperson referred to the company’s previous statement, saying that its policies “expressly prohibit customers from installing the Insight Tag on web pages that collect or contain sensitive data, including pages offering health-related services.” 
Millions of people in the state have received coverage through Covered California, set up under the Affordable Care Act as a way for Californians to quickly and easily shop for insurance and compare plans. In a statement posted online after publication of the  CalMatters and Markup story, the organization said it was “reviewing the nature and extent of sensitive consumer data and information that was inadvertently shared with LinkedIn.”
Since the tracking was revealed, the story has also drawn the attention of lawmakers. Rep. Kevin Kiley, who called the sharing of data “incredibly disturbing,” sent a letter to the Department of Health and Human Services asking it to investigate whether the tracking may have violated privacy laws like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. Kiley is a Republican whose California district stretches from suburban Sacramento to Death Valley.
Among other questions, the letter asks the agency to determine how many people were affected by the tracking, and how “something like this [can] be prevented in the future.”

(Image courtesy of HOK Architecture)Construction is ramping up at a new state psychiatric hospital as Washington works to meet continued demand for treatment of people accused of crimes.
The state broke ground in October on the new 350-bed facility at Western State Hospital in Pierce County. Work began in December, but picked up last month and passersby will start to see the building develop in June, said state Department of Social and Health Services spokesperson Jessica Nelson. 
For years, the Department of Social and Health Services has been under court oversight to improve unconstitutionally long wait times for mental health treatment and evaluations for criminal defendants who are incompetent to stand trial. The new hospital is key to complying with a court-ordered settlement in the case known as Trueblood.
Washington is required to conduct an evaluation within 14 days and offer inpatient competency restoration treatment within seven days. The state has long struggled to meet those guidelines and has paid hundreds of millions in fines as a result.
At the groundbreaking for the new hospital in October, then-Gov. Jay Inslee noted the rise in need for these services over the past few years. 
“This exponential growth was not sustainable unless we really put pedal to the metal on our building programs with what we’re doing today,” Inslee said. “So we have invested tremendous resources to respond to this tremendous challenge.”
In February, the most recent month for which comprehensive state data is available, the average wait time for a jail-based evaluation was about 11 days. Inpatient evaluations took five to six days. Admissions for treatment took nearly seven days at Eastern State Hospital, near Spokane, and less than six days at Western State. In years past, this could take over a year. 
The new Western State Hospital will be the latest addition to the state’s bed capacity. 
In 2023, the state acquired and opened a psychiatric hospital in Tukwila for patients under civil commitments, freeing up space for criminal defendants at Western State. 
Last year, the state added another 86 beds at Eastern and Western State hospitals. 
In their capital budget passed last weekend, state lawmakers included $282 million for the final phase of construction at the new hospital. The budget now sits on Gov. Bob Ferguson’s desk. 
The hospital is aiming to help shift the focus at Western State more toward people entangled in the criminal justice system who need treatment and away from civil patients. Under that system, civil commitments would transfer to community-based facilities to get help.
Construction is expected to be completed between 2027 and 2029.

Over the last two years, “persistently rainy conditions made many forested areas too wet to harvest,” a logging industry rep told legislators.

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerSam Hartnett is a reporter with Community News Service, part of the University of Vermont’s Reporting & Documentary Storytelling program.A bill to help farms recoup losses due to extreme weather could bring forestry businesses into the mix as it makes its way across the Legislature.S.60 sets up a farm relief fund that lawmakers seem to agree should be accessible to loggers as well. Only farms would qualify for the money under the Senate’s initial plan, which came together after floods and freezes in recent years devastated Vermont agriculture.Over the last two years, “persistently rainy conditions made many forested areas too wet to harvest,” a rep from the Professional Logging Contractors of the Northeast told legislators last week in the House committee dealing with agriculture and forestry. Those conditions came alongside damage to roads and bridges due to flooding. Heavy mud seasons and warmer, wetter winters in particular can inhibit both the harvest and transport of timber, leaving loggers stuck.Lawmakers had already been looking at including foresters in the bill when the testimony came. Shortly after, a draft doing just that was introduced.“We expect the loggers impacted would be a fraction of the claims, but their losses from adverse  weather events cause great hardship, and giving loggers the opportunity to apply for emergency funds seems fair,” said Rep. Michelle Bos-Lun, D-Westminster, who had sponsored a nearly identical House bill that covered foresters.A typical forestry outfit’s business model looks a lot different from the average farm, but people in both industries are subject to extreme weather events hurting bottom lines. “Loggers have historically been left out of these relief bills,” said Rep. David Durfree, D-Shaftsbury. Flood relief efforts like the Business Emergency Gap Assistance Program didn’t extend funds to loggers as their losses were considered revenue loss, according to the logging organization.The inclusion of foresters raises questions about who or what would receive payments. Loggers often use sub-contractors for loading logs or trucking timber, and legislators need to determine if or how the fund could compensate those workers.“Clearly, there are different circumstances for a farmer than there are for a logging contractor, and the biggest one is that the logging contractor doesn’t generally own the property they are working on,” said Dana Doran, the rep from the logging group, told the House Committee on Agriculture, Food Resiliency and Forestry.In a phone call Monday, Doran was confident lawmakers would find a way to ensure everyone involved in a logging operation could be compensated.He believes the important part is setting up legislation to provide much needed relief for struggling foresters.As laid out earlier this year, the fund would help farms recover losses or reimburse them for unexpected costs. Those could include wages, wiped-out income from destroyed crops or repairs to roads. It would cover up to 50% of uninsured or uncovered losses, up to $150,000 per year for a farm. A review board would make the final call, with a turnaround coming at most 30 days from officials receiving an “administratively complete application,” under ideal circumstances.The updated version of the bill in the House committee in late April included two forestry operators on the review board alongside the previously planned group of state officials, farmers and farming orgs. Forest fires have also been added to the list of eligible extreme weather events.Legislators also added a limit on the proportion of the fund a single farm or forestry operation could receive at 5%. The maximum funding a single entity could receive from the program remains capped at $150,000. The bill is now being considered in the state Senate.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Proposed farmer relief fund for floods and more could now include loggers.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/logging-2-20230202.jpg?fit=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-02 17:09:21.384894

(USFWS)The Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks is asking anglers in the state to help with ongoing trout research projects.
Working with Montana State University, biologists are in their second year of tagging trout in the Big Hole, Beaverhead, Ruby and Madison rivers. The ongoing research project is aimed at understanding trout population declines in those waterways, and overall health concerns for fish in the Upper Missouri River Basin.
Anglers are asked to report any tagged fish that they catch, essentially working as “citizen scientists” to provide information on environmental conditions and other factors that contribute to the survival and mortality of trout.
“This is a great chance for anglers to take an active part in this research that will benefit the fishery,” said FWP Fisheries Manager Mike Duncan in a press release. “We need your help. Please report the tagged fish you catch.”
Each fish tag — colored blue or yellow — has a unique number and will be attached near the dorsal fin.

FWP says that anglers who catch a tagged fish should use clippers to remove the tag as close to the skin as possible while minimizing handling time and exposure to air for the fish, then submit a report for each tagged fish they catch from the four rivers mentioned above. These reports will include information such as the tag number, date, location, condition of the fish, gear type used, and whether the angler released or harvested the fish.
A how-to video on the process is available on FWP’s website.
FWP operates a rewards program as an incentive for anglers to take part and report tags. Reported blue tags will be entered into regular drawings for gear and fishing trips, while reports of yellow tags are each worth $100.
Some fish may still be carrying tags from last year, according to FWP, which may be covered in algae and less noticeable to anglers, but the same reporting process and reward opportunities apply to older tags.
Reports can be submitted by visiting mtcfru.org/msutag or by calling 406-994-2384.
Anglers and other river recreationists may also meet staff from MSU while on the river. These creel clerks will be interviewing recreational river users as part of the ongoing research effort.
The research project in 2024 after annual sampling the year before found fish numbers to be at or near historical lows in sections of the Upper Missouri River Basin. Since then, FWP has been working closely with MSU to study fish mortality, recruitment and health.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/13982951691_6da005c3eb_o-1024x714.jpg,,,2025-05-02 17:09:21.384894

Proceeds from the event fund educational programs that offer a chance for a better life. 
Held every Sunday in October and one weekend in April, the infamous prison rodeo is one of the highlights of the year for the hundreds of men incarcerated at the Louisiana State Penitentiary who participate in the events. 
Despite its controversies, the rodeo’s most ardent supporters are its participants, for whom the event is a rare bridge to the world outside Angola’s thousands of acres and an opportunity to financially support themselves and their education. 
Andrew Hundley, executive director of the Louisiana Parole Project, which assists formerly incarcerated people as they reenter society, likened Angola to a college campus. It’s an apt metaphor for Hundley, who completed correspondence courses at LSU while he was incarcerated at Angola. 
“There are a lot of opportunities there to use your time wisely, or use your time not so wisely,” Hundley said. “For the people who want to use their time wisely, they’re more than a dozen vocational programs that are there, from automotive repair to collision repair, carpentry, welding, plumbing, small engine repair, you name it.”

‘Wildest Show in the South’
The rodeo is unlike any professional rodeo. For starters, the 75 or so men who compete don’t receive any training. For many of them, the first time they mount a bull is just seconds before the gates open. 
While the men do receive safety vests and helmets, the lack of training makes it more dangerous than a traditional rodeo. After one event at the April 26 rodeo, one incarcerated person was seen falling multiple times trying to get out of the arena after his event, eventually having to be helped out of the mud. 
This rodeo — nicknamed “the Wildest Show in the South” — is also different because it offers unique events that add to the spectacle — like bull pinball. 
It works like this: a rodeo clown sets down hula hoops in the arena, and an incarcerated person stands in each one. A bull is released and the last man remaining in his hoop wins. 
A clown identified only as Rudy exchanged banter with the rodeo emcee over the arena’s public address system.
“Now what would make a human being get in one of them hoops?” Rudy asked during the show.  
“It’s kind of like trying to sign up for the Darwin Award,” the emcee replied, referencing the rhetorical honor given to people who contribute to evolution by removing themselves from the gene pool, usually through a foolish and dangerous act. 
The prison has held its rodeo since 1965 and has been the subject of frequent criticism. 
Operating as a farm on the site of a former slave plantation, Louisiana State Penitentiary has a brutal history. For much of its time, it has been known for indiscriminate violence. Even after significant reforms throughout the late 20th century, it is still the subject of controversy. 
Workers on the prison’s “farm line,” who pick the vegetables that help feed the prisoners, are currently suing the state, alleging dangerous working conditions. Inmates at Angola can earn a maximum of $8 a week, regardless of the type of work they do. 
Despite the danger and outside criticism, none of the dozen incarcerated men or formerly incarcerated men the Illuminator interviewed at the rodeo had a negative thing to say about the event. 
Assistant Warden Anne Easley sat in on all interviews the lluminator conducted at the rodeo. Only incarcerated people with trusty status, meaning they have served at least 10 years of their sentence and have good disciplinary records, were participating in the event and therefore available for interviews. 
In addition to rodeo participants, interviewees included inmate-instructors and incarcerated people selling crafts they made using skills learned at the prison. The craft fair, held outside the rodeo arena, has an atmosphere not unlike a flea market. It offers handmade goods including furniture, art and jewelry. Merchandise sales support the incarcerated people financially or finance prison organizations such as sobriety groups. 
“Y’all come to this rodeo to find out how people feel about it. If all of your views on a rodeo are negative, and you’re not getting all negative answers, then something’s off, right?,” Jeffrey Hilburn, editor of The Angolite, the prison’s news magazine, said in an interview. “But if you come here and you find out that an inmate who’s making a hobby craft … he’s going to get a good percentage of that money.” 
“His family doesn’t have to send him that money. His family can pay their taxes, gas bill, save enough and buy a dozen eggs for $10,” added Hilburn, who serving time for the 1991 second-degree murder of Mark Jones in Richland Parish. He was recently denied parole. 
But support for the rodeo, while widespread among incarcerated people and formerly incarcerated people, is not universal. 
Norris Henderson, now executive director of Voice of the Experienced, an organization that advocates for incarcerated people, was once held at Angola. Henderson was exonerated after 27 years of incarceration. As a volunteer in the prison infirmary, he saw first-hand the injuries of the rodeo participants. 
“To me, the rodeo was just this form of exploitation,” Henderson said. “This is kind of like the Roman Coliseum, where people come to cheer, not the humans in the arena, they come to cheer the animals? 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
‘This whole place has made me a different person’
The career training programs the rodeo finances are run by inmate-instructors, who are required to have the same certifications as those who teach the same courses at a community or technical college. 
There are 17 different career and technical education programs at the prison. According to a fact-sheet included in a souvenir rodeo program, the inmate-led reentry training and mentoring program saves the state $4 million a year. 
Among the instructors is Luther McFarland, the only incarcerated person with teaching certification from the American Welding Society. He is also certified by the National Center for Construction Education and Research.

Like most other instructors at Angola, McFarland is a “lifer,” meaning he’s serving a life sentence. McFarland, who does not have the possibility of parole, was convicted of the 2004 second-degree murder of Coulton Lyell Jr. in Metairie. 
McFarland has a welding certification from Baton Rouge Community College, which he received before the school ended its program at Angola due to budget constraints. McFarland said he has taught welding at Angola since 2010. 
“It really helped me build character … when you’re coming from the streets and you got guys from New Orleans … coming with some mindset,  it was really a challenge, but we got through it,” McFarland said of his time as an instructor. “It wasn’t easy, but we got through it.”  
The instruction has to start with basics, as many of his students have never handled basic tools. But eventually they get trained up enough to do serious work, McFarland said. Several of the barbeque grills he and his students had welded were on sale that Saturday. 
“We learn how to just get the guys up to a par so when they go home, they have the mindset to be able to work in this type of environment and know what to expect from them because it’s the same way,” McFarland said. 
McFarland said his work training his students to be welders when they’re released was the start of his legacy. Though not eligible for parole, he hopes he will receive clemency. In order to receive a sentence commutation, an individual must receive a favorable vote of the Pardon Board as well as approval from the governor. 
Two of McFarland’s former students came to visit their former instructor at the rodeo, including Austin McCraine, father to a newborn. McCraine served time for theft. He said he came back to the rodeo to pay homage to his friends and mentors. 
McCraine worked in welding for a year before moving up to a pipefitter’s job, which typically calls for more skills and experience – and pays better.
“I’ve been working there for almost a year now,” McCraine said. “This whole place has made me a different person.”

Students at the University of South […[...]","The Horseshoe of the University of South Carolina campus, Monday, Oct. 30, 2023 in Columbia, S.C.(File/Mary Ann Chastain/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — The federal government has restored the visa status of more than a dozen international students at South Carolina colleges. Still, a lawsuit filed by a University of South Carolina international student from Nigeria, arguing he was denied due process, continues amid ongoing changes to U.S. immigration policy.
Students at the University of South Carolina, Furman University and Clemson University were among more than 1,800 international students across the country who had lost their legal status changed with little to no explanation from the federal government in recent weeks.
After a flurry of legal challenges in federal courts nationwide, the government began reversing those terminations late last week and said it would issue new guidelines for canceling a student’s legal status.
Among those who saw their status reinstated, at least for now, was Matthew Ariwoola, 32, of Nigeria.
“Matthew’s status was revoked with no notice and no explanation. Just as suddenly, with just as little explanation his status was restored,” said ACLU of South Carolina spokesman Paul Bowers, whose organization is representing Ariwoola in court. “The reason we’re still fighting this is to defend his due process rights.”
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security previously referred the SC Daily Gazette to the U.S. Department of State. The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Ariwoola, a fourth-year doctoral chemistry student at USC, was scheduled to graduate in December.
But on April 8, USC staff informed Ariwoola and at least 11 other students they could not continue studying or teaching due to the change of their immigration status in a Homeland Security-maintained database.
USC staff then recommended in an email to Ariwoola included in court filings that he “depart the United States as soon as possible because you no longer have legal status in the United States.”
U.S. District Judge Jacquelyn Austin stepped in, granting and then extending a temporary order through May 16, to prevent Ariwoola’s detention or deportation while the case makes its way through the court system.
USC and Furman have since confirmed the status changes of impacted students — two at Furman and a dozen at USC — were reversed. Clemson did not respond to messages from the SC Daily Gazette about the status of impacted students at the Upstate university.
Just days after the reversals, the federal government revealed its expanded policy on reasons international students’ legal status can be terminated. An Immigration and Customs Enforcement document, filed this week in a federal court in Texas, said reasons for termination now include the revocation of the visas granted to students to enter the U.S.
Historically, students whose visas were revoked or expired have not lost their legal residency status and could stay in the U.S. to finish school. It only prevented their leaving the U.S. and returning without reapplying.
Ariwoola’s student visa expired in February.
Remarks made by Secretary of State Marco Rubio in March suggested the new administration’s stance would differ from past standards.
“Your visa is expired, your visa is revoked, you have to leave,” he told reporters. “There is no right to a student visa.””
Under the new guidance that has come in in court proceedings, Homeland Security officials also seem to have stripped students of their status simply if their names appeared in a criminal or fingerprint database, The Associated Press reported.
In the case of Akshar Patel, an international student studying information systems at the University of Texas in Arlington, Department of Homeland Security officials told the judge employees ran the names of student visa holders through an FBI database that lists missing persons, the names of suspects and arrests, even if charges were dropped or never filed.
In total, about 6,400 students were identified.
Police arrested Ariwoola in 2023 on a warrant out of Georgia for alleged “theft by deception,” a crime which can involve the use of in-person or cyber scams to steal from a victim. But according to the ACLU, Ariwoola had never contacted the accuser, and the prosecutor had dismissed all charges.
Even so, Ariwoola has no way of knowing for certain if that’s why the government changed his status. The attorneys have yet to fully respond to Ariwoola’s allegations.
Because Ariwoola’s status was restored, government lawyers wrote in court filings that they intend to ask the judge to dismiss the lawsuit if the student does not withdraw it before June 20.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/SC26-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-02 17:09:21.384894

(Photo by Jerry Cornfield/Washington State Standard)Religious leaders in Washington will be required to report child abuse or neglect, even when it is disclosed in confession, under a new law signed by Gov. Bob Ferguson on Friday.
“Protecting our kids, first, is the most important thing. This bill protects Washingtonians from abuse and harm,” Ferguson said, noting Washington is one of five states in which clergy are not currently mandated reporters.
It took Sen. Noel Frame, D-Seattle, three years to get the bill to the governor’s desk. Making sure disclosures during confidential conversations between a penitent and religious leader were not exempt was critical, she said.
“You never put somebody’s conscience above the protection of a child,” she said.
Senate Bill 5375 passed by margins of 64-31 in the House and 28-20 in the Senate. It takes effect July 27. 
It adds clergy members to the state’s list of individuals legally required to report suspected child abuse to law enforcement or the Department of Children, Youth and Families.
Clergy would join school personnel, nurses, social service counselors, psychologists, and many others with a duty to report when they have “reasonable cause to believe that a child has suffered abuse or neglect.”
A “member of the clergy” is defined in the legislation to cover any regularly licensed, accredited, or ordained minister, priest, rabbi, imam, elder, or similarly positioned religious or spiritual leader.
While disclosures in confession or other religious rites where the clergy member is bound to confidentiality are not exempt, religious leaders will retain their privilege to not be compelled to testify in related court cases or criminal proceedings.
More than half the states make clergy mandatory reporters and most exempt what is heard in a confessional. Washington will join several states, including New Hampshire and West Virginia where such conversations are not exempt.
“It says the church is not above the law, especially when it comes to protecting children,” said Mary Dispenza, a founding member of the Catholic Accountability Project and member of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests. “We know children will be safer as a result of passing this law.”
Removing the confessional privilege proved the most divisive provision in legislative debates. 
It’s the chief reason the Washington State Catholic Conference opposed the legislation. They said it would force priests to break the seal of confession, considered a sacred promise to never reveal any of the information disclosed.
Most Republican lawmakers were opposed to including the confessional, too. They argued in hearings and floor debates that abusers would do more harm because they would no longer be able to freely confide and seek forgiveness.
Keeping the confessional in the bill did not give Ferguson pause.
“Not for me,” he said. As a Catholic, “I’m very familiar with it. Been to confession, myself. I felt this was important legislation for protecting kids.”
Frame has said her push for the legislation began after reading an InvestigateWest account of a lawsuit alleging a Jehovah’s Witnesses congregation in Spokane covered up abuse of children by an elder.
Momentum grew as Catholic and Jehovah’s Witness survivors shared their stories with lawmakers and argued for including the confessions, she said. 
“This is going to protect children in other religious communities, especially Jehovah’s Witnesses,” said Marino Hardin of Seattle, who worked to pass the law on behalf of abuse victims. “I believe that a lot more children will not fall through the cracks.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ferguson-clergy-bill-signing-may-2-2025-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-02 17:09:21.384894

Erik Smith, Gov. Laura Kelly and Kansas Bureau of Investigation Director Tony Mattivi, standing left to right. Sarah Meeks, left in red, was wife of the late Derby Police Department Detective Charles Meeks, who died in a traffic accident in 1976. His name was added this year to the state monument. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Sarah Meeks said she was the one expected to perish in the head-on collision during a late-evening rainstorm on US-54 in southwest Kansas.
When an elderly motorist drifted across the yellow line at 9 p.m. May 5, 1976, about 2 miles east of Bucklin, Sarah Meeks woke up just in time to see blur of the oncoming car’s rapidly approaching headlights. Force of the impact threw her into the windshield and caused extensive head trauma. Her husband, Derby Police Department Detective Charles Meeks, initially was treated for a broken arm and shattered leg. But, tragically, Charles Meeks passed away four days later. His wife survived.
“I was the one who was supposed to be dead,” Sarah Meeks said. “When they did the autopsy, they found it was a brain bleed that did him in.”
Sarah Meeks recounted those harrowing moments Friday after the annual service in Topeka honoring men and women who had their names carved into the Kansas Law Enforcement Memorial on the Capitol grounds.
The 307th and 308th names etched into the circular memorial were that of Meeks, who died at age 34 while driving to a firearms competition as a representative of the police department, and Leavenworth County Deputy Sheriff Glenn Curtiss, who was shot and killed at age 26 during a scuffle with the suspect in an Oct. 29, 1924, bank robbery in Linwood.
Gov. Laura Kelly and Tony Mattivi, director of the Kansas Bureau of Investigation, spoke of the state’s good fortune that no names would be added to pay tribute to law enforcement officers who made the ultimate sacrifice during 2024.
“Today, we’re fortunate that for the first time in several years we’re not mourning new line-of-duty deaths in Kansas. That is a blessing,” she said. “But it does not change the solemn responsibility we have to remember those that did give their lives. To all families of fallen officers, you carry a burden few can understand.”
Kelly said the service acknowledged courage demonstrated by law enforcement officers who responded to crimes, of course, but also intervened when people were stricken by mental illness, addiction, homelessness and other challenges evident in society.
The death of Meeks and Curtiss were memorialized in speech, prayer and song. A pipe and drum corps’ offered a rendition of “Amazing Grace.” A line of officers delivered the traditional 21-volley salute. More than 100 uniformed law enforcement officers from Kansas stood at attention on the memorial’s perimeter.
Mattivi, representing the KBI, said Kansans had a duty to recognize women and men who lost their lives while engaged in work to protect communities.
“We mourn the officers whose lives were cut short. We remember their sacrifices in the name of justice.” Mattivi said. “We promise to stand together as brothers and sisters in blue and do everything possible to avoid other senseless tragedies. To each of you, who stand in the same line of fire and risk your lives every single day, thank you.”
Sarah Meeks and her son, Charles, who was 9 years old when the detective died, joined other families in placing flowers on the memorial wall where names of the deceased reside. Both wife and son appreciated the opportunity, after nearly half a century, to take part in the commemoration of lives lost.
“We’ve been to Washington, D.C., and seen the name on the monument there,” Sarah Meeks said. “This is great. He always wanted to be in law enforcement.”

(Photo by Michele Jokinen/Minnesota House of Representatives Information Services)Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz signed a bill creating new safety standards for workers who use scuba equipment to remove underwater weeds from lakes, following the deaths of two young and inexperienced divers.
Brady Aune and Joe Anderson died two years apart in remarkably similar accidents that their parents blame on the carelessness of their employers. They allege the companies didn’t provide adequate training or safety equipment that might have saved their lives.
Neither man was certified in scuba diving. In fact, neither had been scuba diving before they were handed oxygen tanks and weighted belts and sent to pull out weeds in deep murky water with little to no supervision.
“Brady and Joseph were two remarkable young men whose tragic, preventable deaths are a stark reminder that workplace safety cannot be an afterthought,” Walz said in a statement announcing his signature on May 1, International Workers Day.
The law, which had Democratic and Republican authors, requires workers who use scuba equipment to have an open water scuba diver certificate, or more advanced certificate, from a nationally recognized agency.
Commercial diving operations must also ensure a standby diver is available when another worker is in the water, and that workers are trained in first aid and CPR.

Aune was 20 years old when he drowned in Lake Minnetonka in Spring 2022 on his fourth day working for $16 an hour for Dive Guys, an aquatic weed removal company owned by Matt Wilkie.
Investigators found Aune’s weighted belt was on backward, so he wasn’t able to remove it, and that just one of the five employees on the job was trained in scuba diving.
Anderson was 18 years old when he drowned in Lac Lavon in Dakota County in 2024 while working for a different company, Your Lake Aquatic Plant Management. It was his third day on the job and his first time diving underwater.
His parents say he was a strong swimmer, but he received just 15 minutes of training the day he died, from a co-worker who wasn’t scuba certified. Anderson’s supervisor also wasn’t trained in CPR, and while first responders were able to resuscitate him, he died three days later in the hospital.

(File/Getty Images)COLUMBIA — Teachers would be able to count years of experience in another field toward their paycheck under a bill the House passed this week.
The bill went back to the Senate, where it is likely to pass, sending it to the governor’s desk for his signature. Both the House and Senate passed the bill unanimously.
If the bill becomes law, certified teachers would be able to count every two years of work experience as one year of teaching in a similar subject matter. While that won’t fix the ongoing shortage of school staff on its own, it could make a difference when combined with other changes, supporters said.
SC Senate advances bill on teacher contracts called a ‘huge win’ for K-12 educators

“Quality teachers, to bring them in, we need tools in the toolbox,” said House Education Chairwoman Shannon Erickson, R-Beaufort. “And this is a tool in the toolbox.”
Prior work experience would not count toward a teacher’s other benefits or retirement.
Pay is often a leading deterrent for people looking to become a teacher after years in a different field. Because teachers in the state are paid based on their years of experience and highest college degree, a career-changer would start at a district’s lowest pay level for their educational experience.
That can come as a shock for someone who has spent years working in a private industry. Even people who have considered teaching might decide not to pursue it or leave after a few years because they can’t afford it or don’t want to take the pay cut, teachers’ advocates said.
At the same time, having teachers with lived experience in a field, including the expertise that comes with that, can be valuable for students, said Patrick Kelly, a lobbyist for the Palmetto State Teachers Association. For instance, a fellow teacher at Blythewood High School worked for Westinghouse Electric Company before bringing that knowledge to a chemistry classroom.
“All around, this policy is an easy win for teacher recruitment and retention,” Kelly said.
A new teacher with five years of other work experience and a bachelor’s degree could expect to see a starting salary about $2,000 higher than before the bill passed, according to a financial analysis of the bill.
Teachers who have been in the profession for years but started out on a different career path will also be able to request a bump in the state salary schedule from the Department of Education.
SC House budget plan raises teacher pay by $1,500 instead of $3,000

The department estimates that at least 9,400 teachers would be eligible for the credit, according to the state Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office.
Sherry East, president of the South Carolina Education Association remained skeptical about how many people would change their minds about teaching because of the bill. Even if it attracts a few teachers, though, that would be worth it, she said.
The key will be making sure those new teachers have the training to succeed in the classroom as well as in the private sector, she said. All teachers who receive the higher pay must also receive a teaching certificate before going into a classroom.
“If it will entice people into the classroom, we’re all for it,” East said. “However, we need to make sure career-changers have the support they need to be an effective teacher.”
Both the House and Senate passed a version of the bill last year, but it failed to reach the finish line after the House tacked on a separate education bill that the Senate then removed.
The bill House members attached, known as the Educator Assistance Act, headed to the governor’s desk this week after passing both chambers. Advocates expect that bill, which aims to cut down on red tape teachers face, to also bolster recruitment and retention.
As would a proposed increase to the state’s minimum pay for teachers, bringing it to $48,500 for first-year educators, advocates have said. That pay bump, included in both the House and Senate spending plans, is locked into the state budget.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ChildcareGetty-2048x1365-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-02 17:09:21.384894

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)An environmental organization and a Native American advocacy group say two important Black Hills cultural and historical sites face threats from exploratory drilling projects.
One of the projects is proposed by Rapid City-based Pete Lien and Sons. It wants to conduct exploratory drilling for graphite on national forest land near Pe’ Sla, also known as Reynolds Prairie, which is a high-elevation meadow in the central Black Hills. Graphite is used in electric vehicle batteries, lubricants, pencils and other products.
Pe’ Sla is a ceremonial site for Lakota people, and it figures prominently in traditional Lakota creation stories.
“Drilling at Pe’ Sla would be like drilling under the Vatican or at a sacred site in Jerusalem,” said Taylor Gunhammer, an Oglala Lakota, in a news release. “Under any circumstances, it is not a place to be considering mining.”
Dakota Gold will conduct pre-permit study for potential mine in Homestake area

In response to questions from South Dakota Searchlight, a representative of Pete Lien and Sons said the U.S. Forest Service is reviewing the plan’s potential impact on sites of cultural and historical significance in the proposed project area, and questions and concerns should be directed to that agency. 
Gunhammer is a local organizer with NDN Collective, a Native American advocacy group in Rapid City. NDN and the Black Hills Clean Water Alliance are encouraging people to submit comments on the Pete Lien and Sons project and another project that could affect Craven Canyon in the southern Black Hills.
That’s where a Canadian company, Clean Nuclear Energy Corp., plans to conduct exploratory drilling for uranium on state-owned land located seven miles north of Edgemont. Uranium is the primary ingredient in nuclear weapons and nuclear power plants.
The Black Hills Clean Water Alliance and NDN said Craven Canyon contains 7,000-year-old cultural and historical sites of importance to Indigenous tribes, historians and archeologists.
A representative of Clean Nuclear Energy Corp., Mike Blady, said in email correspondence with South Dakota Searchlight that the proposed exploration area has been explored and mined previously. A letter to the company from state regulators last year said the area is within a quarter-mile of the edge of Craven Canyon, but Blady said the area is over a mile away.
“We are aware of the cultural significance and are doing everything in our power to ensure that there is no collateral damage,” Blady wrote. “We have consulted with the state and federal government as well as hosting an open house for Indigenous groups and are confident that there will not be adverse effects.
Meanwhile, another company, enCore Energy, hopes to mine uranium in the Edgemont area. Its various state and federal mining permit applications have been bogged down in administrative and court appeals for years.
The Clean Nuclear Energy Corp. drilling proposal will be considered by the state Board of Minerals and Environment. The Pete Lien and Sons proposal is under consideration by the supervisor of the Black Hills National Forest. Both proposals are open for public comment.

Vaillancourt, 53, of Rutland is brought in to Rutland criminal court for her arraignment after being charged with manslaughter and cruelty to a child arising from the January death of 6-month-old Harper Rose Briar at the defendant’s state-certified in-home day care facility. Pool photo by Robert Layman/Rutland HeraldThe Vermont Supreme Court has upheld the convictions of a former Rutland child care provider found guilty on charges of involuntary manslaughter and cruelty to a child in the death of a 6-month-old baby more than six years ago. Stacey Vaillancourt, 59, was charged in 2019 with giving a fatal amount of a sedative found in over-the-counter antihistamines to Harper Rose Briar, who was in her care. Vaillancourt was convicted of the two charges against her by a Rutland County jury following a trial in December 2023, and was sentenced to three to 10 years in prison. She appealed her convictions, and Friday the five-member Vermont Supreme Court in a unanimous decision affirmed the jury’s guilty verdicts. “Defendant has not identified any grounds to disturb the jury’s verdict,” Justice Nancy Waples wrote in the 17-page ruling.“First, there was sufficient evidence presented for the jury to convict defendant for both involuntary manslaughter and cruelty to a child with death resulting,” Waples wrote. “Second, the verdicts against her are not inconsistent and do not violate double-jeopardy.”Rutland County State’s Attorney Ian Sullivan prosecuted the case at trial along with Deputy State’s Attorney Daron Raleigh. Deputy State’s Attorney Evan Meenan argued the appeal for the prosecution before the Vermont Supreme Court in March.“I hope today’s decision brings closure and a sense of justice to everyone who loved Harper during her all-too-brief life,” Sullivan said in a statement Friday.Dawn Matthews, an appellate attorney with the Vermont Defender General’s Office, argued Vaillancourt’s appeal. Matthews could not immediately be reached Friday for comment.The Pittsford infant died Jan. 24, 2019, at the child care facility that Vaillancourt ran out of her home on North Street in Rutland, according to charging documents filed in the case. Authorities had been called to Vaillancourt’s child care facility that day for a report that the infant was not breathing, the filings stated. Harper was taken by ambulance to Rutland Regional Medical Center, where she later died.It was Harper’s third day at the child care facility when, the charging documents stated, Vaillancourt gave her a fatal amount of diphenhydramine, an “over-the-counter (sedating) antihistamine used for treatment of allergic reactions.”An autopsy report from the chief medical examiner’s office showed that Harper’s death was a homicide caused by “diphenhydramine intoxication.”Vaillancourt’s defense had contended the state case was based on circumstantial evidence and also raised the possibility that another person could have administered the medication. Among the arguments in her appeal, Vaillancourt’s attorney stated that Judge Cortland Corsones erred at the trial by allowing into evidence two short videos of Harper because they were “unduly” prejudicial.“Here,” Waples wrote in the high court’s ruling, “the State argued that it had to prove causation, so videos showing (Harper’s) developmental capacity were relevant because they demonstrated that she did not have the capacity to either give herself medicine or protect herself from harm.”The high court rejected Vaillancourt’s argument regarding the videos.“Any emotional response generated in the jurors from the videos does not substantially outweigh the probative value of the videos,” Waples wrote in the decision.As of Friday, Vaillancourt was incarcerated at the Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility, the state’s only women’s prison, in South Burlington, according to the state Department of Corrections.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont Supreme Court upholds convictions for Rutland child care provider in baby’s death.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/20190319_rhd_infant_death-daycare_Vaillancourt-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-02 17:09:21.384894

The board alleges Amber Herzmann, 44, was working as a travel nurse from June 2024 through September 2024. On Sept. 10, 2024, the board alleges, her employment contract was suspended due to suspicion of medication misappropriation.
The board alleges a review of her charts suggests she was administering the narcotic painkiller fentanyl to women after they gave birth, although the drug is typically prescribed to patients during active labor. Multiple patients denied receiving the medication or the number of doses of medication Herzmann claimed to have administered, according to the board.

Herzmann’s employer later submitted a report to the Drug Enforcement Administration indicating 14 vials of fentanyl and two syringes of hydromorphone were lost or were suspected of being stolen.
The board charged Herzmann with misappropriation of patient medications. In resolving the case, the board agreed on April 10 to let Herzmann retain her license as a registered nurse, and Herzmann agreed to participate in the Iowa Practitioner Health Program, a program that offers assistance to health care professionals with substance abuse issues.
Court records show that on April 24, two weeks after the board approved that settlement agreement, Herzmann was criminally charged with nine felony counts of unlawfully obtaining a prescription drug, plus one aggravated misdemeanor charge of tampering with records.
Prosecutors allege that in October, November and December of 2024 — after her travel-nurse employment contract was suspended — Herzmann was working on the maternity floor of Mercy Hospital in Clinton where she claimed to have administered the narcotic painkillers fentanyl, oxycodone and Dilaudid to multiple patients but instead kept the drugs for her own purposes.
Herzmann is scheduled to be arraigned on May 22, 2025. She has yet to enter a plea in the case.
Other nursing board actions
Other nurses recently sanctioned by the Iowa Board of Nursing include:
— Stephanie Erdman, an advanced registered nurse practitioner who was charged with failing to assess and report the status of a patient, and failure to establish a relationship with a patient. The board alleges that at some unspecified time in the past, Erdman was working as the medical director of a medical spa where she prescribed drugs to a patient she didn’t see and then failed to follow up with the patient. The board settled the case by requiring Erdman to complete 30 hours of educational training on clinical supervision and documentation.
— Jean Havugimana, a licensed practical nurse who was recently charged by the board with leaving a nursing assignment without first ensuring the safety of his patients, and with committing an act or omission that might adversely affect a patient.
According to the board, Havugimana was working a 12-hour overnight shift at The Views of Marion, which operates the Oakview Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, on Jan. 27, 2024. On that night, Havugimana was the only nurse on duty to assist two certified nursing assistants in caring for roughly 40 residents. The facility’s video surveillance allegedly shows Havugimana was inside the facility for less than three hours during his 12-hour shift, and that he repeatedly exited and reentered the building.
The board alleges that during the night, the two CNAs were unable to reach Havugimana to assist with residents’ needs; that Havugimana had the keys necessary to access residents’ medications; and that he was the only person on duty authorized to administer medications.
At one point during the night, Havugimana was “observed in his vehicle, parked in the lot, playing loud music with a female passenger,” the board alleges. At a board hearing on the matter, Havugimana claimed he was working his shift as required, but was busy caring for patients in other areas of the building. According to the board, he offered no explanation as to why his colleagues couldn’t locate him or reach him via their cellphones and walkie-talkies.
In resolving the case, the board suspended Havugimana’s license for one year and stipulated that after the license is reinstated, it will be placed on probationary status for one year. As part of that probation, Havugimana will have to complete additional educational training and submit to chemical screening.
In 2009, the board charged Havugimana with falsely claiming to have completed his educational requirements for licensing and for failing to inform the board of a conviction for driving while barred as a habitual offender. The board suspended Havugimana’s license as a result of those charges.

(Alander Rocha/Alabama Reflector)An Alabama judge Thursday blocked the Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) from regulating freestanding birth centers as hospitals, delivering a victory to midwives in the state.
Montgomery Circuit Court Judge Greg Griffin’s ruling concluded that the Alabama Legislature did not authorize the ADPH to regulate midwifery care in birth centers as “hospitals,” saying that ADPH’s attempt to impose hospital regulations on Freestanding Birth Centers (FSBCs), which offer an out-of-hospital birth option, was unlawful.
“Because both legal rules of statutory construction and undisputed record evidence make clear that FSBCs do not provide ‘obstetrical care,’ and do not provide care ‘to the public generally,’ ADPH’s attempt to regulate them as ‘hospitals’ exceeds its statutory authority and violates the AAPA,” Griffin wrote in the ruling.

Messages seeking comment was left with ADPH and the Alabama Attorney General’s office.
Birth centers are health care facilities dedicated to childbirth and are centered around the midwifery model of care. They are often looked at as an in-between option for mothers not completely comfortable with home births or the medical setting of a hospital. Supporters also say that it provides another option for people with low-risk pregnancies in a state where about 34% of counties are considered maternity care deserts.
Dr. Heather Skanes, OB-GYN and owner of Oasis Family Birth Center in Birmingham, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, said in an interview Friday that the ruling allows her to keep operating without “the burdensome regulations that ADPH was planning to impose” on them. Since reopening after the preliminary injunction, Skanes said that her birth center has been “able to start caring for birthing people again.”
“We’ve been doing births without any issues, and we’ve continued to provide safe and effective prenatal, labor, delivery, postpartum care in an underserved area here in Birmingham,” Skanes said.
New rules approved by the ADPH in 2023 required Alabama birth centers to be overseen by a physician; be located within 30 minutes of an OB-GYN hospital and seek hospital licenses. Birth center advocates feared these regulations, especially the hospital licensing requirement, would make it challenging to serve low-risk pregnancies, particularly in rural areas of the state with poor maternal health outcomes that may lack health care providers..
The plaintiffs, including the birth centers, midwives, and the Alabama affiliate of the American College of Nurse-Midwives, filed a lawsuit in August 2023. The plaintiffs argued that these rules would make it nearly impossible for them to provide midwifery care. The following month, Griffin blocked ADPH from enforcing hospital licensing requirements on birth centers.
In a statement, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which represents the plaintiffs, said the rule would ensure access to equitable pregnancy care in Alabama, a state facing a maternal and infant health crisis. This crisis disproportionately affects Black women, low-income communities, and those living in rural areas with limited access to hospitals.
“We are elated that the dedicated midwives at Alabama’s birth centers can continue to provide crucial care to pregnant Alabamians across the state without undue interference,” said Whitney White, staff attorney with the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project. “Midwifery care in birth centers is safe, can improve patient outcomes, and can play a critical role in expanding access to equitable pregnancy care in Alabama.”
JaTaune Bosby Gilchrist, executive director of the ACLU of Alabama, said the ruling affirms the essentiality of midwife-led care.
“This ruling is a powerful affirmation of what birth workers, families, and communities across Alabama have long known: midwife-led care is essential,” Gilchrist said in a statement. “As hospitals and obstetric services close across the state, particularly in rural areas, birth centers and midwives are stepping in to fill a dangerous gap in access.”
Skanes said that she hopes the ruling “allows Alabama to really reconsider the way that we provide maternal care.” She said that birthing centers could be a solution to providing maternal care by placing them “in strategic areas around the state.” She said that Alabamians would benefit from an integrative approach to maternal care that utilizes both birth centers and hospitals.
 “I think that we really have to change our mindset as physicians and as Alabamians, that this care can really be integrated into the medical system,” Skanes said. “That it doesn’t have to be something that’s stigmatized, it doesn’t have to be something that is talked down upon, but it’s just another option for women and for birthing people, and it works in conjunction with the hospital.”

DemasThis coverage is made possible through a partnership between IPR and Grist, a nonprofit environmental media organization.
 
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has released a new, shorter timeline for its environmental review of the Line 5 tunnel project.
In April, the Army Corps announced it would speed up its review of the tunnel project under a national energy emergency declared by President Donald Trump.
Friday’s announcement was the first time they gave specifics about Line 5 under the new emergency procedures.
The Army Corps will release the draft environmental review on May 30.
That starts the clock on public comment, with half as much time to give it under the new timeline — 30 days instead of 60.
Canada-based Enbridge has long sought to build a tunnel underneath the Straits of Mackinac to house a section of the Line 5 pipeline, which carries oil and natural gas liquids over 645 miles from Wisconsin to Ontario.
About four miles of the pipeline sits along the lakebed between Michigan’s two peninsulas. In 2020, Enbridge applied for a federal permit to build a tunnel for the pipeline and has said doing so would make it safer.
Opponents argue that the tunnel would further endanger the environment, the Great Lakes, and Indigenous ways of life. They also say Trump’s executive order undermines public input into such projects.
With the faster review process, the Army Corps could decide on a permit this fall — months earlier than previously planned.
The Army Corps permit process is one of the last major hurdles in this years’ long process for Enbridge — but not the final step. The company is redoing a permit for the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy.
“Our record of decision is estimated to be fall 2025,” said Army Corps spokesperson Carrie Fox in an email. “However, the Corps of Engineers permit cannot be issued before the EGLE permit is granted.”

(Photo credit: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Aurelia Giacometto, the embattled secretary of the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, has left the agency, according to a news release Friday from Gov. Jeff Landry.
The governor said Giacometto has accepted a position with Earth and Water Law, a firm in Washington, D.C. The governor has appointed Courtney Burdette to fill the vacancy left by Giacometto. 
Giacometto’s departure follows a year of tumult that began with high-ranking LDEQ executives resigning and publicly airing their complaints about her alleged harassment of subordinates. It was also brought to light that Giacometto used public money to travel to out-of-state political events with no obvious connection to her position in state government. 
The most recent high-end LDEQ resignation occurred Monday when its top financial executive left for another state agency, marking at least the 15th departure of a key employee under Giacometto’s tenure. Many of her highest-ranking lieutenants, several of whom were experienced civil servants, left after just a few months or weeks on the job. 
An Indiana native, Giacometto rose to political prominence as President Donald Trump’s appointee to head the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service during his first term. After leaving her federal government post, she went on a speaking tour for the National Rifle Association, which she continued several months into her new job at LDEQ. She could not be reached for comment Friday.
Giacometto’s leadership style came under heightened scrutiny in March when Legislative Auditor Mike Waguespack published the results of a workplace culture survey. Its results revealed pervasive low morale under her leadership, with some employees saying they felt pressured to violate the law or department policy. 
Roughly two weeks after the publication of that report, long-time LDEQ ombudsman Roger Ward abruptly resigned and disseminated a scathing seven-page letter detailing what he called “the increasingly erratic and alarmingly vicious behavior” of Giacometto. Ward said he wrote the letter in lieu of providing an exit interview, a long-established LDEQ practice Giacometto ended this year. 
“This is long overdue but fantastic news for the DEQ institutionally and its employees,” Ward said in an email reacting to Friday’s news. “Ms. Giacometto’s tenure at DEQ has been a nightmare for both new and career employees at the agency. The damage she has done to the agency is immense and it is a shame that it took so many complaints and departures to finally get the governor to address her egregious and narcissistic behavior. DEQ employees are rejoicing over her departure and are thrilled that the Governor has chosen Courtney Burdette as Giacometto’s replacement. Unlike Giacometto, Courtney has the intellect and temperament to lead the agency.”
Top financial official the latest to depart from Louisiana Dept. of Environmental Quality

Ward’s earlier polemic reinforced a similar departing letter from former LDEQ Undersecretary Chandra Pidgeon, who left the agency in March 2024 after just weeks of being hired. Pigeon similarly complained about Giacometto’s “harassment of longtime employees” and other actions.
“I have worked for 23 years for the state of Louisiana, and I have never encountered a leader so destructive, calculating, and callous,” she wrote.
None of that stopped the governor from praising Giacometto’s leadership throughout her time in office and again in his news release Friday.
“I want to sincerely thank Aurelia for her dedicated service to our State and the Department of Environmental Quality. Aurelia prioritized environmental improvements to our air, land, and water, while also keeping a focus on the jobs and businesses that often suffer from red-tape and overregulation,” Landry said. “We are grateful for her actions to improve the Department and wish her the best in her next endeavor.”
Burdette, Giacometto’s replacement, first joined the legal team at LDEQ in January 2014. She served as a permits supervisor of the department’s legal division before becoming general counsel in 2020 and later executive counsel.
Her experience also includes working as an attorney with the Louisiana Board of Ethics, and she was previously an assistant state attorney general who defended the state in a variety of tort cases, according to the governor’s office.
Burdette received a bachelor’s degree in English from Howard University and her law degree from LSU.
This is a developing story.

Sen. Jorge Cabrera, D-Hamden, co-chair of the Insurance and Real Estate Committee, where the legislation originated as a committee bill with no individual  sponsor, told senators it was designed to “incentivize individuals to serve on our boards.”
No one asked if there is a dearth of individuals willing to accept a seat on one of the 16 quasi-public authorities that oversee, among other things, the Connecticut Lottery, Bradley International Airport and, yes, the insurance exchange whose mission is to help people find affordable health coverage.
The bill is similar to a provision slipped into a 235-page budget bill last year by a person or persons unknown, at least to the public, and then removed by leaders amid press inquiries. Such items, which often are drawn with a specific constituent or constituency in mind, are colorfully known at the Capitol as “rats.”
The rat was resurrected with a greater measure of transparency in Senate Bill 1384, a 13-line piece of legislation clearly labeled: “An Act Allowing Board Members of Quasi-Public Agencies to Obtain Health Insurance Coverage Under the State Employee Plan.”
But the exercise of going through the full legislative process — vetting by a committee and a public hearing — yielded no answer to basic questions about the bill’s origin and necessity: Where did it come from? Who sought it?
The Senate passed the bill on a 20-14 vote, with three Democrats joining all 11 Republicans in opposition. Two of the three Democratic dissenters, Sen. Matt Lesser of Middletown and Sen. Martha Marx of New London, also had voted against it in committee. 
Neither spoke during the debate in the Senate or in committee, but Marx said in an interview Friday, “No one could tell me the reason why we were doing that bill.”
Last year’s version only covered four quasi-public authorities, among them the Connecticut Airport Authority, whose board members include Vincent Mauro Jr., the New Haven Democratic chair and former chief of staff to Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven.
Mauro, now a government affairs advisor employed by McCarter & English, a New Jersey law firm with a law and lobbying presence in Connecticut, New York, and Washington D.C., said he was unaware of Senate Bill 1384 and had no role in its passage.
“I have good health insurance,” he said.
At the Capitol, there is no way to trace the DNA of legislation, aside from the record produced by legislative sponsors, advocates and opponents, public hearing testimony and debates in committee and on the floor. SB 1384 generated none of that. 
It was one of a dozen bills on a public hearing agenda of the insurance committee in March, but a review of the transcript shows no mention of the bill, pro or con. There was no written testimony offering praise, criticism or analysis from the quasi-publics, which would bear most of the cost of health care premiums.
Behind the scenes, the bill apparently generated no discussion among the lawmakers who screen bills before they come for a vote in committee, as SB 1384 did on March 13, the last day the Insurance and Real Estate Committee sent bills to the floor.
As is the case with all committee meetings, a video record is available on CT-N.
“I don’t remember going over this bill in screening or talking about it,” Rep. Cara Pavalock-D’Amato, R-Bristol, told fellow committee members in March. She did remember the same idea surfaced a year or two ago, “I think, as a rat.”
Cabrera ignored the rat reference and briefly explained the bill as providing board members access to the state employee plan for the duration of their service, requiring them to pay the same share of the premium as employees, which averages 15%.
“Who put in this bill?” Pavalock-D’Amato asked. “Does anybody know where this bill originated from?”
Cabrera noted there were 16 quasi-publics listed at the bottom of the bill.
She said she understood that. 
“But where is this bill coming from?” she asked. “Is there anybody specific, or any group, that has pushed this bill?”
“So, it was a bill that I originally spearheaded,” Cabrera said, adding he had been “talking to several legislators.”
That was the extent of the origin story of SB 1384.
Rep. Kerry Wood, D-Rocky Hill, the House co-chair of the committee, told Cabrera at the meeting she was willing to move the bill out of committee to the Senate floor but offered no assurance of voting for passage if it reached the House.
“I am going to reluctantly support this bill to get it moving forward,” Wood said then. “But I have said this over and over again, that I would like to see us stop putting bills forward to add anyone that needs health insurance to the state employee plan.”
She reiterated her reluctance to support the bill Thursday after the Senate voted and Cabrera briefly met with Wood outside the House chamber. Wood said she was unsure the bill would get called for a floor vote in the House — of what she would do if it did.
Tom Swan, the executive director of the Connecticut Citizen Action Group, typically applauds anything that expands availability to health care. Not so this time, even though he could be a potential beneficiary. He sits on the board of a quasi-public, the State Education Resource Center.
“We support opening up the state employee health plan for everybody, not just political insiders,” Swan said of CCAG. He laughed and added, “As a board member of a quasi-public, I’ll decline the opportunity to enroll if presented.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/capitollastnight-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-02 17:09:21.384894

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Despite possibly facing contempt sanctions, Attorney General James Uthmeier won’t tell law enforcement to comply with a federal judge’s order suspending an immigration law that led to the arrest of a U.S. citizen.
U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams is considering holding Uthmeier in contempt over his greenlighting of arrests under a law making it a first-degree misdemeanor for a person to enter the state as an “unauthorized alien” — despite her order temporarily blocking enforcement.
The law adds heightened penalties for re-entry.
In his first acknowledgement of the possible sanctions reported Tuesday, Uthmeier told Fox News Digital that he won’t tell law enforcement to “stop fulfilling their constitutional duties.” The attorney general’s press secretary didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment from the Florida Phoenix.
“I do not believe an AG should be held in contempt for respecting the rule of law and appropriate separation of powers,” Uthmeier said. “The ACLU is dead set on obstructing President Donald Trump’s efforts to detain and deport illegals, and we are going to fight back. We will vigorously defend our laws and advance President Trump’s agenda on illegal immigration.”
U.S. judge slams state AG for calling court’s block on immigration law illegitimate

Williams scheduled a hearing on May 29 in the Miami federal court to discuss sanctions against Uthmeier over his defiance of her court order in his April 23 letter to law enforcement stating that there wasn’t a legitimate order stopping them from arresting people under the entry and reentry law.
But that April 23 letter was a pivot from another letter Uthmeier sent five days earlier, telling law enforcement agencies, sheriffs, and police chiefs that they shouldn’t arrest anyone under SB 4C, which Gov. Ron DeSantis signed on Feb. 13 and Williams temporarily blocked on April 4.
“Color me surprised and shocked,” Williams said, asking what had happened in the five days between the letters, during a Tuesday hearing.
His office did not say whether Uthmeier would attend the hearing. Uthmeier has been attorney general since February. DeSantis appointed his former chief of staff to replace Ashley Moody after her ascension to the U.S. Senate, another appointment by the governor.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Law’s suspension
Along with the contemplation of sanctions, Williams on Tuesday suspended the law for the remainder of the litigation. However, the defendants — Uthmeier, the statewide prosecutor, and state attorneys — almost immediately filed an appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. They’ve also asked Williams to remove her block.
The Florida Immigrant Coalition, The Farmworker Association of Florida, and two women lacking permanent legal status brought the suit against the state claiming the law is unconstitutional because federal law governs entry into the country.
“This case is about more than one law — it’s about whether our leaders will follow the Constitution,” said Amy Godshall, an immigrants’ rights attorney at the ACLU of Florida, in a press release Wednesday.
Americans for Immigrant Justice and the Community Justice Project attorneys also represent the plaintiffs.
Uthmeier’s argument is that the court’s order doesn’t apply to law enforcement, including the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the Florida Highway Patrol, because those entities are not named defendants and he lacks authority to discipline them.
Still, Williams showed irritation with that argument Tuesday, saying Uthmeier’s statements on social media showed he exercises authority over law enforcement agencies.
The defendants’ position that arrests should continue even if prosecutors can’t carry forward the cases raised grave constitutional concerns with due process, Williams wrote in her order.
Continued arrests following the suspension of the law had also prompted frustration from Williams, who mentioned in her order the arrest of a U.S. citizen in Leon County.
An FHP trooper arrested Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez, a 20-year-old born in Georgia, on April 16. The case garnered national attention following the Florida Phoenix’s reporting of the arrest without probable cause and Lopez-Gomez’s subsequent release from the Leon County Jail.
No arrests under the suspended law have taken place since Williams further clarified on April 18 that her order applies to law enforcement, Acting Solicitor General Jeffrey DeSousa told Williams during the Tuesday hearing.

Prison staff, state human services employees, lawmakers, judicial officials and community providers spent a morning learning about the complicated process of getting out of prison. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont’s first reentry simulation mimics the bureaucratic morass of leaving prison.","Participants at a reentry simulation hosted by the Vermont Department of Corrections attempt to receive forms of identification. By Ethan Weinstein/VTDiggerMONTPELIER — About 95% of people incarcerated in Vermont will one day leave prison. But getting out — and staying out — relies on a system that often appears rigged against those reentering society. “The system as it’s built today forces individuals to jump through hoops that many of us in this room would struggle through, even in the best of circumstances,” Nick Deml, Vermont Department of Corrections commissioner, told participants at the state’s first ever reentry simulation. More than 50 people, including prison staff, state human services employees, lawmakers, judicial officials and community social services providers spent Friday morning reenacting the brutal bureaucracy people leaving prison face every day. Those exiting incarceration often start life from scratch — forced to acquire basic identification, obtain employment and find housing —  all while battling food insecurity and lack of transportation. The morning’s simulation, which led participants through the cascading steps of reentry, was the brainchild of Maurice Q. Jones, chair of the Philadelphia Reentry Coalition. Jones spent years of his life incarcerated and has devoted the years since helping improve reentry services.  “This is a way for folks to gain empathy to effectuate change,” he said in an interview, describing the event. “When I came home, there was almost zero hope. And I felt like there was a greater need to do this work than to do anything else.”   Inside the Capitol Plaza Hotel, attendees began the session by each adopting the identity of someone just leaving prison, outlined in a series of provided materials. Those documents described the person’s criminal history, housing (or lack thereof), financial situation, employment status, probation requirements, and existing forms of ID. Across four 15-minute “weeks,” each participant needed to complete a variety of tasks, like passing drug screenings, attending Alcoholics Anonymous and counseling, and meeting with a probation officer, all while trying to find employment and stay out of trouble. During “week one,” the line to acquire a birth certificate, Social Security card and state ID snaked across the hotel conference room. During every interaction, participants needed to turn over “transportation cards” representing their ride to the appointment, each of which cost money. And even small transactions like filling out forms came with fees. Low on cash? Donate blood plasma up to twice per week, or pawn a guitar or laptop — just don’t expect much money in return. In almost every instance, an interaction required three forms of ID. Between “weeks,” participants vented about the orchestrated chaos. They’d failed to pay rent, forcing them to report to a shelter. People skipped meals, missed probation appointments, stood next in line for an appointment only to hear the closing bell. At times, the futility of every step appeared to baffle attendees. One participant voiced frustration that despite submitting to three drug tests, she was told she never submitted a test at all, barring her from employment. She thought the hiccup in the simulation was unrealistic.“In real life, they wouldn’t be able to lie,” she said.Katie Jones, a recovery coaching supervisor at Turning Point Center of Central Vermont, who was volunteering at the simulation, suggested otherwise.“You might be surprised.”By the fourth round, some attendees appeared too frustrated to continue. Large sheets of paper meant for participants to write down feelings and impressions started to fill with exasperation: “headache,” “overwhelmed,” “defeated,” “cheated,” “jail is easier.”To Timothy Burgess, an advocate for incarcerated people in Vermont who is himself formerly incarcerated, the simulation’s hair-tearing nature rang true. On Friday, he found himself on the other side of the system, playing the part of probation officer. As he watched the red-faced participants fumble through the process, he couldn’t help but empathize with POs, and he hoped the event might inspire change. “This is an amazing opportunity.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont’s first reentry simulation mimics the bureaucratic morass of leaving prison.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Vermont-DOC-reentry-simulation-1-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C729&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-02 17:09:21.384894

Interview: Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita Drops A Bombshell On Why Indiana Immigration Bill Died… pic.twitter.com/jqrUH2fRCj

Rokita, in an archived April 30 interview with conservative radio host Casey Hendrickson, said the bill “stalled” because “someone had a personal grudge against the language,” naming Fort Wayne Sen. Liz Brown as the barrier. 
“… (She) told me one of the reasons was she’s got a family member who’s an illegal alien,” Rokita told Hendrickson.
In a statement shared with the Indiana Capital Chronicle, a spokesperson for Brown called the claim “blatantly false.”
“Senator Brown does not have an illegal alien relative. This claim by Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita is blatantly false, and is meant to be misleading to Indiana constituents to make them think that Senator Brown has a personal conflict in performing her duties as Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee,” said her legislative office said. “These public erroneous statements are made in an attempt to hurt the credibility and transparency needed and expected in the Indiana state legislative process.”
Brown went on to confirm that she’d filed an official grievance and request for an investigation into Rokita’s comments with the Indiana Supreme Court Disciplinary Commission.
Relevant background
The underlying bill, House Bill 1531, would have required local law enforcement officers to comply with federal detainer requests for undocumented immigrants. It would have also banned employers from hiring unauthorized residents. 
Though the bill passed out of the House on a 64-26 vote, it never got a hearing in the Senate, where it was assigned to Brown’s committee. As the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Brown has the power to select which bills get a hearing — though bills can be reassigned to other committees to circumvent a chair. 
When author Rep. J.D. Prescott was asked about the bill’s demise by the Indiana Capital Chronicle, he referred questions to Brown. 
Brown, an attorney, said she’d shared concerns with Rokita about the legislation “early in the legislative process.” The statement cited the condensed timeline during a budget-writing session and said Hoosiers had shared issues regarding potential impacts, including the possibility of a conflict with federal law.
Rokita weighs in on federal education moves, Indiana immigration bill

Instead, the office pointed to her support for House Enrolled Act 1393, which would require local law enforcement to notify federal immigration authorities about undocumented immigrants in custody.
“(Brown) commends President Trump for the decisive actions he has taken federally to stop the flow of illegal immigration,” the statement concluded.
Rokita fired back, saying in a statement that Brown either “provided inaccurate or unclear information to me and others in the past, or she is backtracking now.”
“As for a disciplinary complaint, Liz can get in line. She didn’t give my office the authority to investigate illegal aliens, but she wants others to investigate me over comments she made. How ironic,” Rokita said. “This is also another example of weaponization of the Indiana court system to attempt to silence me and the people of this state who are tired of sending representatives to Indianapolis who don’t really represent them.”
He went on to accuse the disciplinary commission of encouraging “this political lawfare” by endorsing political candidates, making donations and accepting complaints from “politically partisan people.” 
Rokita has faced the disciplinary commission before. He continues to litigate a case in which he called a practicing OB-GYN an “activist acting as a doctor” after she mentioned seeing a 10-year-old rape victim from Ohio travel to Indiana for an abortion. She was later fined by the Medical Licensing Board for sharing patient information — a move supported by Rokita. 
Though reprimanded by the state’s Supreme Court justices, a subsequent press release from Rokita’s office and his public statements have prompted further scrutiny.

Climate change delivered a double-whammy on top of record low snow for New Mexico, said Andrew Mangham, a senior service hydrologist for National Weather Service in Albuquerque.
The ripple of the rapid melt has hurt Utah and Colorado as well, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration May 1 drought report. Governors for Washington state and Utah declared states of emergencies for drought in their states.

Federal projections for the upper Rio Grande expect only 12% of normal water from snow will make it to the river. Snow accounts for three-quarters of the river’s supply.
“We’ve already seen the bump in all of the rivers from snowmelt, that peak flow is already past us now,” Mangham said, estimating the state experienced the second-driest winter in 130 years. “In terms of volume going through any point on the river, our forecasts all show it’s somewhere between a third to a half of what is normal.”
New Mexico’s meager snowpack and current water conditions bode poorly for fire season, as windy and hot conditions are expected to continue, and the lack of winter moisture left forests drier than usual.
“We’re looking at a nightmare of a fire weather season, I’m not gonna sugarcoat that,” Mangham said.
Overall, the short term forecasts predict New Mexico’s weather to be warmer, drier and windier, although possible storms could cause some spring flooding — such as in the Ruidoso burn scar this weekend.
Long range forecasts paint a potentially brighter picture for the seasonal summer rains, which are possibly going to be stronger than usual in the western part of the state, while the remainder is looking like it will be typical.
“But we still gotta make it through the spring to get to monsoon season,” Mangham said.

SPRINGFIELD — Two Democratic leaders in the Illinois Senate openly expressed their disagreement this week about Gov. JB Pritzker’s proposal to allow community colleges to offer four-year bachelor’s degree programs in certain high-demand employment fields.

The exchange between Senate Majority Leader Kimberly Lightford, of Westchester, and Sen. Cristina Castro, of Elgin, who chairs the powerful Senate Executive Committee, took place during a hearing on an unrelated bill that would overhaul the way Illinois funds public universities. But it offered a public view of the reasons why the baccalaureate proposal, which Pritzker touted in his budget address in February, has so far failed to advance in the General Assembly.

Both the university funding proposal (Senate Bill 13 and House Bill 1581) and the community college proposal (HB 3717 and SB 2482) are intended to stem the spiraling cost to students and their families of obtaining a four-year college degree.

The funding proposal calls for increasing state funding for universities to reduce their reliance on tuition and fees. The community college proposal is intended to make certain four-year degrees available through lower-cost institutions and more accessible to older, nontraditional students who don’t live near a four-year institution.

The university funding plan, sponsored by Lightford, was the subject of a Senate committee hearing Wednesday. The bill allowing community colleges to offer four-year baccalaureate degrees did not advance out of a House committee before a March 21 deadline.

During Wednesday’s hearing, Lightford appeared with a panel of university presidents from Chicago State, Western Illinois, Illinois State and Northern Illinois universities, and the Southern Illinois University System – all of whom support the funding proposal but oppose the community college baccalaureate plan.

“If we're thinking about students’ basic needs, we also need to be thinking about the students that don't necessarily go to the four-year schools,” Castro said to the panel. “If students are really the focus, why are you guys opposed to the (four)-year baccalaureate degrees?”

“I’d like to answer your question, madam chair, because I believe it has zero to do with what we're trying to accomplish here,” Lightford replied.

She said the university funding proposal was the product of four years of negotiations that were intended to address a specific set of issues facing universities – namely, the adequacy and equity of their funding systems. The community college proposal, she argued, would draw students away from universities that are already struggling to maintain enrollment levels.

“Community college students need to stay at the two-year community college level, and then students who are going for a bachelor's degree should stay at the university level,” Lightford said. “Because what happens is, when you begin to offer four-year programs at a two-year school, those students who would traditionally go to the four-year university, we’ll lose those students to the community college level.”

During the exchange with Castro, Lightford referred to the community college proposal as “your bill,” even though Castro is not listed as a sponsor or cosponsor of the Senate version. Castro corrected Lightford, saying: “To be fair, it is the governor's bill. This is one of his initiatives that he has been working on.”

But Lightford said the governor “doesn’t push a button on the floor or in a committee.”

“I like the governor,” she said. “He’s probably my favorite. … But this isn’t that bill.”

Dan Mahony, president of the SIU System, added that he does not oppose the concept of community colleges offering bachelor’s degrees, and said negotiations are continuing on that proposal. He said he wants to make sure the final plan “doesn't pit our universities and community colleges against each other in a way that's unproductive and not good for taxpayers and not good for students.”

“We want to do something that actually is productive, and that's what we're working towards, and we'll continue to work towards,” he said

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)The Colorado Legislature intends to use investment revenue to pay for the implementation of Proposition 130, the measure voters approved last fall to direct $350 million to law enforcement.
Under a bill nearing final passage, local law enforcement agencies would get at least $15,000 per year to use for recruitment, continuing education and additional compensation. Surviving spouses or family members of an officer killed during duty would receive a $1 million survivor’s benefit.
To pay for it, members of the bipartisan Joint Budget Committee want to send $500 million to the Public Employees Retirement Association to invest.
“The bill before you represents a fair and faithful, balanced implementation of the voters’ intent, while ensuring that we can continue to fund equally-important priorities across our state budget and maintain our necessary reserves,” Rep. Shannon Bird, a Westminster Democrat, told the House Appropriations Committee on Thursday.

Proposition 130, backed by the conservative nonprofit Advance Colorado, passed with about 53% of the vote last November. That means lawmakers needed to grapple with its implementation during an ultra-tight budget year in which they already faced a $1.2 billion gap.
Senate Bill 25-310 would establish the Peace Officer Support and Training Fund, which would receive an initial transfer of $15 million in general fund money next year. Then, $500 million from the state’s general fund reserve — money set aside as a buffer for emergencies — would get sent to PERA to invest. Up to $35 million generated from that investment would be sent to the support fund annually, and other revenue would be used to offset a portion of what the state owes to PERA for pension liability every year.
The plan is to always have $15 million per year in the law enforcement support fund. Rep. Rick Taggart, a Grand Junction Republican, said that the average return on PERA investments is about 7%. An expected average annual return of $35 million on the investment would mean the Legislature would fulfill its $350 million obligation under Proposition 130 in 10 years.
“This is how we are using our existing state assets to generate revenues to meet the voters’ intent,” Bird said.
Local law enforcement agencies would get at least $15,000 per year, and if there is enough revenue available, additional money using a formula based on department size. That would begin in December 2026. Agencies would need to prove compliance with allowable spending through an annual audit.
Adam Turk with the Colorado Association of Chiefs of Police told lawmakers in committee that the funding mechanism would not kick in fast enough.
“The funding structure as currently written, delays the impact of this critical investment far beyond the time frame in which departments need it most,” he said. “The timeline does not align with the pressing public safety, staffing and resource challenges agencies are facing today. Proposition 130 was passed by voters with the expectation that the funding would help stabilize and strengthen law enforcement capacity now, not decades into the future.”
The Colorado Municipal League, Colorado Counties Inc. County Sheriffs of Colorado and the Colorado Fraternal Order of Police support the bill.
It passed the Senate unanimously on Tuesday. It needs to clear the House floor, including debate and preliminary voice vote followed by a final recorded vote on a separate day, before the end of the legislative session on May 7. Representatives began that debate on Thursday, but the preliminary vote was delayed on that day and again on Friday morning.

,DC,2025-05-02 20:01:45+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,States’ nuclear energy growth needs federal action to follow Trump’s vocal support,Allison Prang,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/states-nuclear-energy-growth-needs-federal-action-follow-trumps-vocal-support,,"WASHINGTON —  President Donald Trump and his team have signaled a strong interest in continuing to strengthen federal support for nuclear power, an energy source Democratic states are increasingly open to expanding.The administration’s loudly pro-nuclear position creates a rare point of overlap between Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden, whose signature legislation funded hundreds of millions in tax credits for low-carbon energy sources, including nuclear power.Trump during his first roughly three months in office issued multiple executive orders mentioning nuclear energy, casting his broad energy strategy as a way to expand the country’s power resources and shore up its security. State lawmakers are also pushing their own policy moves, sometimes just in an effort to set themselves up to embrace nuclear power at some point in the future.“There are a lot of really positive signals,” said Rowen Price, senior policy adviser for nuclear energy at Third Way, a centrist policy think tank.But Price said she’s concerned that support for nuclear power could be swept up in bigger political fights, such as many congressional Republicans’ goal of axing clean-energy tax credits in Democrats’ 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. The administration’s broad cuts to the federal workforce could also eventually hurt the government's nuclear ambitions, she added.The promise of a nuclear resurgence in the United States isn’t a new goal for the industry or its backers in Washington, D.C., but how successful efforts to expand nuclear power generation will be in the U.S. — a metric that hasn’t budged from around 20% in decades — remains to be seen.Americans’ support for the energy source, meanwhile, is just short of its record high, a recent Gallup Poll found. And more blue states have also started to embrace nuclear power, which has traditionally been more favored by Republicans, to reach climate goals and grow electricity capacity amid anticipated increases in demand.But even as interest in states grows, the cost of building nuclear infrastructure remains an impediment only the federal government is positioned to help scale.‘Renaissance of nuclear’Energy Secretary Chris Wright in April talked about the administration’s desire to elevate nuclear power by making it easier to test reactors, delivering fuel to next-generation nuclear firms and utilizing the department’s Loan Programs Office to help bring nuclear power projects online.“We would like to see a renaissance of nuclear,” Wright said at the news outlet Semafor’s World Economy Summit in Washington. “The conditions are there and the administration is going to do everything we can to lean in to help commercial businesses and customers launch nuclear.”

Wright said he wants the department to help launch 10 to 20 new nuclear reactors to get the industry moving again and to bring down costs. The department’s loan office could make debt investments alongside large-scale data center companies that use massive amounts of power to build nuclear projects and then exit those deals after the projects are built, allowing the office to recycle that funding, he said.The department recently announced that it approved a third loan disbursement to reopen the Palisades Nuclear Plant in Covert, Michigan, which Holtec has been working on doing for the last few years.Last month, the department said it was reopening $900 million in funding to help companies working on small modular reactors after changing some of the Biden administration’s guidance on the program.Federal workforce cutsThird Way’s Price noted that a portion of staffers at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission — which she described as already “tightly constrained” — are eligible for retirement either now or in the next five years.Workforce cuts at the Energy Department and elsewhere could also hurt efforts to grow the nuclear power sector, she said.“Frankly, all of the verbal support from this administration for nuclear only matters if they're actually going to put forward and implement policies that support it,” Price said. “We need to make sure that they do it.”An Energy Department spokesperson said in an email that it ""is conducting a department-wide review to ensure all activities follow the law, comply with applicable court orders and align with the Trump administration’s priorities.”The agency said it didn’t have a final count on how many staffers have left the department through its resignation program, but noted that it doesn’t necessarily approve all requests. The department didn’t comment on how many staffers focused on nuclear energy have been laid off.Nuclear programs were among those affected by the Trump administration’s pausing of federal programs and funding, said David Brown, senior vice president of federal government affairs and public policy at Constellation Energy, which runs the biggest fleet of nuclear plants in the country. But Brown said that even so, the industry is coming out on top.“I think what we are seeing is that as they work through their various review(s) of programs that they’re greenlighting the nuclear stuff,” Brown said.Federal support crucial, but politics trickyLawmakers on Capitol Hill could also change the outcome for industry, for better or worse.Wright, in his remarks last month, said he hopes Congress will take action to help expand nuclear energy, and said lawmakers could do so in the budget reconciliation package on which the U.S. House has started to work.Republican House members have not yet released text of the sections of the package that will deal with energy policy. Wright said support for nuclear power could be included in the reconciliation package, but some advocates are also worried that the package, or the annual appropriations bills, are the exact kind of political battles that efforts to support nuclear power, like the tax credits, could get tied up in.Some state lawmakers point to financial support from the federal government as essential for the industry to grow, even if states make their own headway to build support for nuclear power.Colorado state Rep. Alex Valdez, a Democrat who sponsored a bill signed into law this session to include nuclear in the state’s definition of clean energy, said he hopes the administration follows through on its admiration of nuclear power with funding for states.“Generally, states do not have the financial resources the federal government does,” Valdez said. “It's going to be the federal government that puts their investments behind these things, and that's what's going to enable states as a whole to be able to move forward on them.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-05-02 16:11:38.370437

The data is up for sale, stoking fears about how it might be used and prompting attorneys general from more than a dozen states to warn 23andMe users: Delete your data.
“Your genetic data is your most personal, confidential data, and you should be able to protect who has access to it,” North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson, a Democrat, said in a March statement.
“You have the power to delete your data now — please act quickly.”

Dr. Adam Brown, a Washington, D.C.-based emergency physician and the founder of a health care strategy firm, deleted his information on 23andMe as soon as he learned of the bankruptcy filing, he told Stateline.
For him, the bankruptcy begs a vital question that federal and state laws don’t fully address: What happens to your genetic data when the company holding it collapses?
Federal protections are flimsy. States have beefed up their genetic privacy laws in recent years, but many experts say they don’t go far enough.










There actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.


– Dr. Adam Brown, emergency physician and founder of a health care strategy company


23andMe has said the bankruptcy will not change how it stores, manages or protects its trove of sensitive customer information. In a news release issued shortly after the bankruptcy announcement, the company said any potential buyers would have to agree to comply with 23andMe’s consumer privacy policy and all applicable laws. When contacted by Stateline, the company declined to comment beyond what it has published in news releases and information it posted for customers on its website.
But once the data is in the hands of another company, that company could change its privacy policy at any time, experts noted.
“Once you get to the point of bankruptcy court, there may not be those same guarantees or the same ethos a new company may have around privacy protections for consumers,” Brown said.
“I want people to understand there actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.”

HIPAA doesn’t help

Companies such as 23andMe offer their users potentially game-changing revelations about their health and ancestry. The process is simple: Mail in a saliva sample and the company uses it to build an individual genetic profile that can reveal not only a person’s family connections, but also health insights such as their risk of developing a disease like cancer or Alzheimer’s.
This valuable personal data underpins a direct-to-customer genetic testing market that was valued at $1.93 billion globally in 2023 and is expected to grow, according to market research firm Grand View Research.
23andMe was an industry giant until its stock price plummeted following a massive 2023 data breach that affected the accounts of nearly 7 million customers. Then came the $30 million class-action lawsuit settlement.
The company declared bankruptcy in late March of this year, and announced it’s up for sale.

A flurry of alerts from state attorneys general around the country soon followed. AGs from states including Alabama, Arizona, California, Kentucky, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Texas issued similar press releases that recommended customers ask the company to delete their genetic profile and destroy the saliva sample used to create it.
“We have robust state privacy laws that include data deletion rights, and I would encourage any Texan concerned about their data to exercise the right to have their data securely deleted,” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, said in an April statement.
The fear is that a new 23andMe owner could choose to use or share sensitive personal genetic data in ways the company’s current privacy policy doesn’t allow. There’s worry it could be used, for example, to inflate people’s life insurance premiums or expose them to employment discrimination.
And there aren’t many guardrails to prevent that from happening.
HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, doesn’t apply to companies like 23andMe. The landmark federal law protects patients’ sensitive health information when it’s handled by doctors, hospitals and health insurers. But direct-to-customer companies such as 23andMe or Ancestry aren’t considered health care providers, and their non-invasive saliva collection kit isn’t considered a medical test.
The main federal law that protects people from discrimination based on their genetic information is nearly 20 years old. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) was passed in 2008, long before the rise of at-home testing kits. It applies to employers and health insurers, but not to life insurance companies, mortgage lenders and other non-health entities. And it doesn’t explicitly protect epigenetic information, which is information about the way a person’s genes — and by extension, health — are affected by outside factors such as smoking, disease or stress.

What states are doing

In the past five years, at least 14 states have passed laws regulating direct-to-consumer genetic testing offered by companies like Ancestry and 23andMe. There’s variation, but generally the laws require companies to get customers’ express consent before using or sharing their data, and allow customers to request their genetic data be deleted and biological samples destroyed.
It’s a good start, but doesn’t go far enough, said Anya Prince, a University of Iowa law professor whose research focuses on health and genetic privacy.
Many of those state efforts were built around a model law developed by the Coalition for Genetic Data Protection, an industry group with two member companies: 23andMe and Ancestry.

As DNA testing kits exploded in popularity and attracted increased scrutiny from lawmakers, the coalition pushed to influence legislation and set industry standards. The privacy protections in the laws mirror what 23andMe and Ancestry were already doing with their own privacy policies, experts say.
“They do have some really sensible privacy protections,” said Prince. “It’s great that people can delete their genetic data, and it’s great that law enforcement needs a warrant to access it. But if a privacy advocate had written a model law, there would be the potential for more and broader protections.”
For example, she said, many of the state laws address privacy requirements just for direct-to-consumer DNA testing companies. If 23andMe’s data is bought by, say, a pharmaceutical company, those state laws no longer apply.
The coalition now appears to be inactive, its website defunct.
Since 2020, more than a dozen states have passed some version of a genetic information privacy law, including Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming, based on a Stateline analysis. This year, the Indiana legislature passed a bill that’s now headed to the governor’s desk. Bills have been introduced this year in other states, including West Virginia.
Prince said state laws rely too heavily on consumers to self-manage their data privacy. They’re expected to understand a company’s policy, when studies have shown the public often doesn’t read privacy notices nor fully understand how companies use their data. Further, many state laws don’t address how third parties, such as law enforcement, can access and use consumer genetic data.
It’s also not always clear how the laws will be enforced, or who’s responsible for oversight.
“In general, I think there’s a disconnect between how people think their privacy is protected and how it’s actually protected,” she said.
But a few states have enacted laws that are more robust. California, for example, has a genetic information privacy law, but also has a general data protection law, as well as a state version of the federal GINA law that extends genetic anti-discrimination protections into areas including housing, education and licensing.
Florida has beefed up its DNA privacy laws in recent years, making the using or selling of an individual’s DNA without informed consent a felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison and up to a $10,000 fine. Florida was also the first state to prohibit life, disability and long-term care insurance companies from using genetic information to determine coverage.

Officials said no. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Rutgers University officials have refused a state lawmaker’s request that they reconsider actor Ramy Youssef as a commencement speaker because his support for the Palestinian people and a Gaza ceasefire is “alienating and isolating” for Jewish students.
Assemblyman Avi Schnall (D-Ocean) sent a letter to Rutgers President Jonathan Holloway and the university’s board of governors calling Youssef “polarizing” and “anti-Israel.”

Picking Youssef to address Rutgers-Newark graduates at their May 22 commencement “sends an unfortunate and deeply hurtful message,” especially as antisemitism climbs on college campuses, Schnall wrote.
“Graduation should not be marred by controversy or by actions that leave part of the student body feeling uncomfortable, scared or unwelcome,” Schnall wrote. “It should be a day that lifts every student up.”
Rutgers officials, though, said commencement speakers and honorary degree recipients are “thoughtfully reviewed” and recommended by a campus-wide committee that includes students, faculty, and staff. Youssef also will receive an honorary doctor of fine arts degree at the event.
“Ramy Youssef is a celebrated writer and artist who has deep ties to New Jersey and to Rutgers-Newark, which he attended,” the university said in a statement. “His selection as commencement speaker at Rutgers-Newark reflects a tradition of honoring individuals who embody resilience, creativity, and connection to our community.”
Rutgers announced last week that Youssef, a practicing Muslim and Egyptian-American actor and comedian who was raised in Rutherford, would be the keynote commencement speaker for Newark graduates.
“Thirteen years ago I took a ‘break’ from Rutgers to pursue acting. The break is now over. I am honored to be giving this year’s commencement speech, and to finally receive a college degree,” Youssef said in that announcement. “Thank you Rutgers for this honor, and for making my parents feel like the three semesters of tuition they paid for was actually worth it.”
Last month, he told The New York Times that he has fielded plenty of criticism for his comments about Israel and Palestine. But he defended them as “completely inoffensive” and lamented “a massive power imbalance” in the Gaza conflict.
Rutgers has caught similar flak, most notably over its response to pro-Palestinian solidarity encampments on campus last year that led to Holloway getting grilled by lawmakers in both New Jersey and Washington, D.C.
While Rutgers subsequently banned such encampments and suspended a Palestinian student group that was involved, at least two other Jewish lawmakers have targeted New Jersey’s flagship university for criticism about its encampment response and related issues.
State Sen. Robert Singer (R-Ocean) last month called for a freeze of public funding for Rutgers for “ignoring antisemitism.” U.S. Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-05) also has called on Rutgers officials to cancel campus speakers he deemed antisemitic.
College campuses nationally have seen incidents of both antisemitism and Islamophobia climb since Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel.
At Rutgers, the U.S. Department of Justice in January ordered reforms after it found the university created a “hostile environment” for Jewish, Palestinian, and other students based on national origin. The Anti-Defamation League recently gave Rutgers a grade of “D” for its “deficient” approach to protecting Jewish students from antisemitism.

Reder announced his resignation through social media on Thursday due to “personal and professional reasons.”
He had faced questions in the news media and on political blogs about his residency status, but did not address that in his resignation announcement.
Another legislative seat opened recently in District 22, which includes areas in Beadle, Spink and Clark counties, when Rhoden selected Sen. David Wheeler, R-Huron, to become a judge. Rhoden will make appointments for the open seats.

CHICAGO — Michelle Nolasco, a 20-year-old DePaul University student from Orland Park, Illinois, held a sign that read: “I was supposed to be at school … Instead, I am here, fighting for mi familia y mi gente,” meaning “my family and my people.”

“I feel like being in class is not as important as being here,” Nolasco, a child of undocumented immigrants from Mexico, said Thursday. She was among thousands who gathered in Union Park to mark May Day with speeches and signs before marching through downtown to Grant Park later in the afternoon, where speakers — including Mayor Brandon Johnson — addressed the rally.

May Day — also known as International Workers’ Day — is a global holiday commemorating the labor rights movement, in which Chicago played a pivotal role.

Across the nation and the world, hundreds of thousands demonstrated Thursday to champion workers’ rights as well as to denounce the Trump administration’s widespread crackdowns on immigration, its economic policies and disruptive global tariffs.

Immigration has become a major focus of May Day rallies in the U.S. since 2006, when roughly one million people — nearly half a million in Chicago alone — marched as part of a nationwide movement against tough, proposed, federal anti-immigration reforms. The legislation, called the Border Protection, Antiterrorism, and Illegal Immigration Control Act, would have criminalized living in the U.S. without legal permission, making it a felony.

Nearly 20 years after those first rallies, the crowd in Chicago erupted Thursday into chants of  “No hate, no fear, immigrants are welcome here!” Some said the struggle was all too familiar.

“I was one of the main conveners of the 2006 mega march on March 10 and then on May 1 of 2006, and having to fight against it all over again is obviously a deja vu,” said Omar Lopez, 80, a member of the Central Committee of the Consejo de Resistencia en Defensa del Inmigrante, the body that made the initial call for people to take to the streets.

Since President Donald Trump was sworn into office in January, his administration has launched immigration raids across the country, urged others to self-deport, canceled foreign students’ visas, and even deported legal residents without due process. “We will close the border. We will stop the invasion of illegals into our country,” Trump said during his campaign.

From April 21-26, federal and local authorities arrested 1,120 Floridians in an effort dubbed “Operation Tidal Wave,” according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Earlier that month, the administration sent over 200 migrants to a notorious maximum-security prison in El Salvador in a wave of arbitrary arrests and deportations that 20 United Nations human rights experts deemed “contrary to international law.”

“This is a life-and-death question for the labor movement and for the whole working class, not just for those that are immigrants: It has to do with the unity of the working class and our ability to fight for our own interests,” said David Rosenfeld, a Chicago-based railroad worker who is a member of the Socialist Workers Party and the SMART Transportation Division. “That's why I'm particularly proud of my union, the SMART Transportation union, which has been standing up for our member, Kilmar Abrego García.”

García, a first-year apprentice with the union with no criminal convictions who was living in Maryland, was wrongfully deported to his native El Salvador — despite a 2019 court order shielding him from being sent there due to the risk of persecution by local gangs that had terrorized his family. The Trump administration called the deportation “an administrative error” but contended García was a member of the MS-13 gang, an allegation a federal judge questioned and the man’s wife and lawyer denied. Officials later added domestic abuse to the list of allegations, actions his wife acknowledged but explained, adding that “Kilmar is a loving partner and father.”

A federal judge, an appeals court and the Supreme Court have all ordered the government to facilitate García’s return to the country, but the administration has argued in court that it had no means of doing so.

Although immigration became a focus of the event, it was not the only one.

“We have groups that have other grievances against what's coming out of Washington, and they're also using this as a vehicle to express their grievances,” Lopez said. “Now, we see a broader coalition than we did in 2006.”

Some organizations were planning to organize their own May Day events but decided to follow the lead of the Central Committee.

“We were going to put on a May Day march that was specifically geared towards women and fem-identifying workers,” said Jill Manrique, an executive director at Chicago Jobs With Justice. “But when we found out that this was happening, we joined up—we didn't want to split solidarity.”

According to Lopez, this year’s coalition included 175 organizations—from unions to faith-based groups—from across Illinois, including DuPage and McHenry counties and cities like Elgin, Rockford and Aurora. Unlike the recent “Hands Off!” campaign that spanned more than 30 cities throughout the state, the May Day rallies were held only in Chicago and Evanston. Still, many from outside the city joined the Union Park event.

One protester who would give only his first name for fear of retribution, Ashton — a young trans man from Ottawa, Illinois — drove a couple of hours to the event.

“It's absolutely insane that we need to do this,” he said. “I keep seeing people saying, you know, if a child needs to be an activist, we've already failed them, and this is absolutely freaking true.”

Some organizations arranged transportation to bring people from outside the city.

“The eight buses that our organization is bringing are coming mainly from the Southwest suburbs like Bolingbrook, Plainfield, Romeoville, Joliet, Naperville and Lockport,” said Margarita Morelos, a co-founder of Casa Aguascalientes Chicago, a non-profit working to empower the Hispanic community. “But other organizations are having buses coming from other places, like the North Side and the West Side of Chicago.”

The diversity of the organizations, locations and people represented in the rally was reflected in the thousands of handmade signs, which addressed a variety of issues, ranging from LGBTQ+ and reproductive rights to the rights of health care and education workers, as well as U.S. foreign policy toward Israel and Russia.

“The basic message is that we are resisting, we are defending every community and every sector of society,” said Jorge Mujica, another member of the Central Committee of the Consejo de Resistencia en Defensa del Inmigrante. “This is not only about immigrant workers, this is about students, this is about colleges and universities, this is about the health care system. It's about everything that is under attack by the Washington administration.”

Faith Humphrey Hill, a Chicago-based fiber artist, said she struggled with choosing only one issue to focus on when weaving her sign.

“I almost knitted a really long tapestry, like a long scarf that just drags on forever, because I don't know how to sum up everything that upsets me,” she said. “Women's rights is obviously close to home, but I also have a trans child, and so his (Trump’s) attack on trans people really upsets me.

“My kid exists,” she added. “He's trying to erase them, but no, they're a human, and they exist.”

However, a recent report warns that President Donald Trump’s efforts to eliminate those policies are already cutting into the state’s clean energy gains.
Climate Power, a strategic communications firm centered on climate progress, has issued several reports tracking the impacts of Biden’s climate policies across the U.S., repeatedly pointing to Michigan as the state attracting the largest share of clean energy projects, in addition to drawing significant investments and creating thousands of jobs. 
However, in the months since Trump has taken office, the president’s attacks on clean energy policy alongside the impact of his tariff policies have threatened, delayed or outright canceled $14.2 billion in investments alongside 2,667 jobs, the firm’s latest report said.
If congressional Republicans repeal the IRA’s tax credits for clean energy manufacturing, Climate Power warns that $39.85 billion in investments and 25,357 jobs could be lost.

The report also emphasizes that these cuts would harm low-income communities, where companies have announced $13.3 billion in investments, creating 17,245 clean energy jobs. Additionally projects announced in rural communities which are expected to bring $5.8 billion in investment and 2,886 jobs could also be placed at risk. 
While Climate Power has projected that the state will bring in 167,000 new jobs over the next ten years, the loss of federal support and impacts of Trump’s trade war would similarly jeopardize these gains. 
“Trump’s war on clean energy and his chaotic policies have already caused a hemorrhaging of manufacturing jobs in sectors that had been booming for two years,” Lori Lodes, Climate Power’s executive director said in a statement. “Repealing clean energy investments would jeopardize hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs on its own. On top of this crisis of uncertainty, repeal would devastate American manufacturing — halting construction, sending jobs overseas, hiking energy costs, and forfeiting the future to China and our other competitors.”
Of the 74 clean energy projects committed to investing in Michigan, the majority are centered in electric vehicles and batteries, with 35 projects centered on EV manufacturing and 19 on batteries. These sectors were also the largest for jobs, with the battery industry accounting for  46.9% of incoming jobs, while the electric vehicles sector accounts for 32.6%. However, the clean technology sector has drawn the greatest amount of investments, bringing $13.2 billion into the state.

The report also points to several projects in these sectors, including a $1.6 billion battery cell plant in Van Buren Township from Michigan-based Our Next Energy, and General Motors’ plan to retool its Lansing Grand River Plant for electric vehicle production using a $500 million clean energy grant. 
Climate power also noted that more than a third of the clean energy projects coming into Michigan would be housed in districts represented by Republicans in Congress, for a total of $12.5 billion in investments. 
As Republicans work to cut spendings in order to extend Trump’s 2017 tax policy, some House Republicans have spoken out against eliminating the clean energy tax credit, including Rep. John James (R-Shelby Twp.) whose district expects to see 275 new jobs and over $16 million in investments.
According to a report from Politico, Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Zeeland) signed onto a letter Thursday calling for House Ways and Means Chair Jason Smith (R-Mo.) to maintain incentives for nuclear energy.

The 16-member panel of Republican and Democratic legislators, state officials and a handful of appointees from both parties will craft policy changes in an effort to evaluate Kansas’ current and future water supply, funding efforts for water projects and potential impacts on the state’s economy.
Republicans announced their appointments Wednesday, which included an official from utility company Evergy, an environmental consultant and the manager of a public groundwater management district in northwest Kansas.
Senate President Ty Masterson, an Andover Republican said these members are experts in the field with intricate understandings of water issues.
“Water is the essence of life, the foundation upon which Kansas thrives — sustaining our fields, fueling our communities, and nourishing our future — and truly runs through every decision we make, from agriculture to economic development,” Masterson said.
The task force was born out of House Bill 2172, which passed the Senate in March with unanimous bipartisan support and the House with eight Republicans voting against it. The bill had no opponents in committee hearings.
The task force’s water policy recommendations will begin with a preliminary report due by the end of January and end with a final report that must be submitted to the governor and the Legislature by the end of January 2027.
Within the next two months, the task force members must appoint people to a subgroup that would be responsible for modernizing the State Water Resources Planning Act.
The subgroup’s members must be attorneys, engineers, hydrologists, natural resource planners or others with experience with Kansas water issues, according to the legislation.
First passed in 1963 and revamped in the 1980s, the State Water Resources Planning Act and the State Water Plan guide Kansas water management, conservation and development efforts. With drought becoming increasingly apparent in western and central Kansas, including the depletion of the High Plains Aquifer, the task force will address the state’s current and future water needs.
A focus on agriculture and industry is especially important, said House Speaker Dan Hawkins, a Wichita Republican.
“To say water is vital to Kansas agriculture, business, and communities would be an understatement, and the input from this Task Force will be key to ensuring this precious resource is available for generations to come,” he said in a Thursday news release.
Gov. Laura Kelly, in her own news release distributed upon signing the task force bill into law in April, said the task force enables lawmakers to evaluate risks to Kansas’ water quality and quantity through a funded, bipartisan group.
“Developing a comprehensive, long-term, and sustainable water program is long overdue and a significant step forward in ensuring Kansas’ water supply is preserved for generations to come,” she said.
Republican leadership’s appointees included three Republican legislators; Jared Morrison, director of Evergy’s water and waste programs; Kansas Chamber board chair Karma Mason; and Shannon Kenyon, the manager of Groundwater Management District No. 4 in northwest Kansas.
Democratic leadership on Tuesday appointed Josh Svaty, a former state legislator and former state agriculture secretary, and Heidi Mehl, the Kansas director of water and agriculture for the Nature Conservancy, an international environmental organization.
The task force also will include three nonvoting members from the Kansas Department of Health and Environment, the Kansas Water Office and the Kansas Department of Agriculture.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Copy-of-P5220469-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-05-02 16:11:38.370437

“Questions remain” for landowners regarding how to provide access to public land, grazing representative said. Hunters’ attorney encouraged recreators to exercise caution and goodwill if attempting to corner cross. 
The post Corner-crossing experts urge caution for Wyoming recreators in wake of ruling appeared first on WyoFile .","LARAMIE—A March ruling by a federal appeals court in a widely watched corner-crossing case determined that private landowners cannot bar access to public lands with fences, trespass actions or other methods.
Hunters, recreators and public lands advocates celebrated the ruling and its implications for the states within the 10th Circuit — Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, Oklahoma and Kansas.
Thursday, however, Ryan Semerad, the attorney who represented the four Missouri hunters in the federal civil lawsuit, urged recreators to exercise caution and goodwill if attempting to corner cross — or step from one piece of public land to another where those two parcels meet at a common corner with two private parcels, in a checkboard pattern of ownership. Wyoming’s checkerboard spans more than 2 million acres. 
“There are limitations to that decision,” Semerad said Thursday during a corner-crossing panel discussion in Laramie. “That doesn’t mean go jump on your side by side … and just have at it. It doesn’t mean you get to go on private property without permission, consent or something else. What it means is that you have reasonable access to step from one section to the next section, so long as you can be situated appropriately, you know where the monument marker is, you know where you’re going and you respect that.”
The first corner the hunters crossed was marked by T-posts chained together, signs and a survey monument. (Wyoming Backcountry Hunters and Anglers)
There are also outstanding questions for landowners, said Wyoming Stock Growers Association Executive Vice President Jim Magagna, another panelist. His group filed an amicus brief in the case in support of the landowner who sued the Missouri hunters for stepping over, but never touching, Elk Mountain Ranch property. 
“It’s pretty clear that you cannot deny access to these checkerboard lands,” Magagna said. “Does that mean that you have to allow crossing at every corner? If I want to identify one of the four corners that I control as the access point, do I have the liberty to do that? Or if I want to designate a path through the middle of my private land in lieu of granting access across the corners?
“Those are many of the questions that still remain out there to be addressed,” Magagna said. 
As they talked, it became clear that interpretations of the ruling still vary widely. But both urged common sense and respectful communication — traditional tenets of Wyoming hunting etiquette regarding private landowners.
“We need to remember that it’s a culture of cooperation with these lands, and that’s how this is going to work moving forward,” Semerad said.
The panel was part of the Wyoming Outdoor Recreation Summit, a two-day event bringing together outdoor recreation business leaders, public lands agency officials, nonprofits and others to strengthen the burgeoning industry and enhance access to resources. The summit is one product of newly expanded state government support of the outdoor recreation — Wyoming’s Office of Outdoor Recreation helps put it on. 
Appropriately, the panel addressed a legal question that has captivated recreators in Wyoming and the nation.
Hunters, a wealthy landowner, trespass charges 
In 2020, hunters Brad Cape, John Slowensky and Phillip Yeomans corner crossed to hunt on Elk Mountain, then did so again with Zach Smith in 2021.
Carbon County ranch owner Fred Eshelman sued the four men in 2022 for passing through the airspace above his property on their way to hunt.
Eshelman sued to block them, and anyone else, from corner crossing to reach some 11,000 acres of federal and state land enmeshed in his 50-square-mile ranch, a coveted hunting ground known for its abundant wildlife.
The appeals court used this graphic to depict corner crossing. (IU.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals)
That set off a series of court challenges and appeals in a case that involved everything from the limits of private property rights to the extent of airspace and the legality of preventing the public from accessing public land. 
With implications not only for the 2.4 million acres of “corner-locked” land in Wyoming, but also for 8.3 million acres across the West, the case gained national attention, particularly among hunters. 
It culminated in March with the appeals court decision. In a unanimous opinion, the three-judge panel sided against Eshelman, citing an act of Congress that preempts Wyoming trespass law. 
Congress enacted the Unlawful Inclosures Act in 1885. “No one may completely prevent or obstruct another from peacefully entering or freely passing over or through public lands,” the act says, according to the appellate judges. 
The act, which explicitly prohibits “obstructing transit over public lands by force, threats, intimidation, or by any fencing or inclosing,” supersedes Wyoming trespass law, the judges ruled. 
What that means in practical terms, Semerad said Thursday, is this: “You can now step from one section of public land to the next. In Wyoming, there is no state law, statute or regulation that can stop you; the federal law would preempt it.”
Questions remain 
Magagna believes the ruling is aimed explicitly at the checkerboard — not islands of public land surrounded by private land elsewhere, he said Thursday. 
Semerad disagreed. “The Unlawful Inclosures Act applies to all public lands,” he said. 
Moderator Dan McCoy, director of the Jay Kemmerer WORTH Institute, asked if the Wyoming Legislature or the state could have a bearing on the issue. 
The Legislature’s Travel, Recreation, Wildlife and Cultural Resources Committee will discuss corner crossing when it holds an interim meeting June 5-6 in Dubois.

Though the ruling clearly states the Unlawful Inclosures Act is supreme, Magagna said, “I think where there is opportunity, potentially for the Legislature should they choose to do so, is to better define the tools that are available and the limitations on the use of those tools.” He also brought up land exchanges by which more public land could become accessible without the necessity of corner crossing.  
So what should recreators do if they come across a corner that’s fenced off, McCoy asked.
“If you come across a fenced corner, call me, call the U.S. Attorney’s office because that’s unlawful,” Semerad said. “That is straight up a violation of the Unlawful Inclosures Act.”
The March decision might not be the final word in the corner-crossing case. There is a chance it will be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, Semerad said. The earliest the high court could see it is next winter, he said. 
In the meantime, both men stressed a spirit of collaboration when it comes to public land users and private property owners.

“Respect and cooperation is always going to take us much further than if we’re just going to be battling it out all the time,” Semerad said. 
“The real answer to all this, to me and I think to many people I represent,” Magagna added, “is the relationships we build in Wyoming with people, between private landowners and the recreation and outdoor community, particularly the sportsmen, hunters and fishermen. So I think that the key thing, for now at least, is to build those relationships.”

The committee will host its hearing at 1 p.m. in Representatives Hall in the State House, the final formal opportunity for residents to voice their opinions during the budget process. 
Those unable to attend in person may watch a livestream on Youtube. 
The hearing comes as the committee works to finish a version of the budget that can pass the full Senate by June 5. At that point, the Senate’s version will go back to the House, which will likely convene a committee of conference to allow House and Senate leaders to negotiate a final package. The budget will then head to Gov. Kelly Ayotte, who must sign it by June 30, the end of the current state fiscal year. 
In April, the House passed a budget that made deep cuts to the plan recommended by Ayotte — with $643 million less spending than Ayotte’s proposal. House budget writers said the governor had been too rosy with her revenue projections and that the state needed to make hard choices. 
Ayotte has since expressed disagreement with the House’s budget and has called on the Senate to restore some of the cuts, which included the elimination of the Office of the Child Advocate, a watchdog agency over the Division for Children, Youth, and Families; the Human Rights Commission; the Housing Appeals Board; and the state Commission on Aging, among other spending reductions. 
As the Senate Finance Committee begins crafting its own version of the budget, observers are closely watching the Senate Ways and Means Committee, which plans to unveil and vote for the state’s revenue projections next week. Those projections are traditionally more accurate than the House or governor’s projections, because they come after April 15, or Tax Day, and include preliminary data on state business tax returns. 
The Ways and Means Committee is scheduled to vote on the revenue projections on Wednesday; those projections were not publicly available Friday afternoon. The projections will then be used by the Senate Finance Committee to guide their amendments to the House-passed budget. 
A preliminary monthly report from the Department of Administrative Services suggests that business tax revenues in April were 15.6% lower than in April 2024 and 10.2% lower than had been planned for in the last two-year budget, passed in 2023. That decrease — which includes last month’s Tax Day returns — could affect whether, and how much, the Republican-led Senate chooses to reverse the House budget. 
Senate Democrats criticized Senate Republicans for holding only one hearing on the budget and only doing so in Concord. They held their own listening session at Winnacunnet High School in Hampton on April 23.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/springstatehouse25-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-02 16:11:38.370437

(Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)A measure that Democrats and voting rights advocates say would make it significantly more difficult for citizen-led constitutional amendments to make it on the ballot has passed in the Republican-controlled Florida Legislature.
It now goes to Governor Ron DeSantis desk, where he is expected to quickly sign the measure into law.
“This is the most important bill that we will be hearing in this chamber,” said Democratic Senate Leader Lori Berman on Wednesday. “And as you’ve heard, it’s going to greatly restrict the access of the citizens of the state of Florida to be able to address the system.”
The Senate on Friday passed an amended version of HB 1205, 28-9. The House voted 81-30 on Thursday night.
DeSantis said in January that it was a top legislative priority for him this year. The governor and his fellow Republicans in the Legislature argue the measure is needed to combat signature petition fraud that they alleged was exposed last year in the campaigns to pass constitutional amendments regarding legalizing recreational marijuana and abortion rights.
Their proof? A report published in January by the Office of Election Crimes and Security alleging that more than 100 representatives of the group attempting to pass the abortion-rights initiative committed crimes related to gathering petitions.
“The report penetrates the smokescreen of out-of-state petition mills who steal citizens’ identity and then hide from Florida prosecutors,” said Panhandle Republican Don Gaetz, co-sponsor of the Senate bill, on Wednesday during floor debate. “The report explains the slippery sidestepping of responsibility of amendment sponsors who pay for it all and then deny it all.”
Jacksonville Democratic Sen. Tracie Davis argued that Republicans were making too much of that report.
“We talk about the fraudulent report,” she said. “You’ve heard that over and over again. The 900-page [report] that shows all of the fraudulent cases. Guess what guys? I have it, too. Seventeen arrests. Twenty-five cases. Most of this is charts. Redacted pages, and so on.”
Vero Beach Republican Sen. Erin Grall, the other co-sponsor of the bill, said on Thursday that the report showed 18 arrests in all, along with hundreds of allegations of petition fraud referred to the Office of Election Crimes and Security that are listed in the document.
Who can participate?
The bill includes a number of proposals that Democrats say will allow only the wealthy to participate in the process of placing a constitutional amendment on the ballot in Florida.
“This bill raises the costs,” said South Florida Democratic Sen. Shevrin Jones on Thursday. “This bill tightens the timeline. This bill adds legal tasks and risks. And lastly, members, this bill absolutely stacks the deck until the only people who can access the process are those who can afford lobbyists and lawyers.”
Floridians strongly supported the two constitutional amendments on last year’s ballot regarding cannabis and abortion rights, with both measure drawing more than 55% of the vote — clear majorities but short of the 60% required for passage in Florida.
“Those pesky amendments 3 and 4 just came too damn close to passing, so, what are we going to do?” said South Florida Sen. Tina Polsky, mimicking what she said top Republicans had in mind. “We’re going to make it so hard, and so expensive, that only corporate interests are going to be able to get a citizen’s initiative on the ballot.”
“Fifty-seven percent of Floridians told us that a six-week abortion ban was extreme and should be overturned,” said Orlando Democratic Sen. Carlos Guillermo Smith. “So, instead of taking action when they told us, ‘Do something about this extreme abortion ban,’ we did nothing. Oh, wait, wait. I’m wrong. We did something. We came up with this bill to remind people that we are not listening.”
But Northeast Florida Republican Sen. Jennifer Bradley insisted the bill was absolutely needed.
“This is not a bill to restrict, it is a bill to protect. To make sure that our constitutional system is one of integrity and that it’s free of fraud,” she said. “The bill that is before us does not address imaginary, hypothetical fraud, but known fraud, fraud that has been exposed for us to see.”
What it does
Among the provisions in the bill are:

Requires additional personal identifying information for voters signing petition forms and for applicants for petition circulators, including listing their Florida driver license or ID card number and the last four digits of their Social Security numbers.
Bans people who are not residents of Florida from acting as petition circulators. People who are not U.S. citizens are also banned, as are people who have been convicted of a felony violation and not had their right to vote restored. The sponsors of  an amendment are liable for a $50,000 fine if found to have used such people as petition gatherers.
Requires training for petition circulators.
Requires signed petitions must be returned to the supervisor of elections office within 10 days after the voter signs the form (currently it is 30 days). The petition gatherer will be fined $50 per each day late for each petition form received after 10 days. That fine will be increased to $2,500 for each petition form received if the petition gatherer “acted willfully.”
Those fines will rise to $100 per each day late, up to a maximum of $500, for each petition form signed by a voter on or before Feb. 1 in an election year. That goes up to $5,000 if the petition gatherer acted willfully.
Requires supervisors of elections to notify voters whose signatures are verified and provide an opportunity for such persons to report that their signatures were forged or misrepresented.
Provides for inclusion of the financial impact statement on the petition form and adds the financial impact statement to the issues subject to automatic Supreme Court review.
If a petition gatherer signs someone else’s name to a petition, he or she will be fined $5,000 for each petition.
If the petition gatherer retains a voter’s information for any reason other than for an amendment campaign, they will be subject to a third-degree felony.
A person who collects, delivers, or otherwise physically possesses more than 25 signed petition forms in addition to his or her own signed petition form or a signed petition form belonging to an immediate family member, and who is not registered as a petition circulator, is subject to a third-degree felony.
For any reporting period in which the percentage of petition forms deemed invalid by the supervisor of elections exceeds 25% of the forms received in a particular reporting period, the supervisor must notify the Office of Election Crimes and Security. They will then conduct a preliminary investigation into whether the invalidated petitions are a result of fraud. If warranted, the Office of Election Crimes and Security may report findings to the statewide prosecutor or the state attorney for the judicial circuit where the alleged violation occurred for prosecution.
Bans anyone from the state government from authorizing the expenditure of public funds for a political advertisement or any other communication for a citizen-led constitutional amendment campaign. However, the bill also says that it “does not preclude” state government or a person acting on behalf of the state government from reporting on official actions of the state government in “an accurate, fair, and impartial manner; posting factual information on a government website or in printed materials; hosting and providing information at a public forum; providing factual information in response to an inquiry.”

DeSantis-inspired
The last provision was placed on the bill earlier this year by Sen. Bradley, and follows reports that DeSantis used taxpayers funds last year for public service ads and otherwise used government resources to campaign against Amendments 3 and 4.
South Florida Sen. Jason Pizzo, who left the Democratic Party a week ago to become a political independent, told the bill sponsors on Thursday that if they could acknowledge that state elected officials used taxpayer resources last year, they would have his vote.
“The Bradley provision which we included in this bill was inspired by individuals who work for the state government and are part of the state government now,” Sen. Gaetz said. “And they engaged in behavior that will now be unlawful, and will now be prevented if we pass this bill.”
With that acknowledgement, Pizzo joined all the Senate Republicans in supporting the measure. All Democrats opposed it.
The law will go into effect immediately after the governor signs the bill. That means it will affect organizations working to get a constitutional amendment on the ballot in 2026, such as Florida Decides Healthcare, working to have Florida expand Medicaid.
“This legislation is not about ‘transparency’ or ‘reform.’ It’s a calculated move by out-of-touch politicians trying to rewrite the rules to further keep the power in their hands and away from everyday citizens. They’re attempting to silence Floridians because they’re afraid of answering to We The People,” said Florida Decides Healthcare Campaign Manager Mitch Emerson.
“Florida Decides Healthcare has fought tirelessly to protect the voice of the people and we’re not going anywhere. We will continue to fight for the freedom of every Floridian to access the healthcare they need because no politician gets to decide which rights we’re allowed to keep. The people of Florida deserve better than this bad-faith attempt to silence our voices.”
Brad Ashwell, Florida director of All Voting is Local, took aim at one specific part of the bill as especially egregious.
“By imposing a 10-day timeline on signed petition forms, Florida politicians would effectively get rid of citizen-led amendments and eliminate a proven way for people to participate in the state’s democratic processes,” Ashwell said in a written statement.
“Point blank, this is an attack on our democracy and follows an undeniable pattern in Florida where state officials want to silence anyone who doesn’t agree with them and ensure people can’t decide for themselves how they’re governed.”

(Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)The Maine Commission on Public Defense Services is asking the Legislature to consider a proposal to improve confidentiality between attorneys and incarcerated people communicating in jails. 
LD 1825, would prohibit a jail or third-party contractor who provides communication services from intercepting communication between a person who is incarcerated and an attorney or an employee of a law office. It would also bar them from charging a fee for those communications. 
Current law requires the commission to send a list of names and contact information for attorneys who provide legal services to incarcerated people to all sheriff’s offices on a weekly basis. The legislation would also require each jail to send electronic communications to each attorney on that list certifying that communications will not be intercepted or come with a fee. 
While the Department of Corrections already provides a certain amount of free phone calls to people being held in jails, officials opposed this bill, saying that allowing more would be cost prohibitive. Deputy Commissioner Anthony Cantillo also raised concerns about the electronic communication stipulation and whether jails would be able to keep track of who is an employee at a law office since only attorneys are included on that weekly list.
Maine is in the midst of what some have described a “constitutional crisis” regarding the state’s ability to provide timely counsel to defendants who can’t afford an attorney. The American Civil Liberties Union of Maine has argued since 2022 that the state is in violation of the Sixth Amendment, which declares the right to a speedy and public trial and legal counsel.
Earlier this year, the Kennebec County Superior Court agreed to start releasing defendants who have been waiting for counsel from incarceration if the state fails to provide representation. In response, the commission put forth a proposal with short- and long-term solutions to address the issue. 
LD 1825 was one of four bills the commission brought to the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee born out of an annual report that was submitted to the committee earlier this year. Because of this, they were not sponsored by individual legislators as usual. 
These proposals come after the Legislature passed a bill last month to bolster the state’s strained public defense system by creating new staff positions and increasing funding for private counsel representing defendants who can’t afford their own attorneys. It subsequently became law without Gov. Janet Mills endorsing it with her signature.
The commission also saw push back from the judicial branch on another proposal, LD 1796. 
That bill seeks to clarify that the courts — and not the commission — are responsible for providing and paying for counsel to a juvenile who files a petition for emancipation and those who are entitled to publicly funded counsel in probate cases. It similarly seeks to clarify that courts are responsible for providing the services of a guardian ad litem appointed at public expense.
Julie Finn, a representative for the judicial branch, said the proposed changes would transfer responsibilities onto the courts that are already underresourced. If the judicial branch is asked to take on those responsibilities and payments, Finn said additional dollars would need to follow. She gave a rough cost estimate of $350,000 to $400,000.
Carney asked Finn and the public defense commission’s Executive Director Jim Billings to ponder creative solutions to address the disagreement over who should have that responsibility because she thinks “the money, ultimately, will be a wash.”
Billings said he doesn’t have strong feelings on whether this falls on the commission or the judicial branch, but he wants to avoid future scenarios where the commission is paying for attorneys on both sides of a guardianship case. 
Another bill sought to clarify when a criminal defendant is entitled to counsel at state expense. Billings said the commission is asking the committee to consider LD 1802 because of previous situations that felt incongruent with due process and fairness. 
Currently, prosecutors indicate if they will be seeking jail time in cases where that would be possible. If they indicate they won’t be seeking jail time, that person does not have a right to indigent defense services. 
However, Billings said there are scenarios where a defendant has already spent a night in jail but the prosecutor isn’t planning to pursue further jail time, so they aren’t deemed eligible. LD 1802 would change the policy so that person would be entitled to counsel. 
Billings said other states actually use a simpler system that entitles a person to counsel if the crime they are charged with authorizes jail as a sentence, rather than relying on the intentions of the prosecutor. When asked why the commission isn’t trying to adopt that approach, Billings said he’s interested in using incremental change and compromise to further justice in the state.
“We are moving in baby steps over at PDS,” he told the committee. 
The final bill brought by the commission seeks technical amendments to the definitions of “employed counsel” and “public defender.” LD 1801 would also make training materials used by the commission confidential in response to concerns that some presenters have raised that their materials could be subject to Freedom of Access Act laws.

Tony Evers had already said he wasn’t directing state employees to break the law should immigration officials enter state buildings. Evers answers reporters questions in March. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Gov. Tony Evers issued a three-minute video Friday in which he addressed Wisconsinites, describing a statement  from the White House border czar Tom Homan that has been interpreted by some as a threat to arrest Evers as “chilling.” 
Homan made the vague threat after a reporter for the far-right website Gateway Pundit asked him “why not just arrest” leaders interfering with deportation efforts. The reporter then specifically asked him about Evers’ directive to state agencies instructing them to consult an attorney if federal immigration agents enter state buildings demanding files or computer system access.
“Wait to see what’s coming,” Homan said. “You can not support what we’re doing and you can support sanctuary cities if that’s what you want to do, but if you cross that line of impediment or knowingly harboring or concealing an illegal alien, that is a felony and we’ll treat it as such.” 
Before the comment, Evers had already said he wasn’t directing state employees to break the law should immigration officials enter state buildings.
“A Trump Administration official, in not so many words, apparently threatened to arrest me… The goal of this guidance was simple — to provide clear, consistent instructions to state employees and ensure they have a lawyer to help them comply with all federal and state laws. Nothing more, nothing less,” Evers said in the video. “But Republicans and their right-wing allies, including Elon Musk, lied about this guidance, spread misinformation, accused me of doing things I didn’t do or say, and fueled a fake controversy of their own creation.”

The guidance sent by the Department of Administration to state employees told them to stay calm if an ICE agent entered their offices. It told them to ask agents for their names and badges to verify their identity, to ask why they were there, ask for documentation like a valid warrant then tell the agent to have a seat. It said state employees should call the Office of Legal Council to consult an attorney.
It also told employees not to answer questions from an agent, give them access to paper files and computer systems without speaking to an attorney and not to give consent for an agent to enter a “nonpublic” area, noting that they need a judicial warrant to enter such an area. 
“Remember that every state employee has a duty to protect confidential data and information collected or maintained by the State of Wisconsin in state offices and electronic filing systems,” the guidance stated. 
“I haven’t broken the law. I haven’t committed a crime, and I’ve never encouraged or directed anyone to break any laws or commit any crimes,” Evers said in the video. “When President Trump’s hand-picked appointee, Tom Homan, was asked about me and this guidance after he apparently threatened to arrest elected officials across the country, he said, ‘Wait ’til you see what’s coming.’ Overnight, Republican lawmakers piled on, encouraging the Trump Administration to arrest me.” 
Evers’ directive had received backlash from Wisconsin Republicans who called on Evers to rescind the guidance and support Trump’s deportation agenda. 
One Republican state lawmaker Rep. Calvin Callahan (R-Tomahawk) suggested in multiple social media posts Thursday that Evers should be arrested — sharing an AI-generated photo of Evers in handcuffs and writing in another post that “this is what Tony Evers sent out; stick him in the same cell as the Milwaukee judge!” Milwaukee County Judge Hannah Dugan was arrested last week under accusations that she impeded the arrest of a man that ICE followed to her courtroom. 
Evers said the threats should concern everyone.
“In this country, the federal government doesn’t get to abuse its power to threaten everyday Americans. In this country, the federal government doesn’t get to arrest American citizens who have not committed a crime. In this country, we don’t threaten to persecute people just because they belong to a different political party,” Evers said. 
“These threats represent a concerning trajectory in this country. We now have a federal government that will threaten or arrest an elected official — or even everyday American citizens — who have broken no laws, committed no crimes, and done nothing wrong,” Evers said. “As disgusted as I am about the continued actions of the Trump Administration, I am not afraid. I have never once been discouraged from doing the right thing, and I will not start today.”

The vaccine is 97% effective against measles when two doses are administered (George Frey/Getty Images).Amber Schmidtke, a microbiologist, remembers feeling a tinge of relief five years ago as COVID spread across communities.

At least it wasn’t measles.
“Measles is the most contagious disease we have,” said Schmidtke, who teaches at Kansas City University.
But now, she and other public health experts are watching with alarm as the largely preventable virus marches toward Kansas City in the nation’s largest outbreak since 2019.
So far this year, health officials have confirmed 884 cases across the country, including 46 in southwest Kansas. One Missouri case reported on April 18 involved a child visiting the Branson area.
Marvia Jones, director of the Kansas City Health Department, said her agency will be as prepared as possible when cases reach the metro. But there’s little doubt about whether they will come.
“It’s clear to us that measles is just a car ride away from Kansas Citians,” Jones said at an April 29 press conference that was called to urge people to get vaccinated before the virus gets here.
But rising vaccine skepticism, falling immunization rates and recent major cuts to federal public health funding are all working against efforts to quickly end the current measles outbreak, health officials said.
“This makes me heartsick,” said Lynelle Phillips, president of the Missouri Immunization Coalition. “I think more children will be struck down and killed by a completely preventable outbreak of measles. And I think the question to us as Americans is how many of these children will have to die before we realize the mistake we’ve made?”
Three deaths have been attributed to the outbreak so far, including two children in Texas and an adult in New Mexico.
 Declining immunization rates

Unlike the start of COVID when there was no vaccine, a highly effective measles vaccine is widely available. Until recently it was also widely adopted.
By 2000, 37 years after the measles vaccine was introduced, United States health officials could declare measles eliminated because there hadn’t been continuous spread for more than a year.
Now, that designation is in danger as measles cases spread. So far, the outbreak has reached 30 states. The largest cluster is in Texas, where 663 cases have been confirmed since late January.
The rise in measles infections, health leaders said, can be directly linked to low vaccination rates.
Herd immunity for measles, when the virus is unlikely to spread, requires a vaccination rate of 95%. But communities and schools are increasingly slipping below that mark. And where that happens, an outbreak becomes much more likely.
In Kansas City, three ZIP codes fall below the 95% threshold, city health officials said.

64114 in the Waldo area has an immunization rate of 93%.
64151, where Lake Waukomis is located north of the river, is at 92%.
And 64155, where the upscale Staley Farms development is located, has a vaccination rate of only 84%.

Jones said these undervaccinated ZIP codes will get special attention as the city works to convince more people to let their kids get vaccines. The health department plans to hold community meetings in these areas in hopes of answering questions and easing hesitancy.
“We are doing all we can to add outreach and have real conversations,” Jones said.
The health department also will extend the hours it offers vaccinations. Beginning May 14, vaccines will be available at 2400 Troost Ave. until 7 p.m., and Saturday hours will begin May 17. For an appointment, people can call 311, but appointments are not required.
 Growing vaccine skepticism

Parents, faced with an internet awash in inaccurate information about vaccinations in general and the measles vaccine specifically, are more often skipping routine childhood immunizations.
Two doses of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine are recommended for children. The first dose is recommended at about 1 year old, and a second dose when a child starts school, between 4 and 6 years old.
During the 2023-24 school year, immunization rates for kindergartners fell to 92.7% nationwide, from 95.2% during the 2019-20 school year. In Missouri, the rate went from 94.6% in 2019-20 to 90.4% in 2023-24. In those same years, Kansas’ rate climbed slightly, from 90% to 90.4%.
Six metro counties showed MMR vaccination rates below 95% for kindergartners in the 2023-24 school year.
Schools require children to have the MMR and other vaccinations in order to attend kindergarten, but states allow exemptions for religious or medical reasons. And those exemptions have been on the rise.
The Staley Farms ZIP code’s religious exemption rate doubled to 14% last year from 7% in 2019, city officials said. According to state records, private schools in Clay County, where the ZIP code is located, had a religious exemption rate of 13.4% in 2023, compared with 5.4% in 2019.
In Kansas, the statewide exemption rate was just over 1% in the 2010-11 school year. But by the 2023-24 year, it was up to almost 3%. And Missouri’s statewide rate is getting close to 5%, said Dr. George Turabelidze, Missouri’s state epidemiologist.
Phillips said the increase can also be traced to a change in Missouri law that took effect at the beginning of 2024, lowering barriers for parents to get vaccine exemptions for their children. It’s now as simple as filling out a form online and submitting it to the school.
“Prior to that, you would have to make an appointment at the health department and meet with a public health nurse,” Phillips said.
Parents who oppose vaccines objected to the state’s previous exemption requirements, saying they violated their speech and religious rights.
But Phillips said the added step of going to the health department gave parents an opportunity to learn about the health consequences of choosing to forgo their child’s vaccinations. And they also found out that children who are unvaccinated have to miss weeks of school if they are exposed — even if they don’t get sick.
Public health officials understand that a growing number of people are afraid of having their kids vaccinated. In part, they blame strong anti-vaccination views that took root during the COVID pandemic related to the vaccines developed to treat that virus.
“That (skepticism) spills over to other vaccines as well,” Turabelidze said.
In addition to fueling anti-vaccine views, the pandemic also led to more distrust of public health agencies, which became the face of shuttered schools and businesses and other restrictions that some people abhorred. That distrust has made it even harder to get accurate information to people who may be worried about unfounded claims about vaccines that flourish on the internet.
One of the most persistent myths — that the MMR vaccine is linked to autism — has been especially common, Turabelidze said.
“It’s been debunked so many times, I can’t even count,” he said. “But people keep repeating this myth.”
Now, many fear that the vaccine doubts have been given more credibility with the appointment of vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as the U.S. secretary of Health and Human Services.
 Highly contagious

As Missouri’s immunization rates have slipped, Turabelidze said the state Department of Health and Senior Services has been working to increase outreach and education efforts, especially to schools or communities with lower vaccination rates.
Those communities are sitting ducks for such a highly contagious virus, health experts said.
Nine out of 10 unvaccinated people exposed to measles will get sick. And the virus can infect people who don’t even come into contact with someone who has it. Measles spreads when people talk, cough or sneeze, but can linger in the air for three hours.
“If I had a person in my class that had measles and didn’t know it and they left, everyone who enters that classroom for the next several hours could get it,” Phillips said. “It’s really difficult to manage transmission when you realize just how infectious measles is.”
And the measles virus can be dangerous. One in five people who get the virus end up in the hospital, Dr. Susanne Luedtke, an infectious disease specialist at University Health, told reporters during the April 29 press conference hosted by the Kansas City Health Department.
One in 20 children contract pneumonia with measles. The disease can cause brain swelling and serious long-term side effects like seizures, hearing loss and a condition called immune amnesia, which can destroy a child’s immune response. And between one and three of every 1,000 children who get measles will die.
“Measles is not a rash and a fever,” Luedtke said. “It’s a serious disease with real risks.”
Before the measles vaccine came along in 1963, almost everyone came down with measles before they turned 15. The telltale rash would begin at the hairline and move down the torso and out to the extremities. A high fever developed, along with symptoms like a runny nose and cough.
Of course, most people recovered as they would from the flu or another viral infection. But before the vaccine, every year an estimated 400 to 500 people died, 48,000 were hospitalized and 1,000 developed encephalitis or brain swelling.
“This is not a disease you joke around with,” Turabelidze said. “It’s highly contagious. And it can put you in the hospital. We already have three persons dead in this country. And you can also have long-term consequences.”
The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services operates a 24-hour helpline that doctors can call if they run into a potential case of measles. Turabelidze said calls have increased as doctors, many of whom have never run into a case of measles before, grow increasingly wary of unidentifiable rashes.
“More often it’s not really measles,” he said. “But we would rather have a consultation” than an undetected case.
The state also has added capacity for the state laboratory to conduct PCR tests for measles. That service, which began in March, will reduce the time test results take, which could make a big difference in quelling an outbreak.
“We wanted to have a very, very quick response time because measles is so highly contagious,” Turabelidze said.
 Importance of education

When measles is detected, public health agencies play a crucial role in quickly locating anyone an infected person has been around. They also track down people who have shared an inside space where the infected person could have left behind the virus.
Public health is critical in managing an outbreak. But for the system to work, experts said, the public needs to trust public health. And public health agencies need to be available to answer questions to assuage concerns, provide information to doctors and patients and offer easy access to the vaccine.
“Vaccines in the refrigerator never yet prevented a single case of infection,” said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of infectious disease at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. “They have to be administered… This takes human beings and it takes time.”
It also takes money. But recent federal funding cuts by the Trump administration have slashed support for public health outreach efforts.
On March 24, the Missouri Immunization Coalition, Phillips’ organization, lost all of its funding from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). That money funded the group’s entire budget, which means it is now “on life support,” Phillips said.
And like other public health organizations that had relied on those funds, the work the coalition had been doing — educating people about vaccines, providing transportation and other resources to improve access — is hanging by a thread.
“Vaccination rates are not going to raise themselves,” Phillips said. “The organizations involved with all of the education and logistics and support … have been dismantled. At a time when we’re witnessing a resurgence in measles, these are the ingredients of a perfect storm.”
Missouri’s Department of Health and Senior Services lost a combined $255 million in the March 24 CDC cuts. That included $135 million in projects currently underway to support the state’s public health system and about $119 million for projects that hadn’t been determined.
Turabelidze said it is unclear how the cuts will affect the state’s vaccine efforts.
The Kansas City Health Department has seen federal cuts so far of about $3 million, money that was allocated to pay for adult vaccinations and outreach, enhanced laboratory capacity and community health workers.
On April 25, the city announced it had joined a coalition of other local governments and a labor union representing government workers in a lawsuit challenging the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services funding cuts.
In a statement announcing the lawsuit, Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas said, “It’s important that we as cities and people stand up for common sense and public health in the courts.”
It’s also worth remembering, Schmidtke said, that eliminating outreach programs may save money in the short term. But if measles cases increase as a result, the ultimate cost will be much more. While each MMR vaccine dose costs around $2, she said, managing a case of someone who contracts measles can cost $50,000.
“I know money isn’t everything,” Schmidtke said. “But when we don’t have enough money to get the outreach, to educate the public about the importance of vaccination, to educate them about where to find it, we run the risk of really expensive outbreaks that are hard to control.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)More new apartments were built in 2024 than in any other year since 1974, but the Trump administration’s tariffs and deportations of potential construction workers, plus higher interest rates, could be a wet blanket on the boom.
A U.S. Census Bureau survey found almost 592,000 new apartments were finished last year, the most since the 1970s, when baby boomers sparked a construction surge as they moved out of their childhood homes. There were 693,000 new apartments built in 1974, when the country had about half as many households.

But there has been a steep slowdown in construction starts, as the newly completed apartments come online. The increased supply has lowered rents and increased vacancy rates, making new development less profitable. Some experts also say tariffs on construction materials and labor shortages caused by dips in immigration will create headwinds for new construction.
Apartment starts were down 27% in 2024 compared with 2023, and down 37% from a recent peak of 531,000 in 2022, despite the historic rate of completions. Apartment starts were at their lowest ebb since 2013.

Housing experts have long lamented that there aren’t enough apartments and single-family houses in the U.S. — at least not in places where people want to live and at prices they can afford. Estimates of the national housing shortage last year varied widely, from 1.5 million houses and apartments to 20.1 million; since then, another 1.6 million houses and apartments have been built. Most experts estimate a shortage of 1.5 million to 5.5 million, according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University.
Some states are building apartments faster than others, according to a Stateline analysis. Though completions aren’t tracked by state, permits that lead to new apartments have been granted at high rates in recent years in South Dakota, Utah, Arizona and Colorado. Rates are lowest in Mississippi, Wyoming, West Virginia, Rhode Island, Oklahoma and Alaska.
The massive jump in apartment construction has its roots in 2021 and 2022, when interest rates were low and rent growth was high, said Rob Warnock, senior research associate for Apartment List, a company that posts rental listings online.
Fast-building states get more babies

“Those new apartments came online in 2023 and 2024, and while those deliveries are slowing down today, there are still many apartments in the pipeline,” said Warnock, who added that “supply and demand are coming back into balance.”
In response to greater supply, rents have fallen by about $50 per month (3.5%) from their 2022 peak, according to a report released this week by Apartment List. Apartment vacancy is at a 15-year high of 6.3%, keeping a lid on rents, but that could turn around as construction slows, according to an April report by Moody’s, a financial services company.
Apartment building has been a bipartisan priority as single-family home prices soar further out of the affordability range for young families. In South Dakota, the Republican-controlled legislature worked to prolong the building boom with grants and loans under the state’s Housing Infrastructure Financing Program. The program put $200 million of state and federal funding toward defraying the costs of development in new neighborhoods, such as roads, sewer lines and streetlights.
Republican state Sen. Casey Crabtree, sponsor of the proposal signed into law in 2023, told Stateline it was needed to address a housing shortage, especially in rural parts of the state.
“We have a drastic shortage of workers,” Crabtree said before a vote in 2023. “South Dakota businesses need more workers in our state. To get more workers, we need more housing.”
Apartment construction cools rents in some regions

Armand Domalewski, co-founder of YIMBY Democrats for America, said overregulation is a barrier to housing construction in many areas that his party controls.
“A lot of blue-government areas and cities have extremely restrictive zoning, impact fees and other rules that make it very difficult to build housing,” said Domalewski. Another barrier is local opposition, he said.
“If it was just a free market, developers would want to build in the places like California, where prices are the highest and rents are the highest, because they’d make more money,” he added.
In California, the 2021 HOME Act was meant to spur more affordable housing and ease labor shortages, but it’s faced local opposition in some areas. At the end of last year, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed several measures that aim to streamline regulations and crack down on local resistance to the 2021 law.
South Dakota approved nearly 6,000 permits for apartment units in 2023 and 2024, which when completed would add about 1.4% to its 2023 total of 417,000 housing units. That’s the highest rate in the nation. By contrast, Mississippi during that same period approved about 660 apartment units — a fraction of 1 percentage point to its 2023 base of about 1.4 million housing units.

– Armand Domalewski, co-founder of YIMBY Democrats for America


Chas Olson, executive director of the South Dakota Housing Development Authority, said the full impact of the state infrastructure funding isn’t apparent yet, as many developments that received the help are still under construction.
Completions are still strong this year with about 39,000 apartments finished in March, not much different from the 41,500 in March 2024, which was the biggest March number since 1985.
Another impediment to apartment construction has been high interest rates, which make it harder to borrow money to build, said Danushka Nanayakkara-Skillington, an assistant vice president for forecasting and analysis at the National Association of Home Builders.
She expects apartment building starts to slow until later this year.
“We are going to be short of workers for a long time. That’s the way it is. And of course tariffs are going to have an impact,” Nanayakkara-Skillington said.

(Photo courtesy USAO)Earlier this week, the United States Attorney’s Office in New Mexico announced that 82 people have already been hit with the novel misdemeanor charges for “unauthorized entry into the New Mexico National Defense Areas,” a crime punishable by up to one year in prison. 
That charge follows the United States Interior Department land transfer along New Mexico’s southern border to the U.S. Army, allowing federal troops to now detain and transfer individuals to federal law enforcement for criminal charges. Interior officials said the land transfer was intended to “safeguard sensitive natural and cultural resources,” and also crack down on illegal border crossings.
In touting the new measures, Defense Department officials have said the change simply amounts to converting the “Roosevelt Reservation,” which they describe in a news release as a 60-foot buffer zone along the borders Mexico shares with New Mexico, Arizona and California, into what is basically an extension of the U.S. Army Garrison Fort Huachaca in Cochise County, Arizona.

However, U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich’s office contended in an email Friday to Source New Mexico that the DoD description mischaracterizes the actual size of the area.
Heinrich spokesperson Caty Payette cited the Public Land Order that lists all the new parcels that are affected, along with a map showing a swath of southern New Mexico under the newly created “Emergency Withdrawal Area.” 
“It’s much further than just the 60-foot Roosevelt Reservation and has huge implications for anyone unwittingly driving along Highway 9 who might pull over to stretch their legs and unwittingly trespass on a military base,” Payette said in an email. 
According to a Source New Mexico analysis, the area in the “Emergency Withdrawal Area” is 406 square miles, an area more than twice the size of Albuquerque. 
“We think it’s an important technicality that speaks to the seismic impact of the administration’s action,” Payette said.

,DC,2025-05-02 18:24:48+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump budget puts clean-energy spending in crosshairs,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-budget-puts-clean-energy-spending-crosshairs,,"President Donald Trump’s budget request for the next fiscal year proposes deep cuts to renewable energy programs and other climate spending as the administration seeks to shift U.S. energy production to encourage more fossil fuels and push the focus away from reducing climate change.The budget proposes slashing $21 billion in unspent funds from the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law for renewable energy, electric vehicle charging infrastructure and other efforts to cut climate-warming carbon dioxide emissions. The request also targets climate research spending and initiatives meant to promote diversity.“President Trump is committed to eliminating funding for the globalist climate agenda while unleashing American energy production,” a White House fact sheet on climate and environment spending said. The budget “eliminates funding for the Green New Scam.”The president’s budget request is a wish list for Congress, which controls federal spending, to consider. Even with both chambers of Congress controlled by Republicans who have shown an unusual willingness to follow Trump’s lead on a host of policies, it is best understood as a starting point for negotiations between the branches of government and a representation of the administration’s priorities.A White House official speaking on background Friday, though, said the Trump administration is exploring ways to exert more control over the federal spending process, including by potentially refusing to spend funds appropriated by lawmakers.The first budget request of Trump’s second term calls on Congress to cut non-defense accounts by $163 billion to $557 billion, while keeping defense funding flat at $893 billion.‘Political talking points’The proposal drew criticism for a focus on culture-war buzzwords, even from groups that are not always inclined to support environment and climate spending.The request “is long on rhetoric and short on details,” Steve Ellis, president of the nonpartisan budget watchdog Taxpayers for Common Sense, said in a statement.“This year’s version leans heavily on political talking points—taking aim at so-called ‘woke’ programs and the ‘Green New Scam,’ while proposing a massive Pentagon spending hike to pay for wasteful fantasies like the Golden Dome and diverting military resources to immigration enforcement missions.”Renewable energyThe administration proposal would roll back funding Trump’s predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden, championed for renewable energy.It would cancel more than $15 billion from the 2021 infrastructure law “purposed for unreliable renewable energy, removing carbon dioxide from the air, and other costly technologies that burden ratepayers and consumers,” according to the White House fact sheet.It would also eliminate $6 billion for building electric vehicle charging infrastructure.“EV chargers should be built just like gas stations: with private sector resources disciplined by market forces,” the fact sheet said.And it would decrease spending on the Energy Department’s Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy program, which helps private-sector projects secure financing and conducts research on low-carbon energy sources, by $2.5 billion.In a statement, Rep. Marcy Kaptur, the ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations subcommittee that writes the bill funding energy programs, slammed the cuts to renewable energy programs, saying they would cost consumers and hurt a growing domestic industry.""The Trump Administration’s proposal to slash $20 Billion from the Department of Energy’s programs — particularly a devastating 74% cut to Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy — is shortsighted and dangerous,” the longtime Ohio lawmaker said. “By gutting clean energy investments, this budget threatens to raise energy prices for consumers, increase our reliance on foreign energy, and stifle American competitiveness. … We must defend the programs that power America's future — cleaner, cheaper, and made right here at home.”DiversityThroughout the request, the administration targets programs out of line with Trump’s ideology on social issues, including those meant to promote diversity.For energy and environment programs, that includes spending on environmental justice initiatives, which target pollution and climate effects in majority-minority and low-income communities, and organizations “that advance the radical climate agenda,” according to the fact sheet.Research and grant funding for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration would be particularly hard hit by the proposal, which would terminate “a variety of climate-dominated research programs that are not aligned with Administration policy of ending ‘Green New Deal’ initiatives, saving taxpayers $1.3 billion.”The budget also proposes eliminating $100 million from a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency fund dedicated to environmental justice. That funding “enabled a witch hunt against private industry” and “gave taxpayer dollars to political cronies who exploited the program’s racial preferencing policies to advance an anti-oil and gas crusade,” according to the White House.National Park Service targetedThe budget also proposes cutting $900 million from National Park Service operations, which the administration said would come from defunding smaller sites while “supporting many national treasures.”The document indicates the administration would prefer to leave responsibility for smaller sites currently under NPS management to states and refocus the federal government on the major parks that attract nationwide and international tourists.“There is an urgent need to streamline staffing and transfer certain properties to State-level management to ensure the long-term health and sustainment of the National Park system,” according to a budget spreadsheet highlighting major line items in the request.Despite laws in recent years to boost spending for maintenance at parks, the National Park Service faces a $23.3 billion deferred maintenance backlog, according to a July 2024 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.The proposed NPS cut represents the largest single funding change – either positive or negative – of any line item under the Department of Interior, which would receive a funding decrease of more than $5 billion, about 30%, under the proposal.Jennifer Shutt contributed to this report.",,,,2025-05-02 15:12:12.501265

Ruggerio reported more than $148,000 cash on hand in his campaign account as of March 31. (Photo by Nikki Silva/Rhode Island Current)In his final months as Rhode Island Senate president, the late Dominick Ruggerio continued to rake in campaign donations, according to the first-quarter report filed with the Rhode Island Board of Elections Wednesday.
Ruggerio died on April 21. But his campaign finance account, and its $148,000 balance, lives on, with state law laying out a host of options for how the remains of his war chest can be spent. The balance — aside from any loans or debt that needs to be repaid — can be used to support other candidates, political parties and political action committees, donated to charity, or the money can be returned to the donor.
There’s no deadline by which a deceased officeholder or candidate’s campaign account must be closed, as long as there’s still a treasurer willing to administer the funds and file quarterly reports with the state elections board. 
Jim Aceto, Ruggerio’s brother-in-law, who was named as his campaign finance treasurer in 2008, said the family had not decided what to do with Ruggerio’s campaign funds.
“We’re not even thinking about that,” Aceto said in an interview Thursday.
Only one other campaign finance account remains open and active for a deceased officeholder or candidate, said Ric Thornton, the state elections board campaign finance director. 
Former Warwick Mayor Joe Solomon died in May 2021, but his son, Rep. Joe Solomon Jr., has maintained the account as its designated treasurer since his dad’s death. The older Solomon has over $67,000 cash on hand in his account, though no new donations have been made since his death. The campaign has spent money one time since May 2021, making a $500 donation in September 2024 to St. George Maronite Catholic Church in Cranston for a memorial, according to the report filed with the state elections board.
Solomon Jr., a Warwick Democrat first elected in 2014, did not return multiple calls for comment.
A third account for a deceased officeholder, former Cranston City Council President John E. Lanni Jr., remains open but inactive. After deducting bank fees, the remaining $1,200 balance was transferred to the state’s unclaimed property account, overseen by the Office of the General Treasurer, following Lanni’s death in 2020, Thornton said. Lois Lanni, John Lanni’s wife and the treasurer for his campaign account, died in 2019.
Prior to his death, Ruggerio missed most of the 2025 legislative session due to illness, including two stays at Our Lady of Fatima Hospital in his North Providence district. But the 76-year-old Democrat, reelected to the Senate for the 40th time in November, nonetheless received a strong show of financial support from fellow officeholders, labor and business leaders.
Ruggerio reported nearly $93,000 in donations in the first three months of 2025, including $64,000 from individual donors and nearly $29,000 from political action committees. His financial supporters included local auto body shop owners, Bally’s Corp. lobbyists, and two of his predecessors: former Senate Presidents Billy Irons and Teresa Paiva-Weed, who donated $300 and $250, respectively. Gov. Dan McKee gave $1,000 to Ruggerio, while McKee’s 2022 Republican rival, Ashley Kalus, donated $150.
Ruggerio spent more than $65,400 from his campaign account in the first three months of the year, including more than $31,000 at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Warwick on Feb. 5 for a political fundraiser. 
Ruggerio also contributed to many fellow lawmakers. He gave $1,000 to Sen. Val Lawson, the East Providence Democrat who was his majority leader, and elected Tuesday to succeed Ruggerio as president. Ruggerio also gave $500 to Sen. Frank Ciccone, a Providence Democrat tapped as the new majority leader. Senate Minority Leader Jessica de la Cruz, a North Smithfield Republican who voted for herself in the leadership election among state senators Tuesday, received a $100 donation from Ruggerio’s campaign.

(Courtesy of City of Minneapolis)The number of measles cases is approaching 1,000 across 29 states, according to newly released federal statistics. Even as the outbreaks grow, more local governments are complaining that their efforts to combat measles with vaccination clinics have been shut down by abrupt federal funding cuts.
As of May 1, a total of 935 confirmed cases had been reported, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They were in Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.
There have been three confirmed deaths, two children in Texas and one adult in New Mexico, all unvaccinated.
Some measles response plans crash to a halt after Trump cuts

Metro Nashville, the combined county and city government in Tennessee, and three other local governments sued on April 24 over reductions in federal public health funding, saying the abrupt $11 billion in cuts nationwide forced Nashville to cancel vaccination clinics needed to combat this year’s measles outbreak. Colorado and a group of other states sued earlier in April, mentioning the impact of cuts on their ability to control measles, flu and other vaccine-preventable illnesses.
Others joining the April 24 lawsuit: Harris County, Texas, where Houston is located; Columbus, Ohio; Kansas City, Missouri; and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees union. They called the cuts “a massive blow… at a time where state and local public health departments need to address burgeoning infectious diseases and chronic illnesses, like the measles, bird flu, and mpox.”
The funding cuts also forced Minneapolis to shut down clinics in March that had been scheduled to run through June, said Luisa Pessoa-Brandão, director of health initiatives for the city’s health department.
Last year the city’s clinics served 501 patients with 1,475 vaccination shots, including against measles, she said. About 30% of children in the city are not fully vaccinated, much too high to ensure unvaccinated children won’t fall victim to measles outbreaks like the current one, she added.
“There’s fear and hesitancy about the vaccine, based on some of the misinformation out there,” Pessoa-Brandão said. “There are other factors — access [to medical care] and the COVID pandemic, which delayed people getting vaccinations. We’re playing catch-up the last few years.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-02 18:13:45+00:00,CT Mirror,"Minority contractors say CT not following its own rules, proposed fix doesn’t go far enough",Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/02/ct-minority-contractors-set-aside/,CT requires 25% of state contracts be set aside for small and minority-owned businesses. Study showed it's falling short.,"For decades, minority-owned businesses in Connecticut have struggled to win contracts to do work for the state — despite a nearly 50-year-old program requiring that a certain percentage of state contracting funds be awarded to businesses owned by people of color, women, veterans or people with disabilities.
In 2021, in response to concerns about underrepresentation of minority businesses and the alleged presence of “front businesses” taking advantage of the system, the legislature commissioned a study examining whether state contracts were being awarded fairly.
Last December, the results of that study were published — and they largely validated the concerns minority contractors have raised for years.
But business owners say lawmakers have thus far failed to take meaningful action in response to the findings. 
According to the report, conducted by consultancy Griffin & Strong, about 14% of all construction firms in Connecticut are owned by Black individuals. But between 2017 and 2021, these firms received only 0.57% of state contracts valued at less than $1 million. Of the $544 million spent on these contracts in total, $91 million went to firms owned by women and minorities — or roughly 17%.
The law requires that the state reserve, or “set aside,” 25% of its contracts for small businesses and minority-owned businesses.

Colin Dawkins, the president of the Greater Hartford African American Alliance and owner of MCM Acoustics in Hartford, said the study didn’t capture the full scale of the challenge minority contractors face, since it only examined school construction projects, without factoring in work at UConn and the state’s public colleges and universities — or any of the quasi-public state agencies. 
Aside from the state not meeting its mandate on contracts, minority subcontractors describe barriers across all aspects of the business: from seeking a line of credit from banks, to paying higher prices for materials and experiencing poor treatment by lead contractors on projects, including delayed payments.
“I just think that if it doesn’t get fixed now, we might have to wait until another 15 years for them to do another disparity study in order to fix what needs to be done,” said Dawkins. 
In the wake of the Griffin & Strong report, lawmakers drafted legislation this year that was intended to ease some of the barriers faced by business owners. 
The bill removes the 25% set-aside requirement, and instead assigns the state’s Commission of Human Rights and Opportunities to annually “establish goals for including small contractors and [minority business enterprises] on all public works contracts to attain parity with the availability of contractors required for the specific contract according to their industry and the relevant geographic area,” according to a nonpartisan analysis of the bill. CHRO would also be given a greater ability to penalize lead contractors who do not treat minority subcontractors fairly.
CHRO, which currently oversees the set-aside program and played a large role in drafting the legislation, said it’s meant to give the agency a greater ability to hold large contractors accountable for their treatment of minority subcontractors.
“This bill represents an important opportunity for Connecticut to address continuing disparities within state contracting while improving a program that aims to keep state contracting dollars within the state and giving all businesses, including small contractors and [minority and woman-owned business enterprises], an equal chance to compete for those dollars,” Tanya Hughes, executive director of the CHRO, wrote in testimony.
But owners of minority construction businesses who spoke with the Connecticut Mirror said the legislation won’t address the real barriers that keep small contractors like them locked out of state projects. 
“ It’s clear that the author and the architect [of the bill] have little understanding of the plight that minority businesses are facing contracting. They’re the ones who are supposed to know what we’re facing,” Bernard Thomas, the owner of Global Construction Services LLC and Vice President of the Minority Construction Council, said. “If not, ask. Don’t write up [a bill] and assume that … what you’re writing is good enough for the minority contractors.” 
Gwen Samuel, former owner of Samuel General Contracting, said it didn’t make sense for CHRO to continue to oversee the set-aside program when it was under that agency’s watch that the disparities found in the study were allowed to propagate. 
“ My concern with this whole [bill], it still doesn’t hold Connecticut accountable to fair practices,” Samuel said. 
An ‘aspirational’ program
In 1976, the state created a voluntary set-aside program for small businesses. A senator who spoke during a debate at the state Capitol at the time said the program was designed to keep a few large contractors from overtaking all the state contracts. The next year, the legislature made the program mandatory, and in 1982 it expanded the program to include mandatory set-asides for minority-owned businesses. 
Lawmakers in office at the time the minority-owned set-asides were created said they were intended to help minority businesses during a difficult economic period and create jobs in communities with high unemployment. At the time, a representative of the CHRO also noted that only a small number of minority-owned businesses were accessing state contracts. 
Subsequent changes to the law expanded the program to cover all state agencies and quasi-public agencies and increased the percentage of contracts that needed to be reserved for small and minority businesses. 
The current set-aside program requires that the state reserve 25% of its contracts for small businesses and minority-owned businesses. A quarter of that — 6.25% of contracts overall — must be granted to businesses owned by people of color, women, veterans or people with disabilities.  
In testimony to lawmakers in 2021, when the legislature was considering a disparity study, Hughes of CHRO pointed out that the last time the state studied the program was 1992. “The diversity and economy of Connecticut has changed substantially in almost 30 years,” she wrote, adding that a more “accurate picture” of the challenges facing minority contractors, “ensure equity and equality in state contracting by affirmatively addressing underutilization.”
Ultimately, last year’s Griffin & Strong disparity study characterized the program as “aspirational” rather than setting solid requirements for contracting, and it concluded that the state has failed to meet those goals in multiple categories of contracting for nearly every minority. 
A range of problems to solve
This year’s proposed law, which advanced out of the legislature’s Government Administration and Elections Committee in late March, incorporates a recommendation from the disparity study to shift from having overarching set-aside goals to having the CHRO decide on a project-by-project basis what percentage of the work should be reserved for minority businesses. 
Attorney Spencer Hill for the CHRO told CT Mirror that this was to ensure that what they were doing was legal, since the state constitution only allows race to be used narrowly as a criteria in government programs.
“You want to be very narrowly tailored and have a focused approach,  to ensure that you’re being as effective as possible and not being overly broad and relying on race in any way that’s inappropriate,” Hill said.
Still, contractors said there were other problems with the set-aside program that the legislation failed to address. 
For one, Colin Dawkins said, he believes the definition of “small” business is too large. Under federal guidelines, a masonry, framing, poured concrete or roofing contractor can make up to $19 million annually and still be considered a small business. 
Furthermore, the study referenced concerns from state staffers about “fronts” — situations where firms owned by men were registered in a woman’s name to make the business appear to be female-owned. According to the study, about one-third of business owners Griffin & Strong surveyed were under the impression that non-minority or woman-owned companies were misrepresenting themselves in order to circumvent certification requirements. 
Data from the disparity study shows that in construction, Black-owned businesses earned only 0.3% of the total amount of money the state paid out directly to contractors between 2017 and 2021. Non-minority woman-owned businesses earned 7.22% of the money during the same time period. 
Leigh Appleby, spokesperson for the state’s Department of Administrative Services — which administers state contracts — said in an email to CT Mirror that while the department has heard anecdotes about this for years, it “employs a rigorous review to prevent such things from happening.” He said DAS conducts random site visits, and that falsely placing a male-owned business under a woman’s name can be punished by fines or disqualification.
“DAS procurement has never disqualified a business based solely on a false representation of minority ownership,” Appleby said in a follow-up email. “In some cases, it has been determined that the certification as a small business is justified, while the certification as a minority-owned business is not.”
One woman quoted in the study, a construction firm owner, also said the state had begun to crack down on those “fronts” by interviewing companies to confirm ownership. 
Along with changing the set-aside program, CHRO attorney Hill said, the bill was also designed to increase the CHRO’s ability to oversee construction projects in real time and penalize contractors who do not follow through on efforts to engage minority businesses. 
Hill said the agency typically receives “a handful” of complaints each year from minority contractors. Most come from contractors who say they believed they were selected by a lead contractor to be part of a project solely in order to meet state requirements for minority contracting, and were later dropped from the project. 
“Small and minority contractors deserve the chance to compete in a level, fair marketplace.”Bernard Thomas, Global Construction Services LLC
He said that new reporting requirements outlined in the bill would allow the commission to catch any problems in the contracting process early on, rather than in a review period at the end of the project. 
Additionally, the commission would withhold 2% of the contract cost until their review was completed. 
But Bernard Thomas of Global Construction Services said in testimony to the legislature that the bill did not address inequities in the state’s contracting procedures “by any stretch of the imagination.” 
Thomas said he believed there was no way to hold towns or state agencies accountable when they fail to bid the project properly, and he said a $10,000 fine for violations of the law was “laughably low,” especially for out-of-state companies or contractors who only do business with the state on occasion. 
“Small and minority contractors deserve the chance to compete in a level, fair marketplace,” he wrote. 
Several state agencies also raised concerns about the bill’s intent to set project-by-project goals, saying they felt it would delay projects. 
Office of Policy and Management Secretary Jeff Beckham said the state needed better data collection in order to comply with the bill’s requirements, and DAS Commissioner Michelle Gilman questioned what would happen if available contractors did not bid on the contracts. Gilman also noted that requiring CHRO to set goals for each project without a clear timeline could stall projects. 
Hill said he believed that the new requirements would not cause the delays that the state agencies feared. “We hear their concerns about efficiency. We don’t want to be holding anything up. But I don’t think that the processes are as labor intensive as they’re kind of painting it as,” he said. 
Even if there are some delays, he said, making sure tax dollars are properly spent is critical.
“It would be very efficient to not have oversight and just give out tax dollars without anyone scrutinizing where they’re going or why. But as the state of Connecticut is saying, we need to be better than that,” Hill said. “If there is oversight that needs to happen, we’re not going to sacrifice that just for the sake of business expediency.”
‘Bigger, better breaks‘
Minority contractors say they operate within a system that favors larger, established firms over theirs. That disadvantage is present in every step of the process, from bidding to purchasing materials, they say.
Michele Clark Jenkins, Director of Research and Methodology for Griffin & Strong, told attendees at an informational session that more than half the firms they spoke with for the disparity study described an “informal network” that they said was “monopolizing public contracting with the state.” 
Clark Jenkins also made recommendations around CHRO’s accommodations of lead contractors’ “good faith efforts” — a concept that minority subcontractors have criticized. Under current policy, lead contractors who have made “good faith efforts” to reach out to minority businesses can be exempt from the set-aside requirements. But Clark Jenkins said their research showed that contracts were being awarded whether or not that “good faith effort” was made. 
CHRO Executive Director Hughes said in an email that the new bill would improve the agency’s ability to assess good faith efforts from the start of a project. 
In response to comments about an “informal” or “old boys” network, Appleby said DAS “follows all statutory guidelines concerning procurement,” limits how many contracts one business can have at a time, and has “worked to expand the breadth of our outreach when advertising to reach a wide swath of potential bidders.”
There are other roadblocks within state requirements, business owners told CT Mirror.
State rules require that contractors provide 10% of the total amount of the bid for any project over $50,000 up front. This is known as a “bid bond,” which acts as a kind of security deposit proving that the contractor will complete the project. 
Dawkins said many minority contractors aren’t able to access bid bonds at a level that would allow them to compete for multiple large contracts at once. They don’t have a large amount of assets, and any hits they take on credit can detract from their ability to get a bond. 
Both Dawkins and Rollo Jones, the owner of Capitol Masonry LLC in Hartford, said getting a bank or insurer to sign off on a bond was about relationships. Larger construction companies, they said, have established credit lines they can draw on. 
In addition, minority companies often pay more for materials like sheetrock and drywall. Larger firms are able to purchase in bulk, Dawkins said, meaning they often get a better per-unit price. 
“The big guys, they get bigger, better breaks. They get better deals, they get better contracts,” Rollo Jones told lawmakers. 
With higher material costs, minority business owners say they can’t always complete a project at a low price comparable to what larger firms can offer. 
Dawkins suggested the state could eliminate the requirement for bonding for minority contractors for any bids of $500,000 or less. This way, he said, smaller businesses that couldn’t afford a bid bond would have a chance at getting a contract. 
But Appleby said bonding protects taxpayer money if a contractor fails to complete their contract, and that it also protects workers and subcontractors if the contractor who hired them ends up unable to pay them for labor or materials. He said having a bond provides evidence that a contractor is financially stable.  
Another problem businesses cited was the sometimes lengthy periods they wait to get paid for their work. Although the state requires minority contractors to be paid within 25 days, about 45% of the contractors surveyed in Griffin & Strong’s disparity study said it took at least a month and a half to receive payments from the state. 
For about 10%, it took three months or longer. 
‘A domino effect’
Rollo Jones and his wife Rochelle say they’ve experienced many challenges with their business, Capitol Masonry, in the 30 years it’s been operating.
In one case, the company was contracting in Hartford for a project with the state Department of Transportation. Rochelle said they completed the job in September 2023 but didn’t receive their last check until December 2024. 
“I’ve never seen anyone who worked so hard to do a job and yet does not get paid on time,” Rochelle said of Rollo. “We have a contract we write up, [it’s] supposed to be recognized, but it’s never recognized.”
Department of Transportation Communications Director John Morgan told CT Mirror in an email that the department “has frequent communication and dialogue with Prime Contractors” about payments, and that the department is rolling out a new system that will monitor payments and give subcontractors more access to the department. 
Morgan said the primary contractors who receive payment directly from the department can delay payments to subcontractors “based on quality assurance and quality control of the work that was performed.” 
“If you don’t pay me on time, then I can’t pay my vendors, I can’t pay my taxes … It’s a domino effect.”Rollo Jones, Capitol Masonry LLC
But such delays can put small contractors in a tough position, particularly if they need to make payroll and they don’t have much in savings to draw on. It can also prevent them from taking on additional jobs, and it can hurt their credit. 
In October 2019, Rollo filed a complaint with CHRO against a lead contractor, Viking Construction, whom he alleged had refused to pay Jones the full amount for the work they did and treated him “unprofessionally overall.” 
CHRO ultimately ruled, in May 2022, that there was “reasonable cause” to believe that Jones had been discriminated against based on race. But Rochelle told CT Mirror that even with the CHRO finding, Capitol Masonry was paid only a fraction of the amount they were owed.
(Viking Construction attorney Jeffrey Mirman told CT Mirror in an email that Jones entered into a confidential agreement, withdrew his complaint from the CHRO and that Jones later signed a document in which it stated that he had been “paid in full.”) 
Rochelle said she felt the CHRO didn’t support them during hearings after the finding of probable cause, instead encouraging them to come to an agreement with Viking. In the midst of difficulties with her own lawyer, she said, she felt pressured to acquiesce. 
Hill declined to comment on specific cases, but said the CHRO does not represent any one party in proceedings.  
“If you don’t pay me on time, then I can’t pay my vendors, I can’t pay my taxes, you can’t pay your guys, it’s a domino effect,” Rollo Jones said. “That destroys you. You can’t go to a lender. You can’t go to a bank. You can’t get any material. You can’t get anything. It really destroys you.”
‘We should be embarrassed‘
Thomas, Dawkins and the Joneses asked members of the legislature to place woman-owned businesses in a separate category from ethnic minority-owned businesses, and they asked for the state to require subcontractors be paid on time. Dawkins also recommended eliminating bonding requirements for minority contractors taking on smaller contracts. 
Lawmakers who heard the contractors lay out the minefields they faced said they agreed the legislature needs to address the long-running problems. 
“That level of disparity is just a shame. And to be perfectly honest, I agree with you,” Rep. Joshua Hall, D-Hartford, told Jones at the hearing. “We should be embarrassed as representatives of our community that we’ve allowed this to transpire.” 
Earlier in the session, Hall proposed his own bill that would have eliminated the bonding requirement for all contracts of less than $1 million. The bill failed to receive a public hearing. 
“Our legislative people do not push on these issues,” Thomas told CT Mirror. Thomas said he felt the bill had been drafted “behind closed doors,” without necessary input from the contractors. 
CHRO Executive Director Hughes said in an email to CT Mirror that the agency had been in contact with the Minority Construction Council and had updated the council throughout the process about their plans to address what was laid out in the disparity study.
Jennifer Little-Greer, president of the Minority Construction Council, declined to comment for this article. 
Rep. Derell Wilson, D-Norwich, vice chair of the Black and Puerto Rican Caucus, told CT Mirror that the bill was still being negotiated. He said while caucus members took the disparity study’s findings seriously, they’re still working to find the right way to help the minority contractors while staying within constitutional boundaries. 
“ We are all-in about this. I think that’s a no-brainer. I think for us [it’s] making sure we create something that’s, one, going to last [and] two, going to be beneficial and helpful. And we know that that’s not something that’s going to happen overnight,” Wilson told CT Mirror. 
Black and Puerto Rican Caucus Chair Antonio Felipe, D-Bridgeport, confirmed to CT Mirror Thursday that negotiations were ongoing. He said they were discussing ways to ensure prompt payment to contractors and to verify that major contractors made “good faith efforts” to reach out to minority businesses.
Felipe said lawmakers likely wouldn’t be able to include everything the minority contractors requested, but he said he hoped they could fill some of their requests this year and build on that work next year. 
‘This is about fairness’
The contractors said that having minority business owners flourish does more than add diversity to an industry — it provides jobs in communities where people are in need of work. These contractors often train and employ residents of areas with high rates of poverty and unemployment. 
Gwen Samuel, the former co-owner of Samuel General Contracting, said she wants to restart the business this summer with a specific goal: training young people in construction. 
“They may not be skilled in engineering and plumbing,” she said. “But you can get a basic entry job and make a livable wage in construction.” 
At a public hearing, Samuel urged lawmakers to invest in minority companies, calling it a “fiscally sound decision.”

Dawkins used to run a program teaching incarcerated people at Cheshire Correctional Institute about construction and helping them get certified, before COVID shut it down. He also crafted a proposal years ago to train young people in construction and then have them fix up blighted houses. “ It’s been a passion of mine,” he said.
And the Joneses have been offering classes for decades to people coming out of prison who want to learn a trade. They offer six to eight week classes in things like concrete, carpentry and electrical work. They help them get an OSHA card and a driver’s license. 
Samuel said minority contractors aren’t looking for “help” — what they want is a system that they can operate in. 
“This is about fairness,” said Samuel. “We could help ourselves if we have fair access to the opportunity.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MINORITY-CONTRACTORS-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-02 15:12:12.501265

(Photo by Dan Koeck/North Dakota Monitor)A day for bringing attention to organized labor and worker rights extended into an opportunity to denounce President Donald Trump’s agenda and expansion of executive power.
Around 600 demonstrators attended a May Day event in Fargo-Moorhead Thursday. Holding signs that addressed topics from demands for due process for deported immigrants to concerns about cuts to Social Security, they stood in the rain on the Veterans Memorial Bridge.
“This is one way we show our support of workers and the rule of law,” said Rick Loftus, organizer of the Indivisible Fargo chapter, also known as Fearless.
May Day is historically a time to acknowledge labor and worker rights, and this year’s event took on deeper meaning, Loftus said.
He noted that union membership has dropped to about 10% of all workers since the 1970s and this has led to reduced income and benefits for all employees. In addition, recent cuts to the federal workforce have brought additional attention to the importance of worker rights.
“We have a slogan: courage is contagious,” he said. “We gather because we want people to see we’re not afraid.”
Denise Lund-Smith traveled from Pelican Rapids, Minnesota, to participate in Thursday’s demonstration with her sister.
Lund-Smith has two granddaughters and says she wants to protect freedom for them. She held a sign with a bullet list of concerns ranging from the gutting of civil service employees to the slashing of federal programs.
“I’m 71 and this is the first time I’ve protested,” she said. “This isn’t about politics. (Trump and his administration) are destroying our democracy.”
Denise and Mark Magness of Fargo attended Thursday’s protest because they are frustrated by state Congressional leaders who won’t take a stand against what they describe as an expansion of executive power.
“(Our congressional leaders) are so chicken. They do nothing,” said Mark Magness, who said he calls his senators and representative regularly.
After about an hour, some of the demonstrators moved to the nearby Woodlawn Park where speakers addressed a crowd of about 150 people.
The program began with the singing of “The Star-Spangled Banner” and the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance.
“And let’s put the emphasis on ‘liberty and justice for all’,” Loftus said.
Retired municipal judge Thomas Davies told the crowd they have power to demand changes.
“The U.S. was a beacon of hope and decency until Trump was elected,” he said. “We all have the ability to support candidates who make a positive difference in our national, state and local offices.”
Ashley Ladbury Hrichena spoke on behalf of the League of Women Voters of the Red River Valley. The national nonpartisan organization to which the local chapter belongs recently declared a constitutional crisis. State and local leagues are advocating for Congress to take action to protect the Constitution and advocating to maintain state and local voting rights, she said.
“From the flagrant disregard for constitutional authority and governmental checks and balances, to defying Supreme Court orders, to bring Kilmar Abrego Garcia back home, one thing is abundantly clear. Our country is in a constitutional crisis,” she said.
She then encouraged the crowd to continue to pressure their congressional representatives.
“Congress has been elected by you to serve us, not the president,” she said as the crowd broke into applause.
The event ended with comments from Laura Haugen Christensen, who represented the Northern Plains United Labor Council. Workers need to stand in solidarity, she said, because they’re all facing challenges and attacks: teachers, postal workers, factory workers, the unemployed and others.
“We’re united in our resolve to fight for a better future for all,” she said. “When working people stand together, there’s nothing we can’t accomplish.”

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)While Iowa’s federal delegation has spent the week taking action on issues like fentanyl and Air Force facilities in Washington, D.C., some of Iowa’s U.S. representatives have also weighed in on an issue in their home state — the upcoming governor’s race.
After Gov. Kim Reynolds announced she would not seek reelection in 2026, several Republican elected officials in state and federal office have been brought up in media and elsewhere as potential candidates to replace her as the GOP nominee. Within state government, Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird, House Speaker Pat Grassley and state legislators including Sen. Mike Bousselot, R-Ankeny, and Rep. Bobby Kaufmann, R-Wilton, have indicated they are considering a run for the seat, though none have officially announced their candidacy. Iowa Auditor Rob Sand is expected to join the race as the Democratic candidate but has also not announced an official run.
Iowa’s four U.S. representatives, all Republican, have also been mentioned. Three of the four have already said they do not plan to run for the position. On the WHO AM Simon Conway show Thursday, Rep. Zach Nunn, representing Iowa’s 3rd Congressional District, said directly “no,” he will not run for governor.

“Governor’s race is open, I want to be very clear on this,” Nunn told Conway, a conservative talk show host. “… I think we all want to say thank you very much for Governor Reynolds, for her incredible service, for our state, for her leadership through COVID and beyond. Together, Governor Reynolds and I got to work on the three largest tax cuts in Iowa history, it’s better for every American. That said, we also have a mission. I am combat focused and trained, and now we are in Washington. I’ve got a job to do.”
Rep. Ashley Hinson also said she will not run for governor. She released a statement Tuesday saying she was thankful for the encouragement she has received from many Iowans asking her to run, but that she plans to stay in Washington to work with President Donald Trump on advancing a conservative agenda.
“We have a unique, once-in-a-generation opportunity to make real, lasting change in our country right now, and I’m committed to the fight to make Washington run more like Iowa,” Hinson said . “I am also committed to electing a conservative Governor in Iowa — I’ll be out on the campaign trail doing everything I can to help keep Iowa the best place in the world to call home.”
Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks ruled out a run in a statement earlier in April, saying she was honored for the consideration, but “my current job is all encompassing and I will not be exploring a gubernatorial run.”
The only representative who said he was open to running for the position is Rep. Randy Feenstra of Iowa’s 4th Congressional District. According to the Des Moines Register, Feenstra was asked by reporters at an April Marshalltown event if he’s keeping his options open for a potential gubernatorial campaign, and he answered “I think that’s a fair statement.”
Outside of the 2026 gubernatorial race, here’s some of what members of Iowa’s D.C. delegation weighed in on this week:
Ernst presses Air Force nominee for Sioux City airfield improvements
U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst called for the Air Force to make planned updates to Sioux City’s 185th Air Refueling Wing in a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing Thursday.
The Iowa Republican brought up previous Air Force commitments to upgrade the Sioux City airfield during a hearing for Matthew Lohmeier, the nominee for the under-Secretary of Air Force position. Ernst said the Air Force said they would make these improvements for the 185th, a unit of the Iowa Air National Guard, when the refueling wing converted from F-16 fighters to KC-135 tankers in 2003.
Ernst said at the meeting because the tankers, a heavier aircraft that are carrying fuel for delivery, weigh significantly more than the previous fighters, the current Sioux City runway is unable to support these planes. She said further aircraft upgrades now underway in the Air Force further threaten the 185th, saying the squadron “could potentially lose its mission because of the failure to upgrade this runway.”
“This is completely unacceptable, and the Air Force must live up to its commitment as of 22 years ago,” Ernst said Thursday.
Lohmeier did not agree directly that the Air Force will go through with the upgrades to the Sioux City facility when pressed by Ernst, but said he would be “very transparent in my communications” on the issue and investigate further if confirmed.
“I make the same commitment to you that I’ve made to Sen. (Tom) Cotton, or that I’d be willing to make with any senator in this room, that I’ll weigh each matter in a nonpolitical manner, try and make the best decisions for the force,” Lohmeier said. “And of course, I’m very interested, Senator, as you suggested, in honoring the commitments that the Department of the Air Force has made in the past where that’s feasible.”
Ernst said she will continue to press Air Force leadership to follow through with the Sioux City facility improvements.
“Iowa’s 185th has served with honor, and they absolutely deserve infrastructure that matches their operational demands,” Ernst said. “I’m going to continue to press on this, and I hope that I have resolution in the near future. We need to make sure these commitments are honored.”
Nunn, Ernst propose fentanyl legislation
Ernst also introduced a bill this week to raise criminal penalties for distributing fentanyl when the drug results in the user’s death.
The “Felony Murder for Deadly Fentanyl Distribution Act,” introduced by Ernst in the Senate and Rep. Tony Gonzales, R-Texas, in the House, would make the act of knowingly distributing fentanyl a first-degree murder charge when the fentanyl use caused a person’s death.
Ernst said in a statement Tuesday the measure will help prevent deaths from fentanyl.
“I have seen firsthand how the scourge of fentanyl has inflicted incredible tragedy on communities across Iowa,” Ernst said. “I have worked for years to protect Americans and stop this deadly epidemic. Increasing the severity of the punishment for the drug dealers responsible for the deaths of too many Iowans is long overdue.”
In 2024, the Iowa House passed a similar increase in criminal penalties for people who distribute fentanyl that results in death, but did not include the language in Ernst’s legislation that the distributor must be “knowingly” sharing the drug. The Iowa House passed a similar measure again this year, but it has not been taken up by the Senate.
In recent years, Iowa has seen an increase in overdose deaths related to fentanyl. Republicans at both the state and federal level have called for further action to secure the U.S.-Mexico southern border and prevent drug trafficking of fentanyl into the country. A 2020 U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration report found most fentanyl is transported into the U.S. through legal ports of entry by U.S. citizens.
Nunn introduced a bill Tuesday alongside Rep. Josh Riley, D-New York, aimed at developing technology to detect fentanyl at the border and other government facilities.
The “Stop Fentanyl Smuggling Act” would direct the National Laboratories at the U.S. Department of Energy to research and develop new technologies that can detect fentanyl vapor and particles, particularly for use at U.S. border entry points and in prisons.
In a news release, Nunn said the measure will equip law enforcement with better tools for combatting fentanyl trafficking and will help prevent deaths caused by the drug.
“Fentanyl and synthetic opioids were responsible for 43% of all drug overdoses in Iowa in 2022,” Nunn said in a statement. “Every life lost to this poison is a family shattered. … I’m proud to lead bipartisan legislation that empowers our border agents, first responders, and law enforcement with the tools they need to detect fentanyl before it reaches our streets. This is about saving lives and protecting Iowa communities.”

Details of the decision will be rolled out at a downtown Boston meeting later this month.
The post The next MBTA commuter rail contract is likely to look similar to the current one  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","MBTA OFFICIALS have been weighing how to approach the next contract for the operations and maintenance of the commuter rail while also modernizing the system, which serves 550,000 passengers every week. They plan to roll out the details of their decision to companies potentially interested in bidding on the contract at a meeting inside the state transportation building in downtown Boston later this month. When the MBTA asked for industry feedback last year, most companies said they wanted the opportunity to bid on multiple contracts, including breaking out operations and maintenance separately.  But the scope of the new contract is going to look familiar, because it’s expected to be similar to the current one, according to transportation officials: Operations and maintenance will be handled by one company, as it is right now by Keolis Commuter Services, which has had a contract since 2014. The Keolis contract, a $4 billion agreement that saw several extensions, is now set to expire in June 2027. A request for proposals is slated to go out this fall, with plans for a new contract awarded by the end of 2026 or beginning of 2027, leaving a tight timeframe to transition to the new contract if Keolis is not the operator. The contract for the modernization of the commuter rail will be handled separately, state transportation officials told CommonWealth Beacon. In discussing modernization of the system, MBTA officials have talked of swapping diesel-powered locomotives for electric ones and offering more frequent trips. Those discussions are expected to continue as the MBTA focuses on locking down a contract for operating and maintaining the current system. “I think they’ve done a lot of research and hard work to put this forward, to make sure we get what’s best for the T, but just as important best for the commonwealth, in terms of the next contract,” said Thomas McGee, chair of the MBTA’s board of directors. A public notice on the T’s website touts an “Industry Day” on May 13. “The event is intended for businesses and suppliers in passenger rail operations, rolling stock [locomotives and passenger car] maintenance, and existing infrastructure maintenance,” the notice says. In the days following the event, the MBTA is also offering confidential one-on-one meetings to organizations interested in responding to the procurement process. “Conducting a robust and highly competitive bidding process is paramount to ensuring the delivery of reliable, safe and accessible Commuter Rail service for many years to come,” MBTA spokesman Joe Pesaturo said in a statement. Brian Kane, the head of the MBTA Advisory Board, a watchdog of the public transit agency, said the MBTA’s decision to stick with a scope similar to the current set-up raises questions. “Like many people I still have a lot of questions, mostly around the contract’s duration. Are they going to give someone, not necessarily Keolis, but someone, a ten-year deal, a 20-year deal? And does that set the timeline for when regional rail [modernization] is meant to begin? And how is that transition going to be managed? Because transitions are where it gets tricky,” he said. “There are just more questions than answers right now.” Kane also voiced a concern that the T’s approach could be viewed as giving Keolis, the current operator, a “big advantage.” The perception of an advantage could drive away other contract bidders, he said. “I don’t want that perception because this is too important.” Kane added that the MBTA should more seriously analyze bringing everything in-house, similar to the structure that Phil Eng, the MBTA’s general manager, oversaw in New York when headed up the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s Long Island Rail Road (LIRR). Rich Davey, who worked for MBCR, the company that held the commuter rail contract before Keolis and later left to become MBTA general manager and then state transportation secretary, said he didn’t have a strong opinion on how the contract should be structured, but emphasized that whatever scenario emerges, it should be a competitive bidding process.  “I don’t think people realize – whatever the contract length, 10 years, 20 years, 70 years – it’s expensive,” said Davey, who now heads up the Massachusetts Port Authority (Massport), which owns and operates Logan International Airport. “And commuter rail contractors do not grow on trees, globally. I’ve been involved in this, in and out for the last 20 years. It’s usually two or three competitors at best.” The post The next MBTA commuter rail contract is likely to look similar to the current one  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/CommuterRailtressle.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-02 14:12:29.957091

The Kentucky Department of Education has requested a funding extension for projects in 13 public school districts that are in jeopardy if the federal government continues to halt future payments of pandemic relief funds.
In a Friday press release, Kentucky Education Commissioner Robbie Fletcher said KDE hopes the U.S. Department of Education approves a deadline extension to use COVID-19 relief funds but the school districts “should not have to go through this extra step and the uncertainty because these projects had already been approved by USED.” 
The projects across the 13 school districts were to receive more than $35.5 million in promised funding from the federal government. The school districts had previously requested the expected money from the U.S. Department of Education. Some had signed contracts or incurred other obligations and must now re-examine their district budgets. 
Fletcher previously urged school superintendents to contact their lawmakers in Congress about the sudden stoppage of COVID-19 relief funds to Kentucky schools. School districts previously had until March of 2026 to spend COVID-19 relief funds that had been approved. However, in a  March 28 letter, U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon told state education departments that the federal government was immediately halting nearly $3 billion in relief fund reimbursements. 
McMahon’s letter said the federal department would consider extending the pandemic relief funds’ liquidation period on an individual project basis. KDE submitted information about the planned projects in a deadline extension request to USED. 
“Compounding the problem is that in order to get the extension to spend this money from USED, school districts and KDE have signed contracts that obligated how the money would be spent,” Fletcher said. “Those contracts still exist, and some hard decisions have to be  made about how to pay for these projects if USED does not honor its previous commitments.”
The school districts identified by KDE in the extension request are Boone County, Carter County, Caverna Independent, Christian County, Clinton County, Covington Independent, Knox County, Laurel County, Letcher County, Owsley County, Perry County, Pike County and Trigg County. The districts planned to use their remaining pandemic relief funds for various projects, such as construction of school buildings and ordering new buses. 
Letcher County Schools planned to use its remaining more than $3 million in pandemic relief funds to buy 25 school buses to replace ones lost during the July 2022 floods in Eastern Kentucky. The district’s superintendent, Denise Yonts, said the district must pay for the buses regardless of what the federal education department decides, according to KDE’s press release.
“The board will have to go back to the drawing board on the budget,” Yonts said in the statement. “Right now, we have to look at the contingency and what other resources we have.”
In addition to the school districts’ projects, KDE had $18 million in unspent pandemic relief funds that were initially approved to be used through March 2026. KDE planned to use the money for initiatives like expanding the amount of students for the Kentucky Governor’s School for the Arts program this summer, supporting summer learning for students in 13 school districts and enhancing career and technical education for students with disabilities in four school districts.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/school-choice.jpeg,,,2025-05-02 14:12:29.957091

Green International Airport in March 2023. (Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)State airport officials Friday withdrew a petition filed a week ago to join the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Screening Partnership Program, a move that could have shifted passenger screening at Rhode Island T.F. Green International Airport to a private contractor.
The Rhode Island Airport Corporation (RIAC) said the decision was made after observing “significantly enhanced performance at the checkpoint” in recent weeks.
Airport officials filed the application on April 25 at the recommendation of Virginia-based consultant Studdiford Technical Solutions after RIAC raised concerns about long checkpoint lines during early morning travel last October.
Airport officials consider privatizing TSA screening duties at T.F. Green

Airport spokesperson Bill Fischer said the TSA has since worked to improve wait times at each of the seven lanes within the federal checkpoint.
“Improved wait times, particularly in recent days, have alleviated concerns raised by the airlines and the passengers back in the fall of 2024,” Fischer said in a statement. “RIAC was pleased to witness that the early morning lines that spilled out of the terminal in November are now mostly contained inside the checkpoint — a marked improvement.”
 TSA spokesperson Daniel Velez said the federal agency tries to reduce wait times by adjusting staffing levels during peak hours and high-travel seasons, along with opening additional lanes or redirecting passengers to less congested checkpoints.
Velez declined to comment on RIAC’s decision to drop its petition.
The longest wait time in the last month was at 27 minutes, according to TSA data obtained by Rhode Island Current. The average maximum wait travelers experienced in April was 10 minutes. 
Fischer said airport officials will continue to track wait times, noting an inspection conducted between 4 and 6 a.m. Friday saw roughly 400 travelers go through the checkpoint without any backups.
“RIAC has been singularly focused on one objective: reasonable wait times at PVD’s checkpoint,” he said. 
RIAC’s initial consideration to privatize TSA duties drew quick opposition from union leaders and Rhode Island’s congressional delegation. 
“Success,” responded the head of the union representing New England’s TSA officers after being told RIAC had rescinded its petition.
“Their initial decision to go private was ill-advised,” Mike Gayzagian, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 2617 headquartered in Boston, said in an interview.
U.S. Sen. Jack Reed said RIAC made the right move in leaving screening duties with the TSA.
“Putting people and the traveling public first must be job one at any top-notch airport,” he said in a statement. “ I know the people who work at TSA are committed to being efficient, effective, courteous, and professional and will continue to serve at these high standards.”

About 300 union members cheered the announcement made by Bill Louis, president of the Marine Draftsmen’s Association-United Auto Workers of America, Local 571, The Day of New London newspaper reported.
“We’re officially putting the company on notice that if we don’t have an agreement at 11:59 p.m., we strike at midnight May 18,” Louis told the union members, most of whom are essentially responsible for designing the U.S. Navy’s nuclear submarine fleet.
A message was left seeking comment with an EB spokesperson in Groton.
The looming strike comes a day after the U.S. Navy awarded EB’s parent company, General Dynamics, a contract worth more than $12.4 billion for the construction of two Virginia class submarines authorized during last fiscal year. The funding also covers improved worker pay.
More than two-thirds of the union membership voted last month to authorize a strike if a deal couldn’t be reached on a new contract.
The union’s contract expired on April 4, but leadership has agreed to continue bargaining with EB. They’ve demanded higher wages over four years, the restoration of pension benefits for all members, cost of living adjustments and profit sharing with General Dynamics, EB’s parent company, among other changes.
“The clock has run out on corporate greed,” UAW President Shawn Fain told members during a rally last month. “And I’ll tell you, this is a new UAW where the membership comes first, and we refuse to aim low and settle lower.”
EB’s earlier now-expired offer had included a 23.3% general wage increase over the life of the contract, plus benefits and an increased retirement package.
The company has acknowledged it has been “actively preparing a business continuity plan in the event of a work stoppage,” adding it will “not waver from our commitment to continue building submarines, the nation’s top national security priority.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AP25122010963029-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-05-02 16:11:38.370437

Credit: U.S. Food and Drug Administration.A push to require doctors to treat unvaccinated patients fell short on the final day of  the Florida Legislature’s regular session but lawmakers did agree to pass a priority healthcare package for Gov. Ron DeSantis.
The House on Friday voted unanimously for final approval of HB 1299.
The bill extends the legal definition of mRNA vaccines and continues a ban on businesses, government entities, and education institutions from denying entry or service based on vaccination status. Mask requirements are also banned under the law, which DeSantis persuaded the Legislature to approve in 2021.
But legislators stripped a mandate from the bill that physicians treat patients regardless of vaccination status after Republican Sen. Gayle Harrell, Democratic Sen. Lori Berman, and independent Sen. Jason Pizzo expressed discomfort with the requirement. Harrell, whose late husband was a physician, warned that the requirement would open doctors to increased liability.
Pizzo said the mandate would have contradicted a law that guarantees Florida physicians legal protections to not treat patients on the basis of their conscience.
HB 1299 also tweaks a 2024 law that banned the Board of Medicine from licensing by “endorsement” physicians who have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank, which includes information on medical malpractice settlements. 
HB 1299 makes clear that the Board of Medicine (BOM) can approve licenses by endorsement based on data bank files as long as the reported incident didn’t violate any state law or rule.
Licensure by endorsement is the route to practice in Florida for  doctors initially licensed in other states.
The Board of Medicine opposed the changes in the 2024 law and even contemplated asking the governor to veto the bill. Sen. Jay Collins, sponsor of the Senate companion bill, said he worked with the board to iron out the language.

Around 600 demonstrators attended a May Day event in Fargo-Moorhead Thursday. Holding signs that addressed topics from demands for due process for deported immigrants to concerns about cuts to Social Security, they stood in the rain on the Veterans Memorial Bridge.
“This is one way we show our support of workers and the rule of law,” said Rick Loftus, organizer of the Indivisible Fargo chapter, also known as Fearless.

May Day is historically a time to acknowledge labor and worker rights, and this year’s event took on deeper meaning, Loftus said. 
He noted that union membership has dropped to about 10% of all workers since the 1970s and this has led to reduced income and benefits for all employees. In addition, recent cuts to the federal workforce have brought additional attention to the importance of worker rights.
“We have a slogan: courage is contagious,” he said. “We gather because we want people to see we’re not afraid.”
Denise Lund-Smith traveled from Pelican Rapids, Minnesota, to participate in Thursday’s demonstration with her sister.
Lund-Smith has two granddaughters and says she wants to protect freedom for them. She held a sign with a bullet list of concerns ranging from the gutting of civil service employees to the slashing of federal programs.  
“I’m 71 and this is the first time I’ve protested,” she said. “This isn’t about politics. (Trump and his administration) are destroying our democracy.”
Denise and Mark Magness of Fargo attended Thursday’s protest because they are frustrated by state Congressional leaders who won’t take a stand against what they describe as an expansion of executive power.
“(Our congressional leaders) are so chicken. They do nothing,” said Mark Magness, who said he calls his senators and representative regularly.













































After about an hour, some of the demonstrators moved to the nearby Woodlawn Park where speakers addressed a crowd of about 150 people.
The program began with the singing of “The Star-Spangled Banner” and the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance.
“And let’s put the emphasis on ‘liberty and justice for all’,” Loftus said.

Retired municipal judge Thomas Davies told the crowd they have power to demand changes.
“The U.S. was a beacon of hope and decency until Trump was elected,” he said. “We all have the ability to support candidates who make a positive difference in our national, state and local offices.”
Ashley Ladbury Hrichena spoke on behalf of the League of Women Voters of the Red River Valley. The national nonpartisan organization to which the local chapter belongs recently declared a constitutional crisis. State and local leagues are advocating for Congress to take action to protect the Constitution and advocating to maintain state and local voting rights, she said.
“From the flagrant disregard for constitutional authority and governmental checks and balances, to defying Supreme Court orders, to bring Kilmar Abrego Garcia back home, one thing is abundantly clear. Our country is in a constitutional crisis,” she said. 
She then encouraged the crowd to continue to pressure their congressional representatives.
“Congress has been elected by you to serve us, not the president,” she said as the crowd broke into applause.

The event ended with comments from Laura Haugen Christensen, who represented the Northern Plains United Labor Council. Workers need to stand in solidarity, she said, because they’re all facing challenges and attacks: teachers, postal workers, factory workers, the unemployed and others. 
“We’re united in our resolve to fight for a better future for all,” she said. “When working people stand together, there’s nothing we can’t accomplish.”

“Measles is a highly contagious disease, as we can see by its spread around the country,” New Mexico Department of Health Acting State Epidemiologist Dr. Chad Smelser said in a statement. “More people traveling in the summer emphasizes the importance of keeping you and your loved ones safe with the best-known protection – the MMR vaccine.”
The United States currently has 935 cases of measles, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with reports of infections in 30 of the 50 states as of Friday.
NMDOH also reported an additional adult measles infection in Doña Ana County, bringing New Mexico’s total to 67 cases since the outbreak began in mid-February.
The vast majority of cases, 61, have been recorded in Lea County, which neighbors the outbreak’s epicenter in Gaines County, Texas. The remaining cases lie in the state’s southern portion: three in Eddy County, two in Doña Ana County and one in Chaves County.
NMDOH Scientific laboratory tested 141 samples for measles since Feb. 1, agency spokesperson David Morgan told Source NM on Friday. Doctors have the option to use private laboratories to test samples, but any positive results must be reported to the state, Morgan told Source via email.
More New Mexicans continue to seek the MMR vaccine, with 20,304 vaccinations administered between Feb. 1 and April 26, double the 10,860 given in the same time period last year.
Measles is one of the most contagious diseases in the world. Symptoms include fever, runny nose, cough, red eyes and a spotty red rash. Symptoms can develop one to three weeks after an exposure, and people are contagious days before and after symptoms appear. An estimated one in five cases is serious enough to require hospitalization with severe complications such as brain swelling, blindness or death.
NMODH urges anyone with symptoms or possible exposure to call the NMDOH Helpline at 1-833-796-8773 for guidance in English and Spanish about measles testing or vaccinations.
Health officials are operating 10 vaccination clinics in the state’s southern region, open daily, which require no appointment. There additionally, are other vaccine clinics around the state, which are listed on the state’s website here.

The Louisiana Department of Health identified 164 cases of pertussis, known commonly as whooping cough, in the first four months of 2025. The numbers are on track to break record highs. In comparison, the state had a total of 153 cases last year.
The significant spread of whooping cough is causing increased hospitalizations and deaths. Since September, 40 people in Louisiana have been hospitalized with the illness, and 70% of those hospitalizations involve children younger than 1. 
Two of those infants have died, marking the first two whooping cough deaths in Louisiana since 2018, according to LDH.
Belief in false measles claims correlates with lower vaccination rates, poll finds

Whooping cough is a naturally occurring disease in the U.S.. It is a highly contagious respiratory illness caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis. People with pertussis commonly have severe coughing fits, causing them to take deep breaths that make a “whooping” sound.
The disease spreads from person to person through coughing, sneezing and close contact. Infected people can spread the bacteria from the start of symptoms up to three weeks after coughing begins.
Infants are most affected by whooping cough, showing the highest reported rates of infection and the greatest likelihood of severe complications and death. Bacteria that cause whooping cough are often unknowingly spread to infants by close family or caregivers.
Health authorities say the best way to avoid illness from whooping cough is through vaccination. The vaccines are effective, but protection fades over time, the health department said. Infants over 2 months of age can receive the pertussis vaccine, and mothers can receive it during pregnancy to protect their newborns.

,DC,2025-05-02 17:33:36+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Trump asks Congress to cut $163B in non-defense spending, ax dozens of programs","Jennifer Shutt, Ariana Figueroa",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-asks-congress-cut-163b-non-defense-spending-ax-dozens-programs,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump released a budget request Friday that would dramatically slash some federal spending, the initial step in a monthslong process that will include heated debate on Capitol Hill as both political parties work toward a final government funding agreement.The proposal, for the first time, details how exactly this administration wants lawmakers to restructure spending across the federal government — steep cuts to domestic appropriations, including the elimination of dozens of programs that carry a long history of bipartisan support, and a significant increase in defense funding.Trump wants more than 60 programs to be scrapped, some with long histories of assistance to states, including Community Services Block Grants, the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, the National Endowment for Democracy, the National Institute on Minority and Health Disparities within the National Institutes of Health, and the Sexual Risk Avoidance and Teen Pregnancy Prevention programs.Congress will ultimately decide how much funding to provide to federal programs, and while Republicans hold majorities in both chambers, regular funding bills will need Democratic support to move through the Senate’s 60-vote legislative filibuster.White House budget director Russ Vought wrote in a letter that the request proposes shifting some funding from the federal government to states and local communities.“Just as the Federal Government has intruded on matters best left to American families, it has intruded on matters best left to the levels of government closest to the people, who understand and respect the needs and desires of their communities far better than the Federal Government ever could,” Vought wrote.The budget request calls on Congress to cut non-defense accounts by $163 billion to $557 billion, while keeping defense funding flat at $893 billion in the dozen annual appropriations bills.The proposal assumes the GOP Congress passes the separate reconciliation package that is currently being written in the House, bringing defense funding up to $1.01 trillion, a 13.4% increase, and reducing domestic spending to $601 billion, a 16.6% decrease.Many domestic cutsUnder Trump’s request many federal departments and agencies would be slated for significant spending reductions, though defense, border security and veterans would be exempt. The cuts include:Agriculture: - $5 billion, or 18.3%Commerce: - $1.7 billion, or 16.5%Education: - $12 billion, or 15.3%Energy: - $4.7 billion, or 9.4%Health and Human Services: - $33 billion, or 26.2%Housing and Urban Development: - $33.6 billion, or 43.6%Interior: - $5.1 billion, or 30.5%Justice: - $2.7 billion, or 7.6%Labor: - $4.6 billion, or 34.9%State: - $49.1 billion, or 83.7%Treasury: - $2.7 billion, or 19%Increases include:Defense: + $113 billion, or 13.4% with reconciliation packageHomeland Security: + $42.3 billion, or 64.9% with reconciliation packageTransportation: + $1.5 billion, or 5.8%Veterans Affairs: + $5.4 billion, or 4.1%The budget request also asks Congress to eliminate AmeriCorps, which operates as the Corporation for National and Community Service; the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides some funding to National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting Service; the Institute of Museum and Library Sciences; and the 400 Years of African American History Commission.What if Congress won’t act on the cuts?Debate over the budget proposal will take place throughout the summer months, but will come to a head in September, when Congress must pass some sort of funding bill to avoid a partial government shutdown.A senior White House official, speaking on background on a call with reporters to discuss details of the budget request, suggested that Trump would take unilateral action to cut funding if Congress doesn’t go along with the request.“Obviously, we have never taken impoundment off the table, because the president and myself believe that 200 years of the president and executive branch had that ability,” the official said. “But we're working with Congress to see what they will pass. And I believe that they have an interest in passing cuts.”The 1974 Impoundment Control Act bars the president from canceling funding approved by Congress without consulting lawmakers via a rescissions request, which the officials said the administration plans to release “soon.”The annual appropriations process is separate from the reconciliation process that Republicans are using to pass their massive tax cuts, border security, defense funding and spending cuts package.Huge boost for Homeland SecurityThe budget proposal aligns with the Trump’s administration's plans for mass deportations of people without permanent legal status, and would provide the Department of Homeland Security with $42.3 billion, or a 64.9% increase.The budget proposal suggests eliminating $650 million from a program that reimburses non-governmental organizations and local governments that help with resettling and aiding newly arrived migrants released from DHS custody, known as the Shelters and Services Program.The Trump administration also seeks to eliminate the agency that handles the care and resettlement of unaccompanied minors within Health and Human Services. The budget proposal recommends getting rid of the Refugee and Unaccompanied Alien Children Programs’ $1.97 billion budget. The budget proposal argues that because of an executive order to suspend refugee resettlement services, there is no need for the programs.A federal judge from Washington state issued a nationwide injunction, and ruled the Trump administration must continue refugee resettlement services.The budget proposal also calls for axing programs that help newly arrived migrant children or students for whom English is not a first language.For the Education Department, the budget proposal suggests eliminating $890 million in funding for the English Language Acquisition and $428 million for the Migrant Education and Special Programs for Migrant Students.Key GOP senator rejects defense requestMembers of Congress had mixed reactions to the budget request, with some GOP lawmakers praising its spending cuts, while others took issue with the defense budget.Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Roger Wicker, R-Miss., outright rejected the defense funding level, writing in a statement that relying on the reconciliation package to get military spending above $1 trillion was unacceptable. “OMB is not requesting a trillion-dollar budget. It is requesting a budget of $892.6 billion, which is a cut in real terms. This budget would decrease President Trump’s military options and his negotiating leverage,” Wicker wrote. “We face an Axis of Aggressors led by the Chinese Communist Party, who have already started a trade war rather than negotiate in good faith. We need a real Peace Through Strength agenda to ensure Xi Jinping does not launch a military war against us in Asia, beyond his existing military support to the Russians, the Iranians, Hamas, and the Houthis.”The senior White House official who spoke on a call with reporters to discuss details of the budget request said that splitting the defense increase between the regular Pentagon spending bill and the reconciliation package was a more “durable” proposal.Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins, chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, wrote the panel will have “an aggressive hearing schedule to learn more about the President’s proposal and assess funding needs for the coming year.”“This request has come to Congress late, and key details still remain outstanding,” Collins wrote. “Based on my initial review, however, I have serious objections to the proposed freeze in our defense funding given the security challenges we face and to the proposed funding cuts to – and in some cases elimination of – programs like LIHEAP, TRIO, and those that support biomedical research. “Ultimately, it is Congress that holds the power of the purse.”Senate Appropriations Committee ranking member Patty Murray, D-Wash., wrote in a statement she will work with others in Congress to block the domestic funding cuts from taking effect.“Trump wants to rip away funding to safeguard Americans’ health, protect our environment, and to help rural communities and our farmers thrive. This president wants to turn our country’s back on Tribes—and let trash pile up at our national parks,” Murray wrote. “Trump is even proposing to cut investments to prevent violent crime, go after drug traffickers, and tackle the opioids and mental health crises.”A press release from Murray’s office noted the budget request lacked details on certain programs, including Head Start.House Speaker Mike Johnson R-La, praised the budget proposal in a statement and pledged that House GOP lawmakers are “ready to work alongside President Trump to implement a responsible budget that puts America first.”“President Trump’s plan ensures every federal taxpayer dollar spent is used to serve the American people, not a bloated bureaucracy or partisan pet projects,” Johnson wrote.Spending decisions comingThe House and Senate Appropriations committees are set to begin hearings with Cabinet secretaries and agency heads next week, where Trump administration officials will explain their individual funding requests and answer lawmakers' questions.The members on those committees will ultimately write the dozen annual appropriations bills in the months ahead, determining funding levels and policy for numerous programs, including those at the departments of Agriculture, Defense, Education, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Interior, Justice, State and Transportation.The House panel’s bills will skew more toward Republican funding levels and priorities, though the Senate committee has a long history of writing broadly bipartisan bills. The leaders of the two committees — House Chairman Tom Cole, R-Okla., House ranking member Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., Senate Chairwoman Collins and Senate ranking member Murray — will ultimately work out a final deal later in the year alongside congressional leaders.Differences over the full-year bills are supposed to be solved before the start of the new fiscal year on Oct. 1, but members of Congress regularly rely on a stopgap spending bill through mid-December to give themselves more time to complete negotiations.Failure to pass some sort of government funding measure, either a stopgap bill or all 12 full-year spending bills, before the funding deadline, would lead to a partial government shutdown.This round of appropriations bills will be the first debated during Trump’s second-term presidency and will likely bring about considerable disagreement over the unilateral actions the administration has already taken to freeze or cancel federal spending, many of which are the subject of lawsuits arguing the president doesn’t have that impoundment authority.",,,,2025-05-02 14:12:29.957091

The supermajority is growing more divided about it.,"In summary
California Republicans are increasingly pushing Democrats on child sex crimes bills. The supermajority is growing more divided about it.


California Republicans have developed something of a formula in the state Legislature. 
Push to raise penalties for certain kinds of sex crimes, like trafficking minors. Press the Democrats, many of whom remain wary of increasing prison sentences in the waning heyday of criminal justice reform, on the details. Have a field day in the media with the ensuing public outrage. 
It’s become a reliable way over the past three years to deliver small wins for the superminority party. Even if Republicans aren’t always successful at passing the legislation, they can use it to expose fault lines among the opposing party that dominates the Capitol, or even score some support from the state’s de facto Democratic leader, Gov. Gavin Newsom.
That strategy has led them to win bipartisan approval for bills to increase the penalties for child sex trafficking and soliciting 15-year-olds and under for sex.
The latest such episode exploded in the Assembly this week when Republicans tried to push Democrats to increase penalties for soliciting 16- and 17-year-olds for sex or prostitution. That crime is a misdemeanor punishable by between two days to a year in jail. 
Solicitation involves asking for or arranging sex in exchange for money or something valuable; a host of other sex crimes involving minors of any age are felonies, including paying for and having sex with a minor.
This time, Republicans had the backing of freshman Democratic Assemblymember Maggy Krell, of Sacramento, who authored Assembly Bill 379. Krell objected on Tuesday when her colleagues removed the provision on soliciting older minors, saying fellow Democrats had forced her to agree to it on the threat the Public Safety committee would refuse to hold a hearing otherwise. 
When Republicans said they would try to add the provision into another bill on the floor on Thursday, she bucked Democratic leadership by supporting them. 
“We need to say, loud and clear, that if you’re under 18, a child, a minor … the person buying that person should be charged with a felony,” she said on the Assembly floor. “It’s plain and simple, sex without consent – that’s rape.”
Some moderate Democrats joined her, publicly chiding their colleagues for walking into a political landmine.
“Somehow, as our president tanks our economy and deports innocent children, the American people still don’t trust Democrats,” said Bakersfield Assemblymember Jasmeet Bains. “Any sane person knows that purchasing a 16- and 17-year-old for sex should be a felony, not a misdemeanor. This should not be a debate.”
A rare intervention from Newsom
Democrats already did the same thing last year. 
When they passed a Republican bill to increase penalties for soliciting minors, they carved out 16 and 17-year-olds out of concern the provision would treat older teenagers who are in consenting relationships the same as human traffickers. With the passage of that law, soliciting minors who are 15 or younger is punishable by up to three years in jail. 
Newsom, too, earlier this week issued a statement supporting the higher penalties for minors of all ages — a rare, but not unprecedented, intervention from a governor who occasionally chides fellow progressives when he thinks they’ve gone too far. 
The Republican effort failed on the Assembly floor Thursday, though it did garner some support from Democrats, like Bains. And it forced Democrats into a defensive mode. 
They inserted language into the bill expressing their “intent” to address the question of older teens, and continue debating the matter in future hearings this year. Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas also stripped Krell’s name from the bill and wrote in two Democratic co-authors, Assembly Public Safety Chair Nick Schultz and Elk Grove Assemblymember Stephanie Nguyen, a moderate Democrat.
Schultz, a Burbank Democrat, said he plans to hold informational hearings on the issue and hopes to pass some form of amended bill this fall. The bill, without the higher penalties for soliciting older teens, is headed to the Assembly Appropriations Committee.
Assemblymember Carl DeMaio, a San Diego Republican, vowed to make Democrats pay for the move in the next election.
“I don’t think voters are going to fall for this, and I will spend every day working to ensure that,” he said. 
Progressives warn of ‘unintended harm’ to teens
Krell, a former prosecutor of sex crimes known for taking on the operators of the trafficking website Backpage, introduced AB 379 to target buyers of teenage victims in the sex trade. 
It’s supported by Republicans, organizations that help survivors, law enforcement, including Sacramento County Sheriff Jim Cooper, and Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis. The proposal would make it a crime to loiter with the intent to purchase sex, and would use the fines from those charges to fund services for trafficking survivors.

Krell’s fellow Democrats mostly don’t have a problem with that. But they objected to the bill’s inclusion of making the solicitation of 16- and 17-year-olds a “wobbler” on the first offense, meaning it could be charged as a misdemeanor or a felony. They had just removed an identical provision from a law by Republican Sen. Shannon Grove, of Bakersfield, last year, that made solicitation of 15-year-olds (or any minor who is a trafficking victim) a “wobbler” on first offense. 
Progressives, criminal justice reform advocates and other organizations that help survivors are concerned with blurry lines in some young people’s relationships. In a statement, Anne Irwin, director of Smart Justice California, said the provision “risked unintended harm to minors.”
Democrats said they don’t want to allow older teenagers to be charged with felonies if their parents don’t approve of an interracial or an LGBTQ consenting relationship. 
“Sending an 18-year-old high school senior to state prison for offering his 17-year-old classmate $20 to fool around isn’t smart criminal justice policy,” Sen. Scott Wiener, a San Francisco Democrat, wrote on social media this week. 
Wiener was one of the lawmakers who pushed for 16- and 17-year-olds to be removed last year. Through a spokesperson, he declined to comment further. 
Proponents of the legislation have said those concerns are largely hypothetical. They countered that prosecutors wouldn’t spend time charging teenagers who are having consensual sex. (The legal age of consent is 18.) Grove, who co-authored Krell’s bill, said though it’s already a felony to pay for sex with any minor, any conversation and deal-making that precedes that act should be stopped.
But Schultz and Rivas accused their critics of playing politics and misstating current laws. In addition to it being a felony to have sex with a minor, it is also a felony to contact any minor to commit sexual offense and to send sexual text messages to minors.
“No one in the room is OK with” minors being sold for sex, Rivas said. “This is a nuanced issue and conversation.”
Schultz would not share details of how he envisions changing the bill to include 16- and 17-year-olds later this year, but said he’s considering provisions that lessen penalties for the alleged offender if he’s close in age to the victim — similar to carve-outs in the state’s statutory rape laws. 
Rivas dismissed the idea the issue had become a political liability for Democrats. 
“It’s always high stakes around here,” he said. “Our commitment is to get it right.”

(File photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The fate of more than 15 million customers’ genetic data remains in limbo after popular DNA testing company 23andMe filed for bankruptcy in March. The data is up for sale, stoking fears about how it might be used and prompting attorneys general from more than a dozen states to warn 23andMe users: Delete your data.
“Your genetic data is your most personal, confidential data, and you should be able to protect who has access to it,” North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson, a Democrat, said in a March statement.
“You have the power to delete your data now — please act quickly.”
Dr. Adam Brown, a Washington, D.C.-based emergency physician and the founder of a health care strategy firm, deleted his information on 23andMe as soon as he learned of the bankruptcy filing, he told Stateline.
For him, the bankruptcy begs a vital question that federal and state laws don’t fully address: What happens to your genetic data when the company holding it collapses?
Federal protections are flimsy. States have beefed up their genetic privacy laws in recent years, but many experts say they don’t go far enough.










There actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.


– Dr. Adam Brown, emergency physician and founder of a health care strategy company


23andMe has said the bankruptcy will not change how it stores, manages or protects its trove of sensitive customer information. In a news release issued shortly after the bankruptcy announcement, the company said any potential buyers would have to agree to comply with 23andMe’s consumer privacy policy and all applicable laws.
When contacted by Stateline, the company declined to comment beyond what it has published in news releases and information it posted for customers on its website.
But once the data is in the hands of another company, that company could change its privacy policy at any time, experts noted.
“Once you get to the point of bankruptcy court, there may not be those same guarantees or the same ethos a new company may have around privacy protections for consumers,” Brown said.
“I want people to understand there actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.”
 HIPAA doesn’t help

Companies such as 23andMe offer their users potentially game-changing revelations about their health and ancestry.
The process is simple: Mail in a saliva sample and the company uses it to build an individual genetic profile that can reveal not only a person’s family connections, but also health insights such as their risk of developing a disease like cancer or Alzheimer’s.
This valuable personal data underpins a direct-to-customer genetic testing market that was valued at $1.93 billion globally in 2023 and is expected to grow, according to market research firm Grand View Research.
23andMe was an industry giant until its stock price plummeted following a massive 2023 data breach that affected the accounts of nearly 7 million customers. Then came the $30 million class-action lawsuit settlement.
The company declared bankruptcy in late March of this year, and announced it’s up for sale.
With AI at their disposal, financial scammers are on the rise

A flurry of alerts from state attorneys general around the country soon followed.
Within two days of the company’s announcement, South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson issued a consumer alert to Palmetto State customers.
“This company has sensitive information about the people who have used it,” he said in a March 25 statement. “The best way to protect your personal information is to delete your account.”
AGs from states including Alabama, Arizona, California, Kentucky, New Hampshire, North Carolina, and Texas also issued press releases that recommended customers ask the company to delete their genetic profile and destroy the saliva sample used to create it.
“We have robust state privacy laws that include data deletion rights, and I would encourage any Texan concerned about their data to exercise the right to have their data securely deleted,” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, said in an April statement.
The fear is that a new 23andMe owner could choose to use or share sensitive personal genetic data in ways the company’s current privacy policy doesn’t allow. There’s worry it could be used, for example, to inflate people’s life insurance premiums or expose them to employment discrimination.
And there aren’t many guardrails to prevent that from happening.
HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, doesn’t apply to companies like 23andMe. The landmark federal law protects patients’ sensitive health information when it’s handled by doctors, hospitals and health insurers.
But direct-to-customer companies such as 23andMe or Ancestry aren’t considered health care providers, and their non-invasive saliva collection kit isn’t considered a medical test.
The main federal law that protects people from discrimination based on their genetic information is nearly 20 years old. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) was passed in 2008, long before the rise of at-home testing kits. It applies to employers and health insurers, but not to life insurance companies, mortgage lenders and other non-health entities. And it doesn’t explicitly protect epigenetic information, which is information about the way a person’s genes — and by extension, health — are affected by outside factors such as smoking, disease or stress.
 What states are doing

In the past five years, at least 14 states have passed laws regulating direct-to-consumer genetic testing offered by companies like Ancestry and 23andMe. There’s variation, but generally the laws require companies to get customers’ express consent before using or sharing their data, and allow customers to request their genetic data be deleted and biological samples destroyed.
It’s a good start, but doesn’t go far enough, said Anya Prince, a University of Iowa law professor whose research focuses on health and genetic privacy.
Many of those state efforts were built around a model law developed by the Coalition for Genetic Data Protection, an industry group with two member companies: 23andMe and Ancestry.
As demand for AI rises, so do power thirsty data centers

As DNA testing kits exploded in popularity and attracted increased scrutiny from lawmakers, the coalition pushed to influence legislation and set industry standards. The privacy protections in the laws mirror what 23andMe and Ancestry were already doing with their own privacy policies, experts say.
“They do have some really sensible privacy protections,” said Prince. “It’s great that people can delete their genetic data, and it’s great that law enforcement needs a warrant to access it. But if a privacy advocate had written a model law, there would be the potential for more and broader protections.”
For example, she said, many of the state laws address privacy requirements just for direct-to-consumer DNA testing companies. If 23andMe’s data is bought by, say, a pharmaceutical company, those state laws no longer apply.
The coalition now appears to be inactive, its website defunct.
Since 2020, more than a dozen states have passed some version of a genetic information privacy law, including Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming, based on a Stateline analysis. This year, the Indiana legislature passed a bill that’s now headed to the governor’s desk. Bills have been introduced this year in other states, including West Virginia.
Prince said state laws rely too heavily on consumers to self-manage their data privacy. They’re expected to understand a company’s policy, when studies have shown the public often doesn’t read privacy notices nor fully understand how companies use their data. Further, many state laws don’t address how third parties, such as law enforcement, can access and use consumer genetic data.
It’s also not always clear how the laws will be enforced, or who’s responsible for oversight.
“In general, I think there’s a disconnect between how people think their privacy is protected and how it’s actually protected,” she said.
But a few states have enacted laws that are more robust. California, for example, has a genetic information privacy law, but also has a general data protection law, as well as a state version of the federal GINA law that extends genetic anti-discrimination protections into areas including housing, education and licensing.
Florida has beefed up its DNA privacy laws in recent years, making the using or selling of an individual’s DNA without informed consent a felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison and up to a $10,000 fine. Florida was also the first state to prohibit life, disability and long-term care insurance companies from using genetic information to determine coverage

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)A district judge in Utah issued a marvelous decision on April 18, finding Utah’s school voucher law to be unconstitutional. The 60-page decision was based on a variety of constitutional flaws that the Utah law shares with Idaho’s recently-enacted education tax credit law. The Utah law was enacted in 2023 with $42.5 million in state funds. State funding increased by $40 million in each of the next two years.
The Utah judge said the Utah Constitution gives “a direct command to the legislature to perform a single duty: establish and maintain the state’s education systems.’” The judge continued, “This clear expression of one duty — coupled with the absence of any general duty to provide for the education or intellectual improvement of Utahns — impliedly restricts the legislature from creating a publicly funded school or education program outside of the public school system.” In other words, Utah’s Legislature is restricted from using public funds to support any form of private education.
Utah Fits All voucher program is ‘unconstitutional,’ district court rules

Of interest is the fact that every member of the Idaho Legislature was sent a “Legislative Alert” on the first day of the 2025 legislative session, warning that any scheme to use taxpayer money for private education would be violative of the Idaho Constitution in a number of respects. The alert was provided by The Committee to Protect and Preserve the Idaho Constitution, a group that participated in the successful lawsuit to overturn the restrictive initiative law enacted in 2021.
The alert identified the same constitutional flaw focused upon by the Utah judge — that Idaho’s Constitution prohibits the funding of private and parochial education. That has been the law of Idaho ever since statehood in 1890.
The alert spelled out several other constitutional infirmities that any voucher scheme would entail, including a deliberate transgression of Idaho’s strong prohibition against state support for religious education, discrimination against rural kids and Idaho religions that don’t operate parochial schools, lack of accountability for taxpayer money expended on private schooling, and diminution of state money necessary to support Idaho’s public school system, which has been chronically underfunded for decades.
The Utah judge’s decision mentioned a number of other infirmities in the Utah law — private schools often exclude students with special needs, or condition admission upon adherence to certain religious beliefs, or fail to provide “free” schooling as constitutionally required for taxpayer-supported education. These flaws are also inherent in House Bill 93, the subsidy bill approved by the Legislature this year.
The Idaho Legislature was clearly warned of the serious constitutional problems with House Bill 93, which will subsidize private and parochial education to the tune of $50 million in just the first year. Yet, because of massive funding from out-of-state groups that are seeking to weaken public schools across the nation, a majority of our legislators cast aside the Constitution and passed the subsidy bill. The governor lacked the courage to veto the legislation, despite overwhelming public outcry against it.
Now, as with the similar travesty in Utah, concerned Idahoans will have to resort to the courts in order to protect the wishes of Idaho’s constitutional drafters. Please stay tuned.

Shortly after a tense, hours-long debate in the state House and the passage of a ban on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) across North Carolina government, it was her time to speak on House Bill 254.

The Orange County Democrat stood and asked her colleagues to support legislation that would designate the fourth Thursday of March as “Tuskegee Airmen Commemoration Day” in North Carolina.
In 1941, the federal government established the 66th Air Force Flying School at Tuskegee Institute to train Black pilots for the war.
Almost 1,000 African Americans trained at the Army Airfield in Tuskegee, Alabama; and 450 of the men who completed training were sent overseas for combat duty. Most battled discrimination and other challenges not experienced by white individuals in the officially segregated U.S. military. And for those who survived, many such challenges persisted in the decades that followed — a phenomenon that DEI policies sought to combat.
“The Tuskegee Airmen were pilots, mechanics, bombardiers, navigators, crew members, nurses, and instructors,” Price said. “From 1943 to 1945 in the European Theatre, they provided escorts during bombing missions, helping the Allied Forces in achieving a victory in the global conflict that caused horrific destruction and casualties.”
The Tuskegee Airmen flew hundreds of patrol and attack missions — first flying older and less well-equipped P-40 and P-39 airplanes, before ultimately being reassigned to escort B-17 and B-24 heavy bombers, using P-47 and P-51 airplanes. They earned the nickname “Red Tails” from the distinctive painted tails of the Tuskegee fighter planes.
“I have a personal interest in this request,” Price shared. “Even though he was from New York State, my father was actually part of the 99th Pursuit Squadron and was with the 332nd Fighter Group.”
 Standing on their shoulders

Rep. Nasif Majeed (D-Mecklenburg) told members of the House that as a decorated Air Force combat pilot who flew 120 combat missions over North Vietnam, the history of the Tuskegee airmen was very dear to him.
“I stand on their shoulders,” said Majeed. “They were known as the Red Tails and all the bomber pilots said that because of their outstanding record, they wanted them to escort them because they lost fewer aircraft.”
The National WWII Museum notes that while 66 Tuskegee Airmen died in combat, it was one of the lowest loss records of any escort fighter group. They are credited with completing more than 1,500 missions, destroying 260 enemy aircraft, and sinking an enemy German destroyer.
Rep. Abe Jones (D-Wake) said it was a Tuskegee Airman who helped change the trajectory of his life.
After the war, Harold Webb became a teacher and a principal, and served as a leading force for school integration, according to the Raleigh Hall of Fame.

Governor Jim Hunt later appointed Webb as the first African American director of the Office of State Personnel in 1977. The former Tuskegee Airman worked to strengthen the state’s Equal Employment Opportunity program that was dedicated to diversifying and strengthening the state’s government workforce.
“I’m proud to be able to have a chance to vote for this bill,” Jones told his House colleagues.
 From aviator to prisoner of war 
Rep. Jay Adams (R-Catawba) became emotional as he thought about his own father in World War II.
“He was shot down outside of Rome in January of 1944. He spent 16 months in a German prison camp.”
Adams said it was after his capture in a dark, crowded box car that his father met a fellow southerner and aviator named William E. Griffin from Montgomery, Alabama. Griffin took flight training at Tuskegee, earned his wings in 1943, and flew more than 23 flights over enemy territory.
“William E. Griffin became one of my dad’s best friends. They dug tunnels together. They cooked together. They exercised together. They did everything together for 16 months.”
  Rep. Jay Adams (R-Catawba) said his father was held in a German prison camp during WWII. His best friend was one of the Tuskegee airmen. (Photo: NCGA live stream)
After the war, the two POWs lost touch.
Adams said his father was deeply saddened to learn in 1992 that Griffin died in 1969.
“Willie E. Griffin was the only Black guy in that prison camp. In the end of the war, there were 8,500 airmen there. But he was one of them. They were best friends. This is very special to me.”
Adams said it took years, but he made sure that letters his father had in Griffin’s own handwriting were returned to his daughter.
“He was very educated. He was a smart guy.”
Adams, a co-sponsor on the Tuskegee bill, joined 68 of GOP colleagues in voting to approve the bill to ban DEI programs.
Preserving the Tuskegee legacy amid efforts to dismantle DEI 
Earlier this year, in an effort to comply with Trump administration’s crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion, the Air Force removed videos that included stories of the Tuskegee Airmen from the military’s training materials.
Bipartisan outcry over that hasty decision led Air Force officials to walk back the order.
Locally, the Heart of Carolina Chapter of the Tuskegee Airmen and the Wilson V. Eagleson Chapter are now seeking the special day of commemoration outlined in House Bill 254 to ensure that the history of America’s first Black military pilots and their triumph over adversity is never not forgotten.
HB254 won a rare unanimous vote (114-0) on Wednesday in the state House and now moves to the North Carolina Senate.

The status of other personnel was not immediately clear on Friday.
According to a Politico report last week, the Trump administration said in federal court it was reversing course and reinstating visas for many international students and alumni. 
Two Troy University students also had their visas reinstated.

“We are grateful that the administration is reevaluating its approach to the visas and status of international students. Attracting the brightest minds from around the world benefits us all,” Troy Chancellor Jack Hawkins wrote in a statement Monday. “International students make valuable contributions to critical industries through research, innovation and scholarship.”
According to the Associated Press, at least 1,024 students at 160 colleges, universities and university systems have had their visas revoked or their legal status terminated since late March.
Trump’s widespread immigration actions have also led to the wrongful arrest of several people with legal status, including Maryland resident Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia and three U.S. citizen children under the age of 10, including one with Stage 4 cancer.
Alireza Doroudi, a doctoral student at the University of Alabama, was detained by Immigration Customs and Enforcement (ICE) in March. Doroudi was denied bond on April 17, but the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has not named any charges. 
A message seeking comment on Doroudi’s and other UA international students’ status was left with the University of Alabama Friday morning. President Donald Trump spoke at a commencement-related event at UA on Thursday where he praised his immigration policy.

(Photo by Maine Sea Grant)After an abrupt cancellation, funding for the Maine Sea Grant has been restored. 
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration notified the University of Maine this week that it was awarding three more years of funding for the Maine Sea Grant, according to a news release from the university Friday. The money for the upcoming year was made available immediately, while the remaining two years of funding will be contingent on future appropriations from Congress. 
“This vital funding for Maine Sea Grant is not a cost,” said lobsterman and marine biologist Curt Brown, in the release. “It is an investment in the future of Maine’s coastal industries and communities, an investment that has paid dividends for decades and will continue to support these iconic industries for generations to come.” 
Maine’s Sea Grant program is one of 34 across coastal and Great Lakes states throughout the country. It has helped finance statewide research, strengthened coastal communities and supported thousands of jobs over more than five decades. 
The restoration of funding comes after the university received a letter in late February stating that NOAA was immediately discontinuing funding for the $4.5 million Maine Sea Grant because the grant’s work was “no longer relevant to the focus of the Administration’s priorities and program objectives.” 
Maine’s program seems to have been the only one in the country affected. The decision came about a week after President Donald Trump threatened Gov. Janet Mills during a heated exchange over the state not complying with an executive order barring transgender students from competing in women’s athletics.
Multiple members of Maine’s congressional delegation pushed back on the decision, calling for its reversal. For example, independent Sen. Angus King and Democratic U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree wrote a letter to Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick demanding he immediately reverse the “reckless decision” to terminate the federal grant that boosts research and economic development for coastal communities.
Republican Sen. Susan Collins also spoke with Lutnick about how Maine’s coastal communities could be hurt by ending that funding. Following that conversation, Vice Admiral Nancy Hann issued a memo that the department would renegotiate the Maine Sea Grant, according to a news release from Collins’ office. 
“The groundswell of support for Maine Sea Grant and the stories that have surfaced about its incredible impact on our state’s working waterfronts have been extraordinary and effective,” said UMaine President Joan Ferrini-Mundy. 
In line with the original four-year agreement, the award from the U.S. Department of Commerce this week was just shy of $1.5 million, the release said. That money will be matched by nearly $810,000 from non-federal sources, including industry and state research funding, as is required by the program. 
If Congress continues to fund the National Sea Grant College Program, it will provide $3 million in additional funding to the Maine Sea Grant through Jan. 31, 2028. That would be matched by another $1.6 million, the release added. 
That money will allow the Maine Sea Grant to continue fostering coastal workforce development, hands-on marine science education for students of all grade levels, research to inform lobster and other fisheries management, as well as storm preparedness for working waterfronts. 
Every federal dollar spent to support those activities resulted in $15 of economic activity in the state, amounting to a total annual impact of $23.5 million in 2023, the release said.

Twenty of the bills came from the Senate, led by Senate Enrolled Act 2 — which would require enrollees under the Healthy Indiana Plan to either work or volunteer for 20 hours a week or risk losing their benefits. The proposal includes over a dozen exemptions and must also get the stamp of approval from the federal government before being enacted, however. 
Other Senate ideas include a handful of health bills — one reforming prior authorization requirements and a wide-ranging omnibus package — along with public safety and energy matters. 
One adopts a new set of eyewitness identification procedures — a move celebrated by exonerees wrongly convicted of crimes partly due to mistaken eyewitness identification.

A small modular nuclear reactor pilot program will also move forward, part of a package of bills drafted with the intention of bringing the technology to Indiana. 
Among the 36 House-originated bills signed Friday were three chamber GOP priorities.
House Enrolled Act 1005 continues incentivizing housing construction while House Enrolled Act 1006 creates a prosecutor review board to scrutinize so-called “noncompliant” prosecutors. 
The final priority measure, House Enrolled Act 1008, establishes a commission to study Hoosier absorption of secessionist Illinois counties — though such a move would also require Prairie State consent and federal approval. 
Other House bills set to become law following Braun’s signature include an Indiana National Guard enlistment boost, a “Medicaid diversion program,” and new pediatric cancer research grants. 
Additionally, a transportation infrastructure funding revamp will change how communities fund roads, bridges and more. It eases barriers to tolling and changes up the popular Community Crossings Matching Grant Program. The measure will also increase the speed limit on Interstate 465.

Civic engagement has long been a hallmark of the university community, the lawsuit states, noting University of Michigan students throughout history have protested for different causes on campus including demanding an end to the Vietnam War.
But as members of the university community hold protests demanding the university divest from companies tied to Israel’s war in Gaza, the lawsuit states that since the deadly October 7, 2023 Hamas attack on Israel, the university has completely changed its response to protest activity on campus.
“Since October 7, 2023, the University has solely targeted, discriminated against, and punished students for engaging in speech and protest activity in support of Palestine and calling for the University to divest from Israel as a means of pressuring Israel to cease human rights violations against the Palestinian people, including crimes against humanity and genocide,” the lawsuit says. 
The lawsuit notes that divestment is a reasonable effort for protesters to pursue as the university has divested before, including divesting from tobacco companies in 2000, South Africa in the 1970’s and 80’s and Russia in 2022. The lawsuit further notes that never before has peaceful participation in protests on the university’s Ann Arbor campus resulted in termination or permanent ineligibility for rehire, as it has for these employees.
University of Michigan spokesperson Kay Jarvis said, “the university does not comment on litigation” in response to Michigan Advance’s request for comment on the lawsuit.
The protests at the heart of the lawsuit are a November 17, 2023 sit-in protest outside the university president’s office and a May 3, 2024 protest outside of the University of Michigan Museum of Art.
During the May 2024 protest, the lawsuit said protestors stood outside the art museum while several of the university’s regents were inside the building for a private event. Protestors linked arms and chanted and moved back to continue their protest after university police set up a barrier around the entrance of the art museum.
Months later, five university employees who participated in the protest were sent correspondence informing them that their employment was terminated and they were permanently not eligible for rehire for violating the university policies against community violence. 
Four of the individuals who were fired months after the protest were not employees of the university when the protest was held, according to the lawsuit, which added that all the former employees who participated in the November 2023 and May 2024 protests participated in their own personal time.
During the November 2023 protest, the lawsuit says one particular student, Zaynab Elkolaly, attempted to join the sit-in protest outside the university president’s office, entering the Ruthvan Building, when she became caught between a crowd trying to enter the building and police officers at the entrance.
“While turned away from the entrance to leave and with her back to the police, she was grabbed from behind and thrown to the ground by a University of Michigan police officer. While being thrown to the ground, her hijab was ripped off,” the lawsuit says.
Months later, after Elkolaly had graduated and was no longer an employee at the university, but was planning on applying for work at the school, she received a letter from the university saying she was ineligible for rehire due to violating the school’s policies against violence.
“Each of the Plaintiffs was a dedicated University employee who took their job duties seriously, conducted exemplary work, and performed necessary services for the University,” the lawsuit states, adding that the processes the university enacted to terminate employment or bar future employment for the former employees robbed them of due process to combat retaliation by the university for their civic engagement.
The lawsuit seeks to force the university to repeal actions it took against the plaintiffs’ employment statuses, recover damages from loss of employment and any other relief that would be considered just in this scenario.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Facetune_14-03-2025-16-48-50-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-05-02 13:10:40.194688

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)Despite widespread support from business and environmental groups alike, the Senate voted Thursday to stall a bill that would create a paint recycling program in the state.
House Bill 451, led by bipartisan sponsors, aims to give residents and businesses a responsible way to get rid of their cans, while also keeping paint — which can contain harmful chemicals such as PFAS — out of the state’s landfills. But senators, citing concerns such as the fee added to paint cans to fund the program, moved to rerefer the bill to committee, likely delaying further action on the legislation until the fall.
“It’s been successful in every other state that we’ve launched a program (in),” said Heidi K. McAuliffe, the senior vice president of government affairs for the American Coatings Association. “I was really hopeful that this would be the year the bill would get through. But if it’s not this year, we’ll work towards next year.”
The program would allow retailers to volunteer as drop-off sites for the cans, with no cost paid by residents or businesses at the time of drop-off. Businesses can also arrange, at no cost, for PaintCare, the nonprofit of the trade association that runs the program across states, to pick up large amounts of cans.
The program is funded through fees added to paint cans. The cost added to each can varies by state, the size of the container, the cost of transportation and processing, and paint sales in the state, McAuliffe said. It would be after the legislation passes that PaintCare would work with an independent financial auditor to evaluate those costs, she said.
Fees where the program currently exists — in 10 states and the District of Columbia — range between 30 cents and 65 cents for containers larger than half a pint but smaller than 1 gallon. For cans between 1 to 2 gallons, that fee is between 65 cents and $1.35. For those larger than 2 gallons to 5 gallons, it’s between $1.50 and $2.45 per can. For the smallest containers, there’s typically no cost, McAuliffe said.
Before the vote, Sen. Victoria Sullivan, a Manchester Republican, called the bill “the same paint tax that we’ve been fighting for years,” and “a tax on every single can of paint that is purchased.” But the prime sponsor of the bill refuted that labeling, as does PaintCare.
“The comments about this being a tax — it’s obviously not a tax,” said Rep. Karen Ebel, a New London Democrat, “because the state isn’t getting anything. It’s not a user fee, in the classic sense, because the state isn’t getting anything. We’re basically, by not allowing this program to go forward, we’re basically telling business, ‘No, you can’t do what you want to do.’”
The inception of the program comes from paint manufacturers themselves, who in the early 2000s began working on the idea as they considered how to best manage the end-life of their products. 
In New Hampshire, the bill united groups that may typically be seen as unlikely allies, including Casella Waste Systems, the Vermont-based company at the center of contentious landfill conversations in the state; Waste Management; the Conservation Law Foundation; and a consortium of environmental groups, including the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests, The Nature Conservancy, the Audubon Society, and others.
Natch Greyes, a lobbyist for the Business and Industry Association, which supports the bill, said the legislation helps avoid antitrust concerns that could be raised by manufacturers enacting the program on their own.
“We really need authorization from the Legislature to make sure that if we start up a program like this, that we’re not going to run into any sort of trouble on the antitrust realm,” Greyes said. “And so that’s really the whole basis for the bill, is that we need to do those protections. And the justification is, obviously, this is a great public benefit.”
The bill aims to cut down costs for Household Hazardous Days. Last year, municipalities spent at least $150,000 on paint disposal, according to the bill’s fiscal note, which added that the statewide cost is “likely to be much higher” than that figure.
Ebel said it could also help drive traffic to retailers who choose to participate as drop-off locations. Aubuchon Hardware, which has 17 stores in New Hampshire, provided testimony in support of the bill, while other retailers were neutral, Ebel said. 
“For over 10 years, Aubuchon has participated in PaintCare’s network of volunteer retail collection sites in Vermont, Maine, and Connecticut,” wrote Joseph Houssan, vice president of resource for the company, “We have found that not only does the program allow us to provide a benefit to the community, our customers like the program and the opportunity to bring back leftover paint brings more customers into our store.”
Additionally, Ebel, who chairs the state’s Solid Waste Working Group, said the bill would help New Hampshire meet its goals to reduce waste going into its landfills. The state has a statutory goal to reduce solid waste, in weight, by 25% by 2030 and 45% by 2050. 
“We’re trying to landfill less and less, and this would have been tremendous assistance in that,” Ebel said.
Sen. Timothy Lang, the Sanbornton Republican who made the motion to rerefer the bill, said: “I want to get to ‘yes,’ and I’m going to be working with the prime sponsor, as well as the manufacturers and other people in the industry, to try to get to that.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/paintcansbill-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-02 13:10:40.194688

(Contributed/Snohetta)The North Dakota Legislature removed $50 million in state funding for the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library endowment, but indicated the proposal may be back next session.
The funding was removed from the Department of Commerce budget in a compromise between the House and the Senate. The House earlier had advanced the proposal to help the library with operational costs, but some objected to the funding being proposed so late in the session. 
“There have been no hearings or any kind of consideration in the Senate,” Sen. Michael Dwyer, R-Bismarck, said during floor discussion on Senate Bill 2018.
The library is under construction in Medora near Theodore Roosevelt National Park, with a grand opening planned for July 4, 2026.
Lawmakers in 2019 approved $50 million in state funding for a library endowment.
North Dakota House advances $50M in state funds for presidential library 

Rep. Mike Nathe, R-Bismarck, advocated for additional library endowment funding, which would have been contingent on the library matching the dollars with private funds. On Friday, he said legislators could revisit the proposal in the session that begins in January 2027. At that time, lawmakers would have a better idea of the operational costs after the library has been operating for a few months. 
“We can then take a look at it at a little bit more leisurely pace and take our time to delve into this,” Nathe said.
Several lawmakers said they were told in 2019 that there would not be additional state funding requested for the presidential library.
“I do remember it being expressed as a one-time funding type of deal,” said Rep. Jeff Hoverson, R-Minot. He added the critics of the original funding were proven right six years later.
The state Parks and Recreation budget also contains a $70 million line of credit through the state-owned Bank of North Dakota for the library, continuing what lawmakers approved in 2023. The loan, which can only be used for construction costs, is meant to keep the project moving if there are donations that have been pledged but not yet received by the library foundation. So far, the library has not accessed the line of credit. 
The budget for the state Industrial Commission includes up to $5 million for the presidential library to pay for some of the interest to the Bank of North Dakota if the line of credit is used.
The Industrial Commission budget had not been approved by lawmakers as of Friday morning.
North Dakota Senate rejects proposal to replace Chinese-made drones

Previously, Matt Briney, spokesperson for the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library Foundation, said the group had raised $286 million in private donations as of mid-April. 
The overall Department of Commerce budget sent to the governor includes $9 million for the state to replace state-owned drones that were made in China, which supporters say pose security concerns. The Senate had previously rejected a similar proposal, but compromised on a reduced amount in the Commerce budget.
The bill also contains a name change for the Office of Legal Immigration, which lawmakers established in 2023. The new name would be the Global Talent Office, to better reflect the agency’s work.

Laura Kelly continued to recommend cautious conservatism in terms of cuts to state taxes despite an unexpected boost in income and sales tax receipts.,"Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly and Republican House Speaker Dan Hawkins offered different perspectives on a state tax revenue report for April that showed collections above expectations but below receipts in April 2024. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Revenue from income, sales and an assortment of tobacco, liquor and energy taxes in Kansas exceeded projections in April by 1.3%, but represented a year-to-year decline of $83 million from April 2024, state officials said.
The state reported $1.33 billion in total tax collections last month as the Kansas Department of Revenue took in $17.6 million more than anticipated by state fiscal analysts. The monthly total represented a reduction in revenue of 5.9% from April of last year.
“Kansas’ current financial health is strong, but we must remain committed to fiscally responsible budgeting to ensure lasting stability in the future,” said Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly.
House Speaker Dan Hawkins, a Wichita Republican expected to seek the GOP nomination for insurance commissioner in 2026, said the latest monthly report indicated the governor’s hesitancy to support larger tax cuts was misplaced. In June 2024, Kelly signed a three-year $1.3 billion tax cut bill.
“It’s very encouraging to see April revenue numbers come in greater than expected,” Hawkins said.
He said the monthly report in April demonstrated Kelly’s “dire predictions were all just an attempt to derail much-needed tax relief.”
In the 2025 legislative session, the Republican-led House and Senate passed a bill earmarking future state revenue surpluses to reduction in individual or corporate income tax rates. Lawmakers had promised to focus on property tax reform during the annual session, and did replace a 1.5-mill state property tax levy with revenue from income and sales tax collections.

“I hope in the future the governor will stop with the doom and gloom and join us in looking out for the best interests of Kansas families,” Hawkins said.
In April, individual income tax collections were $684 million, which amounted to an unexpected surged of $10 million. That total was 1.5% above the monthly estimate. In April 2024, the state took in $740 million in individual income taxes. That equated to a year-to-year decline of $55 million or 7.5%.


Corporate income tax collections in Kansas settled at $316 million last month, the Department of Revenue said. That was $1.3 million or 0.4% greater than projected. However, the tally was below the $338 million received in April 2024 and amounted to a reduction of 6.4% or $21 million from a year ago.
The Department of Revenue said state retail sales and compensating use tax receipts for April were $296 million — $5.5 million or 1.9% above the estimate. In April 2024, Kansas took in $1.2 million or 0.4% less in sales and compensating use taxes.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Kansas-Capitol-sw-corner-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-05-02 12:20:18.510376

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)A slew of business organizations, as well as AARP and several former members of the Iowa Utilities Commission, are opposing an energy bill proposed by the governor, because they say it would negatively affect Iowa ratepayers. 
In addition to granting existing utilities the right of first refusal to new transmission projects, House File 834 and Senate File 585 expand the projects that can pursue ratemaking principles and set rules for utility resource planning. 
Opponents argue these elements of the bills would give big utilities a “carte-blanche” to add more capital investments in the state regardless of impact to ratepaying Iowans. 
Utility companies MidAmerican Energy and Alliant Energy are in favor of the bill and disagreed with the assertions that it would not benefit ratepayers.
“The policies in the bill allow us to deliver on our promise to provide safe, reliable and affordable energy when our customers need it,” a spokesperson for MidAmerican said in a statement.

Five former members of the Iowa Utilities Commission, or the Iowa Utilities Board as it was formerly titled, penned a letter to lawmakers and urged them to pause the current legislation. 
The letter said the bill has potential to “shift the risk/benefit ratemaking balance away from ratepayers and towards investors.” 
Ratemaking 
In the early 2000s, Iowa authorized ratemaking principles to account for the added risk of investments into alternative energy sources, like wind and solar, which were new at the time.
These principles, according to the letter from former IUC members, “freed” regulators from traditional ratemaking principles and granted them “premium” returns on equity at levels that ranged between 1% to 2% above the national average. 
The bill would expand the projects eligible for these ratemaking principles with the intent of attracting energy storage and nuclear electric power generation facilities in the state.  
“With these changes, Iowa ratepayers could be paying some of the highest (return on equities) in the country for another round of very large utility investments,” the letter read. 
Legislation sets regulations for anaerobic digesters on livestock operations in Iowa

The former IUC members cited a report completed by an outside firm in 2023, per requests of the Iowa Legislature, to review Iowa utility ratemaking laws and procedures. 
The study found that rate-regulated utilities can receive advanced ratemaking approval with “relative ease” and that the IUC had limited ability to “determine whether an asset would truly benefit the electric system and the ratepayers that pay for it.” 
It also said precedent around advanced ratemaking “facilitates infrastructure build-up without thorough assessment by the IU(C)” 
The former IUC members said they “commend legislators for taking ratemaking reform seriously” but they recommend “pausing the current legislation” or amending the bill, to better address the issue in a way that “protects ratepayers.”
Geoff Greenwood, media relations manager for MidAmerican, said the letter “ignores” that the returns can “only be approved if they are found to be in the public’s interest.” 
“MidAmerican’s track record over the past two decades proves that the policies in the bill allow us to deliver on our promise to provide safe, reliable and affordable energy when our customers need it,” Greenwood said in a statement. 
He said returns on equity are approved “after a robust process” in the IUC with input from the Office of the Consumer Advocate and customers. Greenwoods said the returns are “not ‘premium’” because they “reflect the cost and risk of long-term investments” as they are applied to the 30- to 40-year lifespan of a facility. 
Latest figures from MidAmerican point to average utility rates in Iowa that are 44% below the national average.
“The use of ‘non-traditional’ advance ratemaking principles is exactly what has made Iowa exceptional and resulted in some of the lowest electricity rates in the country,” Greenwood said.
He said MidAmerican additionally uses a method of revenue sharing that allows the company to use revenue, beyond a certain level of return, to “pay off company generating facilities so that customers won’t bear those costs in the future.” 
“This customer-first mechanism incentivizes MidAmerican to better manage its operations and, when that happens, customers benefit,” Greenwood said in the statement.
The bill would also remove the requirement that projects are a baseload electric power generating facility, or one that essentially operates at all times, and lowers the generating capacity of the facility from at least 300 megawatts to 40 megawatts. 
Bob Rafferty, with Iowa Businesses for Clean Energy which is one of the groups opposed to the bill, said these changes would allow companies to seek higher ratemaking principles on projects like gas peaker plants. 
Per MidAmerican documents, a newly proposed $600 million peaker plant project would work when demand is high, and is expected to operate less than 10% of the year. 
A fact sheet on the plants say they are a “key addition” to the company’s “all-of-the-above generation strategy” to meet the expected increased demand of the next 20 years. 
But Rafferty said utility companies have an incentive to build more capital assets, like generating stations and transmission lines, because they can profit from them. 
He said it’s “important” to make sure the system doesn’t allow a company to determine how many capital assets they need to build, as he alleges the bill would do. 
Resource planning 
Opponents are also worried about a line in the bill that says utilities should submit resource plans to the IUC that “reflect the circumstances and management judgment of an electric utility.” Rafferty said this means an investor-owned utility would have to create its resource plans in line with what would benefit its shareholders, rather than ratepayers. 
Iowa is currently one of a handful of states that does not require an integrated resource plan, defined by Midwest Energy Efficiency Alliance as an examination of energy supply, demand and potential risks to meeting demand at a reasonable cost.

Gov. Kim Reynolds’ energy plan for the state, on which the bill is based, notes the need for integrated resource planning, or IRP, to comprehensively look at what energy sources will be needed for further growth in the state.
Current law requires utilities to submit energy efficiency plans every five years, with five- or  20-year energy needs forecasts. 
Rafferty said when a utility proposes an investment be considered for ratemaking principles, the utilities commission doesn’t get the “big picture” of the project’s impact on the state without an IRP. 
“What the IRP should do is require it to be in the ratepayers’ best interest, and the Iowa Utility Commission needs to be empowered to make sure that that is, in fact, the case,” he said.
ROE Letter 4-24-25
 Former members of the Iowa Utilities Commission, Richard Lozier, Jr., Geri Huser, Sheila Tipton, Darrell Hanson and John Norris wrote a letter to legislators opposing the bill.
Under the bill, the Iowa Utilities Commission may make recommendations to the utilities on the resource plan, and the company must “make a good faith effort” to inform and include suggestions from the commissioners, consumer advocate and stakeholders. 
“The legislation, as it’s currently constructed … would give the utilities a carte blanche to make any investment that they want and to earn a premium return on equity,” Rafferty said. 
Rafferty as part of Iowa Businesses for Clean Energy, has banded with lobbyists from Iowa Business Energy Coalition, AARP, Iowa Economic Alliance, National Federation of Independent Business, Iowa Retail Federation and LSPower in opposition of the bill and to suggest lawmakers either “fix it or forget it.”
An amendment suggested by the bill opponents would make it so that facilities outlined in resource plans are “in customers’ best interests.” 
The proposed amendment would also allow the IUC to approve, reject or modify a resource plan and would greatly expand the ability of stakeholders to participate and weigh in on the plans. 
The bill, as is, stipulates a resource plan should “consider all reasonable resources” and should include “adequate, cost-effective, and reliable energy service considering costs, fuel diversity, and probable future demand for energy.” 
Rafferty said legislators need to think of utility rates like they think about taxes for Iowans. 
“Their vote will determine whether taxes go up, or taxes don’t go up,” he said.
A spokesperson from Alliant Energy said the bill will “strengthen and help grow Iowa communities to meet the state’s future energy needs.” 
“We commend Governor Reynolds for leading on energy policy that promotes an all-the-above energy strategy, enhances customer transparency and participation for generation planning and is focused on driving economic development in this state,” the spokesperson said in an email.
Greenwood with MidAmerican said the bill is important in updating Iowa’s policies that “have been effective for customers for decades” and will keep the state from “falling behind other states.” 
“Simply put, Iowa’s energy policy – as it is currently as well as the bill’s proposed updates – works for Iowans,” Greenwood said. 
Lawmakers noted during House hearings in early February the bill would have some amendments before it would be ready for floor debate. As legislators close out the 110th day of session, the bill remains stuck in a Senate appropriations committee and a House subcommittee. 
House Speaker Pat Grassley said Thursday to reporters that the caucus is focusing on the budget before “taking up significant pieces of policy.” When asked specifically about ROFR and the energy bill as a whole, the Republican leader said “it’s still pretty divided” among representatives.

The Republican will pay $18,300 for an improper transfer of funds from his campaign war chest to a local school board election committee in Jenks.
The payment was $2,100 to the local campaign committee, “Cross for Jenks,” which backed candidate Ashley Cross for school board in the district. She expressed concern about “oversexualization” in schools during her 2022 election bid. She eventually lost to incumbent school board member Terry Keeling.
The total payment must be received by the end of September, according to the settlement. The first installment of $5,000 is due on May 30.
It’s the second time Walters has paid a fine in recent months, after another $5,000 settlement for improper use of his official social media account for political purposes in March. In that case, the Commission found 10 of Walters’ social media posts advocating for the election of President Donald Trump and the defeat of former Vice President Kamala Harris violated Oklahoma Ethics Rules.
In good news for Walters, the Ethics Commission also dismissed a separate complaint against him for endorsing an alternative membership organization to a union for teachers, which a Democratic lawmaker had brought.
Rep. Ellyn Pogemiller, D-Oklahoma City, filed the complaint. She told StateImpact that state law provides two avenues for potential violations: using state resources for private purposes and the obligation of state officers to avoid conflicts of interest and preferential treatment. She argued that the union was a private organization and that public resources should not be used for advocacy on its behalf.

(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The fate of more than 15 million customers’ genetic data remains in limbo after popular DNA testing company 23andMe filed for bankruptcy in March. The data is up for sale, stoking fears about how it might be used and prompting attorneys general from more than a dozen states to warn 23andMe users: Delete your data.
“Your genetic data is your most personal, confidential data, and you should be able to protect who has access to it,” North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson, a Democrat, said in a March statement.
“You have the power to delete your data now — please act quickly.”
Dr. Adam Brown, a Washington, D.C.-based emergency physician and the founder of a health care strategy firm, deleted his information on 23andMe as soon as he learned of the bankruptcy filing, he told Stateline.
For him, the bankruptcy begs a vital question that federal and state laws don’t fully address: What happens to your genetic data when the company holding it collapses?
Federal protections are flimsy. States have beefed up their genetic privacy laws in recent years, but many experts say they don’t go far enough.










There actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.


– Dr. Adam Brown


23andMe has said the bankruptcy will not change how it stores, manages or protects its trove of sensitive customer information. In a news release issued shortly after the bankruptcy announcement, the company said any potential buyers would have to agree to comply with 23andMe’s consumer privacy policy and all applicable laws. When contacted by Stateline, the company declined to comment beyond what it has published in news releases and information it posted for customers on its website.
But once the data is in the hands of another company, that company could change its privacy policy at any time, experts noted.
“Once you get to the point of bankruptcy court, there may not be those same guarantees or the same ethos a new company may have around privacy protections for consumers,” Brown said.
“I want people to understand there actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.”

HIPAA doesn’t help
Companies such as 23andMe offer their users potentially game-changing revelations about their health and ancestry. The process is simple: Mail in a saliva sample and the company uses it to build an individual genetic profile that can reveal not only a person’s family connections, but also health insights such as their risk of developing a disease like cancer or Alzheimer’s.
This valuable personal data underpins a direct-to-customer genetic testing market that was valued at $1.93 billion globally in 2023 and is expected to grow, according to market research firm Grand View Research.
23andMe was an industry giant until its stock price plummeted following a massive 2023 data breach that affected the accounts of nearly 7 million customers. Then came the $30 million class-action lawsuit settlement.
The company declared bankruptcy in late March of this year, and announced it’s up for sale.

A flurry of alerts from state attorneys general around the country soon followed. AGs from states including Alabama, Arizona, California, Kentucky, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Texas issued similar press releases that recommended customers ask the company to delete their genetic profile and destroy the saliva sample used to create it.
“We have robust state privacy laws that include data deletion rights, and I would encourage any Texan concerned about their data to exercise the right to have their data securely deleted,” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, said in an April statement.
The fear is that a new 23andMe owner could choose to use or share sensitive personal genetic data in ways the company’s current privacy policy doesn’t allow. There’s worry it could be used, for example, to inflate people’s life insurance premiums or expose them to employment discrimination.
And there aren’t many guardrails to prevent that from happening.
HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, doesn’t apply to companies like 23andMe. The landmark federal law protects patients’ sensitive health information when it’s handled by doctors, hospitals and health insurers. But direct-to-customer companies such as 23andMe or Ancestry aren’t considered health care providers, and their non-invasive saliva collection kit isn’t considered a medical test.
The main federal law that protects people from discrimination based on their genetic information is nearly 20 years old. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) was passed in 2008, long before the rise of at-home testing kits. It applies to employers and health insurers, but not to life insurance companies, mortgage lenders and other non-health entities. And it doesn’t explicitly protect epigenetic information, which is information about the way a person’s genes — and by extension, health — are affected by outside factors such as smoking, disease or stress.
What states are doing
In the past five years, at least 14 states have passed laws regulating direct-to-consumer genetic testing offered by companies like Ancestry and 23andMe. There’s variation, but generally the laws require companies to get customers’ express consent before using or sharing their data, and allow customers to request their genetic data be deleted and biological samples destroyed.
It’s a good start, but doesn’t go far enough, said Anya Prince, a University of Iowa law professor whose research focuses on health and genetic privacy.
Many of those state efforts were built around a model law developed by the Coalition for Genetic Data Protection, an industry group with two member companies: 23andMe and Ancestry.

As DNA testing kits exploded in popularity and attracted increased scrutiny from lawmakers, the coalition pushed to influence legislation and set industry standards. The privacy protections in the laws mirror what 23andMe and Ancestry were already doing with their own privacy policies, experts say.
“They do have some really sensible privacy protections,” said Prince. “It’s great that people can delete their genetic data, and it’s great that law enforcement needs a warrant to access it. But if a privacy advocate had written a model law, there would be the potential for more and broader protections.”
For example, she said, many of the state laws address privacy requirements just for direct-to-consumer DNA testing companies. If 23andMe’s data is bought by, say, a pharmaceutical company, those state laws no longer apply.
The coalition now appears to be inactive, its website defunct.
Since 2020, more than a dozen states have passed some version of a genetic information privacy law, including Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming, based on a Stateline analysis. This year, the Indiana legislature passed a bill that’s now headed to the governor’s desk. Bills have been introduced this year in other states, including West Virginia.
Prince said state laws rely too heavily on consumers to self-manage their data privacy. They’re expected to understand a company’s policy, when studies have shown the public often doesn’t read privacy notices nor fully understand how companies use their data. Further, many state laws don’t address how third parties, such as law enforcement, can access and use consumer genetic data.
It’s also not always clear how the laws will be enforced, or who’s responsible for oversight.
“In general, I think there’s a disconnect between how people think their privacy is protected and how it’s actually protected,” she said.
But a few states have enacted laws that are more robust. California, for example, has a genetic information privacy law, but also has a general data protection law, as well as a state version of the federal GINA law that extends genetic anti-discrimination protections into areas including housing, education and licensing.
Florida has beefed up its DNA privacy laws in recent years, making the using or selling of an individual’s DNA without informed consent a felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison and up to a $10,000 fine. Florida was also the first state to prohibit life, disability and long-term care insurance companies from using genetic information to determine coverage.

This week: May Day demonstrations decry Trump; unemployment benefits hang over state budget deal; strike averted at HealthPartners; governor exempts more workers from return-to-office order; and labor market proves resilient amid economic turmoil. 
May Day demonstrations decry assault on workers, immigrants
Fury at the Trump administration’s assault on unions and immigrants fueled annual May Day demonstrations across the country and in Minnesota, where thousands of people filled the Capitol lawn in St. Paul on Thursday with simultaneous rallies in Duluth, Rochester, St. Peter, Northfield and Brainerd.
“Immigrant rights and labor rights are human rights, and it’s really important to stand up with what’s happening in D.C.,” said Shari Wojtowicz, an AT&T employee and president of the state council of the Communication Workers of America union, in an interview before the rally in St. Paul.
Union leaders and immigrant rights activists decried Trump’s moves to deport undocumented immigrants, hamstring the National Labor Relations Board and rescind collective bargaining rights for federal employees.
They urged the crowd to remember their power in speeches inflected with references to significant historical events: the Delano Grape Strike and Boycott; Martin Luther King Jr.’s final speech to the striking sanitation workers in Memphis; President Reagan firing the air traffic controllers; and the Haymarket massacre in Chicago in 1886 during a protest for an 8-hour workday, which May Day commemorates.
The event featured Sara Nelson, international president of the Association of Flight Attendants, who became a celebrity of the labor movement in 2019 when she called for a general strike and was credited with helping end the 35-day government shutdown.

She began her speech by belting out a stanza from the old labor song, “Solidarity Forever.”
“It is we who plowed the prairies; built the cities where they trade;
Dug the mines and built the workshops, endless miles of railroad laid;
Now we stand outcast and starving midst the wonders we have made;
But the union makes us strong.” 
Nelson renewed her call for a general strike. Like the 1934 Minneapolis general strike, she reminded the crowd.
“That’s the working class power that had corporations begging for labor law,” Nelson said. “Musk and the oligarchs have money and control, but we have the power. Nothing can move without our labor. And it’s time that we exercise our power in a united working class.”
Earlier in the day, Nelson met with workers at the Minneapolis-St. Paul Airport and said the union is closer than it’s ever been to filing for a union election for Delta flight attendants.
Marching with the crowd from the Capitol, Alison Jones, a union English Language Learner teacher in the Minneapolis Public Schools, said she came to show her support for workers’ rights and her students, some of whom have stopped coming to class out of fear of deportations.
“People should be able to go to school and not worry,” Jones said.
Unemployment benefits become sticking point at Legislature
  (Photo courtesy Minnesota House of Representatives Public Information Services)
Unemployment benefits for bus drivers, teachers’ aides and other hourly school employees is becoming a major sticking point in budget negotiations at the state Capitol.
In 2023, Minnesota became the first state to offer unemployment to hourly school workers in the summer months, providing a financial cushion that has long been available to other seasonal workers like those in construction. But the $135 million the state set aside for the benefits in 2023 is running dry, meaning school districts could soon be on the hook for the added expense.
On Monday, the Democratic and Republican co-chairs of the House Education Finance Committee unveiled an agreement that would set aside an additional $30 million for unemployment benefits to carry school districts through this summer and then repeal the benefit in 2029.
But House Democrats in the Rules Committee showed they weren’t willing to go along with the deal from leadership when they voted against advancing the education budget bill to the House floor for a full vote, so long as it included the provision stripping hourly school employees of the benefit.
Meanwhile, the Senate passed a bill extending unemployment benefits for more than 600 steelworkers at two northern mines from 26 weeks to 52 weeks. The proposal sailed through the narrowly divided Senate with support from Republicans, who are increasingly sensitive to the needs of miners on the now reliably red Iron Range.
That raises the possibility that miners — predominantly white men earning upwards of $100,000 a year — could receive a full year of unemployment benefits while hourly school workers — predominantly women and people of color earning around $17 an hour on average — would be stripped of all benefits. Beyond the issue of fairness, Democrats who vote to repeal benefits for hourly school workers would be running afoul of the Service Employees International Union, an important ally that represents school workers.
“What our caucus has clearly said is we are not going to pit workers against each other. We believe everyone should have the economic security of unemployment insurance,” said Emma Greenman, DFL-Minneapolis, who authored the bill in 2023 extending unemployment to hourly school workers.
1,000 HealthPartners workers reach deal, call off strike
Ahead of a 10-day strike set to begin on Monday, HealthPartners and the union representing about 1,000 front-desk and office support workers reached a tentative agreement on a new labor contract that raises wages and preserves health insurance benefits.
The workers, who are represented by OPEIU Local 12, voted to authorize a strike in January for the first time in decades over the company’s proposals to increase health insurance premiums and introduce co-pays for the first time, while offering wage increases that didn’t match inflation.
“The tradeoff for many years was being able to have a gold standard health plan meant taking less in wages,” said Devin Hogan, president of OPEIU Local 12. “Wages have fallen so far behind that people can’t make a living.”
The details of the tentative agreement were not immediately public, but Hogan said the union was pushing for raises that restored the $3.50 per hour in buying power that inflation ate away since the pandemic. The starting wage for OPEIU workers is around $19 an hour.
Governor expands return-to-office exemption
Gov. Tim Walz’s administration exempted more state employees from his order that most employees return to the office 50% of the time beginning June 1.
In a memo published this week, Minnesota Management and Budget said workers who live more than 50 miles from the office — instead of the previous 75 — can work from home.
The order has faced intense backlash from the state’s largest union, Minnesota Association of Professional Employees, which has raised the possibility of a strike and compared Walz to billionaire Elon Musk, who has championed full-time return-to-office at the federal government.
The Walz administration says the move will improve collaboration and communication, while MAPE argues the order will only hurt retention and recruitment without improving productivity.
“We view this as a cosmetic adjustment to an inherently flawed policy that continues to disrupt state operations, require unnecessary costs, and destabilize the workforce without addressing any clear operational need,” MAPE President Megan Dayton said in a statement to the Reformer.
MAPE is currently negotiating a new labor contract with state leaders and has proposed that they be entitled to work remotely unless the state can “clearly and convincingly demonstrate that essential job functions of the position cannot be completed when telecommuting.”
Labor market withstands shrinking economy
The U.S. economy added 177,000 jobs in April and unemployment remained unchanged at 4.2%, two closely watched metrics as the Trump administration’s trade war, federal funding cuts and reduction of the federal workforce roil the economy.
The better-than-expected jobs report on Friday suggests the labor market has remained strong so far despite worrying signs elsewhere. The U.S. economy shrank 0.3% in the first quarter of the year, the stock market has been on a rollercoaster ride, and retailers are cancelling orders from overseas, raising the specter of a return to empty store shelves from the COVID-19 era.
“The ‘R’ word that the labor market is demonstrating in this report is resilience, certainly not recession,” Olu Sonola, head of US economic research at Fitch Ratings, said in Bloomberg. “For now, we should curb our enthusiasm going forward given the backdrop of trade policies that will likely be a drag on the economy.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NN250501_0056-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-05-02 12:20:18.510376

But that first third of 2025 was still much warmer than the average in the mid-1900s in central Connecticut, according to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
For example, from 1949 through 1987, the average January-April daily temperature was about 34.5 degrees. From 1987 through 2025, it was 2 degrees warmer, at 36.5 degrees, and since 2010, it’s been about 37.2 degrees — a stretch that included the brutal winter of 2015.
The winters and early springs of 2002, 2012, 2023 and 2024 each featured average temperatures above 40 degrees for the January-April period — temperatures not seen at any other point in the last 75 years.
While summers have been getting warmer overall since 1949, the increase hasn’t been as sharp as the change in the winters of the year. The average May-August temperature from 1949 through 1987, for example, was about 68 degrees, compared to 1987 through 2025, which was about 69.1 degrees.

Bernie Sanders calls on Democrats to “stop defending the status quo economically” during May Day rally in Philadelphia,"A crowd rallies outside of Philadelphia City Hall on May 1, 2025. (Capital-Star photo by John Cole)Pennsylvania’s capital and largest city were home to May Day rallies on Thursday – as people took to the streets to protest President Donald Trump’s economic, social, and immigration policies.
A few thousand traveled to Philadelphia on a warm Thursday afternoon to celebrate a “Workers over Billionaires” rally, hosted by the Philadelphia AFL-CIO, featuring U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT).
Daniel Bauder, President of the Philadelphia AFL-CIO, described Philadelphia as the “birthplace of America’s labor movement.”
In the current moment, Bauder said he thinks a lot about the 1960s and the struggles of the Civil Rights  labor movements during that era and how the two worked together. He thinks there’s “so many opportunities” for labor and human rights groups to join together to meet the moment.
Debra Boston, who made her way from Lackawanna County, stood outside Philadelphia City Hall with her sign, more than two hours before Sanders took the stage.
“My rights, the Constitution, deplorable president,” she said, as the reason she made the trip.

Attendees and speakers alike were united against the Trump administration. Philadelphia added its voice to Sanders’ rallies, which he has dubbed the “Fighting Oligarchy” tour.
Trump celebrated 100 days in office this week with a rally in Michigan.
Paula Paul, a member of the Granny Peace Brigade Philadelphia, is a fan of Sanders, but noted he wasn’t the only reason she was on hand.
“We came because we’re part of the movement trying to raise issues against the current regime,” she said. “We want our grandchildren to know, our neighbors to know, that we’re standing up against many of the current policies and the disrespect and disregard for human life.”
A few who spoke with the Capital-Star, who opposed Trump in the 2024 election, said he’s been worse than they’d expected.
Carol Rogers, an AFSCME District Council 47 retiree, lives in Philadelphia. She said she’s “heartbroken” with how Trump has conducted himself during his presidency. She said she was disappointed, as an activist, how he is putting an end to the strides the nation has made over the past few decades to end racial discrimination.
“It’s a very frightening time for everybody,” Rogers said.
Robert Frederick, a veteran who lives in Philadelphia, said he was at a protest at Mar-A-Lago in Florida about a month ago and described Trump’s first 100 days as a “circus.”
“He has no ability to govern,” Frederick said.
While Trump’s approval rating has shrunk, the Democratic Party also currently isn’t gaining in popularity.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
One thing most who spoke with the Capital-Star in Philadelphia agreed on is they want Democrats to be more vocal.
“They need to get together and fight. Some of them are fighting, but they don’t have any unified fighting,” said Joan Lukas, another member of the Granny Peace Brigade Philadelphia.
“I think they need to stand up, they need to go after him and they need to just throw themselves up here, because they work for us, and they’re not working for us right now,” Boston said.
Sanders, saying May Day “in a sense, is a sacred holiday,” celebrated the impact that the trade union movement has had on American society. But, he spoke at length about the concerns he has with the current state of the country, directing blame at the Trump administration and others who support him.

“Brothers and sisters, our job right now, in my view, is two fold,” Sanders said. “First, we have got to fight Trump every single day. Secondly, we need to have a vision as to where our country goes in the future.”
“And here is the bottom line and I say that to my Democratic colleagues in the Congress. Stop defending the status quo economically,” he added.
Rev. Gregory Edwards, Executive Director of POWER Interfaith, called for a “moral revolution” during his speech and echoed the power of a joint effort between labor and faith.
“We have been here before,” Edwards said. “We have seen what happens when profits are placed above people. When workers are pushed to the margins, but history also shows us that when labor and faith come together, mountains can be moved, wages can be raised, policies can be changed and communities, neighborhoods, streets can flourish.”
The immigration issue was also on the minds of those on hand.
“I am Kilmar Abrego Garcia, I am Mahmoud Khalil,” said Jimmy Williams Jr., General President of the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades (IUPAT) to applause. “We all are one.”
The recent detention of Garcia and Khalil have garnered headlines nationwide and have resulted in some protests.

There was no shortage of criticism towards Elon Musk during the speeches in Philadelphia, as well as on signs held by various attendees.
No Pennsylvania elected officials took the stage to speak during the rally, but U.S. Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon (D-5th District), state Rep. Joe Hohenstein (D-177th District), and Philadelphia Councilmembers Jim Harrity, a Democrat, and Nicolas O’Rourke, a member of the Working Families Party, were in attendance.
Williams called for solidarity with the rest of the American labor movement and thanked Sanders for being present on Thursday to “tell us the truth and a vision for the future.”
“Today, on May Day, we as the working class must declare our independence from both political parties,” Williams said. “We stand up for what’s right. We have to look and stare down every politician and tell them that if you don’t stand with us, we don’t stand with you.”
‘A reason for everyone to scream’
The protest in Harrisburg, which organizers estimate brought around 400 attendees, had no big name speakers. But union leaders and activists played songs, chanted and offered speeches from the top of the state Capitol steps.
While it was ostensibly a protest for May Day, and some wore union garb, attendees held signs for a host of disparate causes. Some called for President Trump’s removal. Some had Ukrainian or rainbow flags. Others had slogans opposing Elon Musk or the U.S.’s role in the war in Gaza.

The rally was held by a local 50501 chapter, part of a loose coalition of grassroots organizers that’s been holding protests in capitals around the country since the beginning of Trump’s second term. 
And the nonuniformity was part of the design.
“It started off as a reason for everyone to scream,” TJ Demetriou, a 42-year-old from Hershey,  and one of the organizers, told the Capital-Star.
Demetriou, a veteran, said he had never been involved in protesting or politics before Trump’s latest term. But he was alarmed by what he saw. In particular, what he believes are “threats to the Constitution.” He cited attacks on free speech and the press, deportations without due process, and a consolidation of power in the executive branch.
But the protests, he said, were a way to unite people focused on different issues around their opposition to Trump, especially as many echoed the same criticism voiced at the Philadelphia event – Democrats weren’t doing enough.
“I thought we’d be putting up more of a fight. Not us, but Democrats in power,” said Nick Frey, a 26-year-old from Harrisburg.
Though he considers himself a “leftist” and not a Democrat, Frey voted for Harris in November. He sees the party as the most viable option at the moment.
Frey carried a sign that admonished Trump’s “brand of oligarchy.”
“He’s trying to create a tribute system with our allies, when he feels like they aren’t paying their fair share,” Frey said. “He’s ruined our good will built over the past 80 years since the end of World War II. And he’s done that in the first 100 days.”
Still, he said the most important issue for him at the moment is the Trump administration’s treatment of immigrants and minorities more broadly.

Carol Nodgaard, 66, came to the protest from Lancaster.
“I used to teach history and government,” she said. “I can’t control what necessarily goes on in Congress, but I can call, I can write and I can show out.”
Nodgaard said she lives off her social security benefits and 401k savings. But she’s worried that Trump’s aggressive cuts to the federal government may affect the social security program, and his tariff policies have hurt her investments.
“Hopefully it’ll come back up,” she said.
But Nodgaard said, as a gay person, the administration’s hostility towards transgender people has been particularly affecting. And being from a family of farmers in Nebraska, their treatment of immigrants has been hard to watch as well.
“Who’s working on the farms and the meat packing plants?” Nodgaard said. “They’re immigrants doing the work. But all their workers have disappeared because they’re afraid of being deported.”
Still, she’s heartened by the protest movement, which she thinks is stronger than it was in Trump’s first term. She’s been to multiple rallies since Trump took office in January.
“It’s a marathon, not a sprint,” she said.  She said she’ll be back in Harrisburg again Friday to see Sen. Sanders speak at the Farm Show Complex. 
Sanders will be in the capitol city on Friday and Bethlehem on Saturday for his “Fighting Oligarchy” tour.

You can read more about the section here.

Given recent policy changes threatening the future of medical research and news of Mississippi’s falling childhood vaccination rates, I fear we are ignoring lessons learned the hard way. 
One of those lessons occurred during a yellow fever outbreak in the summer of 1898 when a community of honest citizens in Orwood, then a hamlet in southwest Lafayette County, helped a team of physicians change the direction of public health for Mississippi and the rest of the country.
I first heard about their story listening to a documentary about yellow fever with my husband, a virologist, who teaches at the University of Mississippi. The video mentioned an unnamed doctor in Mississippi who had advanced a theory linking mosquitoes and yellow fever.
The story I uncovered models the honesty and trust in medical science we need today to keep our families and communities healthy. 
***
Yellow fever was a problem in the South throughout the 1800s. Its initial symptoms — fever, body aches and severe headache — were followed by jaundice and in some cases internal bleeding leading to death. The jaundice left the skin tinged with yellow, thus the name “yellow fever.”

In early August 1898, a young woman named Sallie Wilson Gray (no relation to the author) developed chills and a fever while visiting at her uncle’s home in Taylor. Her uncle immediately sent her home to be cared for by her family in Orwood, about 10 miles away.  
Days later, Sallie’s uncle in Taylor died from what proved to be yellow fever. Family members wiped black vomit, a sign of internal bleeding, from his body as he lay in his coffin. 
Sallie had now brought the same illness home to Orwood. 
***
I learned about yellow fever in seventh grade when we studied the 1878 yellow fever epidemic, the worst to strike the Mississippi River Valley. That year, Mississippi reported almost 17,000 cases and more than 4,000 deaths. I didn’t realize, though, how yellow fever continued to appear year after year. 
Physicians had a basic understanding of bacteria after the Civil War, but they didn’t recognize viruses, which proved to be the cause of yellow fever, until later in the 1900s. One popular theory suggested yellow fever spread on fomites—inanimate surfaces—like bedding, clothing and furniture. Panic often followed news of a yellow fever outbreak. Health officials established quarantines, closed roads, river ports and train stations, hoping to curb the spread of infections. 
The fear of what was not known then about yellow fever reminded me of the early days of the COVID pandemic when fear spread through rumors and unconfirmed anecdotes on social media. 
***
Sallie’s sisters and brothers in Orwood soon developed the same symptoms as Sallie. By September, 30-plus people in Taylor and Orwood showed signs of the disease and new cases were reported outside the local area. In response, three interstate railroads shut down and Memphis halted train traffic coming into the city. In Starkville, the president of Mississippi A&M (now Mississippi State University) posted a column of guards along its roads. In mid-October, officials placed all of Mississippi under quarantine as thousands fled the state. 
Months earlier, the governor of Mississippi, recognizing the heavy toll yellow fever often brought to his state, had sent a team of Board of Health physicians to Cuba, the center for yellow fever research. There the group met with Dr. Walter Reed, the Army physician directing the American research interests on the island. Reed pursued a theory that mosquitos transmitted the disease, but his experiments to establish that link repeatedly failed. The Mississippi team, including Dr. Henry Gant, a Water Valley doctor, returned home, still hopeful that science could soon solve the yellow fever mystery.
Gant immediately responded when he learned about the outbreak in Taylor. So did Dr. Henry Rose Carter, a field epidemiologist who served as the quarantine officer at Ship Island and who investigated yellow fever outbreaks throughout the South. 
Committed to the same rigorous scientific process that epidemiologists use today, Carter looked for patterns in how diseases spread within clusters of people. With yellow fever, he needed to identify the first person to develop the disease in a specific area and then trace everybody and everything that the person came into contact with.  
Over and over again, unreliable sources or conflicting pieces of data prevented Carter from finding a pattern. People, suspicious of government intervention and scared of the consequences of yellow fever, often distorted the truth. 
Fortunately for us today, the people of Orwood proved to be different. The people, Carter wrote, were “honest enough to tell the truth” and cooperated with efforts to trace the infection of each case.
Working with Carter, Gant moved from house to house in Orwood, instructing families to quarantine at home, though their natural inclination was to care for their neighbors. He also questioned each person, recording data for Gant’s analysis. 
Unlike diseases that produce low-grade fevers, an abrupt and high fever often characterizes a case of yellow fever. For that reason, many of the people Gant interviewed reported the day their infections started and also the time their fevers ignited: Mr. G. W. McMillan, sickened on Aug. 29 at noon.  Mrs. Rogers, Sept. 4, 10:00 am. 
Collecting this detailed information about time proved essential for Carter’s study and he cheered Gant’s ability to gather such reliable data. “A greater tribute to the good faith of the community, or to its confidence in Dr. Gant, can scarcely be given,” he wrote. 
Studying the Orwood data, Carter recognized a consistent time interval between cases, about two weeks between the first case and the development of secondary cases. This meant that the infection did not immediately spread from person-to-person but required time to incubate. He called this the period of extrinsic incubation.
I’ve read Carter’s scientific report with the results of the Orwood study, the same report that persuaded Walter Reed to alter his experimental process. Waiting 10-14 days before introducing infected mosquitos to healthy volunteers, Reed successfully demonstrated the transmission of yellow fever from mosquito to human. 
With the development of mosquito control procedures, the fever soon vanished in the U.S. and Caribbean. Today a vaccine can protect those travelling or living where the disease remains a threat.
***
Sallie and her siblings were among the lucky, surviving their infections with only lingering weakness and fatigue. When frosts fell in north Mississippi in early November 1898, the number of fever cases quickly fell. In total, officials confirmed 2,478 cases across the state. Those who died totaled 114.
Reed later acknowledged that the “work in Mississippi did more to impress me with the importance of an intermediate host in yellow fever than everything else put together.”

My husband and I drove from our home in Oxford to Taylor and then Orwood on a hot muggy day in August, probably experiencing the same weather conditions as Sallie. Orwood is a ghost town today, but we found the cemetery where Sallie’s uncle is buried, adjacent to the wood-planked Presbyterian Church that still stands. 
Walking those grounds emphasized for me what the neighbors who once lived in Orwood taught us. Honesty and rigorous scientific inquiry — and not political rhetoric or unproven claims — are the tools we must trust to combat disease and dispel fear.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Alaska’s seafood industry, squeezed by depressed fish prices and increased costs, is in a crisis. Also in a crisis is the Alaska state budget, with both investment income and oil revenues in sharp decline.
That presents a dilemma for lawmakers trying to find ways to help the beleaguered seafood industry. What can they do to boost the industry’s fortunes at a time when they are staring down a big budget deficit?
Some bills are pending in the Legislature that aim to aid fishers, the industry and the communities that depend on seafood harvests. Those include bills responding directly to recommendations made by a legislative task force that worked for several months prior to the session’s start.
As to which bills are likely to pass this year and which might have to wait until 2026, one task force member had a succinct answer.
“The ones that don’t cost money,” Sen. Bert Stedman, R-Sitka, who is also a co-chair of the Senate Finance Committee, said in an interview last week. “This year is a very difficult year to have legislation that has expenditures with it.”
Task force bills working their way through the Legislature appear to fit Stedman’s description.
One bill that has already passed the House is aimed at providing fishers better access to insurance.
The House passed the measure, House Bill 116, on April 25. The Senate Labor and Commerce Committee has scheduled the bill for a hearing on May 9.
It would allow commercial fishers to establish their own insurance pools, providing a new option for harvesters coping with sharply rising insurance premiums. Three such pools already exist for Alaska fishing organizations, but they are managed in Washington state.
Rep. Louise Stutes, R-Kodiak, said that bill may have the best chance of passing this session among all the pending seafood bills. 
The bill has an especially appealing feature, said Stutes, seafood industry task force member and chair of the House Fisheries Committee: It would impose no new costs on the state. “We’re having trouble paying our bills as it is now,” she said on Wednesday.
A second measure, House Bill 129, and its counterpart, Senate Bill 130, proposes to modify the state’s existing tax credit program aimed at promoting the development of fisheries products. The legislation would expand eligibility for the tax credits.
A problem raised by industry members during the task force meeting was what they considered to be an overly restrictive set of qualifications for the tax credits.
The credit program allows companies to offset state taxes with up to 50% of their total investments in equipment and property used to create value-added seafood products. As of now, the program is limited to equipment used on a single species from a limited set of specific types of fish: salmon, herring, pollock, sablefish and Pacific cod. The changes proposed in the bill would expand that eligibility to all types of seafood, including shellfish. Through that change, it would allow product development investment credits to be applied for purchases of equipment used on multiple fish species.
 

  Senate President Gary Stevens, R-Kodiak, Rep. Louise Stutes, R-Kodiak, and Rep. Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham, listen at a Nov. 13, 2024, hearing in Anchorage to testimony about problems facing the Alaska seafood industry. Stevens chairs the Joint Legislative Task Force Evaluating Alaska’s Seafood Industry, established earlier in the year, and Stutes and Edgmon are members. The task force made recommendations in a report issued at the start of this year’s legislative session, and several bills have resulted from those recommendations.

	The bill would add refrigeration and cooling systems to the list of equipment that qualifies for the investment credit. And it would extend the investment credit’s sunset date from Jan. 1, 2027, the current end date of the program, to Jan. 1, 2040.
Though it would not require direct spending from the state, the proposal is not without costs. According to the fiscal note prepared by the Department of Revenue, it would mean a loss in state revenues ranging from about $1 million in the coming year to over $4 million in 2030.
Both the House and Senate versions of the bill were pending in those bodies’ finance committees as of this week.
A bill aimed at helping fishing communities would increase cities’ or boroughs’ share of the fisheries tax revenues that are currently split between the state and local governments. The measure, Senate Bill 135, proposes replacing the current even split with varying percentages, up to 75% for local governments, depending on where fish are landed or processed. It also proposes a sliding scale for revenue sharing with newly created municipalities or boroughs.
The bill, currently pending in the Senate Finance Committee, is crafted with the purpose of helping communities maintain and repair harbors and other facilities needed by the seafood industry. While it would mean a reduction in state revenues in the short term, the bill could wind up generating more revenue for local and state government in the long term by improving infrastructure, supporters say.
“Acknowledging a more fair balance of sharing the fisheries tax revenue with the communities that most directly affect generating the fisheries tax revenue is in the interest of the State. By reinvesting tax revenue into local infrastructure, we can strengthen coastal economies, support the seafood industry, and promote long-term resilience,” the sponsor statement said.
A fourth bill would shore up the Alaska Commercial Fishing and Agriculture Bank, a member-owned cooperative that has lost business to the state-operated Commercial Fishing Revolving Loan Fund.
The bill seeks to “Help keep financing options open and available for Alaska’s businesses, Alaska small family businesses,” said Sen. Jesse Kiehl, D-Juneau, one of the task force members. Kiehl, speaking at Tuesday’s Senate majority caucus news conference, said Senate Bill 156, if passed, will help the Alaska Commercial Fishing and Agriculture Bank survive “and make sure that those who take a risk and go into business, on Alaska waters harvesting our seafood, have access to the capital they need so that more of the permits don’t migrate outside.”
Additional bills face opposition
Two other pending seafood bills, both introduced by Gov. Mike Dunleavy and not resulting from the seafood industry task force, face an uncertain future.
One measure, numbered House Bill 135 and Senate Bill 131, would expand the duties of the Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute to include mariculture products like oysters and kelp.
Although that idea was discussed in the task force meetings held in the months preceding the start of the legislative session, it was not among the recommendations in the group’s final report.
Many mariculture industry members oppose the idea, arguing that they prefer to manage their own marketing efforts and that they cannot spare the money to contribute to more generic ASMI campaigns.
Stutes said there seems to be a split in the industry, with kelp harvesters more positive about the idea and shellfish farmers more opposed. But as long as significant opposition exists, the state cannot move forward with the proposed expansion of ASMI’s duties, she said.
“We’ve got to have that come from the stakeholders rather than from us,” she said. “We’ll continue having a conversation, but I don’t see it going anywhere in the near future.”

	The other seafood bill introduced by the governor would allow finfish farming in the state, reversing a decades-old ban. The idea has been panned by fishers and by lawmakers representing fishing communities.
The House version, House Bill 111, got a single hearing in Stutes’ committee on April 10. The Senate version, Senate Bill 108, got a single hearing on March 10 in the Senate Resources Committee.
“It’s not going anywhere,” Stutes said. “We gave it a perfunctory hearing just so the administration could hear that Alaskans are not ready for this. “
Aside from the targeted seafood industry bills, lawmakers are seeking to increase ASMI’s funding. The pending budget includes a $10 million boost in funding, to be used over three years. The state agency relies on industry contributions as well as state appropriations to promote Alaska seafood in domestic and international markets.
Stutes said that even though Dunleavy vetoed last year’s lawmaker-approved $10 million injection into ASMI, she believes he will support this year’s funding increase.
“I think that the administration and the governor recognize how important it is,” she said. Dunleavy traveled in March to the Seafood Expo in Boston, she noted. “And I think that he really had an opportunity to recognize how important ASMI is and what they are able to do with the minimum amount of funding.”
Other seafood-producing nations spend much more on marketing than ASMI, she added.
The Legislature’s work on seafood comes at a time when Trump administration policies are anticipated to make the Alaska industry’s plight even worse.
Tariffs were repeatedly brought up as a concern at task force meetings, with virtually all of the comments expressing fears about impact to Alaska’s seafood industry, Stevens said at the news conference.
“It can be pretty horrendous,” he said.
About 70% of Alaska’s seafood is sent to other countries. China, the nation most pointedly targeted by the Trump tariffs, is the top export destination for Alaska seafood.
Stutes said she does not know of any tariff impacts that have hit the industry yet, but she is fully expecting them as fishing seasons get underway. “I cannot imagine that they’re going to get anything but worse, because we send a lot of H&G fish to China to be reprocessed,” she said, referring to the abbreviations for headed and gutted, the first step in processing.
Many companies’ business models are based on sending such fish to China, she said.
The Trump administration’s deep cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration are also a big problem for the Alaska seafood industry, lawmakers said. NOAA’s National Marine Fisheries Service provides the information needed to know when fisheries should open and close, Stevens said. And NOAA’s National Weather Service provides information that fishers need to stay safe.
“Fishermen and processors are very concerned about where things are going,” he said.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/DSC07883-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-02 15:12:12.501265

(Photo by Manuel Balce Ceneta-Pool/Getty Images)Countless elected officials in Colorado must consider themselves vulnerable to personal legal liability and even arrest, based on the Trump administration’s dramatic escalation this week of immigration enforcement tactics.
Administration officials have shown that there is no limit — and certainly no limit imposed by the Constitution — to the methods they’ll pursue to undertake mass deportations. Since almost the beginning of President Donald Trump’s second term, federal immigration authorities have acted with impatience or disregard for due process and court rulings. The most visible victims of this abuse of power have been immigrants, including some who were living in the U.S. legally but were deported anyway.
But now public officials are coming under attack, including leaders in elected office in Colorado, based on an executive order Trump signed Monday. The language in the executive order is wildly hostile. It frames the actions of targeted individual officials — not just jurisdictions — as crimes. Their efforts “often violate federal criminal laws, including those prohibiting obstruction of justice, harboring or hiring illegal aliens, conspiring against the United States, and impeding federal law enforcement.” One passage accuses some “state and local officials” of engaging in “a lawless insurrection” against the U.S. government.

That’s an exceedingly serious accusation.
Sarah Parady, an at-large member of the Denver City Council, presumably is in the ambit of the executive order. She also has an informed perspective on it, since she is a lawyer who has litigated constitutional matters and once clerked for a federal judge in the Denver-based 10th Circuit Court of Appeals. Given the nature of the Trump administration, she had anticipated the kind of threats directed at officials like her that are contained in the order.
“I think weaponized prosecutions are just part of the authoritarian playbook. They always go in that direction, and they always use that against whomever their political enemies are, and that’s what this is about,” she said.
The development gives new urgency, in addition to the general emergency the MAGA agenda presents in the state, to resistance activities throughout Colorado, especially in cities like Denver that immigration extremists label a “sanctuary.”
The executive order directs Pam Bondi, Trump’s attorney general, and Kristi Noem, his secretary of Homeland Security, to publish a list of states and cities they determine are “sanctuary jurisdictions.” It is all but certain Denver will make the list, since the Trump administration has already singled it out for retribution. The administration has already yanked $24 million in grants for Denver over the city’s purported sanctuary policies. In March, Republicans hauled Denver Mayor Mike Johnston before a U.S. House Oversight Committee hearing to answer for what they claimed, largely through misinformation, were “obstructionist policies” around federal immigration enforcement. One of Colorado’s own Republican members of Congress, Gabe Evans has declared that “Denver and Colorado are sanctuary jurisdictions.”
Anti-immigration zealots view several Denver policies as providing improper assistance to immigrants — what local officials would characterize as commonsense, safety-promoting, humane measures — such as a 2017 ordinance that enacted restrictions on local cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. 
There’s every reason to take the executive order seriously. The administration has undertaken its immigration enforcement with evident contempt for constitutional limits, and its efforts have landed hundreds of people — who were afforded minimal or no due process, including U.S. citizens and permanent residents — in detention. Some ended up in a notoriously brutal prison in El Salvador, from which they might never be able to leave. Federal agents recently arrested a Wisconsin judge they claim obstructed immigration officials who wanted to detain a man in the judge’s courtroom.
An actual prosecution against an official like Parady or other Denver officeholders might be unlikely, because obstruction and other statutes the Trump administration suggests they’ve violated do not plausibly cover actions they’ve taken. To make an arrest, federal law enforcement officials would need to establish probable cause and obtain a warrant signed by a judge, Parady noted. That would constitute a strong check on abuse of the legal system.
But the threat of arrests does its own damage.
“It’s an effort to chill the speech and even the votes, or actions in the interest of our constituents, of elected leadership,” Parady said. “I can hardly imagine anything more dangerous to the politics of the country than trying to basically … terrorize your political opponents. But I am not terrorized by this.”
She added that Denver elected officials “just need to keep doing our jobs on behalf of the people that elected us.”
The executive order is not just an assault on public officials. More importantly, it’s an act of oppression against the people, including immigrant residents, of Denver and Colorado.
The laws of the city and state are the people’s laws, and public officials are the people’s representatives. Local statutes and ordinances were adopted according to the people’s will, and an authority that thwarts it through unconstitutional maneuvers amounts to a menace that is the people’s ultimate responsibility to defeat.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The fate of more than 15 million customers’ genetic data remains in limbo after popular DNA testing company 23andMe filed for bankruptcy in March. The data is up for sale, stoking fears about how it might be used and prompting attorneys general from more than a dozen states to warn 23andMe users: Delete your data.
“Your genetic data is your most personal, confidential data, and you should be able to protect who has access to it,” North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson, a Democrat, said in a March statement.
“You have the power to delete your data now — please act quickly.”
Dr. Adam Brown, a Washington, D.C.-based emergency physician and the founder of a health care strategy firm, deleted his information on 23andMe as soon as he learned of the bankruptcy filing, he told Stateline.
For him, the bankruptcy begs a vital question that federal and state laws don’t fully address: What happens to your genetic data when the company holding it collapses?
Federal protections are flimsy. States have beefed up their genetic privacy laws in recent years, but many experts say they don’t go far enough.


There actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.


– Dr. Adam Brown, emergency physician and founder of a health care strategy company


23andMe has said the bankruptcy will not change how it stores, manages or protects its trove of sensitive customer information. In a news release issued shortly after the bankruptcy announcement, the company said any potential buyers would have to agree to comply with 23andMe’s consumer privacy policy and all applicable laws. When contacted by Stateline, the company declined to comment beyond what it has published in news releases and information it posted for customers on its website.
But once the data is in the hands of another company, that company could change its privacy policy at any time, experts noted.
“Once you get to the point of bankruptcy court, there may not be those same guarantees or the same ethos a new company may have around privacy protections for consumers,” Brown said.
“I want people to understand there actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.”
HIPAA doesn’t help
Companies such as 23andMe offer their users potentially game-changing revelations about their health and ancestry. The process is simple: Mail in a saliva sample and the company uses it to build an individual genetic profile that can reveal not only a person’s family connections, but also health insights such as their risk of developing a disease like cancer or Alzheimer’s.
This valuable personal data underpins a direct-to-customer genetic testing market that was valued at $1.93 billion globally in 2023 and is expected to grow, according to market research firm Grand View Research.
23andMe was an industry giant until its stock price plummeted following a massive 2023 data breach that affected the accounts of nearly 7 million customers. Then came the $30 million class-action lawsuit settlement.
The company declared bankruptcy in late March of this year, and announced it’s up for sale.

A flurry of alerts from state attorneys general around the country soon followed. AGs from states including Alabama, Arizona, California, Kentucky, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Texas issued similar press releases that recommended customers ask the company to delete their genetic profile and destroy the saliva sample used to create it.
“We have robust state privacy laws that include data deletion rights, and I would encourage any Texan concerned about their data to exercise the right to have their data securely deleted,” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, said in an April statement.
The fear is that a new 23andMe owner could choose to use or share sensitive personal genetic data in ways the company’s current privacy policy doesn’t allow. There’s worry it could be used, for example, to inflate people’s life insurance premiums or expose them to employment discrimination.
And there aren’t many guardrails to prevent that from happening.
HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, doesn’t apply to companies like 23andMe. The landmark federal law protects patients’ sensitive health information when it’s handled by doctors, hospitals and health insurers. But direct-to-customer companies such as 23andMe or Ancestry aren’t considered health care providers, and their non-invasive saliva collection kit isn’t considered a medical test.
The main federal law that protects people from discrimination based on their genetic information is nearly 20 years old. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) was passed in 2008, long before the rise of at-home testing kits. It applies to employers and health insurers, but not to life insurance companies, mortgage lenders and other non-health entities. And it doesn’t explicitly protect epigenetic information, which is information about the way a person’s genes — and by extension, health — are affected by outside factors such as smoking, disease or stress.
What states are doing
In the past five years, at least 14 states have passed laws regulating direct-to-consumer genetic testing offered by companies like Ancestry and 23andMe. There’s variation, but generally the laws require companies to get customers’ express consent before using or sharing their data, and allow customers to request their genetic data be deleted and biological samples destroyed.
It’s a good start, but doesn’t go far enough, said Anya Prince, a University of Iowa law professor whose research focuses on health and genetic privacy.
Many of those state efforts were built around a model law developed by the Coalition for Genetic Data Protection, an industry group with two member companies: 23andMe and Ancestry.

As DNA testing kits exploded in popularity and attracted increased scrutiny from lawmakers, the coalition pushed to influence legislation and set industry standards. The privacy protections in the laws mirror what 23andMe and Ancestry were already doing with their own privacy policies, experts say.
“They do have some really sensible privacy protections,” said Prince. “It’s great that people can delete their genetic data, and it’s great that law enforcement needs a warrant to access it. But if a privacy advocate had written a model law, there would be the potential for more and broader protections.”
For example, she said, many of the state laws address privacy requirements just for direct-to-consumer DNA testing companies. If 23andMe’s data is bought by, say, a pharmaceutical company, those state laws no longer apply.
The coalition now appears to be inactive, its website defunct.
Since 2020, more than a dozen states have passed some version of a genetic information privacy law, including Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming, based on a Stateline analysis. This year, the Indiana legislature passed a bill that’s now headed to the governor’s desk. Bills have been introduced this year in other states, including West Virginia.
Prince said state laws rely too heavily on consumers to self-manage their data privacy. They’re expected to understand a company’s policy, when studies have shown the public often doesn’t read privacy notices nor fully understand how companies use their data. Further, many state laws don’t address how third parties, such as law enforcement, can access and use consumer genetic data.
It’s also not always clear how the laws will be enforced, or who’s responsible for oversight.
“In general, I think there’s a disconnect between how people think their privacy is protected and how it’s actually protected,” she said.
But a few states have enacted laws that are more robust. California, for example, has a genetic information privacy law, but also has a general data protection law, as well as a state version of the federal GINA law that extends genetic anti-discrimination protections into areas including housing, education and licensing.
Florida has beefed up its DNA privacy laws in recent years, making the using or selling of an individual’s DNA without informed consent a felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison and up to a $10,000 fine. Florida was also the first state to prohibit life, disability and long-term care insurance companies from using genetic information to determine coverage.

One month since the Trump administration shut down a resilience funding program, communities dependent on the money for major infrastructure projects are still reeling.
The post Without FEMA resilience money, Mass. communities scramble to save flood prevention projects appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","WHEN THE AXE FELL on $882 million in federal funding aimed at helping communities prepare for future flooding, it came paired with a critique of the program’s very purpose. The Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program “was yet another example of a wasteful and ineffective FEMA program,” an unidentified FEMA spokesperson wrote in a press release on April 4. “It was more concerned with political agendas than helping Americans affected by natural disasters.” Emily Granoff, Chelsea’s deputy director of housing community and development, was assisting another community with smaller scale grant work before the BRIC cuts were announced. Seeing the news, that community reached out to see if their funding was impacted, and Granoff assured them that it wasn’t.  But Chelsea and Everett had money on the line – a $120 million flood resilience project for the Island End River that included a storm surge barrier, storm surge control facility, and wetland restoration set to begin construction in 2026. “And I looked up the press release,” Granoff said. “And then I cried for a bit.” The local toll wouldn’t be felt fully for two weeks, when Massachusetts estimated that some $90 million in funding and potential grants would be pulled, almost $50 million of which was dedicated to the Chelsea and Everett endeavor. Overnight, project managers overseeing resilient park and stormwater flooding projects, updating drinking water and watershed regulations, and preparing for the best ways to hold rising waters at bay rushed to triage. Granoff was among them, as the project manager for Chelsea in a partnership with Everett. Roughly between and beneath the ground of the two Gateway Cities – historically industrial midsized urban centers – passes the Island End River. This tributary to the Mystic River generates dramatic flooding during serious coastal storms, sending feet of water rushing over the nearby roadways, commercial, and industrial sites. The risk of worsening storm surges is difficult to overstate, Granoff said as she walked the border of the proposed project site on an 80-degree April afternoon, bright sun bouncing off of gleaming high-tide waters and discarded glass and plastic bottles around the spot where the river dips into a massive culvert to pass beneath the city. An illustration of the how a storm tide interacts with a shore, from the Island End River project page.By 2081, the kind of 1-in-100-year storm surge events proportional to Hurricane Sandy could be annual occurrences, according to a 2022 study from the Woodwell Climate Research Center.  Within the 2070 flood risk zone sits Chelsea High School, a Market Basket, Route 1, Route 16, commuter rail and freight rail tracks, a Federal Bureau of Investigation building, and the New England Produce Center that distributes produce to 8 million people across the Northeast. “Basically 10 years ago, the cities of Everett and Chelsea were evaluating their flood vulnerability and found that Island End River was a huge one – not just for us, but for those 8 million people and for anyone who drives into Boston from the North Shore,” Granoff said. “Because all those roads are gonna get flooded out in a coastal storm rain. It’s not really feasible to move Route 1 or Route 16. It’s not feasible to move the New England Produce Center. So we just gotta protect it.” A view of expected flooding in Chelsea and Everett, with the proposed storm surge barrier outlined. Map courtesy City of Chelsea.When Chelsea and Everett were built out in the 18th and 19th centuries, wetlands became the site of a heavily industrial district full of critical infrastructure. Defending that infrastructure, planners determined over the past decade, will require a barrier to prevent water from coming up out of the culvert beneath the island and out of the river around the island and spilling into its old riverbed and marshland path.  Part of the solution is a 3,000 square-foot, $42 million underground storm surge control facility would sink 8 to ten feet below ground and rise 6 to 8 feet above ground next to the small M&T bank building near the outlets of the Market and Beacham Street culverts. Because the river passes physically beneath the area through the culvert, an above-ground storm barrier that stops water from washing over the land wouldn’t stop the surge from blasting through the large culvert tunnel and flooding out through storm drains. So, the control facility would manage the flow of water under Chelsea and Everett while the barrier keeps most of the water from flowing over the cities. The storm barrier would avoid crossing freight rail tracks in Everett, roughly following the path of existing fencing. (Photo by Jennifer Smith)Walking along the path of where the 4,460 linear-foot storm surge barrier – a wall occasionally broken up by gates to allow people and vehicles to pass though when the area isn’t flooding – would go involves weaving in and around city and private land. The path of the barrier has changed over the years, to accommodate issues like avoiding crossing rail tracks or making sure the water-dependent businesses along the port can access the water on which they depend.  On the Everett side, the barrier would wind around commercial sites to higher ground, ending roughly where 2070 estimates expect just a foot of flooding in intense storm events – annoying but manageable. On the Chelsea side, they plan to create a new high ground where the barrier can taper off behind a revamped riverwalk and restored salt marsh that are part of the 18,000 square feet of nature-based resilience improvements that include wetland upgrades. A boardwalk in Chelsea would be raised and upgraded alongside revived salt marsh, including the removal of tall invasive plants. (Photo by Jennifer Smith)The Island End River project was the largest chunk of the $90 million in Bay State BRIC cuts, but the impact sprawls from Eastern to Western Massachusetts.  “The Trump Administration has suddenly ripped the rug out from under cities and towns that had been promised funding to help them upgrade their roads, bridges, buildings and green spaces to mitigate risk and prevent disasters in the future,” Gov. Maura Healey said in April. “This makes our communities less safe and will increase costs for residents, municipalities and businesses.” In dramatically re-orienting the US federal agency responsible for coordinating the country’s disaster relief efforts, the Trump administration cancelled all BRIC applications from Fiscal Years 2020-2023, imperiling states from New England to the Gulf Coast. Any undistributed funds would be immediately returned either to the Disaster Relief Fund or the US Treasury, according to FEMA. Two major Boston resilience projects – Moakley Park in South Boston and Tenean Beach in Dorchester – are either having millions in funding pulled or grant applications cancelled. Funding for culvert projects in Acton, Brockton, Grafton, North Adams, and Taunton also got the axe.  More than two dozen Democratic congresspeople sent a letter to the acting FEMA administrator on April 23, urging the administration to reconsider the cuts.  “Ending the FEMA BRIC program is a terrible mistake and marks a huge setback for many climate-vulnerable cities and towns in my district,” wrote US Rep. Seth Moulton, who helmed the letter.  Newburyport mayor Sean Reardon noted that the town was expecting to receive a BRIC grant protect its watershed and drinking water supply, but “will now need to find other resources to do this important work.” An irony, project proponents point out, is slicing away BRIC funding in the interests of shrinking the budget could cut the other way. Projects must go through a cost-benefit analysis to compare the upsides of a resilience project to what it would cost to build. If disaster washes up to a municipality’s doors because of flooding, FEMA gets the call and bears the cost. At least, that’s how the system has worked for decades, but Trump in March signed an executive order directing state and local governments to “play a more active and significant role” in resilience and preparedness. The administration has since denied some federal funding to disaster-struck areas.  A project is considered cost-effective by FEMA when the ratio of future risk reduction benefits to its cost is 1 or greater. The Everett and Chelsea project’s ratio, which would include over $3.6 billion in protection of high-risk assets according to filings, is more than 38.  But without the FEMA funding, the math looks bleak.  Along with the $50 million BRIC funding, the cities expected to contribute $10 million in combined local funds. Planners have been working with the state to secure $45 million in funding and seeking the remaining $14.8 million through additional state and private foundation grants. “We’ve had warning signs and storms where we’ve seen how disruptive it can be to have even a foot or two of flooding,” Granoff said, standing alongside a main drag that sees a thousand trucks a day roll through with produce and other goods, just a two minute walk from the culvert.  “And that was one of the great things about this project, was that we were gonna prevent it from ever happening. We saw a risk, and we all agreed it was a risk, and we were gonna say we can fix this.” They are looking at whether it would be possible to break the project into pieces, but Chelsea and Everett are communities with a higher proportion of low-income residents, without the budget for projects of this scale.  “Municipalities aren’t built to do this kind of huge infrastructure project,” Granoff said. “But even with all that, we were gonna do it. We’ll still have to do it.” The post Without FEMA resilience money, Mass. communities scramble to save flood prevention projects appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0805-scaled.jpeg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-02 10:07:33.454458

The post Massachusetts has a literacy problem. We ignore it at our peril. appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","THE LATEST RESULTS of the National Assessment of Educational Progress, known as the “nation’s report card,” on our students’ achievement in reading and math were sobering, but not surprising. We are being heralded by Massachusetts education policymakers for being #1 in the nation in terms of academic achievement. But Massachusetts also holds the cringeworthy distinction of having the second largest achievement gap between rich and poor students, a gap that has widened since 2019. In spite of 30 years of reform efforts and tens of billions of dollars in increased spending, we are still only “#1 for some.” Six out of every ten children in Massachusetts cannot read or do math at grade level. Eight out of ten low-income, Black and Latino children are not performing at grade level, leaving our state as a national leader in producing reading gaps for our Black and Hispanic students. Only half of white children are proficient. Needless to say, we should not be proud of our performance. Parents should be outraged, but recent surveys conducted by the MassINC Polling Group indicate that they are generally satisfied with their children’s education. It will take bold leadership at the state and local levels to expose our accelerating achievement gaps and build support for changing literacy instruction to improve outcomes for the students who need it most. (MassInc Polling Group is partly owned by MassINC, the publisher of CommonWealth Beacon.) Massachusetts is one of only 10 states that does not mandate evidence-based reading practices in schools. Additionally, the Commonwealth’s teacher prep programs are not preparing our new teachers with the skills to teach reading effectively. Almost 70% of the state’s higher education preparation programs are teaching practices that run counter to the research about what works best for students. It is as though an alarm keeps ringing, yet we keep hitting snooze. As the ringing gets louder, the stakes get higher, and still our children wait for the adults in our state to wake up and act. Not learning how to read has lifelong consequences. Students who are not reading at grade level by the time they reach fourth grade are four times more likely to drop out of high school which in turn leads to additional challenges for them as adults: lower lifetime earnings, higher rates of unemployment, and a higher likelihood of entering the criminal justice system. The impact of low literacy rates in our state will have sweeping economic and social consequences.  Massachusetts is being outpaced by Louisiana, Mississippi and Tennessee — states that have mandated curriculum changes as a requisite for additional funding. These states are seeing a rebound in literacy scores, while Massachusetts students are falling further behind. Since 2013, we have seen a 71% increase in education spending to an average of $24,900 per student. Yet our children’s reading scores are significantly lower. If what we are buying isn’t working, shouldn’t we shift this investment to a proven method of teaching literacy? Legislation recently filed (SD.1761 / HD.2329) — the “Right to Read Act” filed by Assistant Senate Majority Leader Sen. Sal DiDomenico (D-Everett), Rep. Danillo Sena (D-Acton), and Rep. Simon Cataldo (D-Concord) — would create a comprehensive framework for early literacy instruction, as well as implement the best, evidence-based solutions to improve children’s reading levels. This would be done via providing pre-service training and professional development, offering assessment and parental notification, improving instruction and curriculum, and instituting tiered in-class and out-of-class intervention. It would also better support teachers’ capacity from teacher preparation to when they become solely responsible for their own classrooms, require high-quality curriculum materials aligned with the best science, and mandate support for students with dyslexia and multilingual students.  Governor Healey’s FY26 budget includes increased funding ($25M) for her Literacy Launch initiative, a multi-year program that provides districts with funding for high-quality, evidence-based reading instruction through literacy materials, technical support, coaching and professional development for educators. The Governor is also requesting funding ($25M) for high-dosage tutoring to build students’ early literacy skills. Parents support science-based reading instruction — 8 out of 10 parents believe Massachusetts schools should be required to use evidence-based reading curricula. Our coalition includes parents, former teachers, researchers and advocates across our Commonwealth. Our children attend our public schools. We care deeply about our state. It’s time to awaken from our slumber and act with urgency to improve reading results.  Our children’s future depends on us.  The Mass Reads Coalition is a group of educators, parents, literacy experts, and policy advocates that supports “Right to Read” legislation that would require school districts to use “evidence based” literacy curricula.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)Government cost-cutting led by billionaire Elon Musk spurred a 2022 Democratic U.S. Senate candidate to jump back into the electoral arena.
Brian Bengs announced this week that he plans to run in the 2026 election, this time as an independent, for the seat held by Republican U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds. Sioux Falls businessman Julian Beaudion is seeking the Democratic nomination.
Bengs said his previous run as a Democrat was out of character.
“The bulk of my life I’ve been an independent,” Bengs told South Dakota Searchlight, noting that he only registered as a Democrat in 2022 to earn the organizational and fundraising advantage of party alignment. 
Bengs came in second in the three-way race for U.S. Senate that year. Republican Sen. John Thune, who’s since become majority leader, got 70% of the vote, Bengs collected 26%, and Libertarian Tamara Lesnar pulled 4%.
There had been “people telling me to run” against Rounds in 2026 for quite a while, Bengs said, but “a switched flipped” when Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) came for his job.
Sioux Falls business owner and former state trooper announces Democratic bid for U.S. Senate

The former Northern State University professor and retired U.S. Air Force lieutenant colonel had moved to Hot Springs and taken a “retirement job” as a ranger at Wind Cave National Park. 
In February, DOGE fired “probationary” federal employees – those who hadn’t been on the job at least a year. Court orders later reinstated those employees, though most wound up on administrative leave, not back at work.
Bengs didn’t actually lose his job in the shake-up. No one at Wind Cave did.
“We learned that they had decided they weren’t going to fire veterans,” Bengs said. “I and everybody else were veterans, so we were only spared by virtue of having been in the military.”
That was enough to put Bengs back into political mode. He resigned his position at Wind Cave as of this month.
Bengs told Searchlight he didn’t want to run as a Democrat in 2022, but that “I didn’t have the money to run as an independent.” The party infrastructure opened doors to financing (Bengs ultimately raised about half a million dollars for his 2022 campaign), but it also gave him name recognition and helped him collect a list of potential donors that “wasn’t huge, but it was something.”
“Partisanship is an addictive drug, and it’s a drug we’ve mainlined into our homes,” Bengs said, referencing political media streams. “We get it on a daily basis.”
The small list of donors he collected through his momentary wade through Democratic waters has since grown to a “multi-million” name list, Bengs said Thursday. That’s the list upon which he intends to finance his run this time around.
“If everybody on that list donates even a few dollars, then we’re in the race,” Bengs said.
If elected, Bengs said he wouldn’t caucus with Democrats or Republicans. He’d act as kingmaker, he said, by courting whatever side had a proposal aligning with his values.
“When it’s a closely divided Senate and they want my vote, I’m going to say ‘what’s in it for South Dakota?’” Bengs said.
East River South Dakotans vent, call for action at Sioux Falls political town hall

That would be part of his pitch to the Republicans and independents who might be wary of casting a ballot for a former Democrat. He’d also point out positions like his belief that it’s time to end birthright citizenship. For those on the political left, he’d lean into support for a tax system that “favors work over wealth,” and his disgust with what he sees as the South Dakota delegation’s capitulation to President Donald Trump.
Bengs’ decision to run as an independent strikes Beaudion as opportunistic and as a telling sign. He supported Bengs in 2022 and said the two agree on some issues, but “I always have understood who I am and what I stand for,” Beaudion said.
“My campaign is for the people, and we believe the Democratic Party gives us the best chance to lead people in that way,” Beaudion said. “There has been much more of a steady hand in the Democratic Party.”
Bengs and Beaudion did speak about their respective electoral plans, with Bengs telling Beaudion he didn’t plan to run. That was before DOGE began targeting federal employees, though. 
Both men will appear over the weekend at the Custer County Democratic Party’s $50-per-ticket McGovern Day Rally at Crazy Horse Memorial, as will District 32 state Rep. Nicole Uhre-Balk, D-Rapid City.
Sen. Rounds, in a statement from his campaign staff, responded to Bengs’ announcement by calling him another choice for left-leaning South Dakotans.
“It’s great that the left wing of the Democrat Party will have multiple candidates to choose from,” the statement said.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)In a disaster, service dogs are assigned to search for victims and comfort them. A new bill passed Monday by the Alaska House of Representatives intends to assist those dogs when it’s their turn to need help.
If approved by the Senate and Gov. Mike Dunleavy, House Bill 70 would allow ambulance crews to aid injured these dogs in a crisis and while they’re being transported to a veterinarian.
The aid would be limited to dogs used by law enforcement and those working search and rescue cases. In cases where both people and dogs are injured, the bill requires people to be helped first.
The bill’s sponsor, Rep. Calvin Schrage, I-Anchorage, explained on the House floor that under current law, paramedics and emergency medical technicians are legally forbidden from helping animals while on the job because doing so would be considered veterinary care, which is regulated by law.
An ordinary Alaskan could legally help an injured dog, Schrage explained, but not a trained medical professional.
“These are working dogs that go through serious risk to their safety in order to serve us, to help us be more safe, to be rescued in an emergency, and to be able to provide emergency care on scene, I think, would be an incredible thing,” Schrage said.
The bill was inspired by the death of Alaska State Trooper canine Rico, who was shot and killed during a 2017 police chase in Wasilla.
The House approved HB 70 on a 32-8 vote, with opposition coming from some legislators who cited concerns from veterinarians.
Rep. Rebecca Schwanke, R-Glennallen, said her vote against the bill was for that reason.
“We heard tremendous opposition to this bill by veterinary professionals across our state, largely because it does offer EMS personnel the opportunity to practice emergency veterinary care without proper training,” she said.
House Majority Leader Chuck Kopp, R-Anchorage, referred to his decades of experience as a police officer and said he supported the bill.
“You want the person who is closest to the scene and best able to help save that animal — if the animal is shot or otherwise critically injured — to have a fighting chance,” he said. “These dogs have over $50,000 invested in just the purchase and training of the animal, and hundreds of thousands of dollars to continue to train with the canine officers. They are worth it.”

Since 2021, more than a dozen states have explicitly banned a decades-old literacy teaching method, known as “three-cueing,” that encourages kids to figure out unfamiliar words using context clues such as meaning, sentence structure and visual hints (Michael Loccisano/Getty Images).As states rush to address falling literacy scores, a new kind of education debate in state legislatures is taking hold: not whether reading instruction needs fixing, but how to fix it.
More than a dozen states have enacted laws banning public school educators from teaching youngsters to read using an approach that’s been popular for decades. The method, known as “three-cueing,” encourages kids to figure out unfamiliar words using context clues such as meaning, sentence structure and visual hints.
In the past two years, several states have instead embraced instruction rooted in what’s known as the “science of reading.” That approach leans heavily on phonics — relying on letter and rhyming sounds to read words such as cat, hat and rat.
The policy discussions on early literacy are unfolding against a backdrop of alarming national reading proficiency levels. The 2024 Nation’s Report Card revealed that 40% of fourth graders and 33% of eighth graders scored below the basic reading level — the highest percentages in decades.
No state improved in fourth- or eighth-grade reading in 2024. Eight states — Alaska, Arizona, Delaware, Florida, Nebraska, Nevada, Utah and Vermont — scored worse than they did a year or two prior in eighth-grade reading.
Five — Arizona, Florida, Nebraska, South Dakota and Vermont — saw dips in their fourth-grade reading scores.
In response to these troubling trends, a growing number of states are moving beyond localized efforts and tackling literacy through statewide legislation.
New Jersey last year mandated universal K-3 literacy screenings. Indiana lawmakers this month passed a bill that would allow some students to retake required reading tests before being held back in third grade; that bill is en route to the governor’s desk.
Oregon and Washington are weighing statewide literacy coaching and training models, while lawmakers in Montana introduced a bill to allow literacy interventions to cover broader reading and academic skills, not just early reading basics.
Mississippi, a state seen as a model for turnaround in literacy rates over the past decade, seeks to expand and require evidence-based reading interventions, mandatory literacy screenings and targeted teacher training, and to explicitly ban the use of three-cueing methods in reading instruction in grades 4-8.
Bills prohibiting a three-cueing system model of reading instruction have been introduced in Missouri but haven’t gotten much traction. The idea was added to a sweeping education bill focused on open enrollment, but that bill stalled in the Missouri Senate.
Together, these efforts signal a national shift: States are treating literacy not as a local initiative, but as the foundation of public education policy.
“Literacy is the lever,” said Tafshier Cosby, the senior director of the Center for Organizing and Partnerships at the National Parents Union, an advocacy group. “If states focus on that, we see bipartisan wins. But the challenge is making that a statewide priority, not just a district-by-district hope.”
 ‘It’s the system that needs fixing’

Before he was even sworn in, first-term Georgia Democratic state Sen. RaShaun Kemp, a former teacher and principal, had already drafted a bill to end the use of the three-cueing system in Georgia classrooms.
This month, the final version focused on the science of reading passed the state legislature without a single “no” vote. GOP Gov. Brian Kemp signed a similar bill into law Monday to outlaw three-cueing.
Sen. Kemp said his passion for literacy reform stretches back decades, shaped by experiences tutoring children at a local church as a college student in the early 2000s. It was there, he said, that he began noticing patterns in how students struggled with foundational reading.
“In my experience, I saw kids struggle to identify the word they were reading. I saw how some kids were guessing what the word was instead of decoding,” Kemp recalled. “And it’s not technology or screens that’s the problem. It’s what teachers are being instructed on how to teach reading. It’s the system that needs fixing, not the teachers.”
Sen. Kemp’s bill requires the Professional Standards Commission — a state agency that oversees teacher prep and certification — to adopt rules mandating evidence-based reading instruction aligned with the science of reading, a set of practices rooted in decades of cognitive research on how children best learn to read.
“Current strategies used to teach literacy include methods that teach students to guess rather than read, preventing them from reaching their full potential,” Sen. Kemp said in a public statement following the bill’s legislative passage. “I know we can be better, and I’m proud to see our legislative body take much-needed steps to help make Georgia the number one state for literacy.”
In West Virginia, lawmakers have introduced similar bills that would require the state’s teachers to be certified in the science of reading.
Cosby, of the National Parents Union, said local policy changes can be driven by parents even before legislatures act.
“All politics are local,” Cosby said. “Parents don’t need to wait for statewide mandates — they can ask school boards for universal screeners and structured literacy now.”
Still, some parents worry their states are simply funding more studies on early literacy rather than taking direct action to address it.
A Portland, Oregon, parent of three — one of whom has dyslexia — sent written testimony this year urging lawmakers to skip further studies and immediately implement structured literacy statewide.
“We do not need another study to tell us what we already know — structured literacy is the most effective way to teach all children to read, particularly those with dyslexia and other reading challenges,” wrote Katherine Hoffman.
 Opposition to ‘science of reading’

Unlike in Georgia, the “science of reading” has met resistance in other states.
In California, legislation that would require phonics-based reading instruction statewide has faced opposition from English learner advocates who argue that a one-size-fits-all approach may not effectively serve multilingual students.
In opposition to the bill, the California Teachers Association argued that by codifying a rigid definition of the “science of reading,” lawmakers ignore the evolving nature of reading research and undermine teachers’ ability to meet the diverse needs of their students.
“Placing a definition for ‘science of reading’ in statute is problematic,” wrote Seth Bramble, a legislative advocate for the California Teachers Association in a March letter addressed to the state’s Assembly Education Committee. “This bill would carve into stone scientific knowledge that by its very nature is constantly being tested, validated, refuted, revised, and improved.”
Similarly, in Wisconsin, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers in March vetoed a bill that would have reversed changes to the state’s scoring system to align the state’s benchmarks with the National Assessment of Educational Progress, a federal assessment tool that has recently been hit with funding cuts and layoffs under the Trump administration. Evers said in his veto that Republican lawmakers were stepping on the state superintendent’s independence.
That veto is another step in the evolution of a broader constitutional fight over literacy policy and how literacy funds are appropriated and released. In 2023, Wisconsin lawmakers set aside $50 million for a new statewide literacy initiative, but disagreements over legislative versus executive control have stalled its disbursement.
Indiana’s legislature faced criticism from educators over a 2024 mandate requiring 80 hours of literacy training for pre-K to sixth-grade teachers before they can renew their licenses. Teachers argued that the additional requirements were burdensome and did not account for their professional expertise.
In Illinois, literacy struggles have been building for more than a decade, according to Mailee Smith, senior director of policy at the Illinois Policy Institute. Today, only 3 in 10 Illinois third- and fourth-graders can read at grade level, based on state and national assessments.
Although Illinois lawmakers amended the school code in 2023 to create a state literacy plan, Smith noted the plan is only guidance and does not require districts to adopt evidence-based reading instruction. She urged local school boards to act on their own.
“If students can’t read by third grade, half of fourth-grade curriculum becomes incomprehensible,” she said. “A student’s likelihood to graduate high school can be predicted by their reading skill at the end of third grade.”
Despite the challenges, Smith said even small steps can make a real difference.
“Screening, intervention, parental notice, science-based instruction and thoughtful grade promotion — those are the five pillars, and Illinois and even local school districts can implement some of these steps right away,” she said.
“It doesn’t have to be daunting.”

California is home to roughly 187,000 unhoused people. But for every homeless resident, there may be a concerned parent, sibling or offspring wondering where their loved one is, whether they’re in danger and how they’re getting along living on the streets.
Two concerned relatives saw their loved ones quoted in an October CalMatters article and reached out to our own Marisa Kendall for more information. Her story details how they were able to reunite with their relatives in Oakland.
Proponents of reuniting unhoused people with their friends or family say that while reunification does not always lead to someone becoming housed, it does have the potential to save lives when done with the proper support. 
A small number of organizations offer reunification services, such as the San Francisco-based nonprofit Miracle Messages, which helps unhoused clients look for relatives. It also assists people track down homeless family members, and since 2017, the nonprofit has arranged more than 115 of these kinds of reunions. LifeMoves, another nonprofit, also offers reunification services across 17 of its Silicon Valley homeless shelters.
Ashanti Terrell’s father has had a long history of being homeless throughout most of her childhood. Last fall Terrell received a call from a social worker informing her that her father, Ashby Dancy, was in a Texas hospital after trying to make his way to Atlanta, where she was living at the time, to visit her. But after Terrell made early arrangements and called the hospital back, Dancy was gone and no one knew where he went.
Terrell packed up her belongings in Atlanta and moved to the Bay Area to find her father. While looking him up on Google, she came across his name in CalMatters’ story about homeless voting.
Terrell found and began meeting with Dancy after that, checking in on him and offering food during her visits. In April she brought her 7-year-old son along so he could meet his grandfather for the first time.

Terrell, to her father during their meeting: “I just wanted to let you know that I’m here. As soon as I get myself together, I’m going to help you out.”

Feds freeze green money

As part of President Donald Trump’s objective to take back $20 billion in climate and green energy funding, the administration has frozen $250 million in grants to a nonprofit that helps furnish electric trucks at two major Southern California ports, writes CalMatters’ Alejandro Lazo.
Under former President Joe Biden, the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund awarded grants to nonprofits, banks and other groups. That included $250 million to Climate United, which offers affordable leases for electric trucks to small fleets and individual truckers serving the Los Angeles and Long Beach ports. For years, communities living near the ports face noxious fumes from trucks traveling through the ports.
But that money, which would have funded about 500 electric trucks, has been frozen by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. In March Lee Zeldin, the agency’s administrator, said the green energy grant program was “riddled with self-dealing and wasteful spending.”
Climate groups have sued over the frozen cash, arguing that the federal agency and the bank that holds the money, Citibank, are illegally withholding money Congress had already appropriated.

You’re not the only one fighting against your HOA

For two Republican state lawmakers, the battle against homeowners associations isn’t over. 
Last week a bill that would have required California’s roughly 50,000 private homeowners associations, or HOAs, to be more transparent with their decisions and meeting agendas failed its first committee hearing.
The bill was authored by GOP Assemblymember Carl DeMaio of San Diego, but due to a scheduling conflict with a radio-hosting gig, his colleague Assemblymember Joe Patterson of Rocklin presented the measure at the hearing.
Patterson has gripes with his own HOA: He said his HOA demanded he add more landscaping bark around his home, which he did, and that his HOA sent notice that it disapproved of his son’s basketball hoop. Patterson said the “sheer harassment” he receives from his HOA is why he has a large black flag in his legislative office that reads “Defund the HOA.”
Four other Democratic lawmakers voted with Patterson to advance the bill, including the committee’s chairperson, but that wasn’t enough to pass. DeMaio said he would support Patterson’s plan to reintroduce the bill next year.

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Tunde Salaam, in his fifth year of an apprenticeship with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 24, came out to Camden Yards Thursday evening to march for worker justice and against what he sees as the Trump administration’s anti-union policies.
“Worker rights, union rights are under attack,” said Salaam, 34, who said he came to the May Day march “to support my fellow workers” who he said have been hammered by decades of stagnant wages and offshoring of jobs.
But the march that brought hundreds to the stadium was just one of several “feeder marches” that started in different parts of Baltimore and all converged at the Inner Harbor for a citywide rally in recognition the May Day protests. Others marched for schools, for immigrant justice, for Palestine, but they all came together at the Inner Harbor under one premise: To oppose the Trump administration and “stop the billionaire takeover.”
More than 1,000 people gathered at the Baltimore rally, waving protest signs, singing and chanting their opposition to President Donald Trump (R) and billionaire Tesla owner Elon Musk, whose Department of Goverment Efficiency (DOGE) Service has careened through the federal government, slashing jobs and shuttering agencies.
The gathering in Baltimore was one of more than 1,000 May Day rallies that organizers said were scheduled across the country Thursday.
“The public is mad,” said Beverly Clevidence, 77, who said she only started joining political demonstrations months ago. “We’re banding together about many things – about labor, about civic services, about education.”

Other than some angry comments from drivers passing by, there weren’t any notable counterprotests around the gathering. Meanwhile, there was plenty of honking  and shouting from drivers in support of the protest.
Many of the grievances at the May Day rally were related to the Trump administration’s rapid cuts to funding and programs in an effort to reduce federal spending.
Cristina Duncan Evans, the Teacher Chapter Chair of the Baltimore Teachers Union, said that federal cuts to education and various policy changes are creating a difficult learning environment for kids.
“We’re seeing cuts from the federal government, we’re seeing ongoing issues in the school district, and we’re here showing up to show the strength of unions, the strength of educators and to connect with all of the other issues that people are bringing,” said Duncan Evans, who previously worked as a social studies teacher and a library media specialist.
“We’ve also seen a radical redefinition of civil rights that is an attack on African American students … and an attack on transgender students,” she said, “and we’re standing up for all of our students, all of our families and all of our staff.”
Many of the protesters where angry at the administration’s crackdown on undocumented residents. Kathleen Carlson, 31, an immigration lawyer, was at the protest to stand up for her clients who are “terrified” of Trump’s aggressive immigration policies.
“We’re all workers, and a large number of immigrants provide labor — provide poorly-paid labor, unpaid labor — and they get taken advantage of by corporations and individuals,” she said. “They deserve the same rights as every other citizen.”
Angela Clark, 26, with a youth-led climate activist group, the Sunrise Movement, said that the theme of the rally was “the workers versus the billionaire class.”
“‘Big Oil and Big Pharma, the people ruining the environment, are part of that billionaire class,” Clark said. “Our messaging right now is not necessarily ‘end climate change,’ it’s ‘stop billionaires from ruining our climate.’”

Some of the nonworker-focused protest signs demanded protections for transgender kids and adults, urged the administration to return erroneously deported Maryland resident Kilmar Abrego Garcia, and pushed for protecting Palestinian lives amid the Israel-Hamas war.
“The crowd is huge,” Clark said. “I think it’s great that we started with six different marches, all with different causes. And we’re all congregating here with one real unified message: Stop the billionaire class from messing everything up for us.”

Sign up for Chalkbeat Detroit’s free newsletter to keep up with the city’s public school system and Michigan education policy.
A Michigan program that deploys reading and math tutors to schools to help struggling students faces an uncertain future because of Trump administration cuts.
Holly Windram, the executive director of the Michigan Education Corps, said she learned Friday that the federal Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, had terminated funding for AmeriCorps, a government agency focused on national service and volunteerism.
That affects the Michigan Education Corps work because it is part of AmeriCorps.
The immediate impact came this week with a stop-work order from the Michigan Community Service Commission, the administrative agent for the AmeriCorps program in Michigan. And it means funding for the 2025-26 school year that had been included in the continuing budget resolution Congress passed in March has also been terminated.
The cuts don’t just affect education programs like the academic intervention provided by the Michigan Education Corps. AmeriCorps programs also affect disaster response, public health, economic opportunity, environmental stewardship, and other areas. Those programs also face an uncertain future.
“This is an urgent situation,” Windram said of the wide scope of the cuts. “This is an absolute disaster for our communities.”
The cuts have the potential to upend efforts to improve student achievement across the nation. Many districts had used federal pandemic relief money to provide tutoring in an attempt to help students recover from the public health crisis. But that money has dried up and the AmeriCorps volunteers have helped maintain that work in many schools.
Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel earlier this week joined with 22 other attorneys general as well as two states in filing a lawsuit challenging Trump administration’s termination of the grants and staffing cuts to the agency.
“The President and his administration’s ongoing disregard for the rule of law is once again on full display in their attempt to dismantle AmeriCorps,” Nessel said in a statement earlier this week. “By canceling grants and slashing AmeriCorps’ workforce, the administration is illegally undercutting a Congressionally established and funded independent agency, while harming communities across Michigan.”
Despite the stop-work order, the Michigan Education Corps has enough money to continue paying tutors through the end of the current school year.
“The question mark is next program year,” Windram said.
This uncertainty was unexpected for Windram. When Chalkbeat first talked to her about potential federal funding cuts on April 17, DOGE had already cut a significant portion of the AmeriCorps staff but Windram was optimistic because the budget resolution had kept the funding for the next school year. Now she has to step up efforts to seek additional funding.
Windram has worked to diversify the program’s funding, and currently federal funding covers about 20% of the cost. She’ll now need to find sources of funding that can cover what will be lost if the federal funding cuts stand.
There is much at stake. The program serves 3,740 students from age 3 through grade 8 (the agency includes an early childhood component). Data shows that 75% of them meet or exceed their academic growth target. Windram said that’s important because the program isn’t just seeking to demonstrate growth with students, but instead seeking to have them close achievement gaps.
At Ralph J. Bunche Elementary School in Ecorse, a wall of fame in a hallway features students who were placed in the reading intervention program and have improved enough to no longer need the help. The smiling students are photographed holding their certificates, some posing with their tutors. The wall is a symbol of the impact of the work that happens when the tutors meet one-on-one with the struggling students.
When Chalkbeat visited Ralph J. Bunche Elementary School in Ecorse on April 4, there was already concern about whether the reading and math tutors would be able to continue beyond the current school year.
“That is very worrisome,” said Sandra Fuoco, the school’s Title I teacher, whose position is funded by federal money. “I have my interventionist wondering what’s going to happen? Do they look for a new job over the summer? They want to come back. They’re wonderful, wonderful workers, and we don’t want to lose them.”
The AmeriCorps cuts are happening as uncertainty swirls about potential federal education funding cuts that could affect everything from school meals for students to early childhood programs. Fuoco and Bunche Principal Toyre Burks worry that politicians and policymakers proposing such cuts don’t understand how much cuts could affect students.
“I have my concerns around us being able to meet our kids where they’re where they’re at,” Burks said. “We’re in an at-risk district. Our kids, they need the breakfast, lunch, sometimes even dinner and snacks that we’re giving them.”

Zip Code Wilmington has announced a new partnership with Goldey-Beacom College aimed at helping coding bootcamp graduates earn college credit and continue their education at a reduced cost.
Under the new Credit for Prior Learning initiative, Goldey-Beacom will grant up to 12 academic credits to students who complete Zip Code Wilmington’s intensive training programs and enroll in the college’s associate or bachelor’s degree programs.
“We are delighted to partner with Goldey-Beacom on this initiative, which supports our students as they continue their educational journeys,” said Desa Burton, executive director of Zip Code Wilmington. “It is a testament to the quality of the rigorous Zip Code curriculum that Goldey-Beacom recognizes the value of our training by awarding academic credit to our graduates.”

Graduates of Zip Code’s Software Development bootcamp will receive 12 college credits, while those who complete the Data Engineering and Analytics bootcamp will be awarded nine credits. The programs focus on in-demand technical skills such as Java, Python3, Spark, and SQL.
Goldey-Beacom College President Colleen Perry Keith praised the technical training provided by Zip Code Wilmington.
“We have seen first-hand that students from the Zip Code Wilmington coding programs are highly trained in technology skills aligned with our curriculum,” she said. “In fact, we have hired a Zip Code Wilmington graduate who has added tremendous value to our IT work. It is only fitting for us to award credit to these students who have displayed academic excellence and a dedication to learning.”

(Laura Chramer for Alabama Reflector)President Donald Trump Thursday congratulated more than 200 graduates at a commencement ceremony at the University of Alabama for their academic accomplishments, and himself for his first 100 days in office for his second term.
In a meandering, hour-long address that drew a nearby protest, Trump called Alabama a “winner” and urged graduates to lead successful lives.
“Today, I am also asking you to look forward to, really, something very, very bright, more promising,” Trump said. “And it is going to be even more promising tomorrow, I promise you that. You are the first graduating class of the golden age of America.”
The president also praised himself for his controversial executive orders and rehashed his grievances with his critics and the Biden administration.
“In a matter of weeks, we achieved the lowest number of illegal border crossings ever recorded,” Trump said to the applause of the crowd. “We have seen hundreds of thousands of people pouring into our country from prisons, from mental institutions, gangs, and all over the world, not just in South America.”
According to Axios, the decline in border crossings began under the Biden administration and was due in part to actions taken by the government of Mexico. Experts also say that border crossings can fluctuate. Trump’s actions have also led to the wrongful arrest of several people with legal status, including Maryland resident Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia and three U.S. citizen children under the age of 10, including one with Stage 4 cancer.
Much of the evening’s speech focused on imparting words of wisdom for the graduates using a list of virtues they should incorporate into their lives.

“In America, with drive and ambition, young people can do anything,” Trump said. The president, who became president of a real estate company his father Fred built, spoke about how he developed a property in Manhattan when he was in his 20s. Trump then praised Steve Jobs and Walt Disney for their accomplishments founding companies.
“If you are going to do something, you might as well think big because it is just as tough,” he said. “I know a lot of people, they thought small, and they are very smart. I know others who were not very smart, but they thought about the big picture.”
Throughout the address, Trump would shift quickly from advice to graduates to monologues on social issues. He repeatedly raised transgender issues, returning multiple times to what he characterized as the problem of males who transitioned into females and playing on female sports teams.
He would end his speech by heaping praise on Alabama for more than five minutes.
“You continue the legacy of Alabama legends who blazed the trails, won the games, tilled the fields, forged the steels, built the ships, and gave us the victories that built the American and changed the world.”
He praised the car racing in Talladega and highlighted the rockets developed in the state.
“This is the state that gave us nothing but victory,” Trump said. “The state with some of the greatest heroes in history, like Willie Mays, Jesse Owens, Joe Louis, your coach Nick Saban.”
 Protest draws over 100 people

A protest of Trump’s appearance organized by the University of Alabama’s College Democrats drew over 100 people.
“We deserve somebody who works for the people, by the people. And right now we have someone who is working for billionaires, by billionaires,” said Kyla Chatmon, a junior political science and African American studies double major at The University of Alabama. “And I think that is just unjust. And so I came out today to show my support to all the graduates who are having to have their graduation overshadowed by an authoritarian, fascist, dictator.”
Mary Maxwell, who also attended the event, said she feels like the university might have been scared to say no to the sitting president.
“It is a red state and people are afraid of him,” she said. “They’re afraid he’ll cut their funding and he’ll try to control what’s being taught at the school. I taught at the university for 20 years and did research for 15 [years]. He’s against education. He’s against science. He’s against people knowing more than him.”
Former U.S. Sen. Doug Jones, D-Alabama and Beto O’Rourke, a former Texas congressman who ran for governor and U.S. Senator in Texas, spoke at the event.
“He wants us to feel hopeless. He wants us to feel like he has all the power. And let me tell you something. In this country, in this great democracy, in this government of, by and for the people, the real power is with us,” O’Rourke said during his speech.
O’Rourke encouraged protest attendees to keep fighting against the administration’s policies during his speech as well, invoking Bloody Tuesday, an attack on civil rights protestors by police and a white mob in Tuscaloosa in 1964, and Bloody Sunday, an attack on civil rights protestors crossing Selma’s Edmund Pettus Bridge in 1965.
“We can overcome these challenges, because we have overcome them before against much greater odds,” he said to the crowd.
Former Senator Doug Jones said during his speech that the gathering was “not a protest, this is a movement.”
“It is movements that changed this country,” he said. “Whether it was the Civil Rights Movement, whether it was the anti-war movement, it is the movements. And guess what? It started on college campuses.”

Jones also encouraged protest participants to write to their U.S. Senators as a form of speaking up and out for what they want.
“Write your U.S. Senators, they’ll ignore it, but write them anyway! Because those things mean something. As someone who sat in the halls of the United States Senate, we tried to answer everything, even people that came in that opposed what we were doing,” Jones said.
Jones also encouraged attendees to get involved with civic engagement to fight for the change they would like to see.
“Go to your county commission, go to your city council offices. Get engaged, civic engagement at the local level is where we have to be, that’s the power. You have that power,” he said.

A Republican bill to require more transparency from California’s 50,000 homeowners associations failed to advance out of committee despite bipartisan support.


Republican Assemblymember Joe Patterson says a woman slowly drives by his Placer County home about once a week and takes pictures.
She’s not an angry constituent or a stalker. He said she’s a representative from his homeowners’ association gathering evidence to make sure the exterior of Patterson’s home complies with its strict rules.“I’ve been getting letters for, you know, ‘Oh, your (landscaping) bark isn’t deep enough,’ ” he said. “Now it’s my son’s basketball hoop.”The “sheer harassment” from his HOA is why he said he has a large black flag in his legislative office. It reads: “Defund the HOA.”
So it didn’t take a lot of arm twisting from Patterson’s Republican colleague, Carl DeMaio, to persuade Patterson to present DeMaio’s Assembly Bill 21. The proposed new law would force California’s estimated 50,000 private homeowners’ associations to behave more like local governments when it comes to open records and public meetings. The bill failed to advance from its first committee hearing last week.
HOAs collect monthly fees from homeowners for services such as maintaining clubhouses and pools, security, plowing snow, landscaping, road repairs and other shared amenities. They often set neighborhood rules to ensure properties are maintained and don’t become unsightly.
Many people who live in HOA-governed communities have no complaints, appreciate that they help share the cost and believe that standard rules about home appearance prevent eyesores. 
But the associations themselves can sometimes devolve into bitter feuds between neighbors, featuring accusations of cronyism and ruthless enforcement of petty violations of an HOA’s rules. Multiple popular social media accounts and message boards are devoted to people sharing contempt for their HOAs. 
Patterson said his HOA demanded he add more landscaping bark around his home, which he did. As for his son’s basketball hoop, it’s one of those with wheels on it. That, according to his HOA, is a no-no, he said. Representatives for Patterson’s HOA, the Whitney Ranch Community Association in Rocklin, declined an interview request.

The failed measure would have required HOAs to abide by various rules similar to those city and county boards have to follow. That would have included making it mandatory for an HOA board to make decisions in recorded open meetings and adding mandatory disclosure requirements for records such as meeting agendas and minutes and notices of lawsuits. HOA members could sue to void decisions that violated the law.
“It brings sunlight to HOA governance,” Patterson told the Assembly Housing and Community Development Committee. “This isn’t a crazy, radical proposal. It’s about ensuring that the people who live in these communities have the right to know what decisions are made on their behalf.”

The bill failed last week with four Democrats on the committee voting for it, along with Patterson. A bipartisan group of seven lawmakers voted “no” or didn’t vote at all, which counts the same as a no vote. 
The lawmakers who voted “no” or who didn’t vote did not explain their rationale during the nine minutes the bill was discussed.
According to the Digital Democracy database, the bill’s opponents included the California Association of Community Managers, the Inner City Law Center, the San Diego Housing Commission and the Community Associations Institute, which advocates on behalf of HOAs.
The institute’s lobbyist, Taylor Triffo, told the committee that existing laws already provide accountability and transparency. 
The committee’s Democratic chairperson, Matt Haney of San Francisco, voted for the proposal, but it wasn’t enough to keep it alive.
Patterson said he thinks the bill largely died because of its author: DeMaio. He’s a conservative firebrand and San Diego talk radio host with a brash, Donald Trump-esque, “own-the-libs” style. 
“Honestly, it was Carl’s bill, and it going down in flames had nothing to do with the policy,” Patterson said. “I think if that was Joe Patterson’s bill, it would have had a different fate.”
DeMaio agreed that his name was probably its kiss of death.
“It probably has a lot more to do with the Democrats’ pettiness of just trying to kill any bill associated with me,” DeMaio said. He was unable to present his bill due to a conflict that arose from a radio-hosting gig, he said.
The two Democratic lawmakers who voted “no” on the bill, Alex Lee of Milpitas and Robert Garcia of Rancho Cucamonga, couldn’t be reached for comment Thursday.

DeMaio owns two properties that are in HOAs. He said those paying into the associations deserve transparency from what he describes as “quasi-governmental entities.” That’s why he said he wanted to add new requirements despite normally having a distaste for more regulation of private property. “If they can tax you, if they can encumber your property rights, they’re governmental decisions,” DeMaio said. “And so they should be subjected to the open meetings and public records laws like any other public entity.”
DeMaio said he would support Patterson’s plan to reintroduce the measure next year to give the bill a better shot. Patterson said he’s already gotten interest from Democratic colleagues wanting to sign on to give the bill a bipartisan boost. He declined to name them. 
Patterson said his homeowners association doesn’t charge that much – only $85 a month. But given that there are 2,800 homeowners paying the fee, that’s a significant amount of money for which the HOA board is responsible. Plus, he said if he doesn’t pay to protest the alleged “harassment” or for other reasons, the HOA can put a lien on his house.
“If you’re going to take my house from me and have a recorded lien on my home, then you damn well better provide very transparent financial records to your community,” he said.

How Gavin Newsom is balancing the fight against Trump with Los Angeles fire relief

,California,2025-05-02 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,California’s homebuyer lotto was hardly a ‘Dream for All’. That doesn’t mean it should end,Denise Amos,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/05/dream-for-all-down-payment/,California needs to expand its down payment loan program to keep young families from moving out of the state. Yet there's no new money budgeted.,"Affording a home is no easy feat in California, where houses cost twice the national average. And for a lucky few, a state program aiming to help first-time homebuyers has reduced this American rite to a matter of winning a lottery.
About 18,000 people last year applied for California Dream for All, a state-funded loan that pays all or most of a down payment on a home. Borrowers pay it back when they sell.
Only about 2,000 families won the loans last year, averaging $117,000 each, and about 2,100 got them the year before. The 2-year-old program is costing taxpayers more than $500 million. 
The very existence of a down payment assistance program is a symbol of California’s failure to preserve economic mobility for younger generations. It begs the question: Is this a worthwhile way to help more Californians buy a home?
Gov. Gavin Newsom didn’t include any new funding for the loans in his initial state budget proposal in January. And lawmakers just gutted a bill that would have paid for Dream for All with a new tax on vacant commercial properties. Several dozen business and real estate groups slammed the new tax idea.
If state leaders and even real estate interests won’t prioritize the down payment program, it’s fair to question whether more tax dollars should be used. But once you consider the consequences,  the state must remain in the business of encouraging homeownership, especially if it helps retain California’s cost-burdened middle class.
Homeownership is still one of the best vehicles for narrowing the wealth gap between demographic groups, while stabilizing neighborhoods. And it could temper the growing divide between the very rich and the rest of us, while stemming the flood of people leaving California for more affordable housing elsewhere, which is endangering the state’s long-term outlook.
Today only 15% of California families can afford a median-priced home, which was $884,000 in March. Only 24% can manage a median-priced condo or townhome at $680,000. 
Paychecks just aren’t keeping up. Since 2014, the state has lost more than 700,000 adults who specifically cited housing as the primary reason. Half bought homes in their new state. 
California can’t afford to lose so many young families. With them goes a future tax base, as well as potential businesses, productivity and innovation. And schools lose because they are funded by the number of students in seats.
A shrinking population also means fewer Congressional seats. California lost a seat after the 2020 census; think tanks predict it’ll lose four or five more after the next one if trends continue.
Dream for All initially wooed first-time buyers in the middle who make up to 150% of the median income of their county. In Sacramento County, that means about $170,850 for a family of four, and $147,300 in Los Angeles.
Other programs target lower income families, but ignore the middle range.
“Teachers and nurses are stuck; they make too much for any government programs,” said Roxanne Mariok Girardo, a San Diego-area builder of homes in the $680,000 to $705,000 range. “The government gets in its own way when it makes up its rules. The middle income (class) usually makes too much, but not enough, to buy a house.”
Inheriting $84 trillion in wealth 
Upper-class homebuyers have a generational advantage. Their parents help with down payments and pass on homes and other assets as they die or age, a trend that’s only accelerating. By some estimates, $84 trillion in wealth will be passed down from older Americans to millennial and Gen X heirs by the end of 2045, including $16 trillion just in the next decade.
Such disparities will be even more glaring between races. Dream for All can play a small but important role in counteracting that.
It began as a first-come, first-served loan program, but the money was gone in 11 days. Many of its first recipients were white Sacramentans, prompting a flurry of changes to the program in the second year to produce a more diverse pool of recipients — racially and geographically. 
Now applicants have to be the first person in their family to ever own a home. And their income has to be under lower thresholds, closer to the median for each county. Even so, after last year’s lottery, the program had 4,500 qualifying families still on waiting lists for loans.
Also this time, 70% of loan voucher recipients are people of color, up from 55% last year, state officials said, citing preliminary statistics. 
“If the state doesn’t stay in the game, the housing crisis is going to get worse.”Al Abdallah, president of the Urban League of San Diego County
Latino families snapped up 39% of loan vouchers, far above their 30% share of California households, while Asian American and Pacific Islander families garnered 29% of vouchers when they’re 15% of the state’s households. 
Black homebuyers received 8% of the vouchers though they’re 6% of the population. That’s an improvement over last year’s 4% loan accumulation, but it’s nothing to crow about.
It’s nowhere near enough to begin closing one of California’s most shameful wealth gaps: The Black homeownership rate in California is 32% compared to whites’ rate of 56%. There are many forces at play, including decades of redlining, where banks and federal government-backed lenders refused to write mortgages in some neighborhoods, and restrictive covenants, which outlawed home sales to non-whites in some neighborhoods.
Discriminatory lending still occurs, and there are more loan denials, fewer bank branches and more payday lenders in Black and Latino neighborhoods than in other areas.

California Divide 
Dream for All: Down payment assistance for first-time California homebuyers relaunches with new lottery 

by Felicia Mello 





The Trump administration likely won’t reverse that. The White House has instead slashed programs that try to counteract these barriers to financing. That’s why Dream for All is so important: Other sources of home-buying assistance are at risk. 
One of the Urban League’s down payment programs that helped people of color was “paused” recently because a national nonprofit with federal contracts felt pressured by President Donald Trump’s DEI policies.
“If the state doesn’t stay in the game, the housing crisis is going to get worse. They have an obligation to,” said Al Abdallah, president of the Urban League of San Diego County, which counsels families on homeownership.
“When you have a mortgage you have rent control,” he said. “You’re building equity. You’re sending your kids to college … If homeownership is spread, equity builds in the hands of more than just a select few.”
Locked out of the housing market
State officials say they stand behind Dream for All, even though they’re not making plans to fund it. 
Originally it was pitched as a bigger and bolder program. When Toni Atkins was Senate President Pro Tem, she said Dream for All would lend $1 billion to 4,000 families a year, for 10 years. Instead it got about quarter of the annual funding she wanted and helped half the expected number of families.
Atkins, now running for governor, declined an interview but in a written statement said she understands why people need down payment assistance, having grown up in a rental home with no running water.
“Too many families are still locked out of the housing market,” she said, adding that solving the housing crisis takes “bold action, focused leadership and relentless determination.”
Newsom’s staff said he won’t comment on his budget plans. They did, however, note that when people repay their down payment loans, that money will go toward new loans, ensuring the program’s future.

But that seems too small, and could take years. 
If the program survives, it should expand and be more flexible, so more people qualify and more homes in high-priced places like San Diego and Los Angeles can be included. 
There shouldn’t be questions or qualifiers about who is most worthy of the loans — first-time homebuyers or first-generation homebuyers should qualify, as should families who can prove they or their ancestors were discriminated against.
Dream for All kept its promise for a few thousand people. For tens of thousands of others it was just a pipe dream. It could be so much more.

Feb. 25, 2025. (Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Legislators right now are busy, busy trying to get through hundreds of bills. Despite technically starting a new session, leaders of the House and Senate said they hope to stick to the planned adjournment date of June 18.
Many bills are being passed under the hammer, meaning without a roll call, allowing lawmakers to reserve their floor speeches for legislation about which they feel most passionate. This week, that energy was largely reserved for debates about farmworker rights and expanding the Maine State Police force, while the age of Maine’s sitting U.S. senators also prompted some discussion.
Both chambers overwhelmingly backed legislation (LD 995) to provide one-time funding for low-income electricity consumers, providing an annual allocation of $7.5 million for the next two fiscal years to support eligible households. During the floor discussion, bill sponsor Rep. Melanie Sachs (D-Freeport) noted that on average in Maine, low income ratepayers are paying 8% of their income on power bills, which is double what is recommended. The House voted 120-26 and the Senate backed the bill without a roll call.
Both chambers unanimously passed a measure (LD 606) directing the Bureau of Agriculture, Food and Rural Resources to study the bureau’s financial assistance programs for farmers and food producers to identify potential barriers, which should then be eliminated to increase the effectiveness of the programs.
The majority of the House and Senate also backed a bill (LD 837) that would require positions taken by the public advocate to be consistent with the cost-effective implementation of the state’s climate goals. The Senate voted 18-15 and the House 74-67. Sen. Matt Harrington (R-York), who opposed the bill, argued it would blur the lines to add climate goals to the Public Advocate’s directive, though bill sponsor Sen. Mark Lawrence (D-York) said it would clarify something not currently clear, that the public advocate can advocate for rate payers with the state’s established goals in mind. 
The House and Senate voted under the hammer to pass legislation (LD 130) proposed by the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, which would codify programs supporting farms with high levels of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, also known as PFAS, into state law to ensure the support for farmers and remediation can continue. (More on this bill here)
Both chambers unanimously passed a bill (LD 6) to allow people to label their wild animal traps with the identification number issued by the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife. Rep. Sally Cluchey (D-Bowdoinham) said it’s a simple but important bill that a trapper brought forward because she was concerned about the safety of her and her children after she was doxxed for trapping.
Lawmakers also largely agreed with the committee recommendation to reject LD 499 (House voting 88-57 and Senate doing so without a roll call), which would prohibit geoengineering in the state.
Some of the other bills that passed both chambers under the hammer: 

LD 1150 “An Act to Require Reporting of Sheltering or Aiding Missing Children”
LD 398, “An Act to Amend the Definition of “Transient Occupancy” in the Laws Governing the Maine Land Use Planning Commission”
LD 296 “An Act to Appropriate Funds to the Department of Environmental Protection, Lake Water Quality Restoration and Protection Fund”
LD 117, “An Act to Provide Funding for Sexual Assault Services” 
LD 472, “Resolve, Directing the Maine-Canadian Legislative Advisory Commission and the New England and Eastern Canada Legislative Commission to Examine Restoring Passenger Rail from Boston to Montreal”
LD 987, “An Act Clarifying Exemptions from the Notification Requirements for Products Containing PFAS”
LD 321, “An Act to Make May Progressive Supranuclear Palsy Month”, ought to pass report, passed under the hammer
LD 89, “Resolve, Regarding Legislative Review of Chapter 201: Employer Reporting and Payments, a Major Substantive Rule of the Maine Public Employees Retirement System”

Senate action
Before passing LD 588 by a vote of 21-13, senators had robust debate on the proposal to enact the Agricultural Employees Concerted Activity Protection Act, which gives agricultural employees of agricultural employers the right to engage in certain concerted activity. Sen. Scott Cyrway (R-Kennebec) said the measure is unnecessary and “just puts another layer of difficulty for farmers.” However, Sen. Rachel Talbot Ross (D-Portland) said the bill is “not about farmers” but rather about the fact that farmworkers “have been expressly excluded from our basic labor laws that protect most workers.” She also said if the body fails to pass the bill into law “this relegates a certain segment of our society to second class citizenry.” (More on this bill and other legislation to bolster farmworkers’ labor rights here.)
In an effort to speed things along, Sen. Rick Bennett (R-Oxford) introduced an order to amend a legislative rule that would make it so bills are automatically referenced to committees (something already being done on non-session days). Bennett had attempted to make this change earlier in session, too, but lawmakers opted for the current hybrid model. Sen. Anne Carney (D-Cumberland) raised concern that the adjustment would also change the basis for referencing,  giving bill sponsors greater ability to choose where their bill is heard. Instead, she suggested the order be referred to the Joint Rules Committee, which is tasked with establishing legislative processes (more on that here) — a motion that passed 18-15.
The Senate confirmed the reappointment of Kelly O’Connor of Camden to the Maine Commission on Public Defense Services by a 29-5 vote. 
Here are some bills passed by the Senate under the hammer:

LD 141 “An Act to Provide Limited Immunity to Maine Human Rights Commission Mediators” ought to pass, passed under hammer
LD 1545, “An Act to Clarify the Maximum Value That a Small Estate May Be Under the Maine Uniform Probate Code to Permit Collection of Personal Property by Affidavit”
LD 386, “An Act Regarding Information That May Be Shared by Law Enforcement Entities with a School Superintendent or a Principal”
LD 461, “An Act to Fund Rural Patrol Services in Washington County” (EMERGENCY) 

House action
A bill about who can be appointed to succeed a U.S. senator should they vacate the office caused a bit of a stir after leadership moved a motion not to pass the bill (which was the position of a minority of committee members). The House rejected that motion 56-90, forcing a motion to pass the bill, which advanced without a roll call. LD 749 specifies the nominated person must be enrolled in the same party as their predecessor (or in the case of an independent, they must be replaced by someone not enrolled in a party) with the floor discussion largely centering on the age of Maine’s two U.S. senators, Republican Susan Collins (72) and independent Angus King (81). Rep. Will Tuell (R- East Machias) noted that neither are “spring chickens,” and said if they are not able to fulfill their duties, he’d be concerned that Maine’s chief executive (currently a Democrat) could currently replace them with whoever they want. When the measure came up in the Senate a day later, it was tabled.
Legislation (LD 477) to add 15 new state trooper positions specifically to provide support to county sheriff department efforts in rural areas passed the House 117-26. Arguing in support, Rep. Tavis Hasenfus (D-Readfield) said that because of Maine’s size, there are times when certain areas have a hard time getting police presence. “Maine State Police are Maine’s police,” he said. Pointing to existing vacancies in Maine State Police, Rep. Grayson Lookner (D-Portland) argued that the Legislature should focus on other ways of addressing public safety, such as funding housing.
The House voted 111-29 in support of the committee recommendation against LD 535, which would allow a court to impose a sentence that includes commitment beyond 21 years of age for a juvenile adjudicated of murder or a Class A crime. 
Appropriations
​​Several bills were also moved to the “appropriations table,” where the budget committee can choose to support the measures with any remaining funds. These included: 

LD 457, “An Act to Fund Climate Resiliency Projects Related to the Repair of Campus
Infrastructure Used for Active Transportation and Outdoor Recreation” 
LD 462, “An Act to Amend the Eligibility Criteria for Creditable Service in the Armed Forces of the United States Under the Maine Public Employees Retirement System” 
LD 703, which would provide one-time funding of $500,000 for a health care gap year program that incentivizes recent college graduates to work in critical health care positions, particularly in underserved and rural communities passed both chambers. 
LD 70, to provide one-time funding of $250,000 for each year of the next biennium to the state’s five free health clinics
LD 884, “Resolve, to Establish the Criminal Justice Legal Aid Clinic Pilot Project at the University of Maine School of Law”
LD 109, directing the Maine Arts Commission to study national efforts to protect artists from copyright infringement by Artificial Intelligence companies and suggest potential legislation

Delaware Senate Republican leaders are applauding Governor Matt Meyer’s recent stance against the state’s controversial electric vehicle (EV) mandate, signaling renewed efforts to block the regulation first introduced under former Governor John Carney.
Senate Republican Whip Brian Pettyjohn, R-Georgetown, has circulated an updated version of Senate Bill 96, which aims to halt the adoption of the regulation modeled after California’s Advanced Clean Cars II standards.
The rule, spearheaded by the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC), would require 43% of new vehicles sold in the state to be zero-emission or plug-in hybrids by model year 2027.
That number would climb to 82% by 2032.

“This was never about clean air, it was about control,” said Senate Republican Leader Gerald Hocker, R-Ocean View. “Delawareans have made it overwhelmingly clear they do not want an unelected state agency unilaterally dictating what kind of new cars they can or cannot buy.”
Republican lawmakers have consistently opposed the mandate, citing a 2023 public comment period in which more than 93% of nearly 5,000 responses expressed disapproval.
A separate poll conducted the same year found that 73% of Delaware voters opposed adopting California’s vehicle emissions rules, including many who otherwise support environmental initiatives.
Senator Pettyjohn emphasized the need for consumer choice over government mandates.
“People deserve choices, not mandates,” Pettyjohn said. “EVs may work well for some, but practically forcing them on everyone, especially without the infrastructure in place, is reckless. I thank Governor Meyer for recognizing that and listening to the people of Delaware instead of blindly following California’s lead.”
The revised bill is now being circulated among legislators for co-sponsorship.

(Photo: Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)Nevada’s Economic Forum adjusted the tax revenue forecast down $191 million for the upcoming biennium, representing a further dimming of an already dreary outlook of how the economy will fare under the Trump administration.
The revision means the Nevada State Legislature will have even tougher decisions to make in the upcoming month as they work toward passing a balanced biennium budget by June 2.
“The primary cause” of the lowered expectations from the economy “is the global trade war,” Moody’s economist Emily Mandel told the five-member panel of private-sector financial analysts tasked with setting the revenue forecast used for the state budget. Specifically, higher tariffs and the uncertainty that comes with rapid changes in policy “will do real damage to the economy.”
Moody’s is predicting the economy will experience a “sharp reduction in growth” that will “technically avoid a recession” but “will be felt by households and businesses,” said Mandel.
She acknowledged their forecast of dodging a recession assumes there will be a pivot in the Trump administration’s trade policies, either because Trump will reach trade deals with scores of nations or he will scale back tariffs that are upending the U.S and global economy. Absent a scaling back, the economic outlook will worsen.
Trump’s pivot on trade policy would need to happen “within the next few months,” she added.
Mandel’s comments to Nevada echoed what economists have said at the national and international level.
“The economy is on the precipice of going into recession, and will likely go into one, unless policy takes a very sharp turn here pretty quickly,” Moody’s Chief Economist Mark Zandi was quoted as saying last week.
Consumer spending makes up two-thirds of the economy, and eroding consumer confidence can be a sign of a recession.
“In the past, we’ve seen that when we get a 20-point reduction over three months” in the consumer confidence index ”a recession will follow within 6 months,” Mandel said. “We’re currently at 19.3%. So we’re not there yet. But it’s a reason, just one of the reasons, we have a weaker forecast.”
Nevada numbers
The Economic Forum’s $191 million reduction to the revenue forecast was largely a result of lowered expectations of sales and use tax. They now expect the general fund’s portion of sales tax to bring in $3.68 billion over the biennium — a $100 million drop from what was projected in December.
Moody’s is forecasting sales tax revenue to rise compared to the current biennium but only because the prices consumers pay will increase with inflation. They expect the volume of goods being sold to remain flat.
Notably, the forum chose not to adjust Nevada’s gaming revenue for the upcoming biennium, despite concerns about tourism softening.
The most recent data from the Gaming Control Board appears to show the state struggling to maintain previous levels of gaming win. But the decreases have been minor, said Shelley Newell, senior economist for the Nevada Gaming Control Board.
“With the information and data we have, we had discussions with our licensees,” she said. “They are very aware and cognizant of their numbers, and they do what it takes because they want to be successful in their business. They want the patrons in their establishments.”
Moody’s forecasted a sharp 8% decline in gaming for the upcoming fiscal year. When asked about that prediction by a forum member, Mandel stood by it.
“It sounds like a lot is being baked in, a lot of negative possibilities are being baked in,” commented Economic Forum Chair Linda Rosenthal while asking about the economic assumptions Mandel made to get to that number.
“We’re expecting a decline. I don’t know that I would call it dire relative to the realm of possibilities,” Mandel said, adding that she considered how gaming revenue performed during past, non-pandemic recessions.
The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority has acknowledged that international tourism has dipped.
Canadians make up 10 to 13% of total visitors to Las Vegas, depending on who’s estimating. David Schmidt, an economist with the Nevada Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation (DETR), cited an analysis from UNLV’s Center for Business and Economic Research that found Canadian tourism supports more Las Vegas jobs (43,200) than manufacturing (33,700) does.
Mauricio Solorio, an economist within the Governor’s Finance Office, noted his forecast assumes the drop in tourism from Canada and Mexico could be partially offset by increased tourism from Europeans taking advantage of what’s expected to be a weaker American dollar.
Several European nations and Canada have issued travel advisories warning their citizens of the risks of getting caught up in Trump’s ramped up immigration enforcement policies.
The Economic Forum also chose to lower expectations for the state’s modified business tax (MBT) by $56.51 million. Economists attributed the expected drop in MBT to businesses scaling back expansion plans because of intense uncertainty accompanying Trump administration policies.
“Obviously, the outlook has deteriorated,” said Haley Owens, an economist with the Legislative Counsel Bureau. “We don’t expect to lose jobs in this forecast, but we have lowered our growth expectations both for jobs and wages.”
Mining tax revenue was adjusted upward by $1.23 million. Gold, by far the most valuable mineral mined in Nevada, is a safe haven investment that tends to increase substantially in price during economic crises.
Mining was one of three revenue streams adjusted upward. The others were the state’s insurance premium tax and real property transfer tax.
The forum bumped up insurance premium revenue stream by $46.29 million over the biennium. That helped offset some of the downward revisions elsewhere, but it will likely come at the cost of higher premiums paid by Nevadans for auto and home insurance.
The real property transfer tax was adjusted up by $6.86 million.
Democrats, Lombardo respond
Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo’s office in a statement called the reductions made by the Economic Forum “manageable.”
“While many fiscal decisions remain during the Legislative Session, the State will be able to mitigate and balance the updated revenue projections,” read the statement.
Meanwhile, Democrats were quick to emphasize that the reduction in expected revenue is a direct result of policies put in place by the Trump administration.
Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro, in a press gaggle after the forum, said the Legislature will now be “maintaining as much as we can with what we have.”
“I think the focus for us now is to make sure that we are keeping intact the services and programs that we have,” she said. “To continue to provide healthcare for working families, to continue to provide education to children. Those are going to be at the forefront of everyone’s minds.”
Cannizzaro acknowledged that additional financial uncertainty looms. The Economic Forum’s projection only covers the state’s general fund revenue, which lawmakers generally get to decide how to spend.
The State Education Fund, which funds Nevada’s K-12 public schools, is a separate pot of money funded by the Local Schools Support Tax (LSST), part of the statewide sales tax rate. The LSST rate (2.6%) is higher than general fund sales tax rate (2%), meaning the State Education Fund will likely be looking at its own decline of at least $100 million — likely more since it is also funded by the general fund and other revenue streams that might be impacted by a weakening economy.
Cannizzaro said the forecast for the State Education Fund is expected to be finalized in the next week.
Also still looming over Nevada is the threat of Congress slashing federal funding for widely used programs like Medicaid. If that happens, states will be forced to either cut services or find additional revenue to continue funding services at current levels.
The likelihood of Nevada being able to backfill lost federal revenue is highly unlikely, she said.Cannizzaro did not rule out the possibility of tapping the state’s Rainy Day Fund, formally known as the Account to Stabilize the Operation of the State Government. Lombardo’s office also mentioned the fund in its statement, which similarly acknowledged the potential for future revenue shortfalls.
“Should any unexpected budget issues arise later in the upcoming biennium, Nevadans can rest assured that the State is well-prepared to navigate moments of fiscal uncertainty, especially with the record amount of money in the Rainy Day Fund under Governor Lombardo’s leadership,” read the statement.
Transfer amounts to Nevada’s Rainy Day Fund are set and required by state law: 1% of anticipated revenue each fiscal year, as well as a portion of excess general fund collections.
However, Lombardo last session did successfully spearhead an effort to raise the Rainy Day Fund cap from 20% to 26% of appropriations from the state general fund.
In September 2024, Lombardo and State Treasurer Zach Conine announced the Rainy Day Fund had reached an all-time high of $1.24 billion.
Nevada also has additional reserve funds housed in the Education Stabilization Account, a separate rainy day fund for education set up in 2019.
Mayday
The Economic Forum is statutorily required to meet in December of even-numbered years to approve a revenue forecast. That forecast is used as the base for the governor’s recommended budget, which is given to the Legislature for consideration.
The forum is required to meet again on or before May 1 of odd-numbered years to reconsider their forecast and make adjustments. That forecast must be reflected in the balanced budget passed by the Legislature and signed by the governor by the final day of the legislative session.
Lawmakers are considering changing that timeline. Senate Bill 419, which is quietly making its way through the Legislature, proposes changing the date for reconsidering the forecast to April 1.
In a hearing for the bill, Democratic state Sen. Marilyn Dondero Loop noted the current May 1 deadline predates the state’s 120-day session cap, which was put in place via a constitutional amendment in 1998. Moving the date would give the leg more time to adjust budget accordingly.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/nevada-leg-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-02 09:08:04.314113

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Utah state leaders are being sued over a bill passed by the Legislature and signed by Gov. Spencer Cox in March created a new guardianship system for adults with “severe” intellectual disability. 
In a complaint filed in federal court in Utah earlier this month, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Disability Law Center argued the law — SB199 — violates the American With Disabilities and the Rehabilitation acts, as well as the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which grants equal protection under the law to all citizens. 
Sponsored by Sen. Kevin Stratton, R-Orem, and signed by Cox on March 17, SB199 creates a separate guardianship proceeding for people with a “severe” intellectual disability. To qualify, a physician or psychologist must sign a letter “that indicates that the adult is an individual with a severe intellectual disability,” the bill reads. 
Guardianship is a legal process where someone, typically a family member, can ask a court to determine whether a person with a disability 18 years old or older is unable to make decisions and manage their affairs.

With permission from a court, the guardian could then determine personal care and make financial and legal decisions for the disabled person. According to the Utah Parent Center, it can shield disabled people from manipulation and crime, allowing them to live a safer life. But it also limits the civil rights of the person under guardianship, taking away their authority to make adult decisions.  
The bill had the backing from several families of people with intellectual disabilities, who say the current system is too broad and not tailored to the most severely handicapped. More than 200 people signed on to a petition in support of the bill. 
“It makes sense to create a new and separate guardianship statutory section specifically for those with a severe intellectual disability and a lifelong functional limitation that began as a minor,” said Lisa Thornton, an attorney, when speaking in favor of the bill during this year’s legislative session. “Separating our population from the elderly, or ones who once had capacity, allows for greater protection for those with severe intellectual disabilities without impacting or creating restrictions on the elderly, or those who may regain capacity.” 
But during the session, both the ACLU and Disability Law Center spoke out against the bill. On April 18, the groups filed a lawsuit. 
In the 42-page complaint, the groups argue the law creates a “separate, harsher” guardianship system based on a classification of “severe intellectual disability” — a term they say is “circular and vague.” 
“‘Severe intellectual disability’ is not a term with a clear, well-established meaning among clinicians,” the complaint reads, adding that it requires physicians to make a diagnosis that is typically made by the court. 
The law also allows a guardian to “restrict the disabled person’s association with friends and family, the right to control their food and beverage consumption, and the right to restrict any activity that the guardian believes would be harmful,” according to court documents. Typically, guardians can place restrictions on an individual basis — for instance, preventing an abusive former partner from visiting. But SB199 allows for blanket restrictions, which the complaint says is a violation of the person’s rights. 

SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE

Additionally, the law creates a carveout where the disabled person wouldn’t be granted an attorney in cases where a parent, grandparent or sibling is the prospective guardian, the groups argue.
For those reasons, the groups allege the state is in violation of the American With Disabilities and the Rehabilitation acts, as well as the 14th Amendment. 
“SB199 creates a separate, more restrictive guardianship for a class of people with disabilities and denies them the same rights as others, like the right to talk with friends or relatives, solely based on a doctor describing the severity of a diagnosis,” said Nate Crippes, the public affairs supervising attorney for the Disability Law Center. 
“It also doesn’t allow for individualized determinations for this population, as is required by the ADA,” he added.“And by limiting the right to associate, if a guardian is abusive or neglectful, we fear no one will know. On the other hand, studies show a person with greater self-determination is more likely to identify an abusive situation and less likely to experience it.”
In addition to Cox and the state of Utah, the lawsuit names Utah Supreme Court Chief Justice Matthew Durrant, the Utah Judicial Council, State Court Administrator Ronald Gordon Jr., the Utah Administrative Office of the Courts and the Utah State Court system.

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama Senate passed a bill Thursday to allow the state’s dominant agricultural organization to offer its members health benefit plans.
HB 477, sponsored by Rep. David Faulkner, R-Mountain Brook, would allow the Alabama Farmers Federation (Alfa), the state’s dominant agricultural organization, to offer a health plan that is outside of state insurance regulations and only available to its members. The bill passed 30-2 and heads to the governor.
Supporters said the legislation would help farmers and other self-employed agricultural workers who do not have access to employer-sponsored plans to get more affordable coverage. 
“If we don’t do something to help our young farmers out, we’re not going to have any because they’ve got to go to work somewhere else just to get insurance,” said Sen. Jack Williams, R-Wilmer.

The bill specifies that Alfa would not be engaged in the business of health insurance and imposes a 1.3% tax on premiums. Alfa’s health benefits must include coverage for ambulatory patient services; hospitalization; emergency services; laboratory services; mental health and substance abuse disorder services and prescription drugs. Benefits or services covered under a health benefit would not be subject to an annual limit of less than $2 million per year per enrollee.
“This is a freedom-of-contract issue … it’s a simple issue in my in my head, as far as the freedom to contract, freedom to do what you want, and have a an organization enter into this type of arrangement with its members for some form of health coverage,” said Sen. Arthur Orr, R-Decatur, who is handling the bill in the Senate.
Democrats tried to amend the bill on the floor to align the proposed health benefit plan more with health insurance, but each amendment was voted down due to concerns about keeping the price of the health plans low.
Sen. Linda Coleman-Madison, D-Birmingham, who said she was concerned about denied claims and how consumers could appeal such denials, offered an amendment that would have authorized the Alabama Department of Insurance to “enforce” the bill in order to offer consumer protection. Similar language was added in an amendment to the original House bill but later removed from it. 
“What happens to the health services when an emergency claim is denied? Who do the farmers go to get some kind of mediation?” asked Coleman-Madison. The amendment failed on a 9-24 vote.
Sen. Bobby Singleton, D-Greensboro, raised concerns about pre-existing conditions and the potential impact on farmers. He said that farmers may work around substances like ammonia, which may negatively impact their health.
“[Farmers] want to get insured, because they all are supporting this plan, but they going to be in for some rude awakening when they go there and get their record check, and now they have some kind of lung disease or cancer or something, and then they’re going to be told that they can’t get insurance,” Singleton said.
His amendment failed on a 9-23 vote.
Singleton offered another amendment to raise the premium tax from 1.3%  to 1.6% for each year based on the premiums collected.
“I don’t think it will kill them, that they could pay that back to the people of the state of Alabama,” Singleton said.
Orr opposed the amendment, saying that he thinks “it’s important to keep tax rate low and make this an affordable policy for people that want to participate.” The amendment failed on a 8-25 vote.
When asked after the bill passed if he was concerned the plan would not be regulated like health insurance or that it could negatively impact a policyholder, Williams said that “some coverage is better than none.”
“If you don’t get the whole foot in, you get eight inches in, and it’s working, it’s better than what you got,” Williams said.
The bill now heads to Gov. Kay Ivey for her signature.

(Photo: Michael Lyle/Nevada Current)Local elected officials, planning and transportation representatives along with developers gathered Thursday around a central question: how do we address Southern Nevada’s ongoing housing shortage?
Much of the early focus at Regional Affordable Housing Forum, hosted by the Southern Nevada Regional Housing Authority, was directed at the longstanding request to open more federal public land in sprawling areas surrounding the Las Vegas valley as a tool to build housing.
During a panel discussion, led by M.J. Maynard, the CEO with the Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada, around the intersection of affordable housing and transportation, the conversation focused back to infill development. 
“There is also talk that we will build affordable housing in the outlying areas,” Maynard said. “Well, there is no public transit out there. There has to be a connection between where people live, where they work and how they get there.”
Nevada, like most of the nation, is experiencing an affordable housing crisis with the most extremely burdened renters unable to find places to live.  
There are only 17 available homes for every 100 extremely low income households making less than 30% of the area median income, $21,000 for a single person and about $32,000 for a family of four, compared to 94 available homes per 100 renter households making 100% of AMI, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition. 
There simply aren’t enough places for people to live, especially without paying more than 30% of their income on rent and utilities – the very definition of affordable housing used by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
Housing groups and environmental groups have warned against unsustainable urban sprawl that comes from building outward. 
David Damore, executive director UNLV’s public policy think tank Lincy Institute and Brookings Mountain West, who spoke alongside Maynard on Thursday, said research has shown outside the city limits isn’t where people want to live.  
A survey from the National Association of Realtors showed “you’re starting to see less people want to live in the suburbs,” he said. 
People want to live near where they work and avoid long commutes, panelists agreed. 
“The good news is that there are opportunities to do this in the urban core,” Damore said, pointing to a recent analysis by the Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada and the regional planning collaborative known as Southern Nevada Strong.
The plan identified around 80,000 acres of vacant or underused land in the Southern Nevada area. While a significant portion was in the urban core, he said there were also parts in Boulder City and Mesquite, Damore said. 
Earlier in the forum, during a panel including the mayors of Henderson, Las Vegas, North Las Vegas, Mesquite and Boulder City, along with Clark County Commissioner William McCurdy discussed affordable housing, Las Vegas Mayor Shelley Berkely acknowledged that “it’s going to be very important to infill (development) and start building up instead of out.”
But that was the only instance of local elected officials mentioning infill development, the mayors focusing their discussion instead on Southern Nevada’s traditional planning strategy — expanding the metro area’s footprint — and reiterating support for  the Southern Nevada Economic Development and Conservation Act, commonly referred to as the Clark County Lands Bill. 
U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto and U.S. Rep. Susie Lee, both Democrats, reintroduced the bill that would open 25,000 acres of public land in Southern Nevada and they say could lead to development of more affordable housing. 
McCurdy said during the discussion that the county has been working “very diligently with the federal delegation and county staff to offer more amendments to that bill” including clarifications on any specific provisions around development for specific area median incomes. 
Democratic U.S. Rep. Dina Titus recently told Nevada Current she was opposed to the bill as written because it has no set aside for affordable housing, “ encourages expensive urban sprawl,” would create burdens on the state’s limited water supply, and fails to address infrastructure needed to grow outward.
Interviewed after the forum, McCurdy said he agreed infill development would better address issues that come from urban sprawl, such as helping to reduce the county’s carbon footprint. 
He said while the county was pursuing infill development “it isn’t an either/or” when it comes to infill development versus building outside the county limits. 
“At this moment we can’t just say lets just do infill development and not offer the release of land to municipalities,” he said. “We need all of it.”
Maynard asked other transportation and community developer officials how they would address the housing crisis. 
Shani Coleman, the director of Clark County’s office of Community & Economic Development, said county officials are considering ways to encourage  adding residential components to commercial developments.
She pointed to Commercial Center, a shopping complex along Maryland Parkway and Sahara Avenue. 
There currently is no housing in the center, but the county “is talking about a masterplan that could include housing as well as transportation.” Coleman said, adding multiple other Southern Nevada commercial developments could potentially also be transformed to include housing.
There is “a sea of …  shopping centers and other other complexes around here that are ripe for development, that sit already in our urban areas along our transportation corridors,” Coleman said. “Just because you see something here right now doesn’t mean that has to be the end of what that looks like.”
Lombardo’s housing bill
City and county officials on their panel also praised Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo’s housing bill, Assembly Bill 540. The legislation proposes to allocate $250 million in funding to build more housing and expands the definition of affordable housing to households with incomes near or above six figures.
Throughout the forum, many presenters spoke about the need to build attainable housing and “workforce housing.”
“There is something called affordable housing and something called attainable housing and the two are very different,” Maynard said at the beginning of her panel.  
Some officials at the forum acknowledged that as they were meeting Thursday, the state’s Economic Forum determined how much to pare back the state’s budget projections as a result of the hits delivered to the economy by Donald Trump’s tariff policies. But none of the officials  noted that diminished revenue projections projects could potentially put Lombardo’s housing bill at risk.
Later on in the morning, U.S. Rep. Stephen Horsford, via a video message, hammered Trump’s on again, off again tariffs that have rattled markets and launched the economy toward what many observers warn is a recession.
“Because of blanket tariffs on aluminum, lumber and steel, all of which are imported from Mexico and Canada, it’s compounding on the challenges we are already experiencing by driving the material costs up by another 10 to 15% and possibly as high as 25%,” Horsford said. “This affects budgeting, timelines and ultimately who can and cannot afford a home.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0321-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-05-02 09:08:04.314113

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)The Alaska House of Representatives has approved a formal letter asking Congress to extend a series of Affordable Care Act tax credits that are set to expire at the end of the year.
Unless the credits are extended, Alaskans insured through the federal health insurance marketplace — about 25,000 people — could see their rates rise by an average of 67%. 
The House passed House Joint Resolution 9 by a vote of 26-14 on Monday. It is scheduled for a hearing in the Senate Health and Social Services Committee on Tuesday.
If approved by the Senate, the resolution would be sent to President Donald Trump and members of Alaska’s congressional delegation, asking them to “champion the extension of enhanced premium tax credits, prioritizing the health and economic stability of the state’s residents by ensuring that affordable health care remains accessible to all.”
Rep. Genevieve Mina, D-Anchorage, sponsored the resolution.
“We know that health care costs, as they will increase, would jeopardize small businesses and entrepreneurship. We are facing a tough fiscal situation. Enhanced premium tax credits make health care more affordable with no cost to the state,” she said, speaking Friday on the House floor. “And if these subsidies expire, we’ll see more people who are uninsured. We’ll see more people go on to Medicaid, which will cost more for the state, and additionally we will see impacts to our economy and small businesses.”
All 14 votes against the resolution came from members of the House’s minority Republican caucus.
Rep. Sarah Vance, R-Homer, said that the resolution asks Congress to make COVID-era relief permanent, at a cost of more than $300 billion.
“When we ask for Congress to do things that increase our deficit, we are increasing inflation  that harms Alaskans,” she said. 
“When we are asking Congress to take measures that are going to increase the debt by billions  of dollars, we’re making things worse in the long term for Alaskans,” Vance said in opposition.
Rep. Will Stapp, R-Fairbanks, is a member of the minority. He voted in support of the resolution but noted that he did so with reluctance. 
“I struggle with this resolution because it’s like a Band-Aid on an arterial bleed,” he said. “It doesn’t actually fix the problem of affordable insurance and quality health care. It’s just funnelling a ton of money we take from people, into the pockets of insurance companies so they can charge people less money for insurance premiums, and I don’t know if that model is sustainable.”

The American Lung Association’s 2025 State of the Air report found that the St. Louis and Kansas City areas both had poorer outcomes for some measures of air quality compared to previous years.
St. Louis was ranked 21st worst city across the country for its ozone levels this year, after being ranked 30th last year.  Kansas City was ranked 34th worst for its ozone levels, compared to 48th for 2024’s report.
In Missouri, 19 of the state’s 114 counties have official air quality monitors that feed data back to the Environmental Protection Agency for monitoring.
In all 19 monitored counties, ozone levels worsened in the years spanning the report, said Laura Turner, the director of advocacy at the Missouri chapter of the American Lung Association.
“That was something that really stood out to me,” Turner said. “We know asthma can really be influenced by air quality, and ozone is particularly problematic for people with asthma, especially kids with asthma.”
Air quality monitoring infrastructure is mostly concentrated near Missouri’s urban areas, such as counties surrounding Kansas City, St. Louis, Columbia and Springfield. But some monitors are scattered across rural counties as well.
In urban areas, things like high vehicle traffic and concentrations of industrial output can worsen air quality and be associated with higher rates of lung diseases and other chronic conditions. In more rural parts of the state, manufacturing, mining and agriculture all contribute to poorer air quality.
Plus, high-pollutant industries tend to be concentrated in lower-income areas, where residents are predisposed to other forms of chronic health conditions, said Caitlin Stiltner, a staff attorney at Great Rivers Environmental Law Center in St. Louis, which works for free to represent clients in environmental cases.
“When issuing air permits under the Clean Air Act to some of these industries, they’re disproportionately located near low-income and communities of color,” Stiltner said. “You’re seeing higher levels of asthma and lung cancers in those areas.”
The report found that people of color make up 41.2% of the overall population nationwide, but account for 50.2% of the people living in counties with at least one failing metric in the report.
From 2021 to 2023, 125.2 million Americans were exposed to potentially unsafe ozone levels, an increase of 24.6 million people from last year’s report. Unsafe ozone has been linked with worsening symptoms for those with asthma and COPD and higher risk of respiratory infections.
“One thing that does contribute to ozone across the board is increased temperatures,” Turner said. “When you have higher temperatures, you’re going to see more ozone formation. …That’s just a pretty direct correlation.”
There were improvements in year-round particle pollution, which come from things like factories, power plants and diesel and gasoline vehicles that generate things like nitrogen or sulfur oxides. Increases in long-term particle pollution have been linked with higher likelihood of childhood asthma and lung cancer.
The report found that 85 million people were exposed to year-round levels of particle pollution that don’t meet air quality standards, compared to 90.7 million for 2024’s report.
 Urban areas bear the brunt

Areas concentrated around Kansas City and St. Louis had the poorest grades in the lung association’s 2025 report.
In the Kansas City area, Clay and Clinton counties received an F for high ozone days, while Cass County received a C. Jackson County did not collect data covered in the report. St. Louis city and St. Louis, St. Genevieve, St. Charles, Lincoln and Jefferson counties all received an F for higher ozone days.
People living in poverty are more likely to live close to sources of pollution and have fewer resources to relocate out of a potentially unhealthy area.
Out of Jackson County’s nearly 720,000 residents, for example, nearly 85,000 live in poverty and are considered an at-risk group, the report found. More than 13,000 kids are statistically at risk because of pediatric asthma rates, and another more than 55,000 asthmatic adults are at risk. Another 44,500 are statistically more at risk due to COPD.
Stiltner pointed to a mapping tool that can track facilities with air permits under the Clean Air Act and compare them with rates of asthma, cancer and other diseases.
“We can see the permitted facilities and then overlay it with rates of asthma, rates of lung cancer and other types of cancer, cardiovascular disease, everything,” Stiltner said. “And there’s higher rates near these facilities. These communities are experiencing a cumulative impact from every facility that’s feeding air permits in these areas.”
Both Great Rivers and the American Lung Association are advocating to increase the number of  air quality monitors placed throughout the state. But they aren’t holding out hope, given cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency at the federal level.
“There’s simply not enough air monitors for us to do enforcement on some of these facilities,” Stiltner said. “If they’re not complying with their air permits, proving that the facility is a source of (pollutants) is difficult when there are only a few air monitors near the city.”
Other organizations, including community groups and researchers, run their own air quality monitoring programs, but those reports are not considered official data sources when it comes to enforcement of the Clean Air Act.
 Rural Missouri’s lack of air quality monitors

Andrew, Buchanan, Callaway, Cedar, Jasper, Monroe and Perry counties are the rural parts of the state that have EPA-certified air quality monitors.
All of the counties — besides Buchanan, which does not collect the data — received C or F scores for the number of high ozone days in the report. Many do not collect back high particle pollution figures, the report found.
In rural areas, industries like manufacturing, mining and agriculture all contribute to poorer air quality.
“There are so many gaps between these monitors and the rural communities where there is no monitor there yet,” said Bruce Morrison, who serves as general counsel at Great Rivers. “Whether it’s a factory, a new quarry or some kind of operation that generates air pollutants, it’s something that is not even being monitored. Those health effects are going to be real for the people that live there.”
A lack of monitoring does not equate to a lack of pollution, the lung association said in its report. The group urges Missouri to invest in research programs to gather data, use other forms of technology to track pollutants and to use data for public health protection.
Emissions from many industries are unavoidable, said Frank Mitloehner, a professor and air quality specialist at the University of California-Davis department of animal science. He studies pollutants that come from large-scale animal farming operations, such as dairy and poultry farms.
Ammonia is one agricultural output that can contribute to higher levels of PM 2.5, a pollutant that is measured when assessing air quality. If concentrations are too high, it can be dangerous for neighboring communities and those who work on farms.
“What I can assure you is nobody is sitting back and not worrying about these things,” Mitloehner said. “Farmers do not want to have issues with neighboring communities.”
Mitloehner said that while farmers are working to reduce their emissions, it’s difficult to do so without larger profit margins.
“Some have a low profit margin, and they will do things if they are forced to, but it has no production advantage to them,” he said. “If nobody pays for it, then the question is, ‘Who foots the bill?’ You can only be green if you’re in the green.”
And as the Trump administration rolls back regulation, environmental standards are caught in the fray.
The EPA has been operating under a provision called the endangerment finding, which concludes that climate change threatens public health. The measure has led to new standards on how much pollution is released into the air.
Under the Trump administration, the federal agency is exploring ways to roll back at least 31 air, water and emissions regulations related to the endangerment finding, and experts say the rollbacks could harm public health.
Now, if states want to uphold the standards that may be stripped away, the responsibility will fall on their shoulders. The lawyers at Great Rivers don’t expect Missouri to step in to enforce defunct regulations.
Earlier this month, utility company Ameren asked the Trump administration for exemptions for two coal plants in the St. Louis region, giving the company two additional years to limit emissions and unsafe air pollutants.
“Without the EPA making those rules,” Morrison said, “then there’s nothing really holding states and industries from having stronger controls on pollution.”

HOMEWOOD — Nine-year-old Ruby Banta thought it was a pretty simple choice, even for adults.
“This was the salamander’s habitat first,” she said after an afternoon soccer game. “It’s not a college habitat.”
Ruby was among the youngest of activists—sending a crayon-colored appeal to the City Council to save a sensitive salamander site—who had reason to celebrate this week. Officials at Samford University, a Baptist college just outside of Birmingham, announced a new location for sports fields in a planned commercial development that would have encroached on the habitat of the local spotted salamander population.
Dozens of Homewood residents, Samford community members and local environmentalists had opposed the earlier master plan of a development called Creekside. Homewood closely identifies with the salamander, which burrows on the slopes of Shades Mountain and migrates across South Lakeshore Drive every spring. For the past 20 years, the city has held a salamander festival to educate the public about its slippery spotted neighbor.

At a press conference Monday, the chief executive of Landmark Development, the company contracted by Samford University to complete the project, claimed victory in saving the population that his company’s proposal had put at risk.
“I think we can stand up now and very confidently say, ‘We saved the salamanders,’” Robert Dunn said about the agreement among the city, the university and Landmark to redraw its plans. “The issues of concern did not fall on deaf ears.” The sports facilities are now planned to be built further west to avoid the salamander habitat.
In Homewood, a fight for the spotted salamander

Ruby’s mother, Allison Banta, explained that the girl had learned about the salamander’s dilemma by reading an Inside Climate News report over her mother’s shoulder one night. She “was immediately enthusiastic about figuring out how to help,” Banta said.
Ruby, who has a pet lizard named Popcorn, told her third-grade teachers about the situation. She drafted a letter to City Council members about the salamander’s plight. “Please don’t build there,” Ruby wrote, her crayon drawing of a yellow-spotted salamander adorning the top of the page. “Samford already has an amazing school.”
She recruited friends to shift an already-planned yard sale to benefit Friends of Shades Creek, an all-volunteer nonprofit organization in central Alabama that publicized the threat. “Save the spotted salamander,” the children’s cardboard sign read.

Ruby is no stranger to the salamander. After a soccer game Tuesday, she chatted about a trip she’d taken during its mating season. She ventured out in her pajamas on a rainy night to help the creatures cross a roadway to one of several vernal pools where they lay eggs.
“We had to help them cross because it’s a pretty big road,” Ruby said. “So we have to protect them.”
University of Alabama at Birmingham biologist Megan Gibbons was among the organizers of the broader community opposition to the development and was pleasantly surprised when she heard the change in plans.
“I expected this would be an uphill battle that would end in disappointment,” Gibbons said. “But this is a rare win for the environment.”
“This is SUCH GREAT news!” Alabama Rivers Alliance, a statewide network of groups aimed to protect water resources, posted on social media. “Thank you to Friends of Shades Creek, Cahaba Riverkeeper, Cahaba River Society and everyone else who spoke up for the spotted salamanders! Compromises and creative solutions can be found when the right voices are gathered and heard.”
The environmental nonprofit that benefited from Ruby’s yard sale praised the decision and process in a statement. “Friends of Shades Creek is profoundly grateful to Samford University and Landmark for their willingness to listen to our concerns about the salamander vernal pool habitat and open mindedness to find a new solution for Creekside East.”











This is a rare win for the environment.


– Megan Gibbons, University of Alabama at Birmingham biologist



Samford University’s president said this week that the residents provided useful information and helped all parties reconsider. The development, billed as a “livable town square environment” including shops and eateries, is part of the university’s plan to expand and enhance its campus.
“Like any large development, we needed to hear the feedback of our community and the citizens of Homewood. The largest concern that was voiced was ecological damage, not just the salamanders but also the watershed and other related issues,” university president Beck A. Taylor said in a statement.
“We considered the concerns of our community and we went back to the drawing board. We tried to find an equally attractive opportunity or alternative. We found it. In fact, I would argue that it’s a much better alternative for us.”
Gibbons said the new plan shows that positive change can happen when residents band together. Ruby and her friends were a notable example, she said.
The yard sale, she said, is “motivating for other kids. It’s motivating for neighbors, and it should be motivating for an institution like Samford.”
Despite this win, the threat of habitat loss for salamanders and other plants and animals is ever present, she said.
Research shows that spotted salamander populations are on the decline.
Three out of every five salamander species are at risk of extinction. Of the many threatened amphibian species, more than 90 percent face habitat loss, the most common threat.
“You can name any animal or plant, and if they’re in trouble—if their populations are in decline—the main reason is probably because of unbridled development. Development that’s not taking into account the environmental circumstances and the plants and animals that live there,” Gibbons said.
Even small wins in the face of imminent development are encouraging, she said.
“If we have more outcomes like this, maybe we can begin to reverse this pattern of habitat loss and destruction,” Gibbons said. “We need to be careful about where we’re developing and develop in an environmentally conscious way. It’s a constant battle, but we have to show up to the fight.”

(Photo by Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters)As far as Ed Hale is concerned, it’s all over but the paperwork.
Hale, the current owner of the Baltimore Blast indoor soccer team and a longtime city banker and business owner, said he is committed to mounting a Democratic primary challenge in 2026 to Gov. Wes Moore (D), at the urging of friends who he said are worried about the future of the state.
It’s just talk for the moment, but Hale said Thursday that he is pulling together all the paperwork and disclosure forms that will be needed to make it official.
“I’m getting everything together … and that’s it, and I hope to file it on Monday or Tuesday after working through the weekend to get it all done,” said Hale, 78.
“When I’m done, you know, I will have some sort of press announcement,” he said.
The primary election is not until June 30, 2026, but Hale might need all that time to mount a challenge to Moore, a formidable candidate despite some recent bumps in the road.
While recent polls have shown Moore’s job approval slipped a bit, as state officials juggled new taxes and program cuts to close a $3 billion gap in next year’s budget, his ratings were still above 50% three years into his first term, with 52% of voters in a February poll saying they approved of the job he is doing. Among Democrats, who would be voting in the 2026 primary, 79% said they approve of Moore.
Early GOP candidate for governor taps former delegate as running mate

Moore is a prodigious fundraiser who reportedly has $4 million in the bank already. He will be 47 next summer to Hale’s 79. And the governor frequently makes appearances on national stages and is often talked about as a possible presidential contender in 2028 — speculation he rejected repeatedly during an appearance Thursday on “The View.”
Moore’s office declined to comment Thursday on the possibility of a primary challenge from Hale.
Even in a decidedly blue state like Maryland, the winner of the primary will have to face general election challengers, and the GOP already has one ticket in the race. Republican John Myrick filed for governor in February, the earliest possible date to do so, and he announced his running mate on Wednesday, former Washington County Del. Brenda Thiam.
More daunting would be a race against former Gov. Larry Hogan (R), whose popularity numbers rivaled Moore’s through his two terms in office and who is repeatedly mentioned as a possible 2026 candidate for his old job.
Hale said his decision to run came after discussions with many friends, who were lamenting the direction of the state, particularly its fiscal situation and business climate.
“I talked to [former Maryland Insurance Commissioner] Al Redmer and some other guys, and this is terrible, what’s happening in the state,” Hale said, describing their discussions. “‘Can’t you come up with anybody?’ We were goose hunting on my farm. And finally, people started calling me, why don’t you consider doing it?
“So I just thought about and thought about it, and just decided to do it,” Hale said.
He stresses his business background, noting that he built his businesses from the ground up, with no family money and no college education. Hale waxes poetic about the natural beauty of the state and its many cultural and economic advantages, but said he worries about its future.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
He said he is most concerned about the state’s financial future.
“I hear about the budget, and I hear it’s going to get worse, not better,” Hale said. “I’m not here to criticize the problem. I’m just coming in trying to be part of the solution.”
Hale concedes that Moore would be a formidable opponent who will run a well-organized and well-funded race for reelection. But he said he is not worried by the prospect of raising the money and building the organization that will be needed to challenge a popular incumbent.

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Maryland parents who hope to get a state-funded child care scholarship will have to wait awhile.
Faced with a tripling in the number of families in the scholarship program managed by the state Department of Education, state officials imposed a freeze on new awards effective Thursday. Parents can still apply, but will be placed on a waiting list until a space opens up in the program.
Families already enrolled will continue to receive funding.
Tara Phillips, executive director of the state Department of Education’s Early Childhood Division, said at a Board of Education meeting Tuesday nearly 45,000 child care scholarships have been approved — up from about 15,000 scholarships in 2021. State officials hope to reduce the number of recipients and cap it at 40,000 by the fall, when they could reopen the waitlist.
“If it takes longer or there’s fewer families that drop off, then it’s just going to take longer for them to have spaces on the waitlist,” Del. Jared Solomon (D-Montgomery), one of the legislative leaders on early childhood, said Thursday.
Solomon said there are a few exceptions for parents and guardians who have one child on a scholarship and may decide to apply for a second one for a younger child. And those who receive Temporary Cash Assistance or Supplemental Security Income will still be eligible to receive a scholarship.
Solomon, who chairs the Oversight Committee on Personnel, a subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee, acknowledged that the budget issues that made for a “tough session” this spring will likely continue through the summer as the state is expected to grapple with the fallout of more federal budget cuts and layoffs.
“The actions of the federal government are only going to make it harder and make it worse for us to provide the kind of wraparound and support services and education that we really want,” Solomon said.
“Over the course of the summer and through the interim, we’re going to be working on coming up with sustainable sources of funding so that we don’t have to continue the waitlist, [and] put the investments into child care and early learning that we need to be able to serve the families of Maryland,” he said.
On Tuesday, the state Board of Education heard from several early childhood officials, providers and advocates to celebrate April as the Month of the Young Child. According to a report this year from the Maryland Family Network, the estimated cost of child care in the state was nearly $25,000 a year.
“Child Care is more expensive than state college tuition in Maryland,” said Christina Peusch, executive director of the Maryland State Child Care Association.
Anabella Rodas, president of the Latino Child Care Association of Maryland, said the child care industry should be respected, especially with early childhood being one of the five priorities in the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future education reform plan.
“We’re not babysitters. We’re early childhood educators, just as the teachers in public school,” she said. “When we invest in educators, we invest in children’s futures.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Annabella-Rodas-4-29-2025-1024x537.jpg,,,2025-05-02 08:02:24.870712

She was removed from office in July after being sentenced for stealing more than $6,600. (Photo courtesy maryland.gov)The former Anne Arundel County register of wills who was booted from office last year for misconduct faces new legal problems following a shoplifting conviction.
Erica Griswold was convicted in Anne Arundel County District Court in Glen Burnie Thursday following a nearly 90-minute trial. The conviction is likely to trigger a violation in her probation for a 2024 guilty plea related to stealing more than $6,600.
Griswold, sitting at the defense table, shook her head in disagreement as prosecutors recounted her theft of a dozen household items valued at more than $160.
“I’m just really sorry that all this is happening and that it happened,” Griswold told Anne Arundel District Court Judge Shaem Spencer before receiving her sentence at the end of a bench trial.
“My intention was clear, I thought, on that day,” she said. “I did not intend on concealing, or taking, or stealing anything. It is not who I am or what I do.”
Prosecutors said that Griswold knowingly and intentionally failed to ring up and pay for items before attempting to leave a Walmart in Severn on March 18.
A security employee from the store said she spotted Griswold on cameras pushing a cart laden with merchandise. From those cameras, the employee said she watched as Griswold failed to ring some items and used a tag from a reusable bag costing less than a dollar to make it appear she was scanning other items.
Defense attorneys countered that a conviction requires that a person knowingly and intentionally act. Griswold’s public defender described the checkout as “chaotic,” with items being scanned and placed on all sides of the register and on the floor and in a second empty cart provided by a store employee.
During her own testimony, Griswold said she was rushing out of the store because of a call about an uncle who had just been admitted to the hospital. Under cross-examination, she told prosecutors that the call came just as she arrived at the self-checkout lane.
Griswold said she remembered telling store security, “God has his way of showing me things and that day it was to slow down.”
Video of the area did not show a phone call. Griswold and her attorney offered no other evidence of a call or hospital admission.
During the cross-examination, prosecutors also attempted to bring in Griswold’s 2024 guilty plea for misconduct in office, but Spencer agreed with the defense to block admission of that information. The judge also said Griswold’s explanation of events lacked credibility, however.
“I’m sworn to uphold the law, but I do not check my common sense at the door,” Spencer said.
Particularly damning to Griswold’s case was a 21-minute video. Spencer watched the video, which showed Griswold with an overflowing cart, completing four separate transactions.
Griswold and her attorney described a chaotic scene that included multiple assists from a store employee during those separate transactions.
Spencer said he saw something else — Griswold scanning items the judge said he believed were lower cost. Then Griswold “concealed” other unscanned items or moved more expensive items into her cart, Spencer said.
The video was not played in open court. Instead, it was described in turns by the judge, a store security guard, and prosecutors.
Spencer silently viewed it twice from the bench using a laptop provided by prosecutors. As he watched, he made notes on a yellow legal pad.
Griswold also viewed a portion of the video — shown to impeach part of her testimonty – from the prosecution’s laptop.
Spencer sentenced Griswold to 6 months in jail but suspended that sentence and added 3 years supervised probation. He also ordered her to pay a fine equal to the value of the merchandise she attempted to steal. (A Walmart employee told the court the items were restocked for sale after they documented them for evidence in the case.)
Griswold expressed concern that her 2024 case cast a cloud over this trial, affecting her sentence, but Spencer cut her off, saying he blocked prosecutors from introducing the case in court and refused to hear details about it.
Griswold has 30 days to appeal Spencer’s ruling.
In the meantime, she also faces the likelihood of going back before the Anne Arundel County Circuit Court judge who sentenced her last summer.
At the time, Griswold was the county register of wills. She had just pleaded guilty to stealing and cashing a $6,645 check intended to pay estate taxes.
Anne Arundel Circuit Judge Stacy McCormack in July imposed a term of 18 months in prison, but suspended the sentence and tacked on two years of supervised probation. Griswold was immediately removed from office as a result of the plea.
Thursday’s conviction will likely trigger a violation of that sentence and land Griswold back in Circuit Court where she could face additional sanctions, including all or part of the suspended jail term.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/griswold_headshot-1024x910.jpeg,,,2025-05-02 08:02:24.870712

There’s a shared understanding now more than ever that these programs matter, and that they should be available to all students, not just some.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Jamie Dansereau: Imagine what’s possible when after-school becomes essential.","This commentary is by Jamie Dansereau of Westminster, director of afterschool and summer programming for West River Education District.If you know me, you know I’m a big dreamer. I’ve never been one to say, “We can’t do that.” Instead, I find myself asking, “How can we make it happen?” And when it comes to after-school programming, that question drives me every single day.After-school programs are where so many young people discover what lights them up, whether it’s doing coding, building a fort in the woods, exploring nature or simply connecting with a caring adult. These hours after the school bell rings are full of possibility. We’re not just filling time, we’re building skills, nurturing passions and expanding futures.And yet, in Vermont and across the country, access to after-school programs isn’t guaranteed. While I’m lucky to be part of a strong community of educators and partners, we still face real challenges: staffing shortages, limited resources and outdated perceptions of after-school as glorified babysitting. Many communities don’t have programs at all.But here’s the good news: the momentum is growing. Governor Phil Scott has made after-school a priority, and organizations like Vermont Afterschool continue to lead the way with vision and heart. There’s a shared understanding now more than ever that these programs matter, and that they should be available to all students, not just some.So where do we go from here?We dream bigger. We imagine a Vermont where after-school is not seen as an “extra,” but as an essential part of education. We build it into our systems, into our budgets and into our everyday understanding of what it means to support the whole child.Think about this: after-school programs create space for students to discover new interests, build meaningful relationships and develop real-world skills that stay with them for life. From hands-on STEAM projects to creative arts, from leadership activities to quiet moments of connection, these programs support the whole child. Every student has the chance to grow, explore, and imagine their future in ways that traditional classroom time simply doesn’t always allow.What if we created a state where every child had that opportunity, every day?We already know that learning doesn’t stop at 3 p.m., and neither should our support. Let’s work together to build a system that reflects the full picture of learning, growth and possibility. Let’s make Vermont a place where after-school isn’t a patchwork of programs, but a promise we make to every child and family.Let’s keep dreaming, and building, a brighter future for Vermont’s students.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Jamie Dansereau: Imagine what’s possible when after-school becomes essential.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Commentaries_featured-image-25.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-02 08:02:24.870712

(Bill Lucia / Washington State Standard)Voters in Washington will be asked this fall to let the state make stock market investments with payroll taxes collected for its long-term care program.
The Legislature has put a measure on the Nov. 4 ballot to amend the state constitution to allow assets of the program, known as WA Cares Fund, to be handled similarly to pension and retirement accounts. Any earnings would be plowed back into the program.
The state constitution generally bars investing public money in the stock of private companies. That means state and local governments are limited to fixed-income securities like government bonds and certificates of deposit that are less risky.
Senate Joint Resolution 8201, which passed by margins of 42-7 in the Senate and 86-9 in the House, would add the Long-Term Services and Supports Trust account to the list of funds exempt from that prohibition alongside the state’s pension and retirement funds.
Voters defeated a similar measure in 2020 by a margin of 54.4% to 45.6%. It passed in only three counties — Jefferson, King, and Whatcom.

Much has changed. For one thing, the program was new, collections of payroll tax hadn’t started and distribution of benefits was years away.
Since mid-2023, a 0.58% tax has been applied on the paychecks of most workers in Washington. Beginning in July 2026, those who qualify can begin accessing the program’s benefit, a lifetime amount of $36,500 — a sum that is set to rise in future years to account for inflation.
 As of Dec. 31, 2024, the long-term care account had total assets of $1.64 billion, which are invested by the Washington State Investment Board in line with current guidelines for public money.
Senate Minority Leader John Braun, R-Centralia, the sponsor of the measure in 2020 and this year’s too, said the political environment is much different than five years ago. 
Then, public opposition to the year-old program was strong and the pandemic stirred uncertainty about the stability of the stock market. 
In November, voters defeated an initiative to make WA Cares participation voluntary rather than mandatory for workers, a move that would have effectively ended the program. Braun said that is an indication of a broader endorsement of the program.
He said supporters of the 2020 measure didn’t do a good enough job communicating that the Washington State Investment Board could produce higher earnings on WA Cares Fund assets that would translate into lower premiums and more benefits.
The state investment board uses a long-term, diversified investment strategy. There is a 7% return assumed on dollars invested through the state’s pension accounts, a level set by the Pension Funding Council in 2023.
“We’ll give them another chance and see what they think,” Braun said of voters.
Sen. Bob Hasegawa, D-Seattle, has been a steadfast opponent. He co-wrote the voter pamphlet argument against the measure in 2020 with Mike Padden, a Republican senator from Spokane Valley who retired from the Legislature last year.
Hasegawa said then that he didn’t want the long-term stability of the trust fund “gambled on by Wall Street.” His position hasn’t changed.
“Look at what’s happened to the stock market,” he said in April. It would be smarter to invest the money in municipal bonds to support public works projects of the local government, he said.
Supporters have formed a coalition, We Care For WA Cares, to make the case that the change will lead to larger investment earnings and greater fiscal stability. Coalition members include the Washington State Nurses Association, Washington Health Care Association, AARP Washington and SEIU 775, a union that represents caregivers.

I’m the general manager at Northstar Canoes, a small manufacturing company in Minnesota, and so far, there’s nothing about President Trump’s policies that are good for either our international or domestic business. 
Our 17 employees make performance canoes out of carbon fiber, aramid and polypropylene. Our canoes are sold throughout the United States, Canada and Europe. We’re not even a blip in the economy, but every passionate paddler knows our boats. We are one of the millions of small businesses that politicians like to call the backbone of the economy during campaign season.
All businesses need a stable political and economic environment to thrive. Administrations on both sides of the aisle, for as long as I can recall, have worked to foster conditions that allow businesses to succeed. 
This administration’s trade wars and attempts to weaken environmental regulations, by contrast, are terrible for our business. 
As a small company, we’ve invested significant resources to develop international markets. The tariffs imposed during the first Trump administration caused retaliatory tariffs to be imposed by both the European Union and Canada, which decreased our sales. To keep our prices competitive, we had to give discounts to our European and Canadian partners, lowering profitability. Which meant less opportunity to expand and support our workers. 
Since the second Trump administration’s policies have taken effect, our international business has come to a halt. The constant uncertainty means our customers don’t even know the actual price they’ll pay when they buy our canoes. And our European distributors are wary of a trade war. From the time they place an order it takes months before the container of canoes arrives at a European port, and our distributors can’t risk that tariffs will be imposed during the lag time. 
On this side of the Atlantic, a large Canadian retailer cancelled nearly his entire order. I inquired what he planned to substitute for our canoes. He replied he’d order from a Canadian brand. When I asked why he hadn’t done so before, he answered that their canoes are lower quality and more expensive.
He explained he couldn’t sell our canoes in the current political environment. In his words, Trump has done more to unite Canadians — conservatives and liberals — than anything in recent history. He explained that even if the tariffs were removed, no one would buy our canoes now because Canadians are boycotting products from the United States. 
When trade opens up again — whether it’s in one year or in four — the customers won’t necessarily come back. Once they’ve established new buying habits, we’ll have to invest more capital to change their purchasing behavior again. What’s infuriating is that we have already invested resources to open those markets. 
The goal of any administration should be to facilitate business, not disrupt it.
Meanwhile, our domestic business is threatened by the Trump administration’s plans to eliminate the environmental review for proposed copper sulfide mines adjacent to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. We build canoes in Minnesota because of the BWCA. More canoes are paddled in the Boundary Waters than anywhere else in the nation. The BWCA has some of the cleanest water in the world — many paddlers drink directly from the lakes.
According to the Environmental Protection Agency, hard rock mining is among the biggest emitters of toxic chemicals — such as sulfuric acid, mercury and arsenic — of any industry. Mining companies assure us the toxic chemicals will be contained by tailings dams. But many of these pollutants last hundreds of years. It’s unrealistic to believe a dam can be constructed that will last hundreds of years when the Rapidan Dam on the Blue Earth River recently failed after only 115 years. 
An accidental release into the BWCA would be catastrophic for the environment, and for our business. The release of toxic chemicals into the pristine ecosystem would dramatically reduce BWCA visitation. Longer-term, it would force many BWCA-related businesses to close, while substantially decreasing property values in our region. It is imperative for our business, the economy of northeastern Minnesota, and the country that the BWCA remains permanently protected. 
Between the sloppy rollout of tariffs and bullheaded support for mining without regard to the consequences, the Trump administration is mounting a full-scale assault on our small business. 
You don’t have to look far to find other casualties. 
We elected a businessman. Why doesn’t he behave like one?

(Maddie McGarvey for KFF Health News)For many years, Eric Wunderlin’s health issues made it hard to find stable employment.
Struggling to manage depression and diabetes, Wunderlin worked part-time, minimum-wage retail jobs around Dayton, Ohio, making so little he said he sometimes had to choose between paying rent and buying food.
But in 2018, his CareSource Medicaid health plan offered him help getting a job. It connected him to a life coach, who helped him find full-time work with health benefits. Now, he works for a nonprofit social service agency, a job he said has given him enough financial stability to plan a European vacation next year.
“I feel like a real person and I can go do things,” said Wunderlin, 42. “I feel like I pulled myself out of that slump.”
Republicans in Congress and several states, including Ohio, Iowa, and Montana, are pushing to implement work requirements for nondisabled adults, arguing a mandate would encourage enrollees to find jobs. And for Republicans pushing to require Medicaid enrollees to work, Wunderlin’s story could be held up as evidence that government health coverage can help people find employment and, ultimately, reduce their need for public assistance.
Yet his experience is rare. Medicaid typically does not offer such help, and when states do try to help, such efforts are limited.
And opponents point out that most Medicaid recipients already have jobs and say such a mandate would only kick eligible people off Medicaid, rather than improve their economic prospects. Nearly two-thirds of Medicaid enrollees work, with most of the rest acting as caregivers, going to school, or unable to hold a job due to disability or illness, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
Existing efforts to help Medicaid recipients get a job have seen limited success because there’s not a lot of “room to move the needle,” said Ben Sommers, a professor of health care economics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Most Medicaid enrollees already work — just not in jobs with health benefits, he said.
“The ongoing argument that some folks make is that there are a lot of people freeloading in Medicaid,” he said. “That’s just not supported by the evidence.”

Using Health Programs To Encourage Work
The GOP-controlled Congress could allow or require states to implement a Medicaid work requirement as part of revamping and downsizing Medicaid. The first Trump administration encouraged those work mandates, but many were struck down by federal judges who said they were illegal under federal law.
Policy experts and state officials say more attention should be paid to investments that have helped people find better jobs — from personalized life coaching to, in some cases, health plans’ directly hiring enrollees.
They argue work requirements alone are not enough. “The move to economic mobility requires a ladder, not a stick,” said Farah Khan, a fellow with the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan think tank.
While Medicaid work requirements have been debated for decades, the issue has become more heated as 40 states and Washington, D.C., have expanded Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act to the vast majority of low-income adults. More than 20 million adults have gained coverage as a result — but Republicans are now considering eliminating the billions in extra federal funding that helped states extend eligibility beyond groups including many children, pregnant women, and disabled people.
Only Georgia and Arkansas have implemented mandates that some Medicaid enrollees work, volunteer, go to school, or enroll in job training. But a study Sommers co-authored showed no evidence work requirements in Arkansas’ program led to more people working, in part because most of those who could work already were.
In Arkansas, more than 18,000 people lost coverage under the state’s requirement before the policy was suspended by a federal judge in 2019 after less than a year. Those who lost their Medicaid health care reported being unaware or confused about how to report work hours. Since 2023, Arkansas has been giving Medicaid health plans financial incentives to help enrollees train for jobs, but so far few have taken advantage.
Some plans, including Arkansas Blue Cross and Blue Shield’s, offer members $25 to $65 to complete a “career readiness” certificate. In 2024, some Arkansas health plans offered enrollees educational videos about topics including taxes and cryptocurrency.
Health plans don’t have an incentive to help someone find a better-paying job, because that could mean losing a customer if they then make too much to qualify for Medicaid, said Karin VanZant, a vice president at Clearlink Partners, a health care consulting company.
Rather than offering incentives for providing job training, some states, such as California and Ohio, require the insurance companies that run Medicaid to help enrollees find work.
In Montana, where some lawmakers are pushing to implement work requirements, a promising optional program nearly collapsed after state lawmakers required it be outsourced to private contractors.
Within the program’s first three years, the state paired 32,000 Medicaid enrollees with existing federally funded job training programs. Most had higher wages a year after starting training, the state found.
But enrollment has plummeted to just 11 people, according to the latest data provided by the state’s labor department.
Sarah Swanson, who heads the department, said several of the nonprofit contractors that ran the program shuttered. “There was no real part in this for us to deliver direct services to the folks that walked through our door,” she said. The state hopes to revive job training by allowing the department to work alongside contractors to reach more people.

The Hunt for Results
State officials say they don’t have much data to track the effectiveness of existing job programs offered by Medicaid plans.
Stephanie O’Grady, a spokesperson for the Ohio Department of Medicaid, said the state does not track outcomes because “the health plans are not employment agencies.”
Officials with CareSource, which operates Medicaid plans in multiple states, say it has about 2,300 Medicaid and ACA marketplace enrollees in its JobConnect program — about 1,400 in Ohio, 500 in Georgia, and 400 in Indiana.
The program connects job seekers with a life coach who counsels them on skills such as “showing up on time, dressing the part for interviews, and selling yourself during the interview,” said Jesse Reed, CareSource’s director of life services in Ohio.
 
Since 2023, about 800 people have found jobs through the program, according to Josh Boynton, a senior vice president at CareSource. The health plan itself has hired 29 Medicaid enrollees into customer service, pharmacy, and other positions — nearly all full-time with benefits, he said.
In 2022, California started offering nontraditional health benefits through Medicaid — including help finding jobs — for enrollees experiencing homelessness or serious mental illness, or who are otherwise at risk of avoidable emergency room care. As of September, it had served nearly 280,000 enrollees, but the state doesn’t have data on how many became employed.
The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, which is among the largest private employers in Pennsylvania, running both a sprawling hospital system and a Medicaid plan, has hired over 10,000 of its Medicaid enrollees since 2021 through its training and support services. Among other jobs, they took positions as warehouse workers, customer service representatives, and medical assistants.
The vast majority left low-paying jobs for full-time positions with health benefits, said Dan LaVallee, a senior director of UPMC Health Plan’s Center for Social Impact. “Our Pathways to Work program is a model for the nation,” he said.
Josh Archambault, a senior fellow with the conservative Cicero Institute, said Medicaid should focus on improving the financial health of those enrolled.
While the first Trump administration approved Medicaid work requirements in 13 states, the Biden administration or federal judges blocked all except Georgia’s.
“I don’t think states have been given ample chance to experiment and try to figure out what works,” Archambault said.

The country’s top nonpartisan government watchdog has confirmed it is examining the costs of running the nation’s only active Medicaid work requirement program, as Republican state and federal lawmakers consider similar requirements.
The U.S. Government Accountability Office told KFF Health News that its analysis of the Georgia Pathways to Coverage program could be released this fall.
In its first 100 days, the Trump administration has said rooting out waste in federal programs was a priority, allowing billionaire Elon Musk and the newly created Department of Government Efficiency broad latitude to fundamentally alter the operations of federal agencies.
The idea of a nationwide mandate that requires Medicaid enrollees to either work, study, or complete other qualifying activities to maintain coverage is gaining traction as congressional Republicans weigh proposals to cut $880 billion from the federal deficit over 10 years. The savings are intended to offset the costs of President Donald Trump’s priorities, including border security and tax cuts that would largely benefit the wealthy.
A majority of the public — regardless of political leaning — oppose funding cuts to Medicaid, according to polling released May 1 by KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
The GAO investigation comes at a critical time, said Leo Cuello, a research professor at Georgetown University’s Center for Children and Families.
“Congress seems to be pursuing cuts in Medicaid in a frenetic and rushed manner,” he said. The GAO report could outline for Congress the full extent of problems with work requirements “before they rush forward and do this without thinking.”
The experiences of Georgia and Arkansas — the only two states to have run such programs — show that work requirements depress Medicaid enrollment while adding costly layers of bureaucracy.
Now, more states are trying to get signoff from the Trump administration to approve work requirements for Medicaid, the state-federal program that offers health coverage to millions of Americans with low-incomes and disabilities.
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which approves Medicaid pilot programs such as work requirements, did not respond to a request for comment by publication.
The GAO found in 2019 that work requirement programs can be expensive for states to run — hundreds of millions of dollars, in some cases — and that federal officials failed to consider those costs when approving the programs, which cannot increase Medicaid spending.
Still, the Trump administration has supported work requirements. The programs require state employees to manually verify whether enrollees meet eligibility requirements and monitor their continued compliance.
In 2023, more than 90% of U.S. adults eligible for Medicaid expansion were already working or could be exempt from requirements, according to KFF.
During his confirmation hearing to lead CMS, Mehmet Oz said he was in favor of work requirements but didn’t think they should be used as “an obstacle, a disingenuous effort to block people from getting on Medicaid.”
The first Trump administration approved work requirements in 13 states. Nearly all the programs were blocked by the Biden administration or federal courts.
Georgia is one of 10 states that hasn’t fully expanded Medicaid to nearly all low-income adults.
The state launched Pathways to Coverage on July 1, 2023. It’s been a main policy priority of Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, whose office engaged in a lengthy court fight with the Biden administration after it tried to block the program.
The program cost more than $57 million in state and federal dollars through the end of 2024, with much of that going toward its administration. As of April 25, 7,410 people were enrolled, a small percentage of those who would be covered by a full Medicaid expansion. Pathways has also slowed processing times for other benefit programs in the state.
When asked about the costs and benefits of Pathways, Kemp spokesperson Garrison Douglas instead pointed to Georgia’s recently launched state-based Obamacare exchange. It saw record enrollment due, in part, to enhanced subsidies passed by the Biden administration.
“We are covering more Georgians than traditional Medicaid expansion would have, and for less money,” said Douglas, referring to the state, not federal, share of spending.
The enhanced subsidies that boosted enrollment are set to expire this year. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that extending them would cost the federal government about $335 billion over 10 years.
In March, Arkansas asked the Trump administration to relaunch its Medicaid work requirement program. The federal public comment period on the program runs through May 10. A previous version was halted by a court order in 2019, but not before more than 18,000 lost coverage in less than a year.
Georgia plans to request that the White House renew its program with modest changes, including reducing how frequently enrollees must prove to the state they’re working or engaging in other qualifying activities.
The GAO investigation into Georgia’s work requirement program comes after three Democratic U.S. senators — Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock of Georgia and Ron Wyden of Oregon — asked the GAO in December for an investigation into the program’s costs. Their request cited reporting by KFF Health News.
“I pushed for this GAO report because I am confident its findings will further support what we already know: Pathways to Coverage costs the taxpayers more money and covers fewer people than had the state simply joined 40 other states in closing the health care coverage gap,” Warnock said in a statement.
The GAO said it aims to figure out how much Georgia has spent to run the program, how much of that was federal money, and how that spending is being tracked.

(Getty Images)Sweeping changes to how the state’s public universities manage faculty tenure and campus governance were quietly folded into Indiana’s 2025 budget bill during the final hours of the legislative session despite limited lawmaker debate — and without opportunities for public input.
That’s in addition to other unorthodox provisions slipped into the state’s next two-year spending plan, like language to give Gov. Mike Braun total say over who sits on Indiana University’s Board of Trustees.
Braun has until May 6 to take action on the budget. If he does nothing, the plan automatically becomes law and takes effect July 1.
The new postsecondary rules require faculty at public colleges and universities to post their syllabi online and mandate “productivity” reviews for tenured professors.
Authority of faculty-led governing bodies was reduced, as well.










There’s been ongoing discussion about the efficiency in higher education, and that’s always a fair discussion as to how we maximize the use of taxpayer dollars.


– Rep. Jeff Thompson, R-Lizton


Faculty senates, for example, which are traditionally responsible for shaping a school’s academic policy, will now be limited to an advisory role. More authority will instead shift to university trustees and administrative leadership.
Republican supermajority leadership maintained the changes are necessary and defended using the budget as a vehicle bill.
House budget architect Rep. Jeff Thompson, R-Lizton, said the language was added because universities, like the rest of state government, need to slim spending.
The two-year budget cuts funding for the state’s public colleges by 5%.
“There’s been ongoing discussion about the efficiency in higher education, and that’s always a fair discussion as to how we maximize the use of taxpayer dollars,” Thompson said. “That’s an ongoing discussion. That’s one of our responsibilities.”
But Democrat Rep. Matt Pierce said the move was rushed and unvetted. 
 Rep. Matt Pierce, D-Bloomington, speaks from the floor on April 25, 2025. (Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
“We didn’t think we needed to hear from the public, or maybe even, heaven forbid, some faculty members or people who run universities, to kind of understand how they think this provision might work or not work. Would that not have been helpful?” Pierce, of Bloomington, asked Thompson on the House floor shortly before the session concluded.
Thompson reiterated that university governance “is a fiscal issue,” and that “sometimes, we make these decisions based on the information we have in front of us.”
Pierce and other Democrats disagreed, noting that the higher education provisions were not previously approved by either the House or Senate chambers, nor were they introduced or debated in other bills or amendments earlier in the session.
Faculty advocates further warned that the changes could threaten academic freedom and deter top scholars from staying in or coming to Indiana.
“The public is left to wonder, who put the supermajority on this track? Who is behind the scenes that has the influence to change decades, if not centuries, of the operation of universities?” Pierce questioned.
“All this crazy stuff … undermining faculty governance, treating them like they’re children, and every five years they’ve got to prove they’re doing their job,” he continued. “Those faculty — the best faculty, the researchers, the people who are searching for cures for cancer, the people learning about and understanding nanotechnology, the people who are going to solve the challenges of our day with science and investigation and inquiry — they’re out of here. They’re not going to put up with this.”
More changes to faculty tenure
Once the budget bill becomes law, all tenured professors at Indiana’s public colleges and universities must undergo formal “productivity reviews” at least once every five years.
Bill language specifies that evaluations should “measure” a professor’s “productivity,” which includes: 

the faculty member’s teaching workload;
the total number of graduate and undergraduate students taught by the faculty member;
the time spent on instructional assignments and overseeing graduate students; and
the research and creative scholarship productivity of the faculty member.

Institutions will be required to place faculty on probation if they do not meet the standards set through the review process. According to the legislation, that probation “may result in dismissal.”

The new review system is reminiscent of a law approved by the General Assembly and former Gov. Eric Holcomb in 2024 that seeks to promote “intellectual diversity” on Indiana campuses.
Boards of trustees decide what qualifies as “intellectual diversity,” although the term has been championed by Republican lawmakers who contend that conservative students and faculty members are increasingly ostracized at progressively liberal college and university settings — or at least perceive such shunning.
Under the law adopted last year, both nontenured and tenured faculty are judged on whether — and to what extent — they’ve delivered intellectually “diverse” instruction. University trustees are allowed to decide punishments for professors who fail to meet their school’s standards.
Boards are required to deny promotions and tenure to faculty members if, “based on past performance or other determination by the board,” they are “unlikely to foster … intellectual diversity.” Additionally, “intellectual diversity” must be considered in post-tenure reviews, which are now required at least every five years.
Governance changes on the way
Colleges’ governance groups, like faculty senates and councils, will also be relegated to “advisory only” roles.
Those bodies traditionally make decisions around faculty hiring and promotion processes, in addition to curricula and other academic policies.
Elected faculty groups will be able to recommend and vote on changes to key matters, but final authority will rest with university trustees and top administrators.
Indiana University alumni blast board of trustees changes slipped into state budget

Other budget provisions order public colleges and universities to regularly review their degree programs and either cut those that fall beneath a certain enrollment threshold, or get state approval to continue offering the programs. 
Schools could also be required to cut degrees that fail to meet the state’s standards for “quality, viability, and productivity.”
Chris Lowery, Indiana’s higher education commissioner, told lawmakers in April that his commission had already adopted provisions to “approve and disapprove” proposed or existing credentials offered by Indiana’s post-secondaries. There are roughly 3,400 programs currently offered by school statewide. Lowery wasn’t sure how many programs could — or should — be cut.
“I don’t know what the number is, but what we know in any sector, when you get to that high of a quantity, you should be asking and questioning, ‘Are we giving value to our fellow Hoosiers?’ … We have work to do there,” he said before the House Education Committee last month. “Although our colleges are doing a great job to prepare students for in-demand career opportunities … it’s clear the number is too large here, and we can simply be more efficient and effective with outcomes.”
Another section of the budget bill specifically calls out Indiana University by eliminating alumni input in the selection of university trustees. It instead gives decision-making power over the board’s membership to Braun.
Under current law, Indiana’s governor appoints five members to IU’s board and picks one student representative with the help of a student-led committee. Three other members must be IU graduates and are elected by other alumni.
The new state budget mandates all nine members to be appointed by the governor, and gives the executive leader the ability to, “at any time,” remove and replace a board member who was previously elected by the IU alumni.
Braun defended the policy move Wednesday, emphasizing that just a “fraction” of IU alumni participated in past votes to elect trustees.

Colorado had a 4.5% increase in births last year, the largest in the nation, as births increased nationally for the first time since 2021. (Courtesy of Jon Bahr/MilkShake Factory)The number of births in some Western states that are adding new housing rose last year, reversing losses the year before in many cases, according to new federal statistics released Wednesday.
Increases from 2023 to 2024 were highest in Colorado (4.5%), Idaho (3.8%), Utah (3.6%), Washington state and Nebraska (each 2.6%). Births increased around 2% in West Virginia, South Dakota, North Carolina, Montana, Rhode Island and South Carolina.
Almost all those states had decreases in births the previous year, and many have been building housing rapidly since 2023. Idaho, North Carolina and Utah have issued enough building permits in 2023 and 2024 to add about 4% to their housing stock, the highest in the nation.
Melissa Kearney, an economics professor at the University of Maryland who specializes in families and fertility, said there could be a link between homebuilding and more babies.
“It is quite possible that increased access to home ownership, coming from a reduction in the price of houses in places that are building more houses, could meaningfully increase birth rates,” Kearney told Stateline in an e-mail.
Many of the other states with increases in births are also seeing building booms: Colorado, Nebraska, South Carolina, South Dakota and Washington state are all set to add more than 2% to housing stock based on permits issued in 2023 and 2024, according to a Stateline analysis of U.S. Census Bureau Building Permits Survey data.


Building permits can take up to two years to translate into finished houses and apartments, but they indicate which states are most willing to allow new housing that can boost population, tax receipts and the workforce. In Colorado, Denver County is set to add almost 10,000 housing units and in Idaho, Ada County, which includes Boise, could add 11,200 units based on building permits.
Nationally births were slightly higher in 2024 than the year before, by about 1%, according to provisional federal numbers from the National Vital Statistics System within the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The fertility rate also increased slightly, but it remains below the “replacement level” needed to keep the population stable — 2.1 children for each woman over her lifetime.
All the increase nationally was in births to Hispanic and Asian mothers, with births continuing to decline for Black, American Indian and white mothers. Births to teenagers and women ages 20-24, in sharp decline since 2007, continued to drop last year, while births increased for women 25 and older.
The number of births dropped most in states struggling with stagnant population: falling about 4% in Louisiana, 3% in Mississippi, and 2% in New Mexico and New Hampshire. All those states had little or no population growth between mid-2023 and mid-2024, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates.

(Courtesy of the Arkansas Department of Energy and Environment)Larry Bengal was on a mission.
His target? The band playing during the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact’s annual meeting, which was in Arkansas in 2003. More specifically, a member of that band: Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee.
“I told my wife, ‘Let’s go up and meet Gov. Huckabee,’ because he was playing with his band, Capitol Offense, at the time,” Bengal said. 
As Bengal reached out to shake the governor’s hand, Huckabee jumped off the stage.
“I thought, ‘This is really great, Arkansas is a friendly place,’” Bengal said. 
Instead of shaking his hand, Huckabee walked past Bengal and helped his wife who had slipped on the dance floor and was lying “flat on her back.”
“My first words to the governor, who I would end up working for two years later, were, ‘She hasn’t been drinking, governor,’” Bengal said. “He was a Baptist preacher, so I thought, ‘Oh, I gotta say something.’” 
The incident must not have left a poor impression on Huckabee who in 2005 named Bengal director of the Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission, a position he held for 20 years before handing it over to his successor, Allen York, last month. While Bengal remained the state’s chief energy administrator, he passed on that title as well Wednesday, his official retirement date.
“I am extremely pleased with my time; I’ll be retiring here in Arkansas,” Bengal said.
Possessing a deep knowledge of the oil and gas industry that many at the Department of Energy and Environment and beyond have praised, Bengal came to Arkansas after stints in the private sector and then as the director of the Illinois equivalent of the AOGC. 
During his two decades as director, he oversaw pivotal moments in the state’s oil and gas sector, such as the rise and fall of the Fayetteville Shale play, and more recently, the growing push to source lithium directly from salty brines deep underground in south Arkansas. 
He also studied well-induced seismicity — earthquakes caused by deep injection wells — served as a representative to the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact and testified before Congress.
Reaching for the stars
While Bengal’s career focused on the earth and what lies within it, he was inspired by programs created for the sake of reaching the stars. 
“In the ‘60s, when Russia was putting up Sputnik and we were behind in the space program, President [John F.] Kennedy, as we all know, made a pledge to go to the moon by the end of the decade,” Bengal said. “He also started science projects around the country because we were way behind, everyone thought, in science and technology. And one of the programs that he started was called the Earth Science Curriculum Project, which was a federal program to teach earth science to high schoolers.”
Various high schools around the country were selected for the program, Bengal said, including his own in Philadelphia. 
“At 15 years old, I took that course and fell in love with geology. So I’ve only ever wanted to be a geologist,” Bengal said.
He attended the University of Wisconsin, earned his bachelors degree and then started a decades-long career in geology, oil and gas, although he started as a geologist at a time where coal dominated the energy industry. 
“Back in the ‘70s, when I started, coal was king,” Bengal recalled. “We were running out of gas, and I started my career because the country wanted to make gas out of coal.”
He spent several years in Illinois, working for its geological survey and then later for its oil and gas regulator. 
Fayetteville fracking
Reflecting on his career in an interview last month, Bengal said the Fayetteville Shale stood out in his mind as one of the defining aspects of his career. He wrote many of the rules promulgated by the commission during his tenure, including some of the first regulations in the country to regulate hydraulic fracturing (better known as fracking) fluids, after public concern about chemicals and pollution from the practice of extracting natural gas grew louder and louder.
Fracking, by his explanation, had been happening for decades prior to the natural gas boom earlier this century, just never at that scale. Bengal said the massive amounts of fluid and chemicals getting pumped into the ground as a result was why fracking had “captured the public interest.”
“The public really was inundated with all sorts of, I guess, misinformation and horror stories of what was happening with hydraulic fracturing, that it was contaminating the water” Bengal said. “All of this [fracking] was happening at such depths that that was not the case.”
The interest in fracking made it, and Arkansas by extension, a worldwide issue.
However, there were examples in other areas of the country where a defective well “had caused an issue” — although Bengal said those were “small in extent” — so states had to take action to “allay those fears and show that it was done safely.”
The commission’s work during the play was also crucial in preparing it for the next big rush, Bengal said, this time for lithium.
“Fortunately for Arkansas, we’ve already learned some of those lessons in brine production because we already have a brine statute; I think we’re the only state that has a brine statute,” he said. “We’ve learned to be diligent in trying to understand issues before we knee-jerk a solution.” 
Bengal said he feels “fortunate and blessed” to have worked on the development of the Fayetteville Shale and lithium, as well as the challenges of dealing with earthquakes.   
“You don’t get an opportunity much to deal with new things and be involved in the development of solutions to address those new things,” he said. “I feel very fortunate that I was able to be in Arkansas and be involved in so much of that development.”
While Bengal may be retiring, he’s not going far. 
In an emailed statement congratulating the man her father hired 20 years ago, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said she would be appointing Bengal as an AOGC commissioner.
“Congratulations to Larry Bengal on an incredible 20 years at the Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission,” Sanders said. “We trusted Larry to help build up Arkansas’ modern oil and gas industry. And more recently, we’ve happily leaned on him to develop the lithium industry in South Arkansas, which is why I am proud to appoint him as a member to the Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission to continue his great work.”

(Niki Kelly/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Editor of the Indiana Capital Chronicle Niki Kelly recently shared why the end of the legislative session is her least favorite season. Kelly wonders why the democratic processes that are embraced throughout most of the session are thrown out at the end, particularly through amendments with new or unpopular bill language. However, we argue that this is not just an end of session issue or a shortcoming of the current crop of state legislators, it is by design. This institutional arrangement largely shuts out the very people it claims to represent – the people.
We have a deeper understanding of this concept after we were fortunate enough to team-teach a course, Applied Political Philosophy, at the University of Indianapolis. By training, one of us is a political scientist (Shufeldt) and the other a philosopher (Davidson).
Lawmakers and their terrible, horrible, no good, very bad end of session

Our students started by reading political philosophy, including works from Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, John Stuart Mill, Isaiah Berlin, and John Rawls. We encouraged them to think about what gives the government its legitimacy, the appropriate uses of power, and what constitutes a compelling government interest. In a democracy, many of these ideas revolve around the idea of the “consent of the governed.”
To apply these ideas, students tracked and analyzed bills throughout the legislative session. They were free to pick any legislation they wanted and were encouraged to identify bills they supported or opposed. We did not impose any restrictions or parameters – their selected bills ranged from relatively obscure (but important) to more controversial, contentious pieces of legislation (like House Bill 1393 or Senate Bill 10).
Like our students, any Hoosier can track legislation to better understand the legislative process. The IGA website has vastly improved over the years allowing citizens to watch committee hearings or discussion in the House or Senate. Our students were able to report on the progress of their bills from the comfort of their dorm rooms. The website is relatively up-to-date, giving everyday citizens the ability to see vote outcomes, a schedule for each day, and current bill language and amendments. Moreover, the media landscape in Indianapolis – in no small part thanks to nonprofit newsrooms like the Indiana Capital Chronicle – allows citizens to stay informed about what is happening at the statehouse.
 Transparency doesn’t make participation easier
However, being informed and being able to participate in democracy are not the same. Indiana has what political scientists call a “citizen” or part-time legislature. Session began in January and recently concluded. This part-time calendar has a host of consequences – it affects who is able to serve (especially young people), it artificially speeds up aspects of the legislative process, and leads to large, omnibus pieces of legislation covering far too many topics alongside the inclusion of unpopular ideas without being vetted by committees, but perhaps most problematically – it makes it more difficult for everyday citizens to play a role in the legislative process.
We equipped our students with the knowledge they need to engage in citizen lobbying. We led them through the process of scheduling a meeting: sending an introductory email, making daily follow-up phone calls, and looking out for legislators once we arrived at the statehouse. Of our seventeen students, fourteen were able to have at least one meeting with an elected official (or their legislative assistant) on their own or to join a classmate in their meeting, and we are eternally grateful to the elected officials who took time to speak with our students.

However, the casual relationship with time at the state capitol shuts out everyday voters. Many students lamented the near radio silence in response to their repeated emails and phone calls, the frequent last-minute cancellations or hours-long delays, and double-booked appointments. The typical voter cannot be at the capitol all day, every day, just to have a five minute meeting with an elected official meant to represent their concerns. Without paid lobbyists, citizens are less able to catch last minute amendments or previously thought-to-be dead bill language that gets revived, nor can they afford to wait a few more hours until the legislator is “free” to meet. While our students at UIndy benefit from being a ten-minute drive to the state capitol, Hoosiers traveling from each of the four corners of the state may miss their opportunity for their voices to be heard.
Making space to hear everyday people is not the sole responsibility of individual elected officials. The limited availability of legislators is an institutional failure–one that arises from the design of the assembly and calendar rather than only the individual choices of legislators. Whether students agreed with their legislator or supported the outcome of a bill, a healthy democracy requires citizen involvement, and the institutions must be designed in ways that support this engagement.
Getting shut out of the process and seeing the IGA in action has led some of our students to grow more pessimistic – threatening to lower Indiana’s already abysmal rates of voter participation. For some students, gaining the “tools necessary to feel empowered to change government” (according to their reflections) only made them more committed to the process . Regardless of any individual student’s reaction, the Indiana General Assembly must address the institutional barriers that shut out everyday citizens – they work for us, afterall.

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)A massive May Day protest stretched along multiple city blocks in Milwaukee, as marchers walked from the South Side to Zeidler Union Square Park in downtown. The annual protest brought union organizers, immigrant rights advocates, Indigenous community activists, students from across Wisconsin and other members of the public together to make a stand against the policies of President Donald Trump.
Despite rainy weather, hundreds of participants turned out for Milwaukee’s May Day march, with another protest planned in Madison on Friday. Prior to the march, the morning began with prayers and words from community leaders. Mark Denning, a member of the Oneida Nation, said to the crowd on Thursday that “all prayer goes to the same place” and that “all creation stories are true.” Denning said, “as we stand here together under this sheltering sky that’s giving us this beautiful rain…I want to share that your ancestors are forever. Your future is forever.”

“Natives stand as a lesson to each and every one of you that the injustices of the past cannot be the injustices of the future,” said Denning, calling himself “a remnant of the wars that have been done on my people” and the May Day marchers “a remnant of the wars that must be corrected.” Denning went on to tell the crowd “you are now of this place! You are now of this land, and of these waters! And you will not be denied because this is where your children will be born and have a future!” The crowd cheered in response.
Although the May 1 march for immigrant workers’ rights is an annual tradition in Milwaukee, this year brought with it a new sense of fear buffered by local determination. Waves of arrests have swept communities nationwide, populating social media feeds with images of immigrants and  international students detained by masked, plain-clothes federal agents.
In Milwaukee, local advocates recently learned that agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) have been paying visits to the homes of sponsors of unaccompanied immigrant minors, causing fear of possible deportations. After ICE raids at the Milwaukee County Courthouse provoked outrage, Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan was arrested and accused of obstructing federal agents who arrived outside her courtroom to arrest a man appearing for a hearing. Protests erupted the weekend after Dugan was arrested, building momentum leading up to the May Day march.

Milwaukee marchers  joined a larger network of groups organizing May Day protests in at least 32 states. Rain showers came and went as the marchers traversed the city. People of all ages came out, including  high school students and their young siblings and grey-haired elders. Different sections of the march had different chants and atmospheres. Palestinian flags waved in the breeze alongside American flags (some of which were upside down), Mexican flags, LGBTQ+ flags, and numerous other banners. Milwaukee police officers escorted the demonstration on motorcycles and bicycles, while unmarked surveillance vans patrolled  the perimeter. 
Within an hour, the marchers arrived at Zeidler Union Square Park in the downtown area. Gathering around a central pavilion, the crowd listened to Christine Neumann-Ortiz, executive director of Voces de la Frontera, who said people had come from as far away as Arcadia in Trempealeau County to be part of the event. “We know that when we unite we are stronger, and we can achieve what seems impossible,” said Neumann-Ortiz.

Speakers called for the charges to be dropped against Dugan, for ICE to stay out of local courts, for constitutional rights to be defended and for people to take a stand against fear. Missy Zombor, president of the Milwaukee Public School Board, said that the school district is ready to honor and fight for the ideals and sense of hope that her own grandparents sought when they immigrated to America. 
Zombor said that the school district will honor its safe haven resolution. “Our schools are and will always be safe havens for children,” she said, “regardless of their background, their immigration status, their identity, or their circumstance.” The Milwaukee Public School District, Zombor said, is strengthened by the diverse languages, cultures and backgrounds of  the student body, which includes many student activists. “Our schools are going to continue to promote a curriculum that gives students the knowledge and power to question the world in a way that helps students uproot the causes of racism and inequality,” said Zombor. “Our schools are going to teach the next generation of change-makers.” 
Former Milwaukee judge Jim Gramling Jr. called Dugan’s arrest “a very unfortunate and very dangerous thing.” Gramling said that the unusual, public arrest of a judge at the courthouse “was clearly designed to intimidate other judges and those who seek justice in our courts.” He added  that federal authorities had a week to invite Dugan into the U.S. Attorney’s Office to discuss the case. Instead, Gramling said, “they wanted a public display to embarrass her, to humiliate her, and to intimidate others in the justice system from resolving immigration matters.”

Gramling stressed that judges need to be free of pressure from outside influences, so that they can decide cases based on the facts before them. “And yet we have a president who’s threatening the firing of judges, because of decisions that he doesn’t like,” said Gramling. “And now we have a judge treated like a common criminal by that president’s agents.” Dugan is a long-time and respected member of the community, Gramling said, having served in  leadership roles at local non-profits  and that she doesn’t deserve what’s happened to her. 
Milwaukee student activists also spoke, saying that student voices should not be stifled, and that free speech means little when young people fear retaliation. The students called for Milwaukee police officers to be taken out of Milwaukee Public Schools. Removing school resources officers was a decision made by the school board after years of student organizing. But the state Legislature has demanded that Milwaukee return police to schools as a condition of state aid.

Immigration operations add a new layer of fear for students who already dread the return of school resource officers. Milwaukee police have a standard operating procedure which limits the department’s  involvement in immigration matters, stating that “proactive immigration enforcement by local police can be detrimental to our mission and policing philosophy when doing so deters some individuals from participating in their civic obligation to assist the police.” 
Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) students joined the May Day march, denouncing ICE and encouraging people to stand in solidarity with immigrants. “Don’t let fear imprison you in the shadows,” one student said from the stage. “Join us. We will keep each other safe.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_2408-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-02 07:03:12.183847

How bad is it?  Well, the Department of Environmental Quality just approved yet another application for a 45-condo development using septic systems within a quarter mile of the already-hammered river.  Mind you, this is after the Gallatin was formally declared “impaired” last year due to nutrient overload which now feeds the neon green algae blooms in this once gin-clear river downstream from Big Sky.  
The state agency is obviously ignoring the fact that putting even more nutrients in the Gallatin will only exacerbate its “impaired” status — the exact opposite of what “regulatory” agencies are supposed to do to uphold Montanans’ “inalienable right to a clean and healthful environment” (according to the state’s constitution, Article II, Section 3), as well as the constitutional mandate that “the state and each person shall maintain and improve a clean and healthful environment in Montana for present and future generations.” (Article IX, Section 1)
It’s tough to find any other interpretation of those plain language constitutional guarantees than if there’s already an environmental pollution problem, the onus is on the state to “maintain and improve” the environment, not approve and allow even more pollution.  
Gov. Greg Gianforte, a religious man, swore an oath on the Bible to uphold the Constitution — but that obviously doesn’t mean much when the big money at Big Sky wants yet more overdevelopment and more pollution.   
This is the second phase of the Quarry development which, as reported by Brett French, wants “136 single-family condos, 130 multifamily condos and 11 mixed-use buildings.”  Yet, that’s just a tiny fraction of the 1,354 additional homes the Big Sky Resort Area District says it will need in the next three years as housing for their underpaid workers.
What’s even more shocking is the fact this decision comes only days after the release of a hydrogeologic study by Montana Bureau of Mines and Geology that compared the undeveloped side of the Gallatin with the Big Sky side.  Their conclusion?  The aquifer is “shallow, unconfined, and vulnerable to contamination.”  In other words, the septic effluent has a short trip from the drain field to the aquifer to the Gallatin. 
In the meantime, DEQ is claiming that most of the nitrogen polluting the Gallatin is “natural” — and that septic effluent is only a minor input.  Which begs the question: How was it possible that the Gallatin ran clear and clean for thousands of years before Big Sky, the Yellowstone Club, and the ever-growing cluster of real estate developments started dumping their waste on the mountain and in the river? 
It’s no mystery where the nutrients causing the algae blooms are coming from — and no, it’s not from the bison in Yellowstone National Park.  It’s from the pollution emanating from this bizarre enclave of the wealthy stuffed into a narrow canyon with nowhere for their waste to go but down to the Gallatin.
In short, what we’re seeing is an abject failure of Montana’s so-called “environmental regulatory” agency — aided and abetted by the Gallatin County Commissioners who, when the rich say “jump,” they jump to approve.  
As for a “clean and healthy environment for present and future generations of Montanans” — without enforcement that prescient mandate of our Constitution is just words on paper as the Gallatin River cries “mayday, mayday, mayday” to deaf ears.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Gallatin-River-Green.jpg,,,2025-05-02 07:03:12.183847

Russ Fulcher, R-Idaho, speaks with Republican supporters at the Idaho GOP election night watch party at the Grove Hotel in Boise, Idaho, on Nov. 8, 2022. (Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)U.S. Rep. Russ Fulcher, R-Idaho, sits on the House committee tasked with finding $880 billion in spending cuts over the next decade.
While he stressed that the House Committee on Energy and Commerce is early into searching for cuts, he offered a preview for what’s on the table in an interview with the Idaho Capital Sun on Monday.
“The big takeaway is, number one, our objective is to save it,” Fulcher said of Medicaid. “… And I think we’re going to get there. Number two: our objective is to keep the benefits intact for everybody it was intended for. And I think we’re going to get there.”
Asked what he meant by Medicaid’s intended population, Fulcher described what Medicaid enrollment looked like before the Affordable Care Act prompted all but 10 states to expand Medicaid.
“Disabled people, elderly people who truly need the health care, and they don’t have any other channel to get it. And that’s what Medicaid was designed for. And we’re trying to make sure that that remains intact,” he said.
But Fulcher pushed back on what he called misinformation about congressional Medicaid spending cut plans, naming U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, an Independent from Vermont, and U.S.  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-New York, who recently visited Idaho for a rally.
“I know exactly where they’re coming from, and they would like to see a universal health care system. And there was a big push to make Medicaid that vehicle — and it was just never designed for that,” Fulcher said.
“If you’re working-age, able-bodied, I think that there’s a reasonable chance that that’s going to change. But at the same time, I would say there’s some fairness in there too, because that was really never what was envisioned with the program. It’s just the expansion population included everybody, and there was never any discussion for a funding mechanism,” Fulcher said. “So shame on all of us for letting that happen.”
But not all of the House’s planned cuts need to come from Medicaid, he said. One of the first places the committee will look is to end mandates for electric vehicles and green energy, which he said could combine to well over $100 billion alone.

 Federal Medicaid cuts being considered by Republicans in U.S. Congress

For Medicaid, several savings options are on the table, Fulcher said, like:
Medicaid work requirements for “working-age, able-bodied people.” That could also come with a range of exceptions, Fulcher said, like for people with disabilities or who are medically frail, Native American tribe members, people under the age of 19, people over the age of 64, and people in school or training. There might also be hardship waivers, he said, targeted to counties with higher unemployment rates.
“If we simply employ that — which, frankly, I think is warranted, because it was never intended for the working age, able-bodied, ever — then you might get the rest of the way,” Fulcher told the Sun. “We very well may get the rest of the way of the savings target we’re trying to hit.”
Rule changes for noncitizens and people enrolled in Medicaid in several states at the same time. (In Idaho, noncitizens do not qualify for Medicaid generally. But they can qualify for emergency services paid by Medicaid.)
Cutting states’ higher matching rate for Medicaid expansion hasn’t been discussed — yet, Fulcher said.

“I’m not saying it’s not going to be. But that’s not discussed yet. And I think part of the reason why is we want to know how much savings we think we can get” in other ways, Fulcher said.
But any federal cuts to Medicaid expansion match rates could have ripple effects that could force states into tough decisions about whether to continue Medicaid expansion. Here’s how:

If the feds cut their Medicaid expansion match rate, Medicaid expansion in nine states would automatically be repealed, based on trigger laws in those states, according to Georgetown University’s Center for Children and Families.
In Idaho, cutting the federal match rate for Medicaid expansion would either: Trigger a review by the Idaho Legislature when it is in session based on one law, or allow the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare director to use broad program cut powers recently given to him by a new state law.
Here’s how the federal match rate works: The federal government covers 90% of a state’s Medicaid expansion costs, through the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010. That’s significantly higher than the typical Medicaid federal matching rate, which is adjusted each year based on states’ economic performance. Idaho usually gets 70% of its non-expansion Medicaid costs covered by the federal government.

Provider taxes are a complex process states use to get additional federal Medicaid funds, Fulcher explained. Typically hospitals are taxed some amount that states claim as a Medicaid expense to get additional federal funds. In Idaho, it’s called the hospital assessment tax. Across the nation, Fulcher said provider taxes account for about $600 billion.
“That was never intended for that to be the process. And so this provider tax issue has really turned into kind of a milking of the federal system. And we don’t know how much of that is really going for care, and just how much that is going to other expenses for hospitals,” Fulcher said. “We just don’t know. It might all be legitimate.”
A long way out: Fulcher stressed the U.S. House’s process to find spending cuts is just starting, and that Congress is likely months away from passing bills for cuts.
The U.S. House and Senate have passed competing budget cut plans, and both need to reconcile their differences for policies to pass both chambers.
“The current budget resolution goes through the end of September. And frankly, I think we’re going to chew up all that time. Because what’s likely to happen is our committee is going to come up with something, and it will pass the House. And then the Senate is — their committees are going to come up with something else. It’s going to pass the Senate. And then we’re going to grind it up between the two,” Fulcher said. “So this is a long long way, I think, from fruition.”

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — After debate that spilled into three days, Nebraska lawmakers on Thursday advanced a bundle of “public safety” proposals highlighted by a contentious provision to lower the age at which a Nebraska youth can be detained — to 11 years old.
The age drop was backed by Gov. Jim Pillen and originally included in a bill by Ralston State Sen. Merv Riepe, which did not fully make it out of committee but did, in part, emerge in the bundle now known as Legislative Bill 530.

Segments of at least nine bills were folded into the megabill before the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee moved it to the floor for full debate. Lawmakers advanced it 33-0, with 16 senators marking present not voting, to move the package to final reading.
The vote came after committee chair, Lincoln State Sen. Carolyn Bosn, agreed to continue negotiations with Democratic lawmakers who view the juvenile justice elements as overly punitive. Several have said prevention and rehabilitation services are more effective when dealing with young people whose brains are still developing.
“It costs more to imprison our kids,” said State Sen. Ashlei Spivey of Omaha. “Juveniles have the most chance for rehabilitation … We should be investing in resources and not detaining fifth graders.”
 Threads the needle 

Bosn, a former prosecutor, views the overall package as one that promotes public safety and better re-directs juveniles who have veered into trouble.
“The public has the right to feel safe in their communities while juveniles also have the right to be set up for success. I think this threads that needle perfectly.”
While the Riepe proposal to reduce the minimum detention age from 13 to 11 stirred the most objection, the Ralston lawmaker noted that another previously contentious element was not included in the larger package. That piece would have lowered the age at which a teen could be charged as an adult for serious felonies, from 14 to 12.

He reiterated his stance that the younger age was necessary due to a rise in serious violent offenses by younger kids, and said he relied on information from the Douglas County sheriff and attorney. The goal, Riepe said, is to “intercept a cycle, step in before it’s too late.”
State Sen. Terrell McKinney said juvenile crime has gone down overall. He said the Omaha mayor has campaigned on less crime in the city. “Where’s the research, where’s the data?” he asked Riepe.
Riepe’s LB 556, during a March 13 public hearing, garnered support from a Pillen representative and seven others, while 28 testified in opposition. In addition, 115 wrote in opposition while two people  submitted letters of support.
 Advocates decry package 

Thursday’s vote prompted a statement from the ACLU of Nebraska, Voices for Children and RISE, which supports people transitioning out of incarceration. The groups criticized amendments that expanded felony offenses as well as the proposed drop in the minimum age for detention. 
They noted that among the reasons a preteen could be detained, under the proposed legislation, is if the youth exhibited signs of self-harm.











Detention facilities are not mental health or healthcare facilities or safe havens. Our children deserve better.”


– Jasmine Harris of RISE



“Expanding felonies, harshening penalties and detaining children as young as 11 will not build safer or stronger communities,” said Jason Witmer, policy fellow with the ACLU Nebraska. “LB 530 is very clearly still a step backward on smart criminal and juvenile justice policy.”
Jasmine Harris, director of public policy at RISE, said preteens should be receiving attention that addresses underlying mental, behavioral and environmental conditions that put them in touch with the juvenile justice system.
“Detention facilities are not mental health or healthcare facilities or safe havens,” she said in a statement. “Our children deserve better.”
 ‘Super predator’ group  

Spivey sought unsuccessfully to strike a few provisions in the package — including one she said demonized Black youth — but said she was hopeful negotiations would continue with Judiciary Committee leaders before the final lawmaking step.

Among her failed amendments was one to eliminate creation of a “high-risk juvenile probationer” category that Spivey said would be viewed as a “super predator” group. She said it would open the door to harsher sentencing and disproportionate harm to youths of color. 
Another part of LB 684 that remained despite Spivey’s protest requires the Office of Probation to generate a list of all juveniles on probation in each county by the first day of the month and then provide it to each law enforcement agency in that county.
“It is unnecessary over-surveillance of those young people,” she said, adding that law enforcement already has access to such information.
Spivey was able to garner enough votes to stop the elevation of a penalty if a youth on probation tampers with the young person’s  electronic monitoring device. Spivey said the offense would, for now, remain a misdemeanor versus a felony.

State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha criticized the package as “logrolling” questionably related bills that were too wide-ranging. He said it creates confusion for constituents, who might wonder why their elected official doesn’t support a certain program that is wrapped up in the package.
State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of Omaha introduced the underlying LB 530 as “public safety” legislation that aims partly to raise fines for speeding violations and to change the law to help “vulnerable road users.” 
 Package components 

Among other bills folded into the package:
LB 6, introduced by Bosn and aimed at fentanyl poisoning, calls for enhanced penalties when the person using the controlled substance dies or sustains serious injury. 
LB 44, by McKinney, allows individuals to file for post-conviction relief up until the age of 21 if the conviction occurred as a minor.
LB 124, by State Sen. Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue, would match a drunken driver’s penalty for motor vehicle homicide of an unborn child to the penalty that drunken driver would get for motor vehicle homicide.
LB 395, by State Sen. Barry DeKay of Niobrara, would allow police access to a sealed juvenile record when someone applies for a concealed handgun permit.
 LB 404, by State Sen. Robert Hallstrom of Syracuse, authorizes courts to extend a term of probation upon a joint application from the probation officer and the person on probation. 
LB 600, by State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Omaha, authorizes the Department of Transportation to temporarily reduce speed limits on highways under specific conditions such as adverse weather or a traffic congestion. 
LB 684, by State Sen. Eliot Bostar of Lincoln, was essentially gutted and replaced by a series of juvenile justice measures, including the lowering of the age at which a youth could be detained in a facility. Bosn said the Judiciary Committee sees the measures as ways to “improve accountability for juveniles and transparency for law enforcement.” Spivey said the measures were among the most concerning in the package.

  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
The Examiner has not been able to confirm the authenticity of the email, but WISN News, the ABC affiliate in Milwaukee, reported that two Wisconsin judges confirmed to the station that they had received it from Isham. In the email, Isham allegedly said she would  refuse to appear in  court unless she received “guidance” and “support” concerning the presence and permissible activities of ICE agents. 
Over the weekend of April 26-27, right-wing media outlets obtained and shared the email they claimed Isham sent to other judges.
On Monday and Tuesday Isham appeared in court via Zoom.
There is also  added security in the court, and a Sawyer County Deputy told the Wisconsin Examiner there had been a threat to a judge.

Isham was elected in November 2023 to the newly created Branch 2 court in an uncontested race. She is a member of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians and is the first female and first Native American judge in Sawyer County and only the second Native American circuit court judge in Wisconsin.
In the email, Isham reportedly noted she had sworn an oath of support to the U.S. and the Wisconsin constitutions. She also reportedly added that  Judge Dugan was standing by her oath of office when she confronted ICE officers who came to her courtroom in Milwaukee and escorted the defendant they’d come to arrest out a side door. 
“Yesterday, Judge Hannah Dugan of Milwaukee County stood on her Oath in the very building she swore to uphold it and she was arrested and charged with felonies for it. Enough is enough,” the email message said.
“I have no intention of allowing anyone to be taken out of my courtroom by ICE and sent to a concentration camp, especially without due process as BOTH of the constitutions we swore to support requires. Should I start raising ball money?”
Criticism of Isham
Isham’s reported threat to not hold court out of concern about interactions with ICE agents drew criticism from three northern Wisconsin Republican legislators who represent Sawyer County.
Republican U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany said Isham should resign.
“Monica Isham is choosing to protect illegal aliens over the law,” Tiffany wrote on X. “She should resign or be removed.”
State Sen. Romaine Quinn and state Rep. Chanz Green,  issued a joint statement: “Wisconsin’s Code of Judicial Conduct requires a judge to uphold the integrity of the judiciary. It further states that ‘a judge shall respect and comply with the law and shall act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.’
“Judge Isham’s threat to close court certainly does not promote public confidence in our court system or uphold the integrity of her position as a public official in this state. It is a disservice to the residents of Sawyer County.”
In their joint statement, Quinn and Green note that there had been an intensive effort to expand Sawyer County’s court to the second branch, which was officially recognized in 2023, and they go on to say that if Isham will not exercise her duties, then she should resign.
The Republican Party chair for the 7th CD, Jim Miller, who is also the president of the Hayward City Council, said he has empathy for Judge Isham for saying in the email that she had faced racism in her courtroom.
“That’s sad that she’s had to face that,” said Miller. “If that were my court and I faced racism, I would have held those people in contempt of court.”
However, Miller said that Isham’s threat not to hold court was drawing the ire of many people he had talked to.
“That does not sit well with people because they expect her to be a public servant,” said Miller. “If she is going to get a paycheck, she should come in and do her job. You can’t just boycott working as a public servant. It doesn’t work that way.”
Isham has so far continued to hold court via Zoom. 
Miller is also critical of Isham reportedly mentioning those detained by ICE would be sent to a “concentration camp.”
“My recommendation would be for her to at least clarify or maybe apologize for that statement, because that’s a stretch beyond stretch,” said Miller. “People like to throw out the Nazi references on both sides of the aisle, and it really muddies the argument of what’s going on.”
He added, “I think her emotions got the best of her, but I think people have real questions about her ability to make sure that justice is blind at this point, and that’s the biggest concern.”
Support for Isham
On Thursday, May 1, there was a large demonstration at the corners of state highways 27 and 63 in the city of Hayward with many people holding signs supporting Isham.
At 2 p.m. approximately 80 demonstrators left the corner by the state highways and walked two blocks by the Sawyer County Courthouse, and they were joined at the courthouse by over 20 students from Lac Courte Oreilles K-12 school who said they came out to support Isham, a fellow tribal member.
 “I’m here to fight for Judge Isham and what we stand for, and I find it inspiring to be here,” said Ashland Demonie, 14.
However, Denomie was also appalled to see some adults driving by swearing at the students and giving the youngsters the middle finger.
“It bothers me because we are just children here fighting for our rights and fighting for who we are, and seeing how harsh some adults respond, who should be more mature, is troubling,” she said.
Ode’iminke Leach, 15, is also a student who came out to support Isham and advocate for Native Americans.
“I’m out here protesting because I support Judges Isham and Dugan,” said Elizabeth Riley of Hayward, a Democrat who has run twice for the 74th Assembly District.

Riley said she feared that under President Donald Trump, the U.S. would not follow the rule of law but become more like a developing nation where authority is in the hands of a powerful individual rather than the written law and guaranteed rights.
Mary Vintcenda of the village of Exeland said she was at the demonstration to support Isham and the rule of law.
“I support Judge Isham because she is standing up for the rule of law,” said Vintcenda, who was joined at the demonstration with her brother, Tom, who was also holding a sign. “She’s standing up for what’s right, and I wish others would join us.”
“So we’re out here supporting Judge Monica Isham,” said Paul DeMain, former editor and owner of News from Indian Country and a Native American active in Democratic politics who has run for state Senate.

DeMain said Isham’s email represents concerns that many judges have across Wisconsin after the arrest of Dugan.
“My understanding is the entire state is engaged in a discussion about how to deal with potential ICE raids in the courtroom,” he said.
DeMain said ICE actively pursuing suspects in a court will discourage witnesses from appearing in court if they fear being arrested by ICE.
“Are they going to show up in the courtroom to testify if they think they’re going to get hauled out and deported to El Salvador and put in a concentration camp?” asked DeMain. “These courts need to be safe. They need to be involved with respecting that due process for all U.S. citizens and all people in this country and let the process work it out.”
He added, “I think what’s going on with this administration, showcasing for publicity reasons the arrest of the Milwaukee judge with massive law enforcement officers, cuffing the judge outside in the parking lot, inviting all the right-wing media to take pictures — these are staged events meant to [cause]  U.S. citizens to be afraid to speak up, to be afraid to have an oppositional view, to stand up for citizens’ rights in this country.”

No injuries were reported in the incident, which took 20K barrels per day out of production. Refinery officials decline to offer details about the cause.
The post Newcastle oil refinery restarts operations after it ‘went boom’ in February appeared first on WyoFile .","The Wyoming Refinery in Newcastle has resumed operations months after an apparent explosion in February forced the facility to remain idle for repairs.
The refinery shut down following the Feb. 12 incident, which refinery owner Par Pacific of Houston called an “operational upset.” The company would not provide details of what happened beyond “the main crude heater needed to be replaced” and that there was an “unexpected and unavoidable equipment malfunction,” according to WyoFile interviews and company communications with state officials.
Weston County Emergency Management posted on Facebook the night of the incident that “a heater blew up” at the refinery.
No injuries were reported. 
While some fuel production resumed on April 21, it will be some time before the refinery is back to full capacity of 20,000 barrels a day, Dallas Scholes, Par Pacific’s government and public affairs director, told WyoFile.

“When you bring one of these facilities back online, you’ve got to take it slow,” Scholes said. Because the equipment has been idle for months, making sure everything is running correctly and safely takes time, from bringing the heat up to making sure the oil can move through. “There’s a lot that is involved, and our No. 1 priority in this whole process is to make sure it’s safe, and that’s what we’re focused on.” 
The company is not projecting when the refinery will resume full operational capacity, but it is providing updates on a website dedicated to the incident.
Even with fuel production shut down, the refinery’s workforce has been hard at work, according to Scholes.
“They are some really incredibly hard-working people, and they were doing a lot of extra shifts,” he said. “We used everybody we could on site, and we brought in a lot of really good experts to fill in the gaps and to make things work. They were gainfully employed the whole time. I’m really proud of what they were able to step up and do.” 
The facility produces gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and propane from Powder River Basin crude, according to the company. The economic impact on the region motivated Par Pacific to get the refinery back in operation as soon as possible, Scholes said.

“We stored a lot [of unrefined crude], but that is one of the reasons why we wanted to work as fast as we could — so that we can make sure that oil is still flowing and still available, and to make sure that our producers are still gainfully employed at the end of the day as well.” 
The ‘explosion’
The company doesn’t use the term “explosion” in public-facing communications, and instead refers to the incident as an “operational upset.” However, in a March 24 letter to the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality, Health, Safety, Security & Environment Manager Michael Baldwin wrote, “During the evening of Feb. 12, [the refinery] experienced an explosion in their crude heater … which resulted in a total shutdown of the refinery.”
The incident did not result in any liquid spills or significant airborne gaseous or powder emissions, according to the company. “There were no emissions that left our fence line,” Scholes said.
Regulatory officials are still in the process of investigating the incident in coordination with Par Pacific.
“Things can go wrong, and we live every day doing everything we can to make sure that they don’t.”Dallas Scholes, Par Pacific
The cause of the incident remains unclear. The company has refused to elaborate. “That [information] has not been passed on to me,” Scholes told WyoFile.
In a written communication to DEQ, the company refers to an “unexpected and unavoidable equipment malfunction” that occurred at about 10:37 p.m. on Feb. 12.
Weston County Emergency Management Coordinator Gilbert Nelson, who has been briefed by the company multiple times since the incident, told WyoFile, “They were just trying to restart the heater and it went boom.”
Par Pacific is studying what happened to cause the heater failure, Scholes said. “Anytime an incident occurs, we’re all hands on deck to come do an investigation to look for lessons learned that we can apply to any of our other facilities.
“Oil and gas refineries can be a dangerous profession,” Scholes added. “Things can go wrong, and we live every day doing everything we can to make sure that they don’t. And we were just incredibly lucky, and we developed new systems. We do new checks. This is not something anybody wants to see repeated, so you can bet that we will do everything we can to make sure it doesn’t happen again.”

In the days following, the company’s public updates noted a lingering cold snap and notified locals that they would likely see more steam than usual as crews used boilers to try to keep equipment from freezing. “It was 20 below zero when all this was going on,” Scholes told WyoFile.
The company also notified residents there would be more flaring than usual. Refineries frequently burn residual petrol vapors to reduce their hazardous effects, resulting in a flame at the top of a stack. Later, the refinery asked the state for permission, which was granted, to use a temporary boiler to prevent equipment from freezing, state documents show.
History of incidents
The refinery is situated just south of West Main Street and a half-mile from Newcastle High School. The refinery was established in 1927, and officials are quick to point out that it was the town — at the edge of the Black Hills with a population of about 3,300 — that grew around it.
Par Pacific, which also operates refineries in Hawaii, Billings, Montana and Tacoma, Washington, acquired the facility in 2016.

Under a previous owner in the 2000s, Denver-based Hermes Consolidated, Inc., the refinery was known for a series of mishaps, including a March 2002 spill that rained 20 tons of silica catalyst over a portion of the town, resulting in a 2008 settlement with 47 Newcastle-area residents. Details of the settlement were not disclosed. In the latter part of that decade, the refinery received nine “notices of violation” from Wyoming DEQ, resulting in $427,400 in civil penalties.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency also took action against the refinery at the time. 
The company paid a civil penalty of $150,000 in 2009 and agreed to invest $14 million in upgrades to settle several alleged emission violations cited by the EPA. In 2010, Wyoming Refining paid a $157,500 penalty to the EPA for “failure to prepare, submit, and implement an adequate and complete Facility Response Plan.”

Scholes said Par Pacific prioritizes safety and environmental compliance. “We have certain standards at Par that may not have been there before, and we are constantly working to improve operations.”
A 2023 Wyoming DEQ inspection report, the most recent available, determined, “There were no noted concerns during these inspections.” The inspection report also listed the refinery as being in “substantial compliance.”
“The safety of our workers and the community is our No. 1 priority,” Scholes said. “We’re very proud of our employees that live in the Newcastle community, and they stepped up. They did great work in bringing this facility back to where it can eventually get fully online.”From 2017 to 2022, Wyoming’s overall oil refining capacity shrank by 27% — from 177,500 barrels per day to 125,850, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The state went from five oil refineries to four in 2021 when HollyFrontier Sinclair converted its Cheyenne oil refinery to produce “renewable diesel,” which uses agricultural products — not oil — to produce the fuel.

At least two candidates — Rebecca Bextel of Jackson and Bryan Miller of Sheridan — are running to replace outgoing Chairman Frank Eathorne. 
The post Wyoming GOP to select new leadership appeared first on WyoFile .","Republicans from across the state will gather Saturday in Cody to elect the next chair of the Wyoming Republican Party. 
They’ll have at least two candidates to choose from — Rebecca Bextel of Jackson and Bryan Miller of Sheridan — to lead the party after Chairman Frank Eathorne announced he would not seek reelection. 
While some party members split on Eathorne’s leadership style, he had enough support to chair the party through three terms. His tenure coincided with the further-right wing’s command of the state GOP and the rise of the Wyoming Freedom Caucus, as cemented by its 2024 election victories.

Bextel and Miller both align with that block of the party, so the choice between them is not a question of whether the top post will remain a dark shade of red. Both candidates, however, told WyoFile they have different things to offer the party. 
“I’ve got a ton of experience with the [GOP] State Central Committee. I’ve got a ton of experience at the local Sheridan County Central Committee,” Miller said, pointing to over a decade of involvement with the Republican Party. 
“I have established relationships all across the state with a whole lot of people, and that, in itself, is a big deal,” he said.
While newer to the party, Bextel has recently demonstrated impressive fundraising chops and earned the endorsement of Wyoming’s U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman. 
“Brian has been around a long time. But I think that’s the selling point for me,” Bextel said. “If I’m elected, this is about to be taken to a new level.”
A third or more moderate candidate has not publicly announced a bid for chair, but that remains a possibility since nominations can be made during Saturday’s meeting. 
Rebecca Bextel
Bextel moved to Jackson about 20 years ago with her husband, Jonathan, and has made her living in real estate and as a registered agent. In September, she announced she would run for GOP chair, roughly seven months ahead of the election. 
“I decided to run early because it’s a big state, and I wanted to give people plenty of time to look me up or get to know me,” Bextel said, adding that in just the last three weeks she’s driven 9,000 miles and visited almost all 23 counties. 
“I decided to run because I felt like the role of the chairman of the party is to fundraise, grow the party, and direct the party at the will of the body,” she said. “And so this is not going to be the party of Rebecca Bextel. This is going to be the party of the grassroots. It’s going to be a bottom-up approach.”

She’s raised $130,000 for the party since April, she said. 
“I’ve also raised about $300,000 for conservative candidates and PACs. And a lot of those candidates helped push the [Wyoming] House further to the right,” she said. “I’m very proud of that.”
Bextel was herself a fixture of the Wyoming Capitol during the 2025 session, testifying on bills and spending time with lawmakers. That’s something she said she would continue to do as chair. 
“I have a great relationship with a lot of the members of the House. I have a great relationship with some members of the Senate,” Bextel said. 
And while Miller may have experience, Bextel said, he lacks her “energy level” and “enthusiasm.” Plus, Bextel said she has some new ideas, like creating a group within the party to decide the conservative bona fides of Republican candidates. 
“I am actually considering making a new committee that will obviously be an odd number of people from the four corners of the state, across the Republican spectrum, and that committee will figure out who is 80% platform candidates and who is not,” Bextel said. 
The Wyoming Republican Party’s bylaws require officeholders to have “a voting record of at least 80% in support” of the party’s platform and challengers to sign “a pledge to support the Wyoming Republican Party platform-related legislation.” 
The question of who is and isn’t a Republican has long plagued the party, and Bextel is still “marinating” on the idea of the new committee but said she’s been asking for input during her travels.  
Bryan Miller 
Shortly before retiring from military service, Miller opened a consulting firm in Sheridan in 2010. Since then, he’s served as Sheridan County GOP Chair for several terms and ran unsuccessfully for the Wyoming Legislature, U.S. House and U.S. Senate. 
Those campaigns, Miller said, gave him the chance to make connections across Wyoming. 
“I have established relationships with county party after county party over the years,” he said. “They call us up here in Sheridan because they like what we have done,” Miller said, pointing to the party’s growth under his leadership. 
“They like the fact that we took a party that was considered to be iffy in the Republican cause across the state,” Miller said, and turned it “into a party where over 500 people regularly participate in party activities.”

In Sheridan, Miller said, they have a surplus of people willing to volunteer as election judges and poll watchers, and more voters interested in running for precinct committee seats than available spots. 
The party’s communication and visibility in the community, Miller said, is responsible for increased participation, which is something he’d like to work on at the state level. 
“Our messaging here in town has been tremendous. We talk to people. We have a headquarters set up on Main Street every election cycle,” Miller said. “We have a presence in Sheridan like no other county when it comes to the Republican Party.”
Miller said he’s also proud of the fundraising strides his local party has made, but there’s more to being chair of the state party than just filling up the coffers. 
“Yes, money is important. It absolutely is when it comes to campaigns and races and all that. But it’s not the reason that someone should elect a chair,” he said. “I don’t want to see that the dollar signs drive the party toward doing things that will not be helpful to the party’s cause.” 
Miller originally planned to run for vice chair of the party, he said, but a series of events, including a meeting with Bextel, changed his mind. Miller said he also heard from some lawmakers who didn’t take well to Bextel during the session. 
“My ability to work with the leadership in the House and the Senate is tremendously ahead [of Bextel’s],” Miller said. “I’ve actually already been speaking with the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate regarding [Wyoming’s election laws] and this lawsuit that’s been filed in Hot Springs County.” 
Miller is running as a “team” alongside Fremont County Chairwoman Ginger Bennett, who is seeking the position of vice chair of the party. 
“Ginger is who I think should be the vice chair,” Miller said. “Because she’s got that gregarious attitude. And she knows a lot of people. She’s been involved in the Republican women’s groups in the state, and it’s a match that at this point in time is perfect in my opinion.”
What now?
While Saturday’s meeting is open to the public, only county chairs, state committeemen and state committeewomen are allowed to vote in the state party’s officer elections. 
The meeting starts at 9 a.m. at the Cody Auditorium.

Antler hunting in Jackson Hole began Thursday with the “Shed Hunt Motorcade” that saw police escort hundreds of searchers in an orderly fashion through town.
The post Run for the racks appeared first on WyoFile .","“It’s going to be a big old-fashioned horse race,” Hunter Whitney said as he lounged in his makeshift camp Wednesday at the Teton County Fairgrounds, waiting for the opening of shed-antler hunting season.
Camp stoves, backpacks, folding chairs and even a cornhole set surrounded the Star Valley resident as he catnapped among picnic tables at his sidewalk quarters. A long-cold fried egg lay abandoned in a skillet, a pair of sturdy boots aired out on the concrete.
Through a lottery arranged by the Jackson Police Department, Whitney won a coveted spot close to the front of the “Shed Hunt Motorcade.” The hundreds of police-escorted pickups and horse trailers would snake through town to be turned loose on nearby public land at 6 a.m. Thursday. That’s the official Wyoming Game and Fish Department time when antler hunting starts and big game winter range opens in the western and southwestern parts of the state.

Male elk shed hundreds of antlers in the spring, dropping some of them on national forest land beyond the National Elk Refuge — home to some 7,000 elk each winter. The refuge itself is closed to antler gathering except for the local Boy Scout troop, which collects them for an annual auction.
Last year, bidders paid an average of more than $26 a pound. A skull and antlers from a winter-kill elk can bring thousands of dollars, depending on size and condition.
The lottery and motorcade replaced the mayhem of various helter-skelter mass starts that marked iterations of the antler rush in years past.
Mike Jackson, No. 265, drove up from Lyman for his first-ever hunt. He and his family arrived at a prescribed time to park in their place in line.

For a day and a night, the fairgrounds became a community of campers with a common goal. For $20 a head, they could corral their mounts in various nearby rodeo pens.
The Jacksons were going to a restaurant before cozying up in their horse trailer to sleep. 
They planned to get up at 5 a.m., saddle their steeds, load them in the trailer and join the 5:45 a.m. procession to the city limits and open range beyond.
The lottery drew 513 applications, each costing $20, for a designated motorcade spot. By Wednesday afternoon, some 400 vehicles had lined up along Snow King Avenue in a queue that snaked into and around the fairgrounds.
Dubois resident Ty Finley drew No. 2. He was pleased. The No. 1 pickup ahead of him towed a horse trailer that carried only ATVs. Those aren’t allowed off dirt roads, so Finley was pretty sure he would be leading the charge.
After drawing his coveted spot, “I was trying to make sure none of my friends found out about it,” he joked. In fact, he showed up with many friends — Boedeckers, Hankinns, Cragoes, Hadleys and Eastburns — seemingly half the town of Dubois.

Cutting programs that promote diversity, equity and inclusion robs Wyoming of win-win opportunities, Rep. Ken Chestek opines. 
The post Attacks on DEI highlight the fallacy of zero-sum thinking appeared first on WyoFile .","In its 2024 budget session, the Wyoming Legislature added a footnote to the budget for the University of Wyoming stating “no funds from this appropriation shall be expended on the office of diversity, equity and inclusion at the University of Wyoming or on any diversity, equity and inclusion program, activity or function.” As a result, the UW closed that office while reassigning some of its functions to other units. Then, UW’s Faculty Senate this spring agreed to terminate the undergraduate academic degrees in gender and women’s studies. Another bill defunding DEI more broadly was adopted by the legislature in 2025, but was vetoed by Gov. Mark Gordon.

Opinion

I am continually baffled at why the Legislature, and others in Wyoming government, are so vehemently opposed to diversity, equity and inclusion. In my world, each one of those things is a value to celebrate, not an evil to eradicate.
Superintendent of Public Instruction Megan Degenfelder said at the time of the cut to UW’s budget that DEI has become a form of reverse discrimination. She claimed that DEI programs create “preferential treatment of one race, one gender over another, and [that] one race [is] inherently racist over another.” But that is a logical fallacy; specifically, a false dichotomy. It results from zero-sum thinking.
Zero-sum games are situations where for every winner, there is a loser. Think of a typical sale transaction: for every dollar the buyer pays, the seller gains a dollar. The net sum is zero. On the flip side, for every item the seller sells, he loses that item, but the buyer gains the item. Still a net zero.
But human interactions are seldom zero-sum games. They are most often plus-sum games, where both participants gain something from the interaction. Working together, respecting and learning from each other, leaves both participants better off. A plus-sum game. A win-win.
Since DEI practices and attitudes promote respect and learning between different groups, it is a plus-sum game. If a favored, dominant group reaches out to understand and respect a disfavored or oppressed group, that does not weaken the dominant group. The false dichotomy is that social prestige and opportunity are not a win-lose situation. One does not have to choose between which group has opportunities. Sharing opportunities can lift up both groups to heights neither could attain separately.
President Donald Trump has many flaws, but perhaps his biggest flaw is that he seems incapable of anything other than zero-sum thinking. Everything he does is transactional, and he must always “win.” He sees immigrants as taking “our” jobs. Foreign governments are stealing “our” money by having trade surpluses (never mind that private commercial transactions, not foreign governments, create trade imbalances). Law firms that represent his opponents are taking power away from him, so they must be punished. Courts that restrain his illegal actions also deprive him of power, so they must be attacked. All of this he does because of his irrational need to “win” the zero-sum games he perceives.
The Wyoming Freedom Caucus, possibly taking their cue from Trump, is likewise stuck in zero-sum thinking. Its ongoing efforts to defund DEI programs appear to be an attempt to institutionalize the power of favored groups over disfavored groups, apparently in the belief that lifting up the disfavored group somehow diminishes the favored group.
But diversity, equity and inclusion are not zero-sum games. When we all work together — when we respect each other, share our talents with each other, treat each other with the dignity we deserve — we are all better off. Every one of us has a gift to make this world a better place. Let’s share those gifts freely with each other.

March 11, 2025. (Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Lincoln and Omaha city officials would have the future option to move city elections and line them up with Nebraska statewide elections, under this year’s annual election cleanup bill.
Legislative Bill 521, from State Sen. Rita Sanders of Bellevue, advanced 42-0 on Thursday. Sanders, who chairs the Legislature’s Government, Military and Veterans Affairs Committee, said the goal is “modernizing” elections.
“This bill represents a significant investment in the integrity and efficiency of our electoral system,” Sanders said during debate.
Election cleanup package
LB 521 would make a series of changes, including to allow hospice or disability services patient records to count as a photo voter ID, stop petition signature verification of candidates or new political parties at 110% of the goal (similar to ballot measures), notify a voter if their voter registration is canceled, prohibit petition circulation within 200 feet of ballot drop boxes and permit the secretary of state to distribute petition pages to counties “by a secure method,” rather than just mail or by law enforcement.
  State Sen. Rita Sanders of Bellevue. Dec. 10, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Four other bills were amended into LB 521, by a 41-0 vote. They would:

Allow Lincoln or Omaha to move odd-year city elections in April and May to instead be in line with statewide primary and general elections (LB 19 from State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha).
Exempt local foster care review boards from the Open Meetings Act (LB 238 from State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha).
Address situations where a public meeting notice has been sent to a newspaper but can’t be published on a proper timeline, and address what happens if a public notice can’t be posted online (LB 243 from Sanders).
Allow political parties to appoint watchers to monitor county election officials’ mandatory three independent tests of vote-counting devices. The results of the tests would later be published online (LB 659 from State Sen. Bob Andersen of north-central Sarpy County).

Andersen said his vote-counting reforms “reflect a commitment to election integrity and ensuring Nebraskans have confidence in the accuracy and security of our vote counting.”
LB 521 no longer includes a provision that could have allowed the secretary of state to use software, including artificial intelligence, to assist in processing a filed petition.
Omaha, Lincoln city elections

Sen. John Cavanaugh’s LB 19 is different from his introduced version, which would have required Omaha to move its off-year elections beginning in 2028. Under his amended bill, Omaha as well as Lincoln officials would have the option of putting a city charter amendment to a vote of residents to change the election timing. 
The bill would not affect 2025 elections.
In odd-numbered years, Omaha primary elections are the first Tuesday of April, while general elections are the first Tuesday after the second Monday in May. For Lincoln, the general election is the first Tuesday in May, and the primary election is four weeks prior.
State law dictates the election timing for cities of the primary class (100,001 to 399,999 residents) and metropolitan size (400,000 or more residents).
This year, Omaha will have its general mayoral election May 13. Lincoln will have its city election May 6, but the mayor is not on the ballot until 2027.
Any city that changes to be in line with statewide election timing could change the point at which terms in office end, according to Cavanaugh. If not, and if, say, one of the cities had an election in November 2028, it could lead to a lame-duck public official for six months. Today, city terms in office start about four weeks after an election.
Cavanaugh said LB 19 would save property tax dollars, such as the $1.5 million Omaha is spending on this off-year election cycle, which he said would probably be a little less for Lincoln. 
He said it also would help with voter fatigue after sometimes “grueling” statewide elections.
LB 521, a Government Committee priority for the year, faces up to two more rounds of debate.



Example timing for Lincoln/Omaha city elections under amended LB 521
City elections in Lincoln and Omaha are in odd-numbered years under existing state law, in contrast to the hundreds of other municipal elections statewide. Under Legislative Bill 521, as amended, officials would have the option to move city elections to even-numbered years.
Terms of office begin in 2025

Current law: Elected May 2025. Term in office June 2025 to June 2029. Next election April/May 2029.
City charter amendment is adopted (before 2028): Elected May 2025. Term in office June 2025 to June 2029, or sooner. Next election May/November 2028.

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Education priorities, including funding for K-12 public schools, higher education and early childhood education and child care, proved to be the issues that arose most often in public hearings held by the Wisconsin Legislature’s powerful budget committee in April. 
Wisconsin lawmakers wrapped up their public hearings this week with a hearing Monday in Hayward and one Tuesday in Wausau. Two hearings were held in early April in West Allis and Kaukauna.
With the hearings complete, the Joint Finance Committee will turn its attention to the work of writing the budget with the goal of completing it by the June 30 deadline. If lawmakers and Gov. Tony Evers don’t complete the budget by that deadline, Wisconsin continues to operate under the current budget into the next fiscal year. 
Tessa Maglio, digital and communications organizer for the Wisconsin Public Education Network, a nonprofit advocacy organization for public schools, worked with legislative policy Lead Bryn Horton and organizing and engagement coordinator Camden Hargrove to track testimony at each of the public hearings.
“Tracking the testimony is really important because we have seen in budget cycle after budget cycle people ask for the resources Wisconsin kids in their public schools need and then have watched the subsequent budget not meet the requests,” Maglio said. “We wanted to keep it in the forefront of the advocates’ minds as well as the governor’s mind and legislators’ minds.” 
According to the WPEN tracker, more than 900 people spoke across the four hearings, which lasted about 29 total hours. WPEN reported that more than 170 people discussed funding for K-12 schools, more than 50 people spoke about higher education and more than  50  spoke about child care. Maglio said education across the spectrum made up at least a third of the total testimony.
“It is really powerful to hear you know people share their stories and experiences and priorities and so even though some of the topics might not have tallied very high on our tracker, they’re nonetheless still very important,” Maglio said.
On the issue of  K-12 public education, Maglio said, public testimony included calls to raise the special education reimbursement to at least 60%, provide districts with more spendable aid, fix the revenue limit structure, which restricts how much school districts can raise without permission from lawmakers or the public, and help school districts keep their schools operating and serve their students.
There were “many different stories and many different perspectives and people brought their own experiences whether they were coming from large urban districts or small rural districts,” Maglio said. School districts in Wisconsin have not had predictable increases in funding through state aid or property taxes in over 15 years, and an increasing number of school districts have had to rely on getting permission from voters in referendums to meet costs.
Maglio highlighted testimony by Laura McCoy, president of the Green Bay Area Public School District Board of Education, at the Kaukauna hearing. 
McCoy told lawmakers that her community supports their local schools.
“We know this because we just passed yet another referendum: the third referendum in eight years. We’re going to have to pass another one next year,” McCoy said. “Honestly, funding public education by referendum is no way to educate our future generations. Districts around this state are begging for change. Please listen to them.” 
“We are doing our job in Green Bay. We are holding up our piece of the sky. We are preparing our students for the future and we are hitting it out of the ballpark with workforce development,” McCoy added. “But it gets harder every year and we need to feel like the state Legislature is our partner, and not our adversary.” 
JFC Democrats call for education funding
Democrats on the Joint Finance Committee also called on Republican members to fund education in the upcoming state budget during a Wednesday press conference.
“From West Allis to Wausau, the message was consistent and it was clear,” said Sen. LaTonya Johnson (D-Milwaukee).  “Wisconsinites want a budget that invests in public education, affordable health care options, workforce development and child care.” 
“It is our job as state legislators,” Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison) said, “and it is time for my Republican colleagues to join Democrats in actually providing the resources that our kids deserve.” 
Republican leaders have said that the state Supreme Court decision on Evers’ partial veto, which extends the annual $325 revenue limit increase for school districts for 400 years, would affect the state budget. In April, the Court upheld the veto, saying it was within the governor’s  power and suggesting that lawmakers could take different routes, including writing the budget differently or passing a constitutional amendment, if they want to prevent such vetoes in the future. 
Roys said it would be “an excuse” and “pathetic” if Republicans decide not to increase education funding due to the decision. 
“If they want to try to pass a constitutional amendment, we’ve seen them do it again and again. They can certainly give that a try, but I don’t think that’s an acceptable excuse to fail to pass a budget on time, fail to pass a budget that makes the investments that our kids and our constituents — all of our constituents — need and and deserve,” Roys said. 
Johnson added that the state could also cover the cost of the $325 revenue increase Evers’ veto allowed school districts to raise from local taxpayers. 
“I’m hoping that they do the right thing,” Johnson said of her colleagues in the Legislature. “We heard a consensus across the board of taxpayers coming in and testifying, saying that the referendums are not sustainable. It’s not the way for them to fund public education, and let’s be real, it’s not fair, either.” 
Health care concerns
According to the WPEN’s tracking, health care was the second most discussed issue at the hearings. 
“Coming in just behind the focus on public education was Medicaid expansion, Medicaid funding, health care,” said Maglio. “Many, many, many people came out to testify in favor of those things and shared really powerful and sometimes heart-breaking personal stories about the impact that Medicaid funding has on their lives or the lives of their loved ones and what that would mean if that funding were not to be supported in the budget.” 
Evers, as he has done in each of his budget proposals, asked  that Wisconsin take the federal Medicaid expansion that would allow almost all adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level to qualify. Wisconsin is one of only 10 states that has not done so.
This session, though, the request comes at a moment when the Medicaid program is facing the threat of deep cuts from  the Trump administration and Republican members of Congress. Concerns about proposed federal cuts came up at the state budget hearings. 
“Also with farming and food access and previously supported funding for Wisconsin farmers to provide food to schools and to food pantries… Across the board there was kind of an undercurrent [of] people focusing on the needs of Wisconsinites, but urging their lawmakers to think about the budget within the context of decisions being made at the federal level,” Maglio said.
In addition to broader Medicaid expansion, a postpartum Medicaid expansion, which would extend health care coverage for mothers who recently gave birth from 60 days to a year, has been a major point of bipartisan agreement this session. A bill that would make Wisconsin the 49th state to take the extension recently passed the Senate but it faces challenges in the Assembly, where the top Republican has opposed the measure deeming it an expansion of “welfare.” 
Roys called on her Republican colleagues to get it done by placing it in the budget. She noted that the four Democrats and the six Senate Republicans on the Joint Finance Committee, who voted in favor of the bill, could place the proposal in the budget without Assembly Republicans on the committee having to vote in favor. 
“I understand that there are some problems over in the Assembly, and we’ve heard that Vos  is to blame year after year, session after session when this doesn’t get done — despite having overwhelming support for members of his caucus, and, of course, every single Democrat in the Legislature,” Roys said. “The good news is that if Republicans in the Assembly are afraid of political retribution from Speaker Vos or they don’t want to cross him, we can still put postpartum Medicaid expansion in the budget right now.” 
Another major issue that lawmakers will debate this budget is tax cuts, though Roys noted that cuts for “millionaires and billionaires” were not popular topics at the public hearings. 
“That’s one thing that nobody asked for, [but] seems to be the focus of my Republican colleagues,” Roys said. “In fact, they are focused on trying to shove through an irresponsible tax cut before we even engage in meeting the needs of Wisconsinites.”
Republican lawmakers have said they want to pass a tax cut bill prior to the budget. 
“The goal, again, is to try to find something that can actually get across the finish line,” Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) said in April. During the last legislative session, Evers vetoed several Republican  tax cut proposals, including proposed reductions for the top income tax brackets in the last budget. “I think the governor realizes that we’re not going to spend any more money unless we have the ability to reduce taxes and help folks get by with inflation.”
Evers, meanwhile, has said that he won’t support tax cuts done outside of the budget.
“It has to be part of the budget. We just can’t do things one way, and then, you know, just do taxes and then do spending,” Evers said. “We have to look at it together.”
So far lawmakers have declined to discuss specifics. Committee Co-chair Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green) said at a press conference ahead of the Wausau hearing that details haven’t been negotiated and they aren’t going to “negotiate anything in the media.” 
Democratic legislative leaders have said they haven’t been part of those discussions. 
Roys said that if Democrats were going to support a tax cut, it needs to be part of the budget process and it needs to be “responsible and not create a massive structural deficit that then Republicans will use it as an excuse to undermine the services that we rely on in our public schools.” Any cut, she added, needs to be targeted towards “everyday Wisconsinites.” 
Johnson said that investing in other priorities could also present a better opportunity for savings for taxpayers. 
“Everybody could use a couple of extra dollars in their pocket. Let’s be real, I could use a couple of extra dollars a month, but if those same communities are going to have to go to referendum to support their schools, it’s not a tax break for them,” Johnson said.

Angelito Tenorio, Francesca Hong and Renuka Mayadev in the Wisconsin State Assembly chambers. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)After two sessions as the only Asian American lawmaker in the Wisconsin Legislature, Rep. Francesca Hong (D-Madison), who was first elected in 2020, stood alongside freshmen Reps. Angelito Tenorio (D-West Allis) and Renuka Mayadev (D-Madison) Thursday to announce the formation of the state’s first Legislative Asian Caucus.
The lawmakers announced the creation of the caucus on the first day of Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, saying that they have a responsibility to represent Asian American Wisconsinites, who make up 6% of the state, and to work to advance their rights, visibility and improve their daily lives.
“I’m deeply grateful, and I couldn’t think of a better team to be in the Asian caucus with… We have the distinct opportunity to make all of our communities stronger,” said Hong, who is the daughter of Korean immigrants, said. At one point during the press conference, Hong said she felt like she was going to cry.
Tenorio is the first Filipino American to be elected to the state Legislature, and said during the press conference that his parents immigrated to the U.S. “in hopes of finding a better life.” He said that growing up he didn’t see people that looked like him in leadership positions, including in government. 
“That lack of representation stuck with me, and I knew I wanted to change that,” Tenorio said, adding that he was an activist in college, served in the Wisconsin Army National Guard and has become an advocate for addressing climate change and protecting the environment. 
Tenorio said the creation of the caucus is “historic” and a “declaration” that Asian Americans deserve to help shape the future of the state. 
“For too long, our stories, struggles, strengths and victories have been overlooked,” Tenorio said. “As members of the Legislature, we have a seat at the table, and we carry the responsibility to make this table bigger, more inclusive and more representative of our state.” 
Tenorio noted that the lawmakers have introduced a resolution to recognize 2025 as the “Year of the Snake” and a resolution to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the conclusion of the Vietnam War, the Secret War in Laos and of the 50th anniversary of the Fall of Phnom Penh in Cambodia —  conflicts that led to people from Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam resettling in the U.S. 
“Such communities largely resettled in Wisconsin, overcoming adversity to establish vibrant communities that have significantly contributed to the social, cultural, and economic fabric of our state” the commemorative resolution states. “Wisconsin is now home to the third-largest Hmong population in the United States, with communities thriving in cities like Appleton, Sheboygan, Green Bay, Wausau and Milwaukee.” 
“These resolutions aren’t just ceremonial. They’re a part of our broader efforts to write our stories into the narrative of our states, to affirm that we are not outsiders,” Tenorio said. “We are part of the fabric of Wisconsin.”
The caucus members said they will host events throughout the month to highlight the contributions of Asian Americans, including one focused on Japanese internment, another on celebrating the Hmong community and one to uplift Filipino stories.
“There is so much to celebrate, so much to be proud of and so much to feel honored by being an Asian American,” Hong said. 
Maydev is the first South Asian elected to the Assembly and represents the University of Wisconsin-Madison campus and other parts of the state’s capital city. She noted that her district is about 17% Asian American and she represents the highest concentration of Asian Americans in the state. 
Mayadev said that her journey to hold public office didn’t start when she submitted her nomination papers. 
“It started when my parents decided to leave everything they knew in their homes more than 50 years ago, and traveled from India as immigrants to the United States,” Mayadev said. “Like the representatives beside me, we are all first-generation Americans — proud children of immigrants.”
Mayadev also emphasized that the lawmakers will bring in the voices of others in the community. She said people have reached out to her for that reason already. 
“They said they’ve never reached out to an Assembly person before, but they reached out to me because they felt that they would have an empathetic ear and an understanding that goes deeper that maybe they felt that somebody else wouldn’t be able to be,” Mayadev said. 
Hong said caucus members will also make sure to go to different communities in the state and work to identify leaders who want to build relationships. 
The formation of the caucus comes as Republicans at a federal and state level have targeted immigrants as well as diversity and inclusion efforts. 
“We must do more. We know the reality on the ground. AAPI folks, like so many immigrants, workers and people of color, continue to face threats and challenges — from the underrepresentation and political exclusion of Asian Americans to the surge in anti-Asian hate crimes to growing economic inequality,” Tenorio said. “We are navigating a landscape that too often undermines our dignity and our safety.” 
Mayadev acknowledged the caucus is being established during a time of upheaval for immigrants as the Trump administration has proclaimed its aim of carrying out mass deportations and has detained even immigrants who are in the country legally. Wisconsin Republicans have supported those efforts, seeking legislation that requires local law enforcement to cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and to discussing removing a Milwaukee County judge who was arrested by the FBI and is accused of impeding the arrest of a man that ICE followed to her courtroom.
“There’s much uncertainty and fear,” Mayadev said, adding that caucus members are committed to providing “guidance and leadership during this time, so that all feel welcome in Wisconsin.”
Asked about the targeting of inclusion efforts by Republicans in the state Legislature, Hong mentioned a recent hearing in the Joint Audit Committee, where Republican lawmakers grilled state agency leaders on their inclusion efforts. 
“I plan to speak with the chairs of that committee about my experiences when I first got here of deep xenophobia and racism,” she said, adding that she hoped by being “very truthful, honest and vulnerable” she and other members of color could “dispel some of the preconceived notions that racism and discrimination isn’t happening right here in the halls of power amongst colleagues.”

(Kevin Mohatt for Colorado Newsline)Abortion advocates and providers in Colorado feel increased pressure under the Trump administration to support people seeking abortions from Colorado and surrounding states with restrictions. 
Melisa Hidalgo-Cuellar, abortion fund director for Cobalt, said the organization has been “constantly adapting” to meet the demand for support. The abortion fund has increased its staffing capacity over the last couple of years and ramped up its digital security to ensure client information is protected. 
Cobalt, one of two Colorado-based abortion funds that offers financial support to patients seeking abortion care, is also helping clients navigate mis- and disinformation related to abortion care. Hidalgo-Cuellar said many patients in restrictive states don’t know there are financial assistance resources available because their states and communities intentionally try “to keep that information out of their hands.”
“We really see that play a role in the abortion funding world when we are working directly with abortion seekers who are fearful of leaving their state to access care and having to walk them through the resources available to them,” Hidalgo-Cuellar said.

While there’s been an increase of people seeking abortion care in Colorado since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the national right to an abortion in the Dobbs v. Jackson decision and Texas’ abortion ban, providers are looking for different ways they can help meet the demand, relying particularly on telehealth, Hidalgo-Cuellar said. She’s also seen increased coordination between abortion funds and clinics to help make sure each patient gets care in a way accessible to them. 
About 62% of Colorado voters supported Amendment 79 in November, which made abortion access a constitutional right in Colorado. The Colorado Legislature approved a measure implementing the amendment and also passed several shield laws to protect providers as well as out-of-state patients. Every state except New Mexico that borders Colorado, as well as Texas, has abortion restrictions.
A new report from the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization focused on sexual and reproductive health, found that abortions actually decreased by about 2,400 in both Colorado and New Mexico from 2023 to 2024. The total still remains higher than before the Dobbs decision in both states, though. It stood at 24,490 in Colorado last year. Increased capacity from clinics in Kansas likely contributed to the reduction for Colorado and New Mexico, as well as broader access to telehealth medication abortion under protection of shield laws, according to the report.  
While Cobalt is still waiting to hear back from a few clinics before it has final spending data from the first quarter of 2025, Hidalgo-Cuellar said Cobalt has already seen an increase in patients served as well as cost per patient, meaning there’s higher demand for financial support. 
For funding directly supporting a patient’s ability to pay for a procedure, preliminary numbers show Cobalt has spent about $306,000 in the first quarter of 2025, compared to $218,000 in the first quarter of 2024, Hidalgo-Cuellar said. The fund also helped 883 clients between January and March 2025 compared to 717 in those months in 2024. 
Over 50% of Cobalt’s procedural funding in 2024 went to patients in Colorado. But just under 90% of Cobalt’s practical support funds — which help people pay for travel, lodging and child care expenses needed to access abortion care — went to patients from Texas. 
“That tells you that we have that enormous need coming out of Texas as people are forced to travel for abortion care. They’re having to put their lives on pause to be able to access this care,” Hidalgo-Cuellar said. “These are just the numbers from the people who found out about Cobalt, who knew that money was available. There are so many people who are navigating this process on their own without understanding that financial support is available.”
Abortion deserts still a problem
Vanessa Martinez, vice president of policy at the Colorado Organization for Latina Opportunity and Reproductive Rights, said Colorado’s willingness to support out-of-state patients in need is not a threat to Coloradans’ ability to access reproductive health care. She said the biggest threat to care would be if anti-abortion states start to bring lawsuits against Colorado providers, though the state’s shield provisions exist to protect those providers.
“Colorado has been a leader in reproductive care at the national level, and when we consider the national ecosystem of care, Colorado is so, so important both for abortion care and for gender-affirming care,” Martinez said. “There are people who drive hours and hours to be able to get the care that they need here in Colorado.”
The Guttmacher report said 26% of abortions provided in Colorado in 2024 went to out-of-state patients.

There are people who drive hours and hours to be able to get the care that they need here in Colorado.


– Vanessa Martinez, vice president of policy at the Colorado Organization for Latina Opportunity and Reproductive Rights


Hidalgo-Cuellar said the abortion clinics Cobalt works with overall have seen shorter wait times for an appointment as they have increased their capacity. Many have been able to accommodate urgent cases, when a patient needs to be seen in a day or two. 
The need for practical support still exists in Colorado, particularly in abortion deserts, Hidalgo-Cuellar said. Patients in rural parts of the state might have to travel up to six hours to access care. 
“Abortion deserts have always been and still are problems even in access states, in protected states such as Colorado,” Hidalgo-Cuellar said. 
Telehealth has been crucial for abortion deserts, Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains spokesperson Fawn Bolak said. Since the Durango Planned Parenthood temporarily closed due to provider shortages, Bolak said Planned Parenthood has connected patients to its virtual clinic so they can continue to access care. She said the only service patients in Durango cannot access as a result of the closure is a procedural abortion. 
“We are actively recruiting for an advanced practice clinician so that we can reopen that health center,” Bolak said. “The reason why we had to temporarily close that location is because we are navigating a national provider shortage. Health care institutions, not just in reproductive and sexual health care, but across the board are really feeling a significant burden from this provider shortage and we’re definitely not immune to that.” 
Some providers have looked specifically to abortion deserts for sites of future clinics. Hidalgo-Cuellar said that’s what Care Colorado did when it opened a clinic in Pueblo.
Goal is to instill fear
Bolak said she’s seen how “frustrated” and “scared” patients are under the Trump administration, particularly immigrants who lack permanent legal status. Reproductive and sexual health advocates have known the Trump administration would target access to care, but the “swiftness with which they have begun” attacking health care, particularly gender-affirming care, has been “pretty devastating,” she said. 
“Since Trump announced that he would be seeking reelection, we began preparing for things like additional attacks on access to mifepristone, additional abortion bans, attacks on contraception, attacks on health insurance and different things like that,” Bolak said. 
Trump has said he will leave abortion policy to the states, but he pardoned anti-abortion protesters who were prosecuted under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, and his administration has withheld funding from Planned Parenthood clinics. Advocates also fear the administration will target mifepristone and misoprostol, two medications used to perform abortions and manage miscarriages. 
Hidalgo-Cuellar said attempts to criminalize seeking and providing abortion care have increased across the board under the Trump administration. She said part of the goal is to instill fear in anyone seeking abortion care and anyone helping those seeking care. 
Martinez said her organization has had concerns since last summer about attacks from anti-abortion states, especially now that the federal government “not only doesn’t protect the rights of everyone in our communities, but often targets a lot of the community members that COLOR advocates for: community members of color, LGBTQ+ community members, immigrant Coloradans.” 
Many Latino and Latina people COLOR works with have felt a sense of instability since Trump took office, Martinez said. Those with immigrant family members who lack permanent legal status have been particularly on edge and consider whether accessing any kind of health care could put their loved ones at risk. Martinez said many people need help understanding what insurance coverage options are available for them, and hesitate to enroll in public programs out of fear it will put them “on a list that the federal government will later use” to target their families. 
“We’re seeing uncertainty from community members just in navigating their health needs, and this isn’t coming up just in emergency situations,” Martinez said. “It’s coming up too in child visits — Do I take my child to get their vaccines, to their checkups? — which is really scary for entire communities.”
Martinez said Colorado Senate Bill 25-130, which would ensure that anyone who goes to an emergency room cannot be denied care, is especially important after instances in other states when pregnant people have gone to an emergency room needing “miscarriage management” or abortion care only for that care to be delayed or denied “at the expense of their lives.”
She said the bill will also help people in rural communities who might not have direct access to specialty providers.
“We know that already has happened in Colorado where folks have seen delays in care at the emergency room or not been transferred to the emergency room soon enough,” Martinez said. 
The bill passed the Senate and its House committee hearing Monday, and is scheduled for debate in the House Friday.

(Getty Images)Contraception can be one of the greatest tools for safely, affordably and effectively growing a family. 
When we collectively talk about birth control, the conversation is often about pregnancy prevention, but what is missed is the nuance that contraception improves health and economic outcomes for families and even supports their growth. Access to birth control gives individuals and couples the power to choose when and how to have children leading to better outcomes in their health, economic stability, and ultimately leads to a more prosperous Idaho.
Idahoans can now get six months of birth control under new law

And when people feel more confident and in control, they’re often more willing to build their families to the size they want and work toward the necessary means to support them.
We have been, and will always be, advocates for Idaho families. As board members of the Idaho Contraceptive Education Network, we are committed to facilitating healthy, respectful dialogue about the many ways birth control can support families at every stage. 
Our network and membership, comprised of hundreds of Idahoans across the state, have raised their own families or varying sizes, utilizing tools like contraception to do so on their terms. As a statewide network, we advocate in order to dispel myths and sharing real information about contraception, which can and does support healthy, growing families in numerous ways. 
Imagine a future where every Idahoan has the ability to grow their family with intention. 
One big factor in whether families feel able to keep growing is their ability to space pregnancies. Health experts, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, recommend waiting at least 18 months between births to lower health risks for both mother and baby. 
As couples build families, planning for the desired spacing of their children is important. Couples who can space pregnancies may be more likely to grow their family to the desired size when the risk of complications is reduced. 
Access to contraception allows Idahoans to pursue education, careers, and financial stability — all important factors for building healthy families. The freedom to pursue financial security doesn’t diminish the desire to become parents — it often makes couples more prepared and excited to do so when the time is right.
Available and affordable contraception truly allows couples to think clearly about what they want their family to look like and to pursue those goals intentionally. Studies show that people are more likely to reach their desired number of children when they have access to effective contraception. 
Couples should be allowed to determine what they want their family to look like and have the freedom and tools to make choices reflective of their goals, values, and readiness. This kind of intentionality is important — it allows people to consider not just how many children they want, but also when they want them, what kind of life they hope to provide, and how parenthood fits into other aspects of their lives. 
Being intentional doesn’t mean having everything figured out perfectly, but it does mean making informed, thoughtful decisions rather than being caught off guard by circumstances.
Contraception has also been proven to help to-be parents stay in the workforce, complete school or training, and build financial security before becoming parents. That’s not a detour — it’s a foundation. 
Delaying childbearing for the right reasons often leads to being in a better position to raise multiple children, and if those options do not exist it is possible families may opt out of growing their families.
Access to effective contraception plays a crucial role in supporting this intentional approach. Without that access, they may be more vulnerable to unplanned pregnancies, which can make it harder to reach the family structure and size envisioned. 
Contraception isn’t just about prevention — it’s about empowerment. It gives couples the ability to align their reproductive lives with their long-term hopes and plans, rather than leaving something so significant up to chance.
If we’re serious about supporting families in Idaho, we need to start by empowering people to build the families they envision. Birth control plays an important role in that — it allows couples to plan for children when they’re ready, creating the stability and intention that strong families are built on. Ensuring Idahoans have the ability to prepare for parenthood better equips them to raise children in healthy, secure, and thriving homes.

New apartments reached almost 592,000 nationally last year, the highest number since 1974, with South Dakota and the Rapid City area approving new apartments at particularly high rates. (Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)More new apartments were built in 2024 than in any other year since 1974, but the Trump administration’s tariffs and deportations of potential construction workers, plus higher interest rates, could be a wet blanket on the boom.
A U.S. Census Bureau survey found almost 592,000 new apartments were finished last year, the most since the 1970s, when baby boomers sparked a construction surge as they moved out of their childhood homes. There were 693,000 new apartments built in 1974, when the country had about half as many households.
But there has been a steep slowdown in construction starts, as the newly completed apartments come online. The increased supply has lowered rents and increased vacancy rates, making new development less profitable. Some experts also say tariffs on construction materials and labor shortages caused by dips in immigration will create headwinds for new construction.
Apartment starts were down 27% in 2024 compared with 2023, and down 37% from a recent peak of 531,000 in 2022, despite the historic rate of completions. Apartment starts were at their lowest ebb since 2013.


Housing experts have long lamented that there aren’t enough apartments and single-family houses in the U.S. — at least not in places where people want to live and at prices they can afford. Estimates of the national housing shortage last year varied widely, from 1.5 million houses and apartments to 20.1 million; since then, another 1.6 million houses and apartments have been built. Most experts estimate a shortage of 1.5 million to 5.5 million, according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University.
Some states are building apartments faster than others, according to a Stateline analysis. Though completions aren’t tracked by state, permits that lead to new apartments have been granted at high rates in recent years in South Dakota, Utah, Arizona and Colorado. Rates are lowest in Mississippi, Wyoming, West Virginia, Rhode Island, Oklahoma and Alaska.
The massive jump in apartment construction has its roots in 2021 and 2022, when interest rates were low and rent growth was high, said Rob Warnock, senior research associate for Apartment List, a company that posts rental listings online.
“Those new apartments came online in 2023 and 2024, and while those deliveries are slowing down today, there are still many apartments in the pipeline,” said Warnock, who added that “supply and demand are coming back into balance.”
In response to greater supply, rents have fallen by about $50 per month (3.5%) from their 2022 peak, according to a report released this week by Apartment List. Apartment vacancy is at a 15-year high of 6.3%, keeping a lid on rents, but that could turn around as construction slows, according to an April report by Moody’s, a financial services company.
Apartment building has been a bipartisan priority as single-family home prices soar further out of the affordability range for young families. In South Dakota, the Republican-controlled legislature worked to prolong the building boom with grants and loans under the state’s Housing Infrastructure Financing Program. The program put $200 million of state and federal funding toward defraying the costs of development in new neighborhoods, such as roads, sewer lines and streetlights.
Republican state Sen. Casey Crabtree, sponsor of the proposal signed into law in 2023, told Stateline it was needed to address a housing shortage, especially in rural parts of the state.
“We have a drastic shortage of workers,” Crabtree said before a vote in 2023. “South Dakota businesses need more workers in our state. To get more workers, we need more housing.”
Armand Domalewski, co-founder of YIMBY Democrats for America, said overregulation is a barrier to housing construction in many areas that his party controls.
“A lot of blue-government areas and cities have extremely restrictive zoning, impact fees and other rules that make it very difficult to build housing,” said Domalewski. Another barrier is local opposition, he said.
“If it was just a free market, developers would want to build in the places like California, where prices are the highest and rents are the highest, because they’d make more money,” he added.
In California, the 2021 HOME Act was meant to spur more affordable housing and ease labor shortages, but it’s faced local opposition in some areas. At the end of last year, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed several measures that aim to streamline regulations and crack down on local resistance to the 2021 law.
South Dakota approved nearly 6,000 permits for apartment units in 2023 and 2024, which when completed would add about 1.4% to its 2023 total of 417,000 housing units. That’s the highest rate in the nation. By contrast, Mississippi during that same period approved about 660 apartment units — a fraction of 1 percentage point to its 2023 base of about 1.4 million housing units.
Chas Olson, executive director of the South Dakota Housing Development Authority, said the full impact of the state infrastructure funding isn’t apparent yet, as many developments that received the help are still under construction.
Completions are still strong this year with about 39,000 apartments finished in March, not much different from the 41,500 in March 2024, which was the biggest March number since 1985.
Another impediment to apartment construction has been high interest rates, which make it harder to borrow money to build, said Danushka Nanayakkara-Skillington, an assistant vice president for forecasting and analysis at the National Association of Home Builders.
She expects apartment building starts to slow until later this year.
“We are going to be short of workers for a long time. That’s the way it is. And of course tariffs are going to have an impact,” Nanayakkara-Skillington said.

Robin Smith of Hixson, ex-House Speaker Glen Casada of Franklin and former aide Cade Cothren, who posed as “Matthew Phoenix” to run the secret company called Phoenix Solutions.
“Remember you have zero connection to (Phoenix Solutions) and don’t know much except they’ve done work for you and they are good,” read one message from Cothren to Casada in November 2019.
Smith resigned her legislative seat in 2022 and pleaded guilty to honest services fraud in connection with a scheme in which she and Casada directed lawmakers to use Phoenix Solutions for their taxpayer-funded printing and postage program for constituent mailers. Casada and Cothren are charged with 20 counts of fraud, theft and money laundering.
In a December 2019 message read by Worcester, Cothren texted, “We just have to make sure no one knows it’s me involved.”
“That’s short term,” Casada responded. “In 12 months, no one will remember.”
Amid text discussions of how to gain additional campaign business from the House Republican Caucus, Cothren suggested disguising his voice on phone calls with caucus members. 
Flow of money from state to defendants outlined
Prosecutors outlined the money laundering method defendants allegedly used to cover up payments to a vendor that tapped into lawmakers’ constituents mailers in 2020.
Testimony from an FBI forensic accountant detailed how the money flowed to companies run by Smith, Casada and Cothren. 
Thursday’s testimony showed how the money allegedly flowed from the state to Phoenix Solutions or Cothren, whose identity was “masked” because of his 2019 resignation in connection with a racist and sexist texting scandal.
The FBI’s forensic accountant prepared several charts to show the trio allegedly laundered nearly $52,000 over the first half of 2020.
In one instance, Rivers Edge Alliance, a company run by Smith, sent invoices to the state for a total of $10,969 for producing mailers for Republican Reps. Esther Helton-Haynes of East Ridge, Dan Howell of Cleveland and Casada. House members receive $3,000 annually for postage and printing of constituent mailers.
The state paid Rivers Edge Alliance, which then sent a check to Phoenix Solutions for $10,100, which was transferred to Cothren, even though he wasn’t part of Smith’s company.
Almost all of the money wound up with Cothren, the accountant testified. Another chart showed Casada, who ran Rightway Consulting, and Smith received 25% each of the proceeds and Cothren 30% while the rest went back into Phoenix Solutions.

It’s not exactly the trial of the century (or the crime of the century, for that matter). But it’s good enough for folks around here.
They tell me that more corruption takes place at the Cordell Hull Building on a daily basis than in the entire Phoenix Solutions “scam” to tap into lawmakers’ constituent mailer business in early 2020.
In fact, Thursday’s federal courtroom crowd thinned out noticeably. But earlier in the week, when people still had feeling in their butt bones, a handful of interested lawmakers showed up, such as Republican Rep. Todd Warner and Democratic Reps. Gloria Johnson, Shaundelle Brooks, Gabby Salinas and Justin Jones. (The reference to rear end pain stems from sitting for hours on the wooden courtroom pews.)
Other Republicans such as Rep. Jay Reedy and Patsy Hazlewood were compelled — by subpoena — to testify about how they let the secretive company do their constituent mailers, not knowing that the ex-chief of staff for former House Speaker Glen Casada was running the company. Hazlewood and Reedy both said they wouldn’t have let Phoenix Solutions get their business if they’d known Cade Cothren was behind the set-up. He left the post following a racist and sexist texting scandal just four months before Casada vacated the leadership job in 2019 following a no-confidence vote by the House Republican Caucus.










Cade Cothren’s always been straight up to me. He’s done fantastic work. I’d put him up against the best in the state.


– Rep. Todd Warner, R-Chapel Hill 


Warner, a Chapel Hill Republican, was the only lawmaker to show up in support of Cothren. His home was raided the same day feds visited Cothren, Casada and Smith in 2021, but he hasn’t been indicted and said this week he hasn’t used his printing and postage account for constituent mailers, instead tapping into the $3,000 yearly allowance only to buy items such as flags for schools.  
Warner acknowledged Cothren has done consulting work for him, added. “He does very good work,” something the defense is trying to push.
Asked if he has any reservations about continuing to use Cothren, who is believed to be connected to Dixieland Strategies, as well as Phoenix Solutions, Warner said, “We’ll see how it plays out. He hasn’t been found guilty yet. Cade Cothren’s always been straight up to me. He’s done fantastic work. I’d put him up against the best in the state.”
Warner defeated incumbent Rep. Rick Tillis in 2020 while using Dixieland Strategies. Tillis, whose brother is U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis from North Carolina, was an online critic of Casada during his short tenure as House speaker. Someone urinated on Tillis’ office chair in 2019 just to add a little spice to the situation.
In contrast, Johnson wasn’t nearly as kind to the defendants when she spoke with the Lookout during a break in the trial.
  “I’m sitting there working on legislation. They’re working on how they can make money off the state, and that’s disgusting to me,” said Rep. Gloria Johnson, a Knoxville Democrat, outside Nashville’s federal courthouse. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
“What we’re talking about is what folks are doing up in Cordell Hull and up in the Capitol, and the corruption that we see,” Johnson said. 
Smith testified Monday that almost as soon as she arrived in Nashville after winning election and replacing former House Majority Leader Gerald McCormick she met with Casada and Cothren about finding a way to make money, Johnson pointed out.
“And then she starts talking about … we went for the state mail accounts because it was low-hanging fruit,” Johnson said. “So she said her colleagues were low-hanging fruit and those state taxpayer dollars were low-hanging fruit for them.”
“I’m sitting there working on legislation. They’re working on how they can make money off the state, and that’s disgusting to me,” Johnson said.
Questions are being raised by the defense and on-lookers about the minuscule amount of money involved in the case, about $52,000. But while lawyers argued this week over whether evidence could be admitted dealing with efforts to win Republican Caucus and campaign business – which they did – it was likely only the beginning, that is until they got caught.
“Just another brick in the wall”
Defense attorneys for Cothren subpoenaed just about everyone but the late pope to testify. 
They also served a subpoena on Smith’s Chattanooga attorney, Ben Rose, on Wednesday (not for his flashy suits) for allegedly trying to communicate with Smith while she was on the stand.
It happened when defense attorney Cynthia Sherwood asked Smith to tell her about discussions she had with Rose this week after trial was recessed. Everyone in the court burst out laughing, knowing talk between attorneys and clients is privileged information. 
During a back-and-forth between Sherwood and Smith that got a little tense, the defense attorney asked her if she was communicating with her attorney from the stand. Smith responded by saying she couldn’t see his head in the back of the courtroom.
Still, Sherwood — after co-counsel Joy Longnecker whispered in her ear — said she might try to have that attorney-client privilege waived.  
Sources tell the Lookout that they tried to serve a subpoena Wednesday on Rose in the courtroom but then asked him to return it because they needed to make a copy. This hasn’t been confirmed.
  No laughing matter? Courtroom observers burst out laughing when an attorney for the defense asked former Rep. Robin Smith, center, to disclose conversations she had with her attorney, Ben Rose, left, when court wasn’t in session. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
Rose tried to have the subpoena quashed Thursday, and his co-counsel, David Bridgers, told Judge Eli Richardson they felt the defense was making a “deliberate attempt” to confuse Smith on the stand.
“We wish the government had objected sooner,” Bridgers said, adding they felt “defenseless.” “All we were doing was saying ‘object’ and to no one in particular other than ourselves.”
Richardson deferred the matter. But the Lookout believes everyone can agree it’s little wonder the trio in question couldn’t keep Phoenix Solutions a secret because Smith can’t stop talking, even when the judge says answer only “yes or no.”
How long can we take it?
First, people wanted to know if this trial would start as rescheduled on April 22 after a multitude of delays. Indictments were made in August 2022.
Now, everyone wants to know when it will end. One of the jurors asked to be excused because she couldn’t afford to miss four weeks of pay. That sent shock waves through the courtroom.
After the first couple of days, it seemed that four weeks was a major underestimation, especially since Judge Richardson had to keep calling the attorneys to the bench for a sidebar every 15 minutes, once because the defense objected to the prosecution asking a witness to describe House “leadership,” not whether they’re good or bad, which we already know, but who they are.
Another major delay broke out in an argument over whether the prosecution could admit evidence dealing with Republican Caucus and campaign work done by Phoenix. Richardson said he hadn’t seen such a ruckus in his 27 years in federal court. Clearly, he’s never covered the Tennessee House chamber where fights, riots and name-calling are as common as sarcasm in the press box.
Anyway, we’re predicting this ain’t over by a long shot.
“It’s been such a long time / I think I should be going / And time doesn’t wait for me / It keeps on rollin’.” *

May 1, 2025 | Photo by Erick Diaz VelizAfter a rainy Thursday afternoon, hundreds of people, including workers, students, and retired community members, marched through the streets of downtown Detroit, rejecting and criticizing the Trump administration’s actions during its first 100 days in office, which has featured an assault on diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, and a rollback of federal agencies and departments.
The march took place as part of a demonstration organized by May Day Detroit, 50501 Michigan, and other local social movements. It began with a rally that brought together hundreds of people outside Michigan Central Station at Roosevelt Park in the Corktown neighborhood, commemorating International Workers’ Day.
This demonstration took place alongside others organized simultaneously in various cities across the country and throughout the state of Michigan. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
International Workers’ Day, also known as May Day, commemorates the historic fight for an eight-hour workday and the broader pursuit of fair labor conditions, stemming from events like the Haymarket affair in Chicago in 1886.
As the sky began to clear and the rain subsided, dozens of people approached Roosevelt Park carrying signs and banners criticizing Elon Musk, Trump, and the current administration.
Various groups gathered on the sidewalk along Michigan Avenue holding their signs to begin their demonstration, receiving both support and, in some cases, rejection from passing drivers. At the same time, other groups were gathering in the park as the speakers were about to begin
“Long live international workers’ solidarity,” said Frank Hammer, 82, labor activist and former president of the United Auto Workers Local 909.
“We are embracing May Day and putting the ruling class on notice that we are here to fight as one united working class,” Hammer added.
Several speakers addressed the crowd during the rally, touching on topics such as the deportation of immigrant workers, police violence, worker layoffs, funding cuts, and the rising death toll of Palestinian civilians in Gaza.
“While our essential services are being cut, law enforcement remains well-funded and well-protected.” said Victoria Camille, a member of the Coalition for Police Transparency and Accountability. “Instead, our basic needs are being stripped, while law enforcement stands by to uphold so-called ‘law and order.’ What’s happening in our country is neither lawful nor orderly in any way.”
Amid federal funding cuts that have affected Michigan communities in food, education, health, and research, a bipartisan plan supported by Michigan House Republicans proposes creating a $115 million annual Public Safety and Violence Prevention Trust Fund to support local law enforcement.
Although there was a great sense of optimism regarding the social actions against the Trump administration during the demonstration, some community members expressed concern about the effectiveness of these actions since the beginning of the current government.
“We (workers) are gonna get hit hard, we’re gonna have tariffs by the middle of the summer, and when that happens, there will be a lot of layoffs. We’re gonna have people very desperate,” said George Lutz, 29, a Detroit resident.
“People are happy to go and make funny signs about Elon Musk and Trump, but when the police start shutting down factories, or when people really have to face the authorities of this country, when they are desperate, they will be forced to take it more seriously than now,” Lutz highlighted.
A few minutes past 5 p.m., the protesters began to march along Michigan Avenue toward downtown Detroit, carrying their signs and chanting slogans in support of workers, such as “May Day every day across the USA” and “Sí se puede,” which means “Yes, we can” in Spanish.
The protesters made a stop at the Patrick V. McNamara Federal Building, where more speakers took the microphone to express their concerns to the audience.
“Our postal office is under attack; they (the government) want to privatize it, just turn it into a profit-making corporation, and we don’t work for profit. Sending letters will become more expensive,” said Gina Favors, 75, a retired member of the postal workers’ union. “Help us keep the postal office public; it was made for the people, let’s keep it that way.”
Trump, who referred to the constitutionally-mandated institution as a money-losing entity, has floated the idea of transferring the postal service to the Department of Commerce.
The protesters marched through some streets in downtown Detroit, escorted by police cars at the front and rear of the march, until they returned to Michigan Avenue, where more protesters joined them while others observed from their windows. They arrived back at Roosevelt Park, where the protest ended around 7:30 p.m. without any incidents.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/164A0474-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-02 06:03:36.549319

(NIH/Public domain)I commend the National Institutes of Health for Tuesday’s announcement that it will begin leaning into human- rather than animal-based research. As a physician in Salida, I believe this is great news for human health. Experiments using organoids, tissue chips, computational models, and real-world data analyses produce results that more directly translate to humans.
“For decades, our biomedical research system has relied heavily on animal models. With this initiative, NIH is ushering in a new era of innovation,” NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya said in the announcement. “By integrating advances in data science and technology with our growing understanding of human biology, we can fundamentally reimagine the way research is conducted — from clinical development to real-world application. This human-based approach will accelerate innovation, improve healthcare outcomes, and deliver life-changing treatments. It marks a critical leap forward for science, public trust, and patient care.”
This positive news comes just days after the Food and Drug Administration announced it would begin to phase out animal use in favor of human-relevant research methods.

This shift away from animal experiments will allow new, more effective pharmaceuticals to be delivered to the market sooner for patients who need them. 
It will save money. A 2022 economic analysis estimated that the use of non-animal technologies for new drug toxicity testing instead of animal tests could generate over $24 billion in increased research productivity. This would mean streamlined drug development and translate to cost savings for patients.
And, it will reduce the number — estimated at more than 100 million — of dogs, cats, monkeys, mice, rats and other animals being used in painful and deadly experiments each year. 
In a recent poll, 86% of Americans said “animal experimentation should be phased out in favor of more modern research methods.”
I wholeheartedly agree. And now, the NIH and FDA do too.

(U.S. Army Corps of Engineers photo by Michael Davis) As a public affairs specialist for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, my job is to help tell the story, but I’ve never been one to make myself part of it. In fact, I’ve never written a commentary before. But after spending the last month deployed to western North Carolina as part of the Hurricane Helene recovery mission, I realized that sometimes the most honest way to tell the story is to share the view from the ground, through my own experience and perspective. 
My goal is to help the public understand the scale, complexity and humanity behind this mission. With my deployment soon coming to an end, and another public affairs professional rotating in to continue telling this story, it felt like the right time to reflect on what I’ve experienced and why this work matters.

First impressions on the ground 
When I arrived here, it had already been more than six months since Hurricane Helene carved its way through the region. As a 20-year Air Force veteran, I’m no stranger to deployments or disaster zones, but I was still taken aback by the scale of devastation that remained. Piles of storm debris filled riverbanks and blocked access to homes and businesses, but just as striking as the damage was the recovery already underway. There were visible signs that, with the help of FEMA, USACE, and our contractors and partners, communities were finding their footing again. 
One of my first stops upon arriving was a temporary debris management site. The sheer volume of material was staggering, with massive mounds of both vegetative and manmade debris. Trucks came and went in a constant flow, unloading raw debris and hauling away mulch by the ton. I had seen news footage before I arrived but seeing it in person gave me a new respect for what it takes to move a community toward recovery. Not just the scale of the effort, but the coordination, the endurance and the heart behind it. 
Understanding the complexity of disaster response 
Each day since then has deepened that understanding. In my role, I have the privilege of traveling to different sites throughout the region, such as waterway debris removal operations, water treatment facilities, meetings with local leaders, and everywhere in between. I get to see the full picture, both figuratively and literally, as I document the mission through photos and stories for the public and our stakeholders. And from that vantage point, I’ve learned something that I believe more people need to hear.
From the outside, disaster response may seem simple: see a problem, send help. But the reality is far more complex. There’s a structure, a chain of requests and assignments, and a deliberate process in place to ensure resources are used efficiently, fairly and in accordance with the law. 
In the aftermath of a disaster like Hurricane Helene, federal agencies like the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are ready and willing to help, but we are limited in what we can do initially. The process starts with a presidential disaster declaration, followed by state and local governments identifying specific needs. FEMA then assigns missions to various federal agencies, including USACE, based on those needs. That’s how we end up where we are, doing what we’re doing. It’s not about picking and choosing; it’s about fulfilling a very specific role within a much larger response framework. 
Stewardship, accountability and urgency 
I’ve also come to see the importance of something that often gets overlooked, which is stewardship. The funding that supports these recovery efforts comes from taxpayers across the country. That means someone in Kansas, Delaware or even Alaska, is contributing to the cleanup here in North Carolina. And with that comes a responsibility to be accountable. That’s why eligibility rules exist for what can be removed and how contractors are paid. It’s also why we have safeguards in place to help prevent fraud, waste and abuse. 
That same sense of responsibility applies to the environment. Many of the areas we’re working in are ecologically sensitive: waterways with nesting birds, vegetation that supports wildlife, and communities that rely on natural beauty to fuel their tourism economies. And while we’re mindful of those concerns, we also have to balance them with urgency. Every day that work is delayed, livelihoods hang in the balance. The contractors working here are operating under agreements that require steady progress.  The funding that supports these recovery efforts is tied directly to performance milestones. If work stalls, it doesn’t just affect a schedule, it can jeopardize the resources available to continue the mission, slow down the recovery for entire communities, and prolong the hardship for families and businesses that are depending on us. 
The clock is always ticking; not just for us, but for the people whose lives and futures  are still shaped by what Hurricane Helene left behind. 
Unique circumstances 
This mission has also presented challenges that most hurricane responses don’t. Coastal regions often have disaster plans in place. They’ve seen these storms before and are equipped to act quickly. But the mountains of western North Carolina aren’t where you would expect to experience a hurricane. This storm hit, leaving state and local officials, residents, and even federal partners navigating unfamiliar territory. The learning curve was steep, and decisions had to be made in real time. That led to frustration, misinformation and, at times, assumptions that didn’t reflect the full picture. But through it all, one thing has been clear. Every person here, from government employees to contractors to local leaders, is here to help. That’s the common theme in every conversation, every challenge, and every cubic yard of debris cleared. 
The people behind the mission 
One of the greatest privileges of this deployment has been meeting the people behind the mission. I get to talk to contractors, Corps employees and local officials every day. Not just about what they do, but why they do it. Through a series we call Responder Spotlight, I’ve had the chance to interview individuals who volunteered to deploy here from across the country, many leaving behind families, home districts and daily routines to support a community they had never visited before. Their reasons vary. Some are drawn by duty, others by curiosity, and many by a deep desire to serve. But whatever the reason, their impact is unmistakable. 
Each person has a story worth telling. And while I can’t highlight them all here, one interaction during a site visit reminded me of just how connected this mission is to the people we’re here to help. 
During a visit to the region by the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, Mr. Lee Forsgren, we stopped at one of our private property debris removal sites where the owners had requested and been approved for assistance in removing debris left by Hurricane Helene. In addition to scattered vegetative debris, a historic structure on their land had been severely damaged — a tobacco barn that had stood on the family property for more than 100 years. 
As we stood there, we watched an excavator operator carefully begin the demolition. He removed wooden planks from one corner of the building, then moved to the opposite side and, with a final push, brought the structure down. The barn crumbled in a cloud of dust and splintered wood, collapsing onto itself.

The structure was damaged in Hurricane Helene and presented a safety concern requiring it to be torn down and removed. (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers photo by Michael Davis)
What made the moment so impactful was seeing the property owners look on as it happened. This wasn’t just an old shed or garage that could easily be replaced. It was a piece of their family’s history. A place filled with memories, tied to generations of work, pride and tradition. It needed to come down for safety reasons, but its loss left a void both physically on the property and emotionally in their lives. 
Being able to share in that moment, and to capture it through my camera lens, will stay with me long after this deployment ends. And for Mr. Forsgren, witnessing that scene firsthand, I’m sure offered a powerful, undeniable reminder of what the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is doing here, and why this mission matters so deeply. 
Mr. Forsgren was accompanied on his visit by Maj. Gen. Jason Kelly, the USACE deputy commanding general for Civil and Emergency Operations. While speaking to some local media, Kelly explained that when you wear the military uniform, you’re often playing the “away game,” deploying overseas to protect our country and interests. But here, in North Carolina, we’re playing the “home game.” We’re helping Americans, in America. For me, there’s something special and deeply fulfilling about that.  
Why we keep showing up 
There are frustrating days, of course. Particularly when managing social media. Most of the feedback is positive, but occasionally someone will misunderstand what we’re doing, or use the comments to spread misinformation. We try not to let it get to us. Sometimes it’s an opportunity to clarify and educate. Other times, our followers jump in and offer support themselves. But in those moments, I’m reminded why it’s so important to keep telling the story. Because even while other parts of the country face new emergencies — wildfires in the West, floods in the South, hurricane season on the horizon — the work here isn’t finished. There are still people hurting, still communities trying to recover, and still lives waiting to be put back together.  
At the heart of it all, I guess what I would want people to know is that we’re still here. USACE and our partners are still on the ground, still clearing debris, and still helping communities in western North Carolina recover from a storm that changed everything. This isn’t just about logistics, equipment or contracts; it’s about people. 
Disaster response doesn’t end when the cameras leave or the headlines change. It continues quietly, behind the scenes, carried out by individuals who care deeply about doing the right thing whether anyone notices or not. 
If I could bring the public out here for just one day, I’d want them to see what I see. Not just the debris or the cleanup, but the resilience and the commitment. The business owner getting ready for the summer season. The kayaker asking when the river will be safe again. The contractor working weekends and holidays to finish a job because he knows it matters. This region is filled with beauty, both natural and human, and the urgency to restore it is real. 
And with hurricane season approaching and wildfire risks rising, we know this work is about more than just recovery. It’s about readiness. Helping one community recover quickly makes space for us to help the next. 
That’s why we’re still here, that’s why we keep showing up, and that’s why we’ll keep telling the story until the last load of debris is cleared, and long after.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Hurricane-Helene-debris-Army-Corps-photo-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-05-02 06:03:36.549319

While the Virginia Freedom of Information Act presumes all government business is by default public and requires officials to justify why exceptions should be made, too many Virginia leaders in practice take the opposite stance, acting as if records are by default private and the public must prove they should be handled otherwise.
In this feature, we aim to highlight the frequency with which officials around Virginia are resisting public access to records on issues large and small — and note instances when the release of information under FOIA gave the public insight into how government bodies are operating. 

The Mercury’s efforts to track FOIA and other transparency cases in Virginia are indebted to the work of the Virginia Coalition for Open Government, a nonprofit alliance dedicated to expanding access to government records, meetings and other state and local proceedings.

 Former Richmond FOIA officer’s case against city moves forward

A trial date has been scheduled for Sept. 23 in a transparency case involving the city of Richmond’s former Freedom of Information Act officer, who said she was fired in retaliation for refusing to flout FOIA laws and raising concerns about possible FOIA violations during her tenure.
Connie Clay, the former Richmond FOIA officer, also said in her lawsuit against the city that her former supervisor, then-city director Petula Burks, instructed Clay to withhold information requested under the Act. Burks, who resigned from her role with the city last summer, is also named in the suit filed in March 2024.
On Tuesday, Judge Claire G. Cardwell set the discovery process to begin on May 27 at 11 a.m. The three-day jury trial is to start on Sept. 23. The judge asked both sides to fully cooperate in the process. 
“I understand strong advocacy,” Cardwell told attorneys on Tuesday, as quoted by the Richmonder. “But without pointing fingers in either direction, I would like counsel to start anew.” 
“To the extent you can work together on administrative matters, please do so,” she added.
Richmond attempted to dismiss the case in January, but was denied by Cardwell, according to a report by VPM.
“Although Plaintiff’s Complaint does not explicitly connect her good faith disclosures of suspected wrongdoing to defendants’ retaliation and discrimination toward her, the Court may reasonably infer this alleged conduct flowed from her disclosures of suspected FOIA violations,” Cardwell wrote in her Feb. 5 order. 
 News editor wins in transparency case against Flock Safety

A Roanoke Circuit Court judge recently ruled that the city of Roanoke violated the Freedom of Information Act and is required to fulfill a renewed request for traffic camera footage of Cardinal News Executive Editor Jeff Schwaner’s vehicle, Cardinal News reported.
Schwaner requested information from Flock Safety’s License Plate Reader, which was footage of his car from Roanoke police, on Feb. 21. He filed the same request for 15 other law enforcement agencies. Flock Safety provides the license plate reading hardware and maintains the data.  
In response, the city and the Botetourt County Sheriff’s Office filed a motion in the Roanoke City Circuit Court asking the court to decide whether it was obligated to provide the footage under FOIA.
Another issue raised during the court proceedings is that camera data automatically erases after 30 days. As a result, the data Schwaner sought in February did not exist, the city said.
Judge Leisa Ciaffone “did not find that the city “willfully and knowingly” denied the request in a way that would make it subject to additional penalties that can be assessed when FOIA is violated,”  Cardinal News reported.
However, she dismissed all the city’s arguments for not fulfilling the FOIA request. She also ruled that the FOIA law outweighed local policies and contracts that localities may have with third parties like Flock Safety.
“The court finds that Mr. Schwaner has substantially prevailed on the merits and grants his reasonable attorney’s fees and costs associated with this action,” the judge wrote.
John Koehler, Schwaner’s attorney, told Cardinal News that they are pleased with the court’s ruling that the city must release the data. 
“Transparency in government gathering of data about the public is necessary to assure that the benefit that can be derived from the effort is worth both the expense and the impact on the community,” Koehler said.
Schwaner added that at the core of this request was a single idea: “that the public has as much a right to know what’s going on in public as anybody.”
WDBJ7 did reach out to the city of Roanoke for comment on the case, but the city declined to comment out of deference to the circuit court.
Gov. Glenn Youngkin is considering legislation that would put restrictions on the use and data retention of license plate readers and exempt system data from disclosure. Youngkin has until Friday to rule on the proposal.
 CDC public records staff placed on leave

Congressman Gerry Connolly, D-Va., is requesting information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention regarding why the agency’s public records staff was placed on administrative leave until their jobs are eliminated June 2.
The CDC layoffs come after hundreds of federal workers including health agency workers were fired amid President Donald Trump’s administration’s restructuring of the federal government.
The letter, which was published by NPR and directed to CDC’s acting director Dr. Susan Monarez, states FOIA ensures that the public has a “right” to access federal agency information. Since its enactment in 1967, it has been crucial to ensuring government transparency and accountability.
“As a result, there are currently zero personnel available to process FOIA requests received by CDC,” Connolly wrote in his April 24 letter. “The elimination of staff responsible for facilitating FOIA strongly implies an effort by the administration to prevent the public from obtaining information about their government that they are entitled to request.”
Connolly requested a response by May 8. He announced earlier this week his plans to retire.
 Richmond’s new pump increased fluoridation levels

Richmond water remains safe to drink after the recent installation of a new pump increased fluoridation levels at its treatment plant, the city announced on Monday.
The announcement, made roughly three months after Richmond faced a debilitating water crisis as state lawmakers returned to begin the 2025 General Assembly session in January, leaving thousands without drinking water.
On April 23, the city discovered the fluoride levels did increase, but at no point did samples collected in the distribution system indicate the fluoridation level exceeded the Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) of 4.0 mg/L within the region, which is the highest level allowed in drinking water by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
The city said the optimal target is 0.7 mg/L. 
Hanover County said in a statement it was “disappointed by the lack of communication” from the city, and that they didn’t learn of the incident until four days later. The locality said the Virginia Department of Emergency Management notified its officials about the fluoride leak on the evening of April 27. In response, Hanover determined through its own testing that its system was well within the MCL with 1.6 ppm.
Mayor Danny Avula, who took office at the start of the year, said in a statement that he was disappointed that the city’s Department of Public Utilities did not notify the Department of Health within the required 24-hour period.
The city said the Department of Public Utilities is creating new state standard operating procedures for the water treatment plant.
“I’m disappointed with our failure to communicate,” Avula said. “This incident damages the work we’re doing to rebuild trust — not only with the residents of Richmond, but our communities, and our regional partners, including Henrico, Chesterfield, and Hanover. We must do better.”

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)Virginia voters can begin casting ballots Friday, May 2, as early voting opens for the June 17 primary elections. These primaries will determine party nominees for key statewide offices and legislative seats ahead of the November general election, which could reshape the state’s political landscape.​
While Virginia’s gubernatorial race between Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears and former U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger is set, Democrats still have to settle their tickets for lieutenant governor and attorney general.
All 133 Virginia localities will hold a Democratic primary, while just 31 will host a Republican one. Six candidates are competing in the Democratic primary for lieutenant governor:
A labor leader and employment attorney from Northern Virginia, Alex Bastani once juggled law school at night while working as an economist at the U.S. Department of Labor.
Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Chesterfield, made history in 2019 when she became the first Muslim and South Asian American woman elected to the Virginia Senate.
With a background in medicine and education, Dr. Babur Lateef chairs the Prince William County School Board and has led the University of Virginia Health System Board.
State Sen. Aaron Rouse, a Virginia Beach state senator and former NFL safety, won his seat in a 2023 special election.
A former federal prosecutor now practicing law in Arlington, Victor Salgado handled high-profile cases during his tenure, including the prosecution of Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio.
And Levar Stoney, who served as Richmond’s youngest mayor until January, also held the role of Virginia’s Secretary of the Commonwealth before launching his bid for higher office.
The winner will face Republican nominee John Reid, a conservative radio host and the first openly gay man to run statewide in Virginia. 
Reid’s candidacy has sparked controversy within the GOP after explicit images surfaced online, leading Gov. Glenn Youngkin to request his withdrawal. Reid denies any connection to the images and has vowed to continue his campaign, highlighting internal divisions within the party.​
For attorney general, the Democratic primary features Jay Jones, a former state delegate from Norfolk who in 2021 unsuccessfully challenged then-incumbent Mark Herring for his party’s nomination, and Shannon Taylor, Henrico County’s commonwealth’s attorney. 
Jones, a lifelong Norfolk resident, previously served as an assistant attorney general and represented the 89th District in the House of Delegates. Taylor, first elected in 2011, has emphasized her experience as a prosecutor in her campaign. 
The victor will challenge incumbent Republican Jason Miyares, who is seeking re-election.​
House of Delegates: Competitive primaries across the state
All 100 seats in the Virginia House of Delegates are up for election this year. Democrats currently hold a narrow majority, and both parties are fielding candidates in multiple districts.​
Several Democratic primaries are drawing attention:​

House District 1: Incumbent Del. Patrick Hope, D-Arlington, faces a challenge from Sean Phillip Epstein and Arjoon Srikanth
House District 32: Michael Forbes and Jonathan Michael Lucci are seeking their party’s nomination to challenge Del. Bill Wiley, R-Winchester.
House District 40: Donna Littlepage and Kiesha Preston are running to take on Del. Joe McNamara, R-Roanoke County.
House District 49: Jasmine Lipscomb and Gary Miller are vying for their party’s nomination in a Republican-leaning district currently represented by Del. Danny Marshall, R-Danville, who is not seeking reelection. 
House District 57: May Nivar and Andrew Schear are seeking to take on Del. David Owen, R-Henrico. 
House District 72: Randolph Critzer and Bilal Raychouni are competing for the chance to challenge Del. Lee Ware, D-Powhatan. 
House District 73: Voters will choose between Leslie Mehta and Justin Woodford to decide who challenges Del. Mark Earley, R-Chesterfield, and independent candidate Michael Talat Saleh Azab.
House District 75: In the most crowded House primary this cycle, Lindsey Dougherty, Stephen Miller-Pitts and Dustin Wade are battling for the opportunity to oppose Del. Carrie Coyner, R-Chesterfield.
House District 81: Alicia Atkins is taking on Del. Delores McQuinn, D-Richmond. No Republican has filed in this district yet.
House District 89: The primary between Blaizen Buckshot Bloom and Karen Robins Carnegie will decide which Democrat will face the Republican nominee hoping to succeed Del. Baxter Ennis, R-Chesapeake.

Republicans are having primaries in these districts:

House District 21: Gregory Lee Gorham, Xanthe Larsen and Sahar Smith are competing for the chance to unseat Del. Josh Thomas, D-Prince William. 
House District 37: Austen Schwend is hoping to unseat Del. Terry Austin, R-Botetourt. If successful, he will face Sharron Burgess, the lone Democrat running in this Republican-leaning district, in the November election.
House District 46: Mitchell Cornett and Adam Tolbert are hoping to face Democrat Jamie Ralston Henry in this district currently represented by Del. Jed Arnold, R-Smyth, who is not seeking reelection. 
House District 49: The primary contest between Vanessa Reynolds Scearce and Madison Whittle will decide who will succeed Del. Danny Marshall, R-Danville, and face the Democratic nominee who has yet to be selected. 
House District 62: Karen Hamilton and Clay Jackson are competing for the chance to take on Sara Ratcliffe, the lone Democrat running in this district. 
House District 70: The winner between Cynthia Scaturico and Hailey Shupe-Dollar will go up against Del. Shelly Simonds, D-Newport News, in November. 
House District 89: Either Mike Lamonea or Kristen Shannon will face the Democratic nominee in a district currently represented by Del. Baxter Ennis, R-Chesapeake, who is not running for reelection. 
House District 97: Former Del. Tim Anderson and Christina Miriam Felder are seeking the Republican nomination to take on Del. Michael Feggans, D-Virginia Beach.

Voting information and key dates
Virginia conducts open primaries, allowing any registered voter to participate in either party’s primary, though not both. Early voting runs from May 2 through June 14. Voters can cast ballots in person at their local registrar’s office or vote by mail.​
Important deadlines:

May 27: Deadline to register to vote or update registration.
June 6: Deadline to apply for a mailed absentee ballot.
June 14: Last day for in-person early voting.
June 17: Primary Election Day

For more information on early voting locations and to find your polling place, visit the Virginia Department of Elections website.
Voter turnout forecast
In recent years, voter turnout in Virginia’s primary elections has fluctuated, reflecting varying levels of public engagement. For instance, the 2021 Democratic primary saw about 8% of registered voters casting ballots —  a slight decrease from the 10% turnout in 2017, which was one of the highest in recent history. This dip occurred despite the presence of competitive races and increased accessibility to early voting options.
Nationally, primary election turnout often lags behind general elections. Since 2000, average turnout for general elections in the U.S. has been more than twice as high as for primaries. 
This trend suggests that while general elections draw broader participation, primaries are typically decided by a more engaged subset of voters.

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)Three Virginia Planned Parenthood health centers in Richmond, Hampton and Virginia Beach have been affected by federal Title X family planning grant freezes, losing over $1 million in funds fueling family planning services. 
Established in 1970, the federal program helps low and extremely low-income people access family planning care like contraception, sexually transmitted disease screenings and treatment as well as cancer screenings, at low or no cost. 
Virginia League for Planned Parenthood CEO Paulette McElwain said that clinics in Virginia became aware of the federal funding changes on March 31, which means that about 11,000 patients will now have to pay higher costs for services. 
She added that more than half of the Title X patients that VLPP cares for have incomes at or below the federal poverty level — the demographics that the federal funding program is meant to support. 
“VLPP is working hard to keep costs for patients as low as possible but inevitably, the loss of $1.2 million in funds that directly subsidized family planning services will impact patients,” McElwain said. “It is profoundly disappointing that the Trump administration is putting politics ahead of the health care needs of the people Planned Parenthood serves.” 
The Trump administration is facing a lawsuit over the cuts to the funding. California, Hawaii, Mississippi, Maine, Missouri, Montana and Utah have been completely cut off from the grants, according to the lawsuit, while Alaska, Connecticut, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia have had their access reduced. While costs for care have gone up for patients in Virginia, other states have reported the possibilities of reduced hours, laid off staff or closures of clinics altogether. 
Filed in the District Court of Columbia, the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association and the American Civil Liberties Union’s 35-page lawsuit argues that about 842,000 people across the affected states now face reduced access to care. With the Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. named as the top defendant, the suit argues that HHS has withheld $65.8 million over disagreements about organizations’ “opposition to racism” and speculation of “providing care to undocumented immigrants.”
While legal challenges to changes in reproductive health care access play out at the federal level, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin may soon weigh in on a right-to-contraception bill from this most recent legislative session. After passing the legislature, he sought amendments. 
Youngkin’s substitute of the bill reinforces two U.S. Supreme Court cases that deal with access to contraception nationwide, while the right-to-contraception proposal prior to his substitute would apply specifically to Virginia if those federal cases should be overturned.
After helping overturn federal abortion protections in 2022, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas expressed interest in revisiting cases that upheld contraception protections. As some states have also explored contraceptive restrictions in recent years, reproductive rights advocates and some lawmakers in Virginia have emphasized the benefit of strengthening state law, should federal protections for contraception also be overturned.
While the measure also cleared the legislature last year, Youngkin sought amendments that the bill’s patrons said “gutted” it because it reinstated the federal court cases for which protection hinges on before he ultimately vetoed it. 
He has until Friday to choose to sign the bill as it had cleared the legislature this year, or to veto it  again.

As anyone who steps outside of a gated community these days is aware, the number of impoverished and homeless people living on the street is, thanks to our unjust and top heavy economy, way up.
What’s more, providing useful assistance to these people – many of whom struggle with disabilities, mental and physical health challenges and just plain hopelessness — is extremely tough.
Here, however, is one thing we do know from the experts who do this heroic work: passing laws to make life on the street even tougher isn’t a solution.
Unfortunately, that’s where the North Carolina legislature is heading with a bill that would force local governments to criminalize camping or sleeping on public property.
As a Methodist pastor told lawmakers, quote “How can we push down folks who are already down? Seems like it’s impossible, but this bill has figured it out.”
The bottom line: As several advocates told lawmakers, the solution to homelessness lies in a sustained commitment to building a genuine social safety net and ending poverty, not criminalizing people who have no other place to go.

“The Ohio Housing Trust Fund is the primary source of state funding for local homelessness, emergency home repair and affordable housing development,” the Coalition on Homelessness and Housing in Ohio’s executive director Amy Riegel said during a press conference Thursday. “We see that making any type of change and overhauling it would be drastic and would make huge ripple impacts across the state.”
The trust fund was created in 1991 and is administered by the Ohio Department of Development. It is funded by a portion of the fees collected by county recorders, with half of the fees staying with the county and the other half going back to the fund — which requires at least 50% of the funds be spent in non-urban areas. 
The House budget proposal would remove the requirement for county recorders to send the state Department of Development money to reallocate the funds, making it less effective across the state.
“This would leave counties with only the funds that they are able to collect, which creates a drastic impact on communities where they might not be collecting as many revenues as other counties,” Riegel said. “Shifting to a county-by-county approach will negatively impact folks who are struggling to just keep her roof over their heads.”
Robert Bender, CEO of the Provident Companies, is concerned counties could lose their leveraging ability and wouldn’t have the capacity to administer funds. 
“We have an easy solution: just don’t mess with it,” he said. “This is really elected officials who don’t have enough information trying to tinker with something to make it better when it’s going to make it worse.”
The Housing Trust Fund provided emergency shelter for more than 27,000 Ohioans last year, Riegel said. 
“That’s just one year,” Riegel said. “Multiply that by the last 23 years, and you can see this has a huge impact across our state.” 
Housing advocates asked House lawmakers why the amendment was added, but Riegel said the rationale behind it remains unclear. Now, they are talking to Ohio senators about trying to remove the amendment. 
“We have heard from many of them that they do support removing the language … however, it is the decision of the entire body of how to move forward,” Riegel said.
Habitat for Humanity of Ohio’s Executive Director Ryan Miller said they serve primarily populations of people who have paid off their homes, are living on fixed incomes and dealing with health issues. 
“They have no other option, and we must keep the current funding structure in place to let them live in dignity and peace,” he said. 
The trust fund is one of the most effective tools to reduce homelessness, said Becky Eddy, chief community development officer for the Integrated Services for Behavioral Health. 
“The current regional approach isn’t broken,” she said. “Shifting to a fractured county-by-county model would slow things down, drive the administrative costs and ultimately increase homelessness across the state.”

State attorneys general are urging concerned customers to delete their data, while experts warn that state and federal laws may not fully protect their privacy. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The fate of more than 15 million customers’ genetic data remains in limbo after popular DNA testing company 23andMe filed for bankruptcy in March. The data is up for sale, stoking fears about how it might be used and prompting attorneys general from more than a dozen states to warn 23andMe users: Delete your data.
“Your genetic data is your most personal, confidential data, and you should be able to protect who has access to it,” North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson, a Democrat, said in a March statement.
“You have the power to delete your data now — please act quickly.”
Dr. Adam Brown, a Washington, D.C.-based emergency physician and the founder of a health care strategy firm, deleted his information on 23andMe as soon as he learned of the bankruptcy filing, he told Stateline.
For him, the bankruptcy begs a vital question that federal and state laws don’t fully address: What happens to your genetic data when the company holding it collapses?
Federal protections are flimsy. States have beefed up their genetic privacy laws in recent years, but many experts say they don’t go far enough.










There actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.


– Dr. Adam Brown, emergency physician and founder of a health care strategy company


23andMe has said the bankruptcy will not change how it stores, manages or protects its trove of sensitive customer information. In a news release issued shortly after the bankruptcy announcement, the company said any potential buyers would have to agree to comply with 23andMe’s consumer privacy policy and all applicable laws. When contacted by Stateline, the company declined to comment beyond what it has published in news releases and information it posted for customers on its website.
But once the data is in the hands of another company, that company could change its privacy policy at any time, experts noted.
“Once you get to the point of bankruptcy court, there may not be those same guarantees or the same ethos a new company may have around privacy protections for consumers,” Brown said.
“I want people to understand there actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.”
HIPAA doesn’t help
Companies such as 23andMe offer their users potentially game-changing revelations about their health and ancestry. The process is simple: Mail in a saliva sample and the company uses it to build an individual genetic profile that can reveal not only a person’s family connections, but also health insights such as their risk of developing a disease like cancer or Alzheimer’s.
This valuable personal data underpins a direct-to-customer genetic testing market that was valued at $1.93 billion globally in 2023 and is expected to grow, according to market research firm Grand View Research.
23andMe was an industry giant until its stock price plummeted following a massive 2023 data breach that affected the accounts of nearly 7 million customers. Then came the $30 million class-action lawsuit settlement.
The company declared bankruptcy in late March of this year, and announced it’s up for sale.
States Battle Big Tech Over Data Privacy Laws

A flurry of alerts from state attorneys general around the country soon followed. AGs from states including Alabama, Arizona, California, Kentucky, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Texas issued similar press releases that recommended customers ask the company to delete their genetic profile and destroy the saliva sample used to create it.
“We have robust state privacy laws that include data deletion rights, and I would encourage any Texan concerned about their data to exercise the right to have their data securely deleted,” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, said in an April statement.
The fear is that a new 23andMe owner could choose to use or share sensitive personal genetic data in ways the company’s current privacy policy doesn’t allow. There’s worry it could be used, for example, to inflate people’s life insurance premiums or expose them to employment discrimination.
And there aren’t many guardrails to prevent that from happening.
HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, doesn’t apply to companies like 23andMe. The landmark federal law protects patients’ sensitive health information when it’s handled by doctors, hospitals and health insurers. But direct-to-customer companies such as 23andMe or Ancestry aren’t considered health care providers, and their non-invasive saliva collection kit isn’t considered a medical test.
The main federal law that protects people from discrimination based on their genetic information is nearly 20 years old. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) was passed in 2008, long before the rise of at-home testing kits. It applies to employers and health insurers, but not to life insurance companies, mortgage lenders and other non-health entities. And it doesn’t explicitly protect epigenetic information, which is information about the way a person’s genes — and by extension, health — are affected by outside factors such as smoking, disease or stress.
What states are doing
In the past five years, at least 14 states have passed laws regulating direct-to-consumer genetic testing offered by companies like Ancestry and 23andMe. There’s variation, but generally the laws require companies to get customers’ express consent before using or sharing their data, and allow customers to request their genetic data be deleted and biological samples destroyed.
It’s a good start, but doesn’t go far enough, said Anya Prince, a University of Iowa law professor whose research focuses on health and genetic privacy.
Many of those state efforts were built around a model law developed by the Coalition for Genetic Data Protection, an industry group with two member companies: 23andMe and Ancestry.
DNA Databases Are Boon to Police But Menace to Privacy, Critics Say

As DNA testing kits exploded in popularity and attracted increased scrutiny from lawmakers, the coalition pushed to influence legislation and set industry standards. The privacy protections in the laws mirror what 23andMe and Ancestry were already doing with their own privacy policies, experts say.
“They do have some really sensible privacy protections,” said Prince. “It’s great that people can delete their genetic data, and it’s great that law enforcement needs a warrant to access it. But if a privacy advocate had written a model law, there would be the potential for more and broader protections.”
For example, she said, many of the state laws address privacy requirements just for direct-to-consumer DNA testing companies. If 23andMe’s data is bought by, say, a pharmaceutical company, those state laws no longer apply.
The coalition now appears to be inactive, its website defunct.
Since 2020, more than a dozen states have passed some version of a genetic information privacy law, including Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming, based on a Stateline analysis. This year, the Indiana legislature passed a bill that’s now headed to the governor’s desk. Bills have been introduced this year in other states, including West Virginia.
Prince said state laws rely too heavily on consumers to self-manage their data privacy. They’re expected to understand a company’s policy, when studies have shown the public often doesn’t read privacy notices nor fully understand how companies use their data. Further, many state laws don’t address how third parties, such as law enforcement, can access and use consumer genetic data.
It’s also not always clear how the laws will be enforced, or who’s responsible for oversight.
“In general, I think there’s a disconnect between how people think their privacy is protected and how it’s actually protected,” she said.
But a few states have enacted laws that are more robust. California, for example, has a genetic information privacy law, but also has a general data protection law, as well as a state version of the federal GINA law that extends genetic anti-discrimination protections into areas including housing, education and licensing.
Florida has beefed up its DNA privacy laws in recent years, making the using or selling of an individual’s DNA without informed consent a felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison and up to a $10,000 fine. Florida was also the first state to prohibit life, disability and long-term care insurance companies from using genetic information to determine coverage.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-02 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Insurance costs threaten CT foster care providers,Ginny Monk,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/02/insurance-costs-threaten-ct-foster-care-providers/,Nonprofits that run foster care programs in CT are facing rising insurance costs that they say could force them to end those programs.,"Connecticut nonprofits that run foster care programs for some of the state’s highest-need children are facing rising insurance costs that could force them to discontinue those programs, providers said.
In 2022, the federal government passed a law that removed the statute of limitations for lawsuits related to child sex abuse, meaning providers can face civil action decades after the abuse occurred. The law aims to provide justice to victims.
But foster care programs across the country say insurance companies are citing the law as a reason to end long-standing liability insurance contracts or drastically increase costs of those coverage plans.
“My agency is 100 years old,” said Chris Lacey, chief executive of the Waterford Country School. “I have the responsibility to make sure it lasts about another 100 years, and if foster care is too risky for insurance carriers to get into, maybe it’s too risky for me to get into.”
Lacey’s agency manages a therapeutic foster home program under a contract with the Connecticut Department of Children and Families. The school also has special education programming and runs a Specialized Trauma-Informed Treatment Assessment and Reunification, or STTAR, home which is meant to be a shelter and respite treatment program for children with severe behavioral issues.
Therapeutic foster homes have been used as a way to keep children out of more restrictive settings such as inpatient psychiatric care. Foster parents in these settings are trained to support children with serious mental health conditions. Between 400 and 600 children in Connecticut are in therapeutic foster care.
The Waterford Country School has gotten its liability insurance through the same company for years. They’ve never had a claim on the policy, but the insurance company told them a few weeks ago that they were no longer covering foster care programs.
Eric Goldberg, an attorney with the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, said insurers are seeing more courts and juries finding providers liable in lawsuits and plaintiff attorneys making requests for a quick decision.
The requests often mean that the plaintiffs’ attorneys are asking for a final decision on a case before the insurance company has had time to investigate, Goldberg said. There are also more awards offered than in past years for pain and suffering, he said.
“Carriers, in an abundance of caution, often are settling cases that they may ordinarily have litigated, or at least sat down and had a conference with another party to be able to exchange the information that was needed,” Goldberg said.
Few insurance companies provide this type of insurance, so options are limited, Lacey said. His agency’s foster care contract is for about $1 million, he said, and it could be facing annual insurance payments that cost half of that contract.
New Britain-based Klingberg Family Centers has seen modest increases on its insurance premiums of 3-5% in recent years. This year, the costs increased by about eight-fold annually for less coverage. The nonprofit had a $10 million umbrella policy and had to drop that to about $2 million, chief executive Steven Girelli said.
The family centers have never had a claim, Girelli said.
“I don’t think we, or any of the foster care providers can absorb this dramatic increase in cost and increase in risk exposure indefinitely,” Girelli said. “It’s just, for us, it would be untenable.”
The Village for Families and Children’s insurance costs have increased from about $300,000 in 2021 to nearly $1 million annually this year, and they’re expecting more increases, chief executive officer Hector Glynn said.
Providers met with state officials from DCF and Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration last month to inform them of the issue.
Mary Quinn, a spokesperson for the state’s Insurance Department, said the agency is “actively engaged,” in discussions to address this issue and that Senate Bill 1322, which is under consideration by state lawmakers, would require the agency to study the insurance market issues for nonprofit providers.
“The Connecticut Insurance Department (CID) is aware of the challenges foster care providers are facing in securing affordable and adequate liability insurance and understands the urgency of this issue,” Quinn said in a written statement.
Providers said the foster care system, which is already strained, could break down further without the nonprofit programming.
Nonprofits across the country are being forced to close because they can’t get liability insurance, and in some states foster care providers can’t find any insurers who are willing to offer policies, according to a March report from the American Enterprise Institute.
Lawsuits and “bad public policy,” have driven insurance costs up, outpacing inflation, according to the report.
Lacey said there are a couple of steps the state or federal government can take to fix the problem, including establishing special liability protections for foster care providers. It could also establish a government-backed or captive insurer created only to insure foster care programs.
The American Enterprise Institute report also recommended establishing a compensation fund to provide one-time payments to victims.
The state is in the early phases of figuring out what to do.
Glynn said the state needs to find a solution, and soon. Nonprofits can endure the financial loss temporarily, but not forever, and smaller organizations may struggle in the immediate term, he said.
“It’s just getting to the point that the increases are unsustainable,” Glynn said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_20180201_114127.jpg,,,2025-05-02 06:03:36.549319

(Getty Images)When a child walks through our doors at Waypoint, we don’t just see a case file — we see a future. One that could be bright if that child has the necessary tools they need to grow up healthy, safe, and strong. One of the most powerful tools we have to make that future possible is Medicaid and its expansion through the Granite Advantage Program. 
Right now, that critical lifeline is at risk.
At Waypoint, we work every day with families facing poverty, trauma, and mental health challenges. We see firsthand how access to Medicaid transforms lives — not just for children, but for entire families. It’s no exaggeration to say that Medicaid is one of the most important investments we can make to ensure New Hampshire’s children grow up healthy, stable, and ready to succeed.
Medicaid’s impact starts before a child even takes their first breath. Last year, almost a quarter (22%) of births in New Hampshire were covered by Medicaid, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation report. That coverage means access to prenatal care that reduces complications and improves birth outcomes leading to healthier babies and mothers.
And the support doesn’t end there. Today, roughly 1 in 4 children in New Hampshire is enrolled in Medicaid, making children the largest group Medicaid serves. It covers doctor visits, dental and vision care, immunizations, mental health services, and critical care for children with complex needs or a history of trauma. For children in foster care, Medicaid is a guarantee — offering stability to those who need it most.
Yet the state budget bill now being considered by the New Hampshire Legislature proposes drastic changes to the Medicaid and other programs that are unnecessary, concerning and potentially damaging to the health of children and families. The House-approved budget includes a 3% rate cut to Medicaid providers along with reductions in funding for mental health, community health, and public health programs. It would even eliminate the Office of the Child Advocate, a critical partner to our staff who rely on that office for independent oversight in complex and high-risk cases involving child safety. 
Beyond the budget, a proposal to impose a work requirement for adults in the Granite Advantage Program would very likely cut off access to care for many current enrollees, because of the administrative burdens it will impose. And Medicaid cuts under consideration at the federal level could eliminate Granite Advantage entirely, forcing all 60,000 individuals on the program to lose their health insurance coverage.
And when parents lose coverage, children suffer. Research consistently shows that children are more likely to be insured and receive regular checkups and timely care when their parents have access to health insurance. 
Medicaid is also a shield against financial disaster. By covering essential services and reducing out-of-pocket costs, Medicaid helps families stay afloat. Without it, an unexpected illness can become a life-altering crisis. Families risk losing their homes. Parents can lose their jobs. And children — caught in the storm — lose their safety, support, and stability.
Medicaid and the Granite Advantage Program are also one of our most effective tools in addressing the growing mental health crisis. New Hampshire has some of the highest rates of childhood behavioral and mental health disorders in the country. Untreated mental health conditions in parents are linked to poor developmental outcomes for children. Medicaid helps break this cycle by ensuring access to mental health care for both parents and kids, supporting more resilient and healthier families.
The evidence is clear: traditional Medicaid and the Granite Advantage Program are a game-changer for New Hampshire’s children. We cannot afford to lose or limit the benefits Medicaid provides to our New Hampshire children and families. We should be strengthening the systems that help families weather life’s storms, not reducing them when they are most needed. 
In New Hampshire, we pride ourselves on being a place where families come first. We say we value our children. But values mean nothing without action — especially when the well-being of our kids is on the line. 
So, we must ask ourselves: What kind of New Hampshire do we want to be? A place where every child has a chance to thrive? Or one that turns its back on its most vulnerable?
Let’s choose the healthier path forward. Let’s invest in New Hampshire’s children by supporting Medicaid and the Granite Advantage Program.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/medicaidumbrella-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-02 05:02:12.862054

Just two months ago, the president’s approval rating was six points higher than disapproval. Now he’s under water.
Although job approval is a different question than who to back in an election, it’s a notable deficit for someone who won the state by 11 points last November.

“Consistent with many national polls, we find that Trump has lost considerable support over his first 100 days, suggesting his honeymoon was short-lived,” Bowling Green State University political scientist Robert Alexander said. “Having a net negative favorability rating in a state he won by 11 points should be of concern for Trump nationwide.”
Alexander also said if the numbers continue to slide, “we can expect the hopes of Democrats in Ohio to increase as they look to the 2026 election.”
The data comes from a poll conducted by BGSU’s Democracy and Public Policy Network. Pollsters contacted 800 registered voters from April 18-24 and the poll has a margin of error of +/- 4 percentage points. The bulk of their contacts were people they previously polled in February; 235 respondents had not been contacted before.
Voter’s impression of the first 100 days
The April survey shows Trump’s base of supporters remains intact, while independents and Democrats are disenchanted with his performance.
On a handful of broad qualitative question regarding respect for the country abroad, anxiety levels of respondent and whether Trump’s performance has compared to expectations, the negative responses led, but fell short of a majority.
BGSU political scientist Melissa Miller said, despite Republicans’ 2024 double-digit victory in Ohio, “Trump administration policies appear to be a mixed bag in the Buckeye State.”
A majority of respondents supported federal recognition of only two sexes, and declaring an emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border. But most respondents opposed renaming the Gulf of Mexico, withdrawing from the World Health Organization and pardoning Jan. 6 defendants.
Tariff policy, however, was a glaring exception. A majority opposed Trump’s 25% tariff on Canada and Mexico, but offered support for a 10% tariff on China. As of April 9, the import duties on most Chinese goods sit at 145%. According to the White House some goods will face a 245% tariff.
By a 2-to-1 margin, the poll’s respondents said tariffs will hurt them personally, and 49% said the policy will hurt the United States. Just 38% said tariffs will be beneficial for the country. Respondents were also dubious about who stands to gain from the policy. Sixty percent said the benefits will flow to the wealthy and large corporations. Meanwhile, majorities agreed that tariffs will harm small businesses, labor unions, the middle class, the working class, and the car industry.
“No matter how you look at it,” Alexander said, “Ohio voters do not like what they are seeing with Trump’s tariff policies.”
Peeking ahead to 2026
Pollsters asked about the upcoming governor’s race, as well. Among Republican candidates, entrepreneur and former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy leads the field by a vast margin. Lt. Gov. Jim Tressel and Attorney General Dave Yost garnered 14% and 13% support respectively, while Ramaswamy has the backing of 64% of GOP voters.
All three Republican candidates have an edge over the only declared Democratic candidate, former Ohio Department of Health director Amy Acton. The poll suggests Acton, a first-time candidate, has work to do consolidating Democratic support. Given the choice, 59% of respondents said they’d prefer former U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown as the nominee to Acton’s 20%. Former U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan got 16% of the total.
Miller argued there are warning signs in their figures about distrust in the federal government. Among Republicans, that figure ticked upwards slightly, but within the margin of error. For Democrats and independents the increase was larger.
“While rising distrust in the federal government among Ohio Democrats is not particularly surprising,” Miller argued, “the 8-point increase in distrust among independents between February and April could have real consequences. Independents tend to be the holy grail in U.S. elections.”

(Photo by Marty Schladen, Ohio Capital Journal.)The Ohio Retirement Study Council leaders are evaluating whether or not to remove the voting rights of teachers on their retirement pension fund board.
This comes after a year of controversy in which elected educators are accused of participating in a $65 billion corruption scheme. The board chair denies all allegations, and some retired educators are accusing the Statehouse Republicans of trying to stop transparency.
“It’s not a radical idea to think about how other teacher retirement boards are comprised,” state Rep. Adam Bird (R-New Richmond) said.
Bird, the chair of the Ohio Retirement Study Council, is considering all options when it comes to changing the makeup of the State Teachers Retirement System board.
But for him, the timing of the change isn’t due to the recent spending of $2 billion to restore a 1.5% cost-of-living adjustment.
“I’m concerned that the STRS current composition of seven teachers and four appointed investment experts appears to be imbalanced, which can lead to a perception of lack of fiduciary responsibility,” Bird said.
For the past year, controversy has been swirling inside the State Teachers Retirement System (STRS), a roughly $100 billion pension fund for the more than 500,000 active and retired public educators in Ohio.
In summary, there has been constant fighting, two board resignations, and allegations of both a public corruption scheme and mishandling of funds. There has been a senior staff dismissal and at least two senior staff resignations.
The scandal centers around former board member Wade Steen, board chair Rudy Fichtenbaum, and their relationship with investment firm QED Technologies, run by former Ohio Deputy Treasurer Seth Metcalf and Jonathan (JD) Tremmel.
How we got here
In May 2024, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine received a 14-page anonymous whistleblower memo, alleging a massive public corruption scheme brewing and moving quickly within STRS. In 2020, Metcalf and Tremmel set their eyes on STRS, according to the document.
The document claims that QED — despite having no clients and no track record — tried to convince STRS members to partner with them.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThey couldn’t impress the board members, mainly because of their lack of experience and because QED was not registered as a broker-dealer or investment adviser. The men also didn’t own the technology to “facilitate the strategy,” the documents said.
So what exactly are Steen and Fichtenbaum trying to change, and what would QED allegedly attempt to do? Revise the investment structure.
The men are seen as the leaders of the “reform movement.” This fight began from a debate on how STRS should invest money; through the current system of actively managed funds versus an index fund. Active funds try to outperform the stock market, have more advisors, and typically cost more. Index funds perform with the stock market, are seen as more passive, and typically cost less.
In short, “reformers” want to switch to index funding, while “status quo” individuals want to keep actively managing the funds. Recent elections have allowed the “reform-minded” members to have a majority of the board.
Steen and Fichtenbaum had allegedly been bidding continuously, pitching QED’s direct documents to board members and proclaiming the company’s talking points to other staff.
Attorney General Dave Yost later filed a lawsuit to remove Steen and Fichtenbaum from the board, stating they were participating in a contract-steering “scheme” that could directly benefit them. Yost started the investigation after the memo – now known to have been prepared by STRS employees – alleged that Steen and Fichtenbaum had been doing the bidding of QED.
Reporting by WEWS/OCJ has included the first time Yost and QED spoke about it, and continued with dozens of reports on the topic. A September investigation revealed that STRS was, once again, moving to hire a firm that allegedly lacked experience and personal ties to the board leaders, according to senior staff. After the reporting, the board chose not to move forward with the firm that has been the subject of the news investigations.
Restructuring
Bird’s move is the first step in changing state law. Other Republican leaders are arguing that, due to the scandal, the elected teachers on the board should be removed or they should be non-voting members.
“There’s been an attempt to circumvent the long-standing evaluation process that STRS has for evaluating investment strategies,” the study council chair continued.
Retired teacher Robin Rayfield is appalled by the idea of removing the elected members from the board.
“We’re not in favor of them changing the board, except if they were eliminating appointed positions,” Rayfield said. “As retired educators, we believe in democracy.”
The educator runs the Ohio Retirement for Teachers Association, ORTA, an organization currently under investigation along with Rayfield.
Due to his close relationships with both Steen, Fichtenbaum and QED, Rayfield’s conversations have been subpoenaed by the attorney general. He was also reported to the Ohio Ethics Commission due to his financial donations to board members. He put together a fund in 2023 to pay Steen’s legal fees, with additional funds being added to help both Steen and Fichtenbaum’s litigation against Yost. ORTA has donated more than $163,000, according to financial forms.
The STRS memo claims QED and ORTA had worked together, specifically when it came to elections, to get a more sympathetic — or willing — board.
Rayfield said that the investigation is a sham and a way for the state to stop transparency.
“It’s clear that the folks in Ohio in power — they want more power,” Rayfield said. “They don’t want people having the opportunity to represent themselves.”
He said it isn’t fair to use the argument that they don’t trust the board to follow their fiduciary duty due to the board’s alleged continued interest in QED.
“That’s a straw man,” Rayfield said. “The QED thing has been dead since ’21.”
The STRS chair was asked in August whether he was still considering QED.
“I don’t know at this point,” Fichtenbaum responded. “I think that the idea that they had about earning fees is not a bad idea.”
Also, Rayfield allegedly called interim STRS Executive Director Aaron Hood in April to discuss QED, according to a public records request.
In an email to the board, Hood wrote:
“Yesterday afternoon I received a telephone call from Robin Rayfield at ORTA. Robin offered to set up a meeting for me with representatives of QED (including Seth Metcalf) since there is so much “controversy.” I was so taken aback that I stepped out of my office and asked him to acknowledge his request again on speakerphone so that other staff could hear his confirmation of the request. I informed him that I will not meet with anyone related to QED and encouraged him to read the AG’s filings (including exhibits) involving communications from QED to a former board member. To be clear, no STRS staff will be meeting with representatives of QED and I would advise you all as board members to avoid any such meetings as well, especially in light of the pending outside litigation.”
Despite all of this, Rayfield and the “reformers” argue that there is nothing wrong with questioning the status quo — and that this is clearly a targeted attack at public education.
“It’s more political talk; When they’ve spent a billion dollars on private education and ignored public education, reduced the budget for public education, attacked our pension — all of the forces of everything — the governor, the attorney general, all of the high ranking elected officials, it has been to diminish what our public service has been through — decades of neglect and abuse,” Rayfield said.
The Ohio House Republicans passed a budget that dramatically slashed school funding. To be fully funded based on statistics from the Fair School Funding Plan from 2021, schools would need $666 million. The proposed budget only gives them about $226 million.
Based on 2025 numbers and inflation, the amount of money to fund K-12 would be closer to $800 million, new data from public school advocates like former lawmaker John Patterson found.
Retired educator Mary Binegar, who doesn’t trust the “reform” faction of the board, still says that removing the teachers’ voices is a bad move.


“Whether we like the board members (that) are there or not, we do have the opportunity to vote for them,” Binegar. “I think it’s important for educators to have that sense that there are other educators watching out for them.”

When Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman, R-Lima, was asked about his interest in pension reform, he said he aims to pass some changes to the pension board by the end of June.
“I wanna see what those recommendations are going to be,” Huffman said. “The problem, conceptually, with pensions… it’s trying to solve a problem now that looms many years in the future, it’s difficult for people to understand.”
Senate President Rob McColley, R-Napoleon, shared similar sentiments when I asked him about pension reform. He said he has had a few conversations with the Retirement Study Council leaders.
“I do think it’s worth reminding folks, whenever you’re on a pension board, you are acting with fiduciary duties to the pensioners in that pension system,” McColley said. “It’s important that they remember that the decisions they make shouldn’t just be based on a particular policy that they want to move forward or a particular message that they want to send, but rather it should be based on getting the best return at the appropriate profile for that pension system.”
House Minority Leader Allison Russo slammed the Republicans when asked for her thoughts.
“You’ve got a pension system that represents retired workers, but you don’t want to have workers represented on the board? I think (that) speaks to, again, lack of accountability in how individual retirement systems are run, the long-term stability of them.” Russo said. “And if you don’t want voices of those retired workers — I think that’s wrong and that’s hugely problematic.”
No matter the scandal, and no matter the side, each educator who spoke on the matter said that removing their perspective from the board will hurt the fund and cause teachers to feel isolated and unheard.

The national championship-winning Ohio State University football team played Michigan State University last season.
But it was a game you could only watch on Peacock, NBC’s streaming service — something that OSU fan and state Sen. Bill DeMora, D-Columbus, was angry about.
“I don’t have streaming services because, again, I can’t afford to spend all that on the streaming service,” he said. “The fact that I wasn’t able to watch an Ohio State game about killed me.”
In recent years, streaming services have been getting exclusive contracts to broadcast college athletics. If you don’t pay for the services, you don’t get to watch.
DeMora said this adds up, since the Big 10 has a deal with Peacock and the Middle Atlantic Conference (MAC) has one with ESPN subsidiaries ESPN+ and ESPNU.
This could be especially difficult for people who can’t access or don’t have high-speed internet, he said.
“They can’t watch streaming TV even if they wanted to pay the extra money for it,” he continued.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXSince DeMora is not only a fan, but also a state senator, he introduced Senate Bill 94, which would prohibit public universities from giving exclusive broadcasting rights to a streaming service.
“The streams were lagging, pixelated, out of sync and plagued by poor audio quality,” DeMora said during recent testimony on the bill. “People were paying for something that was horrible quality to start.”
WEWS/OCJ reached out to both the BIG 10 and MAC conferences, the different streaming services and their owners — as well as OSU, Kent State and the University of Akron.
Akron said they didn’t have a comment yet, and Kent declined to comment. But Ohio State did chime in.
“Media rights agreements are negotiated by the Big Ten on behalf of all conference members, and broadcast rights for specific athletic events are controlled by the designated media partner in accordance with the larger media rights agreement,” OSU spokesperson Ben Johnson said.
State Rep. Josh Williams (R-Sylvania) said this was a “kind of stupid” bill.
“Imagine the Buckeyes not being part of the Big 10 anymore because a simple piece of legislation said you can’t sign up to a streaming deal,” Williams said. “I think it’s ill-advised, ill-conceived and it won’t get any support.”
This bill could hurt the schools, he added.
“You’re going to stop universities from a revenue stream that they can generate off of their athletic programs that they use to reinvest into their athletic facilities,” the Republican said.
The legislation would also allow students to watch broadcasts for free. The legislation would require state universities to provide enrolled students access, but it is up to the school’s discretion how that is implemented.
Johnson explained that Peacock does give a student discount. Right now, the premium subscription for students is $2.99 per month for a year, down from $7.99. Once a year passes, students will have to pay $7.99 per month.
“Having to pay extra to watch their teammates and classmates’ sporting events isn’t fair to them,” DeMora argued.
Williams disagreed with this argument and the Democrat’s frustration with the cost in general.
“That’s like saying someone can’t afford the purchase of a television, so therefore games shouldn’t be televised,” Williams said.
The general public is with him on what he calls the streaming epidemic, DeMora said.
“It’s not fair to the everyday fan,” he said.
The bill will be subject to more hearings in the coming weeks.
Both DeMora and Williams have proposed football-related legislation. The Democrat proposed a bill that would prevent state money from going towards professional sports teams that have losing records. Williams, in the last General Assembly, introduced a bill that would make planting a flag in the center of the Ohio Stadium football field illegal. He proposed this after a brawl broke out when University of Michigan players tried to plant a flagpole after they beat OSU.

Using a few hundred words (and a handful of emojis), Sheriff Eric Kirsch invited teens to call law enforcement if they need a sober driver: “SO….in WABAUNSEE COUNTY KANSAS if you’re drunk as hell & under 21 & need to get home safe, you can call us & we’ll get you home safe.”
For the “young adults” who accepted the offer, he promised not to cite them with a minor in possession of alcohol.
The post is a masterpiece of social media, attracting more than 1 million views in the first few hours. Kirsch hopes teens think, “Wait a minute guys, let’s call the Sheriff’s Office” after a night of Jägerbombs and Bongzillas. In the process, the message charmingly zigzags all over the place.
Kirsch morbidly opens with the military and law enforcement resumes of the department’s officers, complete with all caps at all the wrong moments, by listing “HORRIFIC crimes like homicides,” “a serial killer” and “decades in and out of combat zones.” One jarring sentence lists, “child molestation & online child crimes investigations, busted up PEDOPHILE NETWORKS & other sinister human trafficking syndicates.”
The perfect words to convince a tipsy teenager to stagger into a police cruiser? Nope.
After that wobbly start, Kirsch gets down to business by offering teenagers a ride home “if you’re drunk as hell.” I think most college-town Uber drivers would tell you the clean-up risk of wasted first-time drinkers. Teenagers often volunteer the alcohol they just drank right back to the world. Puke clean up is a startling new job responsibility that the sheriff is possibly assigning his deputies. Here’s hoping Wabaunsee County has invested in rubber floor mats.
This is a good moment to inspect the photo that accompanied the words. The top of the image has the badge of the department against the black Kansas sky. At the center, a law enforcement officer smiles — a flashlight, handgun and body camera strapped to his vest. His thumbs-up gesture is mimicked, with varying levels of enthusiasm, by a few of the teens who flank him. Their faces appear to be lit by the strobing lights of a sheriff’s cruiser.
The teenagers are perfectly Midwest. Their hoodies advertise Coors beer and the Bank of the Flint Hills, brands that likely don’t appreciate these product placements alongside teen drinking, thank you very much. The boys mostly wear baseball caps, while one girl stands uneasily near the middle, nervously hinging her OnCloud sneaker in the gravel.
At the center of the photo is the contraband: plastic bags from WalMart and Dollar General, filled with empty cans of Mike’s Hard Lemonade and other alcohol. The sheriff reveals that they had also been drinking beers and Boone’s Farm Wine, the archetypal teen garbage swill. He writes: “HORRIBLE BOONES FARM WINE (that’s basically engine degreaser dudes, you should be ashamed of yourselves )”. It’s a standard and cringey aside that signals: “You can trust me! I’ve been a young drinker before.”
(Only slightly more likely to appeal to 2025 teens? The sheriff’s office replied to its own post with a song from 2007, when many of them had yet to be born.)
If these words aren’t convincing teens, Kirsch next tries compassion, and it’s a heavy, heartfelt dose: “I’m tired of carrying people off the roadway in the aftermath of entirely avoidable tragedy.” There’s a bit of patriotism swirled in as Kirsch calls teens “the future leaders of this Great Nation & we NEED AND WANT you ALL to succeed.”
For anyone who has coached, taught or mentored young people, this post presents a familiar conundrum: In order to keep teenagers safe, we need them to trust us adults.
Does that trust come through showing them expertise by listing law enforcement accomplishments?
Does that trust come through showing them compassion by reminding them, as Kirsch write, that, “We’re here for you dudes, even if you’re not quite there for yourself yet ”?
Does that trust come through the legal forgiveness of a sheriff overlooking the misdemeanor crime of a drunk teenager?
Kirsch admits that there is no perfect formula to eliminate teen drinking. He writes: “People are going to party, prohibition doesn’t work yet providing options does. We provide this option so all lives on the road may benefit.”
Of course, prohibition of alcohol — whether for teens or an entire country — doesn’t work. But that distracts from how these free rides gently sanction teen drinking. The sober rides are a slight but very public enabling.
However, Kirsch’s stated goal is to create safe roadways that are free of drunk teenage drivers. If that is his mission, this impromptu policy announced on social media works as a step in that direction. The subtle permission for teen drinkers simply might be a necessary cost.
When I was a high school teacher, my student journalists interviewed a child psychologist about teen drinking. They asked, “If parents drink with their teenagers in controlled ways during high school, is that a good way to minimize alcohol abuse later in life?” The psychologist was flummoxed by the question. No, she said, drinking early in life is a leading indicator of later alcohol abuse, so any implicit approval for it is consequential, especially during teenage years.
The comment section on Facebook voices this exact worry: “Thanks for encouraging underage drinking…. No more Ubers the wabunsee (sic) sheriff’s office will do it free of charge and listen to your drunken dreams and goals yay good job guys ”
Is the sheriff smartly trading tipsy teen drivers for teens who feel liberated to be “drunk as hell”?
Another anecdote from my high school teaching days provides my personal answer. Each October I supervised the fall dance with about 700 students celebrating in the school gymnasium.
A few hours into the dance, students literally leaned against the doors, eager to start partying in basements with their own bottles of Boone’s Farm. After I released the students and after the chaperones left, I sat in the bleachers of the gymnasium surrounded by drooping streamers and deflated balloons. The DJ packed his speakers into the back of his van. Through the open doors, traffic whirred past.
That’s when I would hear the sirens.
I bowed my head. I hoped the police car wasn’t responding to the accident of a drunk student driver. I sometimes prayed in those moments to keep all of those young people safe.
The ones I worried about the most had driven themselves to the dance, packing into sedans with corsages on their wrists and beers in their bellies. “Please keep them safe,” I thought.
The ones I worried about less? Students who wobbled onto party buses with drivers to deliver them home. Or students who arranged rides with parents. If they insisted on drinking, at least they would be safe.
So, I hear you, Sheriff Kirsch. In the realm of teen drinking, there is no silver bullet (Well, maybe one). There is only ambiguity and a hope for safety.

A U.S. Census Bureau survey found almost 592,000 new apartments were finished last year, the most since the […]","Apartments and stores under construction in Rapid City, S.D., in 2023. New apartments reached almost 592,000 nationally last year, the highest number since 1974, with South Dakota and the Rapid City area approving new apartments at particularly high rates. (Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)More new apartments were built in 2024 than in any other year since 1974, but the Trump administration’s tariffs and deportations of potential construction workers, plus higher interest rates, could be a wet blanket on the boom.
A U.S. Census Bureau survey found almost 592,000 new apartments were finished last year, the most since the 1970s, when baby boomers sparked a construction surge as they moved out of their childhood homes. There were 693,000 new apartments built in 1974, when the country had about half as many households.
But there has been a steep slowdown in construction starts, as the newly completed apartments come online. The increased supply has lowered rents and increased vacancy rates, making new development less profitable. Some experts also say tariffs on construction materials and labor shortages caused by dips in immigration will create headwinds for new construction.
Apartment starts were down 27% in 2024 compared with 2023, and down 37% from a recent peak of 531,000 in 2022, despite the historic rate of completions. Apartment starts were at their lowest ebb since 2013.
Housing experts have long lamented that there aren’t enough apartments and single-family houses in the U.S. — at least not in places where people want to live and at prices they can afford. Estimates of the national housing shortage last year varied widely, from 1.5 million houses and apartments to 20.1 million; since then, another 1.6 million houses and apartments have been built. Most experts estimate a shortage of 1.5 million to 5.5 million, according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University.
Some states are building apartments faster than others, according to a Stateline analysis. Though completions aren’t tracked by state, permits that lead to new apartments have been granted at high rates in recent years in South Dakota, Utah, Arizona and Colorado. Rates are lowest in Mississippi, Wyoming, West Virginia, Rhode Island, Oklahoma and Alaska.
The massive jump in apartment construction has its roots in 2021 and 2022, when interest rates were low and rent growth was high, said Rob Warnock, senior research associate for Apartment List, a company that posts rental listings online.
“Those new apartments came online in 2023 and 2024, and while those deliveries are slowing down today, there are still many apartments in the pipeline,” said Warnock, who added that “supply and demand are coming back into balance.”
In response to greater supply, rents have fallen by about $50 per month (3.5%) from their 2022 peak, according to a report released this week by Apartment List. Apartment vacancy is at a 15-year high of 6.3%, keeping a lid on rents, but that could turn around as construction slows, according to an April report by Moody’s, a financial services company.
Apartment building has been a bipartisan priority as single-family home prices soar further out of the affordability range for young families. In South Dakota, the Republican-controlled legislature worked to prolong the building boom with grants and loans under the state’s Housing Infrastructure Financing Program. The program put $200 million of state and federal funding toward defraying the costs of development in new neighborhoods, such as roads, sewer lines and streetlights.
Republican state Sen. Casey Crabtree, sponsor of the proposal signed into law in 2023, told Stateline it was needed to address a housing shortage, especially in rural parts of the state.
“We have a drastic shortage of workers,” Crabtree said before a vote in 2023. “South Dakota businesses need more workers in our state. To get more workers, we need more housing.”
Armand Domalewski, co-founder of YIMBY Democrats for America, said overregulation is a barrier to housing construction in many areas that his party controls.
“A lot of blue-government areas and cities have extremely restrictive zoning, impact fees and other rules that make it very difficult to build housing,” said Domalewski. Another barrier is local opposition, he said.
“If it was just a free market, developers would want to build in the places like California, where prices are the highest and rents are the highest, because they’d make more money,” he added.
In California, the 2021 HOME Act was meant to spur more affordable housing and ease labor shortages, but it’s faced local opposition in some areas. At the end of last year, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed several measures that aim to streamline regulations and crack down on local resistance to the 2021 law.
South Dakota approved nearly 6,000 permits for apartment units in 2023 and 2024, which when completed would add about 1.4% to its 2023 total of 417,000 housing units. That’s the highest rate in the nation. By contrast, Mississippi during that same period approved about 660 apartment units — a fraction of 1 percentage point to its 2023 base of about 1.4 million housing units.













A lot of blue-government areas and cities have extremely restrictive zoning, impact fees and other rules that make it very difficult to build housing.


– Armand Domalewski, co-founder of YIMBY Democrats for America





Chas Olson, executive director of the South Dakota Housing Development Authority, said the full impact of the state infrastructure funding isn’t apparent yet, as many developments that received the help are still under construction.
Completions are still strong this year with about 39,000 apartments finished in March, not much different from the 41,500 in March 2024, which was the biggest March number since 1985.
Another impediment to apartment construction has been high interest rates, which make it harder to borrow money to build, said Danushka Nanayakkara-Skillington, an assistant vice president for forecasting and analysis at the National Association of Home Builders.
She expects apartment building starts to slow until later this year.
“We are going to be short of workers for a long time. That’s the way it is. And of course tariffs are going to have an impact,” Nanayakkara-Skillington said.

(Stock photo by Lourdes Balduque/Getty Images)As the recipient of Nebraska’s largest Early Head Start-Child Care Partnership grant, we’ve made a promise: to show up with care, consistency and compassion, especially when families face the toughest of times. Our work with CRCC, CSI, Educare Lincoln and Educare of Omaha, Inc., brings more than 200 combined years of experience in serving Nebraska’s children and their families.
The federally funded Head Start program is part of that promise, one that has received bipartisan support year after year. But in recent weeks, news broke about a federal budget proposal that would zero out funding for Head Start in 2026. It is impossible to state the impact this move would have on nearly 800,000 children and their families nationwide. 
Congress has the power to decide what gets funded and what doesn’t. That’s where we need to act.
Nebraska impact
In Nebraska, Head Start funding supports the capacity for 5,653 eligible children, employing 2,187 staff in 179 child care centers across the state. These are not just numbers. These are real Nebraska children and families with real futures. And now, the funding to support them is at real risk. 
For 60 years, this nationally recognized, locally rooted program has given our most vulnerable children a safe, developmentally rich environment to learn and grow while their parents work to achieve economic self-sufficiency. The National Head Start Association’s 2025 Nebraska Head Start Profile shows that 4,137 parents of enrolled children were employed, in school or in job training, which would not be possible without reliable child care through Head Start.
Protecting Head Start is essential to the well-being of children, families, and communities. Any move away from this risks consequences we can’t afford. We don’t use these words lightly.
Head Start is a vital foundation for families working to build a better future. It offers reliable support for parents and strong, nurturing early education for children — along with meals, vision and hearing screenings, developmental assessments, and dental care. 
Stability for children and families
Protecting Head Start means preserving stability, opportunity and access to care for at-risk children and over a million parents who rely on it to stay in the workforce. Communities nationwide depend on it as a cornerstone of their child and family support systems.
Head Start works. Not because it’s easy — but because it’s essential. It’s a federal program with decades of data, bipartisan support and consistent, community-driven results. It combines local donations with state and federal funds to provide exactly what Nebraska families need: dependable, comprehensive quality child care. 
Given Head Start’s proven return and essential impact, the conversations in Congress and in our communities should be about increasing funding, not eliminating it. The return on investment is clear.
Nobel Laureate economist James Heckman found that every dollar invested in quality early childhood programs like Head Start returns more than seven dollars in reduced crime, improved health and increased earnings. Supporting Head Start is not just a moral imperative. It’s a smart economic one. 
Investments in future 
How much does the country invest? Head Start funding accounts for 0.18% of the FY2024 federal budget.
Head Start funding strengthens our work as long-standing early childhood partners in Nebraska. We know these families. We work alongside them. We see the deep commitment to their children and their dreams for their families’ futures, many of which would not be possible without help from Head Start.
As a state that values hard work, personal responsibility and community, Nebraskans should encourage congressional support for this invaluable program. When we talk about Nebraska family values, we do not abandon our youngest citizens when they need us most.
We call on our elected officials, neighbors, friends and fellow Nebraskans — from Lincoln to Scottsbluff, Omaha to Ogallala — to speak up. Let your voice be heard. Speak up. Share this message. Remind Washington that Nebraska protects its children. 
Let’s ensure that, as Head Start celebrates 60 years of impact this May, the gift we give back is unwavering support. Because when we invest in children, we invest in us all.

Gavin Newsom contrasted federal efficiency cuts with his use of AI to improve state government. But California's record of using technology has been poor.,"Gov. Gavin Newsom staged a news conference in Los Angeles this week to tout the adoption of artificial intelligence to improve the efficiency of state government.
That’s pretty dull stuff, so Newsom goosed its news value by contrasting California’s AI program with President Donald Trump’s slashes of federal services via his Department of Government Efficiency, headed by Newsom’s erstwhile pal, industrialist and inventor Elon Musk.
“I could have easily come in here with sunglasses and chainsaws — you know where I’m going — and gotten your attention,” Newsom told reporters. “We’re DOGE but better.” 
He took another potshot at Trump and Musk, saying, “They haven’t come close to the savings they’ve asserted. I think it’s been very damaging.”
Newsom’s remarks on Trump, Musk and DOGE represent his latest political repositioning, from a harsh critic after Trump recaptured the White House, to making nice with Trump as the state sought $40 billion in wildfire recovery grants, to entertaining prominent pro-Trump figures on his new podcast, and now to reclaiming the role of resistor-in-chief after taking heat from other Democrats for cozying up to Trump.
Newsom contrasting DOGE with California’s AI is not just a metaphoric stretch. Whether the latter will lead to an existential improvement in state government efficiency is open to question.
“GenAI is here,” Newsom said about generative AI, “and it’s growing in importance every day. We know that state government can be more efficient, and as the birthplace of tech it is only natural that California leads in this space. In the Golden State, we know that efficiency means more than cutting services to save a buck, but instead building and refining our state government to better serve all Californians.”
The state’s initial employment of the new technology will help improve highway congestion, traffic safety and services in the Department of Tax and Fee Administration, he said.
Will it?
The state’s sorry record of  implementing information technology prior to the emergence of AI as a tool warrants skepticism. 
Although Newsom wrote “Citizenville,” a book touting technology as a transformative factor in government, state tech projects have not fared well during his governorship, essentially continuing a record of failures and setbacks than began many years ago.
There’s another aspect of Newsom’s new embrace of AI that’s also troubling because of the state’s spotty record on tech — a change in the way the state implements AI projects that could make it more difficult for legislators and the public to know whether they are working as promised.
Coincidentally or not, as Newsom was touting AI in Los Angeles, the Legislature’s budget analyst was issuing a report that raises red flags.

Commentary 
California’s list of failed tech projects just added an agency 

by Dan Walters 





The topic is wonkish to the max, but basically the state is changing the way it approves certain types of technology projects. 
It has been using a contracting and implementation process aimed at providing a whole picture of technology projects as funds are sought from the Legislature, but Newsom’s new process would do the projects in phases, and “Some information currently available … such as a project’s total baseline cost, schedule, and scope might not be as readily available (in the new system) while other information might be made confidential sooner during project planning,” the Legislative Analyst’s Office is telling the Legislature.
Implicitly the LAO report is warning the Legislature that a project’s shortcomings might not be known until it is too late to stop its adoption. “Therefore, to help the Legislature evaluate and understand the new process over a more reasonable time frame, we recommend the Legislature require reporting on completed project planning activities, and limit the new process to a small subset of projects (with additional reporting) over the next fiscal year.”
Complex though it may be, the change in implementation could result in even worse tech disasters than keeping the current process.

Jill Nolin/Georgia RecorderShelby Hutton was a biologist studying sexually transmitted diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who was planning to expand her gonorrhea research by starting doctoral studies in the fall.
But in early April, Hutton found herself suddenly unemployed and applying for a job at Starbucks.
As a scientist, Hutton said she had not expected to find herself among the legions of federal workers abruptly fired as part of the Trump administration’s plan to shrink the federal government through mass firings. 
U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced plans to slash 10,000 job in late March, including 2,400 jobs at the CDC. 
“Hundreds of good scientists and subject matter experts were among the cuts to federal employees,” Hutton said while standing outside the CDC in Atlanta. “This is the exact opposite of what RFK said would happen. I’ll be the first to say that there is a lot of improvement to be had in terms of government efficiency, but I really can’t picture a functional CDC without laboratorians.”
  Shelby Hutton, who is a scientist, poses for a photo outside the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention just days after she was swept up in the Trump administration’s sweeping reduction in force. Jill Nolin/Georgia Recorder
Hutton said she was in the middle of validating tests her team had developed for the molecular surveillance of gonorrhea that is resistant to antibiotics – work she said she doesn’t know of other labs doing – when she received the email dismissing her and her entire laboratory branch.
They didn’t have time to properly store specimens that Hutton described as “priceless.” 
To Hutton, it feels like the deep cuts at the CDC are part of a backlash to the COVID-19 pandemic and lingering anger among some over shutdowns and other safety measures taken to control the spread of the virus. 
“It absolutely feels like we’re the scapegoats. It feels like we’re being attacked,” Hutton said. “And I don’t think people realize how important the work that we do is and how much we care about the work we do in public health.” 
The Office of Personnel Management and the CDC did not respond to questions about the actual number of dismissals since February. 
Tuesday marked Trump’s 100th day in office, but the president has already seen his approval rating suffer in Georgia – a state he won last year after narrowly losing here in 2020.
Trump’s approval rating among Georgia voters is at 43%, according to a poll released Wednesday by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and conducted by the University of Georgia School of Public and International Affairs.
  A demonstrator holds a sign outside of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta during a rally in April. Jill Nolin/Georgia Recorder
Anger over the cuts to the CDC has shown up at town halls, protests, press conferences and rallies outside the center’s Atlanta campus. Navy blue signs saying “Save the CDC” and “Save Public Health” can be seen in Atlanta front yards. 
And signs of dissatisfaction with the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency’s efforts to reduce the size of the federal government are also reflected in the AJC’s poll.
A slight majority of the poll’s respondents – 51.5% – said they disapprove of those efforts to reduce the size of the government, many of them saying they strongly disapprove. Only 44% said they approved, with 4.5% unsure. The cuts were not popular with the independent voters polled, with about 55% of them frowning on the efforts.
But 74% of Republican voters surveyed said they enthusiastically back the cuts.
‘Everybody knows that you need CDC’
Sarah Boim, a former communication specialist at the CDC, says she is trying to remain hopeful that the wave of legal challenges in response to the cuts to the federal workforce will lead to her and many of her colleagues getting their jobs back. 
But Boim is also not waiting around to see if that happens.
She and other CDC workers who lost their jobs have formed a group called Fired But Fighting. What started out as a newsletter to disseminate accurate information to workers trying to figure out their next steps has quickly evolved into a broader effort to push back on the cuts through spirited advocacy. 
“We just need people to know how important it is to have public health managed at a federal level,” Boim said. “You cannot privatize public health. You need the money that a government has. You need the money of a country – we’re talking about B with billions – and you also need to be able to coordinate across the states. And you just can’t do that in a private company or an organization.”

Fired But Fighting made a splash at Sen. Jon Ossoff’s recent town hall in Marietta, where they pressed the senator to do more to push back on the Trump administration.
The Democrat responded by saying the future of the nation’s public health infrastructure ultimately hinges on whether the American people “see and understand that they’re being put at risk” – and vote accordingly. 
Republican state leaders have expressed at least tepid support for the cuts, though one said he was uneasy about the pace.
After the first round in February, Gov. Brian Kemp said “government can stand a little right-sizing.” Suwanee Republican U.S. Rep. Rich McCormick said he asked the White House to slow the pace of the firings after being caught in the crosshairs of an angry town hall, telling the Atlanta Journal-Constitution in February that “I think we’re just moving a little too fast.” Congressman Mike Collins, a Jackson Republican, told WABE in February that the fired workers could go find other work in Georgia. 
Boim, who was fired in February, said she is trying to find another job, broadening the search to even “health adjacent” roles. 
“I have applied to 127 jobs,” she said. “I keep a spreadsheet. I’ve had two canceled interviews, both because they’re worried about federal funding, and a lot of thanks, but no thanks, because the job market is just saturated with people like me.” 
She said she hopes the state’s Republican leaders will come around.
“I think they’re scared. If you’re not on Trump’s side, you’re against him, and I think that they’re scared of getting on his bad side,” Boim said. “I’m sorry, but people need to start being brave. I feel like CDC is a bipartisan issue. Everybody knows that you need CDC.” 
‘Not going quietly’
Jill Daugherty said she knew the CDC’s injury center she worked at was likely poised to lose staffers, but the extent of the cuts left her stunned. The injury center was gutted after last month’s round of cuts, with Daugherty’s traumatic brain injury team wiped out. She thinks the goal is to dismantle the CDC.
“We really didn’t know which teams were going to get cut, so we were just kind of waiting around the whole week before, like, ‘Is it gonna be us? Is it gonna be us?’ And then it was everybody,” Daugherty said.
That’s how Daugherty found herself on the other side of the CDC’s entrance on a recent Tuesday afternoon holding a sign that said, “Firing experts… Ignoring science… CDC deserves better.” She stood on the curb as the passing vehicles – including her former colleagues leaving work for the day – honked their horns at the group of demonstrators.

The Tuesday rallies, organized by retired CDC staffers, have become a ritual since the mass firings started. 
“You’re not just standing up for yourselves. You’re standing up for our country and the best that America represents,” U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock, a Democrat, told fired CDC workers during a visit to one of the rallies in April.
Even when facing the prospect of unemployment and an uncertain future, many of the fired CDC workers still focus on the loss to the programs they had dedicated their careers to advancing when they talk about the mass firings.
Aryn Backus was a health communication specialist at the CDC’s Office on Smoking and Health until Valentine’s Day, when hundreds of workers were swept up in the first round of dismissals. She said she remained hopeful that the firing would be reversed until her entire office was cut in April. 
“So, I knew that even if I were to get my termination rescinded, there would be no job to go back to,” said Backus, who is the mother of a 1-year-old.
But even then, when standing at a microphone in front of reporters recently, Backus wanted to talk about the work her office did to curb smoking rates – and all the work left to do.
“The impact of these CDC cuts will be felt in public health for years to come. They’re not going to help make America healthy but will decrease public health programs that help save lives,” said Backus, who is also part of Fired But Fighting.
“That’s why the CDC employees are not going quietly. We are fighting back to not only protect civil service, but to protect public health.”

(Laura Chramer for Alabama Reflector)President Donald Trump Thursday congratulated more than 200 graduates at a commencement ceremony at the University of Alabama for their academic accomplishments, and himself for his first 100 days in office for his second term.
In a meandering, hour-long address that drew a nearby protest, Trump called Alabama a “winner” and urged graduates to lead successful lives.
“Today, I am also asking you to look forward to, really, something very, very bright, more promising,” Trump said. “And it is going to be even more promising tomorrow, I promise you that. You are the first graduating class of the golden age of America.”
The president also praised himself for his controversial executive orders and rehashed his grievances with his critics and the Biden administration.
“In a matter of weeks, we achieved the lowest number of illegal border crossings ever recorded,” Trump said to the applause of the crowd. “We have seen hundreds of thousands of people pouring into our country from prisons, from mental institutions, gangs, and all over the world, not just in South America.”
According to Axios, the decline in border crossings began under the Biden administration and was due in part to actions taken by the government of Mexico. Experts also say that border crossings can fluctuate. Trump’s actions have also led to the wrongful arrest of several people with legal status, including Maryland resident Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia and three U.S. citizen children under the age of 10, including one with Stage 4 cancer.
Much of the evening’s speech focused on imparting words of wisdom for the graduates using a list of virtues they should incorporate into their lives.

“In America, with drive and ambition, young people can do anything,” Trump said. The president, who became president of a real estate company his father Fred built, spoke about how he developed a property in Manhattan when he was in his 20s. Trump then praised Steve Jobs and Walt Disney for their accomplishments founding companies.
“If you are going to do something, you might as well think big because it is just as tough,” he said. “I know a lot of people, they thought small, and they are very smart. I know others who were not very smart, but they thought about the big picture.”
Throughout the address, Trump would shift quickly from advice to graduates to monologues on social issues. He repeatedly raised transgender issues, returning multiple times to what he characterized as the problem of males who transitioned into females and playing on female sports teams.
He would end his speech by heaping praise on Alabama for more than five minutes.
“You continue the legacy of Alabama legends who blazed the trails, won the games, tilled the fields, forged the steels, built the ships, and gave us the victories that built the American and changed the world.”
He praised the car racing in Talladega and highlighted the rockets developed in the state.
“This is the state that gave us nothing but victory,” Trump said. “The state with some of the greatest heroes in history, like Willie Mays, Jesse Owens, Joe Louis, your coach Nick Saban.”

A protest of Trump’s appearance organized by the University of Alabama’s College Democrats drew over 100 people.
“We deserve somebody who works for the people, by the people. And right now we have someone who is working for billionaires, by billionaires,” said Kyla Chatmon, a junior political science and African American studies double major at The University of Alabama. “And I think that is just unjust. And so I came out today to show my support to all the graduates who are having to have their graduation overshadowed by an authoritarian, fascist, dictator.”
Mary Maxwell, who also attended the event, said she feels like the university might have been scared to say no to the sitting president.
“It is a red state and people are afraid of him,” she said. “They’re afraid he’ll cut their funding and he’ll try to control what’s being taught at the school. I taught at the university for 20 years and did research for 15 [years]. He’s against education. He’s against science. He’s against people knowing more than him.”
Former U.S. Sen. Doug Jones, D-Alabama and Beto O’Rourke, a former Texas congressman who ran for governor and U.S. Senator in Texas, spoke at the event.
“He wants us to feel hopeless. He wants us to feel like he has all the power. And let me tell you something. In this country, in this great democracy, in this government of, by and for the people, the real power is with us,” O’Rourke said during his speech.
O’Rourke encouraged protest attendees to keep fighting against the administration’s policies during his speech as well, invoking Bloody Tuesday, an attack on civil rights protestors by police and a white mob in Tuscaloosa in 1964, and Bloody Sunday, an attack on civil rights protestors crossing Selma’s Edmund Pettus Bridge in 1965.
“We can overcome these challenges, because we have overcome them before against much greater odds,” he said to the crowd.
Former Senator Doug Jones said during his speech that the gathering was “not a protest, this is a movement.”
“It is movements that changed this country,” he said. “Whether it was the Civil Rights Movement, whether it was the Anti-War movement, it is the movements. And guess what? It started on college campuses.”

Jones also encouraged protest participants to write to their U.S. Senators as a form of speaking up and out for what they want.
“Write your U.S. Senators, they’ll ignore it, but write them anyway! Because those things mean something. As someone who sat in the halls of the United States Senate, we tried to answer everything, even people that came in that opposed what we were doing,” Jones said.
Jones also encouraged attendees to get involved with civic engagement to fight for the change they would like to see.
“Go to your county commission, go to your city council offices. Get engaged, civic engagement at the local level is where we have to be, that’s the power. You have that power,” he said.

With nighttime temperatures frequently still in the 30s, impossibly long waiting lists for shelter beds, and already limited housing options which precluded us from accessing them because of our relationship status, health conditions and pets, we had a resounding question to ask. Where then shall we go?
Through the 2025 People’s Budget, Unhoused Activists Community Team members have called on the Elicker administration and local Board of Alders to fully fund the overnight warming and cooling centers throughout the year until a long term, humane and dignified solution can be adopted to ensure everyone who wants to can be sheltered in New Haven.
We are your neighbors, friends, and family. We serve your coffee, cook your food, care for your houses, repair your cars, and contribute to this city in a variety of ways, but affordability has excluded us from accessing traditional homes like you.
The mayor’s logic is filled with more potholes than the ones he’s left in the streets of New Haven. Even as he shutters the warming centers, if we set up tents and tarps in discrete locations to better protect ourselves and our few belongings, law enforcement officials are rapidly deployed to sweep and seize what little we have. Should we be harassed and criminalized simply because we are unsheltered?
Neighbors like you can help by ensuring civic solution systems like “See, Click, Fix” and Call211 are used to report downed stop signs and broken street lamps not our critical camp sites and temporarily unattended carts stationed next to park benches. Better yet, flood the mayor’s phone and email with demands for more publicly accessible storage and bathrooms! 
With these vital emergency resources cut off, hundreds of us have no where else to go. When warming centers are shut down, they don’t just turn off the heat—they turn away human beings and sentence us to uncertainty, instability, and peril.
While a President in Washington D.C. and a mayor in New Haven might endorse extrajudicial policies which attempt to disappear people they find personally and politically abhorrent, we believe the real residents of this city and state stand for more and pride ourselves on values of inclusion, community solidarity, mutuality, and economic justice.
Many of our state representatives agree and are fighting to pass legislation like House Bill 7033, an initiative Justin Elicker has testified against, which would decriminalize homelessness and necessary life-sustaining activities like seeking temporary refuge in an unobtrusive way on public lands.
Show your support and tell your politicians that you believe in humane policies, like HB 7033, which make our communities safer for all of our neighbors.
It’s time for community driven solutions to this collective housing crisis. We need to start by keeping the warming centers open year-round, constructing publicly available bathrooms in highly accessible areas, and decriminalizing our right to peacefully exist and seek refuge outside when no other options are available to us. Until that happens, we’re not solving homelessness—we’re just hiding it.
Just as the need for shelter doesn’t change with the temperature and the rain and wind don’t yield because the calendar says it’s spring, the struggle of being unhoused doesn’t stop just because the mayor and his budget say it should.
The time for common sense, compassion, and solidarity is not seasonal. It’s always, and it’s now. The emergency is tonight.

Ryan Fazio, Greenwich First Selectman Fred Camillo and Selectwoman Lauren Rabin. I asked if they were going to speak out against Trump’s destruction of our democracy, his lawlessness and his attacks on human dignity. None of the them responded. As far as I can tell, none of them have publicly denounced the president’s actions.

Jonathan Perloe
The German pastor and anti-Nazi dissident Dietrich Bonhoeffer said, “Not to speak is to speak. Not to act is to act.” He was sentenced to death and executed in a concentration camp for his resistance to Hitler’s fascist regime.
My Republican elected officials’ silence speaks volumes. As leaders in the President’s party, their voices have influence that Democrats simply can’t match, and not for want of trying. Given the stakes at hand, their silence makes them complicit in the unprecedented attacks on our constitutional democracy being carried out daily by President Trump and his administration.
 It makes them complicit in Trump’s incoherent trade war that is increasingly likely to lead to a global recession, cost American jobs and perhaps most alarmingly, undermine the U.S. dollar as the world’s most stable currency which will dramatically raise the cost of financing our nation’s debt.
They are complicit in seriously compromising our self-defense, saying nothing about the gross incompetence of Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and other senior national security officials who used an unsecure, commercial messaging platform to unknowingly share military strike plans with a journalist. Nor saying anything about substantially degrading the country’s cyberdefenses, including substantial portions of the systems that protect elections from cyberattacks and provide early warning of attacks on the power grid, communications and pipelines.
Fazio, Camillo and Rabin are complicit in wrongly deporting without notice, legal justification or due process, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a legal immigrant who posed no threat. They are complicit in creating a constitutional crisis now that the Trump administration has willfully ignored the Supreme Court’s ruling to return him from the notorious Salvadoran prison that a federal judge called one of the most “inhumane and dangerous prisons in the world,” exposing him to harm that “shocks the conscience.”
They are complicit in supporting a president who has said he has no problem deporting U.S. citizens, who has declared himself king and who incited an insurrection to keep himself in power despite losing the 2020 election.
They are complicit in Trump’s sweeping attack on voting that could disenfranchise millions of eligible voters, especially women, by requiring proof of citizenship to register to vote. Trump’s baseless claims about noncitizen voting reveal his true intentions to undermine free and fair elections that are the foundation of our representative democracy. Voting by noncitizens is virtually nonexistent and already illegal, with penalties including prison time and deportation. A study by the Brennan Center for Justice found only 30 suspected incidents of potential noncitizen voting out of 24 million votes cast in the 2016 presidential election.
Rather than actually encouraging the rigorous analysis needed to reduce government waste, with their silence these three Republican officials are complicit in Trump’s corrupt crony capitalism aimed at further enriching his billionaire friends. Trump delayed a Biden administration effort to close a loophole that has resulted in Medicare spending more than $10 billion annually on unproven “skin substitute” bandages, more than it spends on ambulance rides, anesthesia or CT scans. Trump received a large campaign contribution from one of the bandage sellers.
With their silence, Fazio, Camillo and Rabin are complicit in Trump’s war on the rule of law, which J Michael Luttig, a conservative former federal judge, characterized as a “full-frontal assault on the constitution, the rule of law, the federal judiciary, the American justice system and the nation’s legal profession.”
Because they chose not to respond to my email, I can’t say whether Fazio, Camillo and  Rabin (along with the vast majority of GOP officials nationwide) agree with Trump’s lawless, corrupt and inhumane agenda, don’t have the courage and integrity to stand up to him or don’t want to risk losing their power for the good of the American people.
Regardless of their motivations, the silence of Republican elected officials is putting the economic security, health and safety of Americans, and our democracy at grave risk. Perhaps with enough encouragement from their constituents, they’ll do the right thing and stand up to President Trump.

Is that fair? We say no.,"A part-time faculty member teaches class with strep throat. Another part-time faculty member teaches classes remotely from his hospital bed. Still another part-time faculty member resumes teaching on campus two weeks after giving birth. 
These are just a few examples of the real-life consequences when part-time instructors in the Connecticut State Colleges and University system don’t get sick days. Is that fair? We say no.
Let’s start with the idea that anyone with a student-facing job in the CSCU system deserves a minimum level of support.  After all, the Connecticut state universities are all about the success of our students and the sustainability of the system.  Then the long-term well-being of the system depends upon the well-being of the employees who provide direct services to the students.  Surely these employees are provided with the resources they need, right?  The case is not so clear for the part-time faculty in the CSU system.
According to the National Center for Educational Statistics College Navigator (Fall 2023 numbers), 57.16% (1,552) of the 2,715 instructional faculty in the CSCUs are part-time, and contingent.  Part-time faculty are not continuing employees.  We are hired only for one academic semester at a time, with no guarantee of being rehired in the future. 
Years, and in some cases, decades of service matter little, because we provide flexibility to the system.  We make far less money and enjoy far fewer benefits than our full-time colleagues.  We provide substantial cost savings to the system.  An example of these benefits is paid sick time.  Part-time faculty do not receive paid sick time.  That benefit is only available to full-time faculty.  
Here is the problem.  Like every other CSCU employee, part-time faculty do occasionally get sick or injured. Part-time faculty have immediate family members die.  We also must sometimes care for a seriously sick or injured family member.  But, among the professional employees in the CSCUs, part-time faculty alone are required to take unpaid leave for these reasons.  
Add to this the fact that most part-time faculty are not eligible for health insurance through their employment in the CSCUs.  Why is the part-time majority of the CSU faculty treated like this?
This inequity is even worse during times of crisis.  During the COVID pandemic, enrollments in the CSCU system dropped significantly.  Those enrollments are now recovering quite nicely, but the situation would have been worse if the CSCUs had not offered some on-ground instruction during the pandemic.  
With a very few exceptions, full-time faculty got to choose whether they taught on-ground or not.  Part-time faculty were not so fortunate.  Many of us, myself included, were offered courses to teach only if they were partly or entirely on-ground.  If we were unwilling or unable to teach in-person, the courses would be taught by someone else.  As a result, these courses were disproportionately taught by the part-time faculty, who had neither paid sick leave nor health insurance.  Full-time faculty, who had both, could choose to stay remote.
I hope you remember what things were like during the COVID pandemic.  Being on-ground on a college campus entailed a substantive risk of contracting a disease about which little was known.  Many Connecticut residents got quite sick, and some died.  Isn’t it interesting that the group of faculty without sick time or health insurance were asked to assume most of this risk?  What happened to part-time faculty who got COVID, particularly long COVID?  They were at serious risk of losing their courses in the CSUs.
Another wrinkle is that over 600 part-time faculty in the CSCUs lost their courses during the pandemic.  This was due not only to COVID-related issues, but also to the decreased enrollments that resulted.  If you have never heard that statistic, don’t be surprised.  Faculty did lose their jobs, but those losses happened among the group that was asked to assume most of the risk of working on-ground, with no sick leave or health insurance.
So, if you are wondering why part-time faculty should have paid sick leave, the answer is fairly straightforward.  The CSCU system already saves a substantial amount of money by excluding most of us from obtaining health insurance through our employment.  It then asks us to assume the same risk, or more risk as during the pandemic, of getting sick because of doing our jobs.  The result is a longstanding inequity for the majority of the CSCU faculty.  
If we believe that the sustainability of the Connecticut state university system is a good idea, we need to look to the well-being of the students and the employees.  It is time to support the majority of the CSCU faculty, the part-timers.  One simple and relatively inexpensive way to do this is to allow part-time faculty to earn and use sick time.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)To avoid high insurance costs, some groups of commercial fishers in Alaska have formed cooperatives to collectively pay liability and damage claims themselves.
A bill passed April 25 by the Alaska House of Representatives would exempt these cooperatives from regulation under the state’s insurance laws.
The House voted 37-0 to pass House Bill 116, which now goes to the Senate for consideration.
The bill was carried on the House floor by Rep. Louise Stutes, R-Kodiak, but came from the ideas of a legislative task force assigned to study the commercial fishing industry, she told the House.
The three insurance cooperatives already operating in the state are organized under Washington state law, she said, and cover about 840 vessels. The legal change would allow Alaska fishers to organize other pools locally.
“This bill comes at no cost to the state and supports our fishing industry by simply allowing Alaska-based commercial fishing insurance cooperatives to form,” she said. “Rising premiums and availability of insurance serve as a barrier to operating for Alaska’s aging commercial fishing fleet. Underwriters have been raising premiums on individual vessels and have become increasingly selective of which vessels they choose to ensure.”
Rep. Sarah Vance, R-Homer, said that insurance is now required in order to enter Homer’s small boat harbor, and she’s heard from fishers in other communities who now wonder whether they can afford to fish.
“I think this is a wonderful opportunity to allow a free market,” she said. “They take the risk, but it just says, hey, we want to no longer restrict you if this is something that you want to take on and be able to form a group for yourself.”

(Photo courtesy of Idaho State University)Now more than ever, leadership comes down to knowing when and how to pivot.
Whether you’re running a small business, managing a classroom, serving in public office or raising a family, you’ve likely seen firsthand how quickly circumstances can change. At Idaho State University, we feel it too. But rather than retreat in the face of uncertainty, or freeze in place, we’re leaning in with courage, creativity and a deep sense of responsibility to the state of Idaho and its communities.
Nowhere is that more evident than in ISU’s L.S. Skaggs College of Pharmacy, serving Idaho for over 100 years.
Like many professional programs nationwide, market pressures in the pharmacy industry have caused enrollment declines over the past decade. For a state like Idaho, where access to health care is already strained, this is a serious concern.
Many pharmacy programs in the U.S. have tried to just weather the storm, unwilling to respond or adapt. At ISU, forward-thinking administrators and faculty got to work. They asked hard questions, made tough decisions and reimagined what the future could look like. They pivoted.
For the College of Pharmacy, their strategy in the face of enrollment changes was both simple and bold: tighten the belt, focus on excellence and stay true to our mission. The college began a multi-year “step-down” budget process to right-size operations while protecting core programs and positions. They eliminated vacancies through attrition, restructured contracts and found smart ways to reduce overhead and adjust student cohort sizes. Every decision was guided by a commitment to students, principles and patients, not bureaucracy or maintaining the status quo.
And it’s working. Through disciplined planning, ISU’s College of Pharmacy is not only financially stable, but it’s innovating and thriving in a new environment while continuing to graduate skilled professionals.
Take, for example, their expansion of clinical psychopharmacology. This master’s degree program trains licensed psychologists to prescribe medication safely and effectively, especially in underserved areas. Today, we have 22 students enrolled from across the country, and demand continues to grow. That’s a real impact, rooted in local need and national relevance.
Or look at our hybrid delivery model. With campuses in Pocatello, Meridian and Anchorage, Alaska, in partnership with the University of Alaska Anchorage, our faculty teach and collaborate across thousands of miles, supporting students in rural communities and building tight-knit teams that defy geographic boundaries. They’ve turned a challenge into a strength.
What we’ve learned from ISU’s College of Pharmacy applies far beyond higher education. When circumstances shift, we can’t cling to the way things used to be. We need leaders at every level who are willing to adapt, focus on purpose and move forward with faith in the future. It also requires confidence in the mission and knowing what not to sacrifice or give up in pursuit of making a positive difference.
At Idaho State University, our purpose is clear. We exist to serve Idaho. We prepare the next generation of pharmacists, nurses, teachers, engineers and business leaders while contributing to the creative arts and producing impactful research. We provide a return on investment that benefits every community, and we do this with fewer resources than most universities of our size.
This year, as Idahoans consider the future of education and government, I hope our story adds something meaningful to the conversation. Higher education institutions can adapt; we can pivot while being true to the most important aspects of an educational mission. At our best, we are nimble, practical and deeply committed to solving real problems and contributing to society.
We’re not perfect. But we’re listening. We’re learning. And we’re leading.
In uncertain times, leadership isn’t about being the loudest voice in the room. It’s about showing up, making hard, but principled decisions, and exhibiting strength through resiliency. Because perseverance in tough times doesn’t just steady the ship, it charts a better, bolder course for the future.

The city of Aurora found itself in the national spotlight last year when Trump, campaigning on a platform of mass deportations and harsh new border restrictions, claimed the expansive suburb of 400,000 had been “invaded and conquered” by the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. Early in his second term, Trump’s claims about the gang have fueled one of the most controversial elements of his agenda: The invocation of the centuries-old Alien Enemies Act to deport 137 detainees to a brutal maximum-security prison in El Salvador in March.
About 90% of those 137 deportees had no criminal record, and at least one, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, was removed as a result of an “administrative error.” Advocates, attorneys and family members for other deportees say that they were falsely identified as TdA members because of tattoos honoring family members or their favorite soccer team. The administration has moved to designate hundreds of other detainees for similar removals, but a variety of federal courts have halted the practice citing due process concerns and the inapplicability of the Alien Enemies Act in peacetime. Trump has openly floated plans to send American citizens to the prison, known as the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT, next.
A series of highly publicized raids in Denver and Aurora in February by Immigration and Customs Enforcement failed to turn up a large TdA presence in the area, with agency officials telling Fox News that they had detained just one suspected gang member out of the hundred they had targeted. Instead, federal law enforcement agents have touted busts of at least two underground nightclubs, where they said they detained dozens of people in the country unlawfully. ICE agents also detained Jeanette Vizguerra, a prominent local immigration rights activist, in a March arrest that Vizguerra’s lawyers allege was an act of retaliation for her speech.

Corrales urged the crowd at the Capitol to stand up for Vizguerra and other “working women who are detained at the horrific ICE concentration camp in Aurora for the simple crime of crossing borders while poor.”
ICE operates an immigration detention center in Aurora.
Citing the additional burdens and barriers faced by immigrants in the workforce, including employers’ use of the threat of ICE enforcement to coerce immigrants into unfair working conditions, she said the fight for immigrants’ rights and workers’ rights are part of an interconnected struggle.
“We are here today because we are here to fight, not on one front, or even two or three fronts,” Corrales said. “We’re going to stand with workers on every front.”
Ramon Zuniga, secretary-treasurer of United Food and Commercial Workers Local 7 and the son of Mexican immigrants, echoed that message.
“Immigrant rights are workers’ rights, and unions will lead the charge to fight back and stand up in solidarity with our immigrant brothers and sisters,” Zuniga said. “We must take to the streets, and to the Capitol and courtrooms, and to the ballot box, and together, we will prevail.”
The protest follows several other recent Trump-agenda protests at the Capitol, the latest on April 19.

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)Several thousand people took to New Mexico streets Thursday evening, in marches and community gatherings — complete with paletas and protest signs — in celebration of workers, expressing solidarity with immigrants and others targeted by the Trump Administration.
“We’re not going to let them destroy our workforce, we’re going to protect our kids, and we are going to show them that we are here to stay,” said Fabiola Landeros, community organizer on immigration for El Centro, repeating herself in Spanish to the crowd. Both events in Santa Fe and Albuquerque were bilingual.
Approximately 100 people gathered outside the St. Bede’s Episcopal Church in Santa Fe on Thursday evening to rally against U.S. President Donald Trump’s mass deportations and disappearances and celebrate the immigrant workers’ rights movement in New Mexico.
Another couple thousand people marched in the streets of Albuquerque after a rally at Tiguex Park, stretching the full length of a city block. 
Thursday was International Workers Day, also known as May Day, a holiday directly born from the fight for workers’ rights in the U.S. sparked by the demand for the eight-hour workday. The U.S. has long refused to officially recognize the holiday, but rallies, demonstrations and protests took place across the country as part of a national day of action, including in several additional New Mexico locales.
The gathering in Tiguex opened on a somber note, with neighbors of Nhon Ngoc Nguyen, a 58-year old Vietnamese national who died in ICE custody on April 16, speaking out, holding signs with his photo. Nguyen, who had dementia, was detained during a Feb. 24 appointment with ICE in Albuquerque.
A statement from his nephew, Duke Nguyen, was read out, memorializing his uncle’s love of soccer and his affection for his nieces, who remained in Vietnam. 
“With this, I say we remember Nhon as someone who will be deeply missed, but never forgotten — for the person he was and the impact he had on those around him,” the statement concluded.

Megan Taros, environmental justice and community development coordinator at the nonprofit Earth Care and the child of a Mexican immigrant, said while the Trump administration is targeting immigrants, no one is safe under fascism. “While our pride in our communities is a risk, and fighting back is a risk, looking away will not save you,” said Taros, who has previously contributed to Source NM. “We demand not only that MAGA Republicans end this assault on our communities, but also that our Democratic leadership act in a manner that reflects the severity of this moment.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Amid a severe state budget deficit, the Alaska Senate Finance Committee is proposing the lowest Permanent Fund dividend in five years and — if adjusted for inflation — the lowest dividend ever.
On Thursday, the committee unveiled a new version of its proposed state operating budget with a $1,000 dividend, a $400 reduction from its first draft. 
That cut reduces the Senate’s budget draft by $265 million, likely balancing it once additional legislation is considered.
The dividend figure is not final: The committee will consider budget amendments on Friday, and the full Senate will vote on the committee’s proposal next week.
If the Senate adopts the $1,000 figure, it would have to be negotiated with the House, which approved a $1,400 dividend in April.
The House’s budget contained a significant deficit, however, and differing policy positions between the House and Senate have left lawmakers with no choice but to cut services and the dividend in order to balance the budget.
The document unveiled Thursday is the committee’s second draft operating budget, and it follows prior drafts from both the House and Gov. Mike Dunleavy.
The new Senate committee draft is $1.7 billion less than the governor’s proposed operating budget and $384 million below the draft approved by the House.
In both cases, the primary difference is the amount of the Permanent Fund dividend.
Dunleavy proposed a dividend of roughly $3,900 per recipient based on the formula in state law, which would have resulted in a $2.1 billion deficit. 
He proposed solving that deficit by taking the money from the Constitutional Budget Reserve, the state’s chief savings account. That account contains $2.8 billion, and members of the Senate have refused to spend from the CBR for the coming fiscal year, citing the prospect of larger deficits next year.

In Portland, a march organized by a coalition of unions, community and leftist political groups briefly stopped traffic on Forest Ave. as the crowd progressed from the University of Southern Maine through the city, culminating with a crowd of roughly 1,000 in Congress Square.
Scott Adams, president of the American Postal Workers Union Local 458, addressed those gathered outside the post office. He said that President Donald Trump and billionaire advisor Elon Musk want to privatize the U.S. Postal Service.
 “We will lose everything we won in the past if we don’t fight in the present,” he said.
Other speakers highlighted local labor fights. Stephen Bennett of the University of Maine Graduate Workers Union pointed out that they’d been negotiating their first contracts for more than 500 days. 
“Why does the University of Maine System refuse to acknowledge that our work is valuable?” Bennett asked.

The graduate workers and their supporters, including the Maine Education Association and Eastern Maine Labor Council, also held a march and rally in Orono. Other events were organized in Bridgeton, Bath, Augusta, Waterville, Auburn and York.
On Wednesday, national AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler participated in a listening session with Maine workers that have been impacted by the actions of the Trump administration, including a recent executive order that ended collective bargaining rights for federal unions.

Union Migrante, an immigrant advocacy group, organized the event that started with several speeches, delivered in the shadow of a monument to Benito Juarez, the first indigenous president of Mexico. The rally concluded with participants marching to and from City Hall.
President Donald Trump and his push for mass deportations were a focal point of the event, which also included pro-Palestinian speakers and members of a newly formed nurses union at University Medical Center. Earlier in the day, the nurses went on strike to demand better pay and working conditions from UMC’s management organization, LCMC Health.
In addition to Trump, speakers took and at billionaire Elon Musk, an unofficial adviser to the president who’s led the call for drastic federal government job cuts. Gov. Jeff Landry was also called out for his alignment with Trump.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Two major roadblocks remain before Iowa lawmakers can pass the state’s budget and end the 2025 legislative session — pipelines and paraeducator pay, among a few other spending priorities.
Iowa lawmakers will not receive most session per-diem payments after Friday — a milestone meant to spur legislators to approve budget bills and end the session. While Republicans hold a trifecta of control at the Statehouse, there are still disagreements between the two chambers on funding and policy proposals. One of the major pieces of policy that remains up for discussion is the use of eminent domain in carbon sequestration pipeline projects.
On Wednesday, a group of 12 GOP senators sent a letter to Senate leadership demanding debate on House File 639, legislation passed by the House and approved through the Senate committee process.
“We believe addressing eminent domain is more important than the budget or any other priority for the 2025 session and pledge to vote against any remaining budget bill until a floor vote occurs on the clean HF639 bill,” the letter states.
Bills need a constitutional majority, at least 26 votes, in order to pass the Senate. If the 12 Republican senators who signed the letter and all 16 Democrats vote against a bill, the measure will fail.
The lawmakers who signed onto the letter were Sens. Kevin Alons, Doug Campbell, Rocky De Witt, Lynn Evans, Dennis Guth, Mark Lofgren, Mike Pike, Dave Rowley, Sandy Salmon, Dave Sires, Jeff Taylor and Cherielynn Westrich. These senators and others have spoken on the Senate floor about the need to pass a bill on eminent domain and pipelines during “points of personal privilege” following debate in the past two weeks.
Sen. David Rowley, R-Spirit Lake, said Senate discussion on the use of eminent domain in pipeline projects has “been a long time coming” as Senate discussions on similar measures have failed to advance for the past three years.
“We had a lot of pushback over the years and and we felt this year, it was getting strung out as well, so we took this measure to do everything we can to bring it to the floor,” Rowley said.
The measures brought up in 2025 and during previous legislative sessions largely focus on the proposed Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline, which would span more than 1,000 miles in Iowa transporting liquid carbon dioxide from ethanol plants to underground storage facilities in North Dakota.  Rowley said he has had many discussions with landowners who would be affected by the Summit project, many of whom are concerned about the potential health risks posed by a CO2 pipeline on their property.
“It’s horrible to think that the government could come in and force them to have that pipeline on their property,” Rowley said. “And even though Summit’s done a great job I think, working with people or trying to, it’s still — it’s not enough. It can’t be enough.”
The bill brought up in the letter is a measure the House advanced in March to prohibit carbon sequestration pipelines from using eminent domain in Iowa. Floor debate at the time included concerns over the Senate’s avoidance of eminent domain bills over the past several years.
The proposal combines a number of bills previously proposed in the House aimed at hindering the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline. The bill would increase insurance requirements for pipeline operators, limit permits to one 25-year term and adjust the definition of a common carrier that would eligible for eminent domain. The bill also requires a member of the Iowa Utilities Commission be present at all hearings, limits the commission’s ability to impose sanctions on Iowans who intervene in the proceedings and allows affected Iowans, including lawmakers, to intervene.
Sen. Mike Bousselot, R-Ankeny, proposed a major amendment to the bill that would remove the eminent domain ban and broaden the scope of the bill to include all eminent domain projects in the state — such as roads or utility lines — not just liquid hazardous pipelines. The amendment, which can only be officially adopted on the floor, would allow projects to find voluntary easements outside of the original project corridor, which Bousselot said during committee hearings would allow projects to “avoid” eminent domain.
His amendment would also require an IUC decision on a permit within one year and strikes almost all of the House language, keeping only the IUC attendance requirements and portions of the insurance requirements.
Sen. Kevin Alons, R-Salix, proposed a strikethrough amendment to Bousselot’s proposition. Another amendment, proposed by a group of largely the same GOP lawmakers who signed onto the letter, would limit the definition of public use projects in Iowa Code related to eminent domain for the construction of “hazardous liquid pipelines for the transportation or transmission of liquefied carbon dioxide.”
Salmon, R-Janesville, said in an interview with the Iowa Capital Dispatch the letter was sent as public pressure has been building for Iowa lawmakers to take action on this issue.
“By and large, the public has become quite aware of it now, and and really don’t see the need for eminent domain to be used for this project,” Salmon said. “It’s a private project. It’s for private use. It’s not a public use project, and our Constitution requires it be a public use in order to have eminent domain used.”
The fact that South Dakota now has a law banning the use of eminent domain for carbon dioxide pipeline has also helped “build the momentum to put the same type of prohibitions on CO2 pipelines here in Iowa,” Salmon said.
Senate Majority Leader Jack Whitver said in a statement that “a number of Republican Senators are working on policy surrounding eminent domain and pipeline issues and I am optimistic we will find a legislative solution.”
Disputes over spending between House, Senate and governor remain
The senators’ plan to block legislation from moving unless eminent domain legislation comes to the floor is not the only item keeping lawmakers from advancing budget bills.
On Monday, the governor and Senate Republicans said in a news release they had reached a “budget compromise.” The same day, House Republicans released their own targets for the state’s fiscal year 2026 budget.
In the following days, appropriations subcommittees and committees passed budget bills. But as of Thursday, the chambers have not reached resolutions on the line items that remain a conflict between the two chambers. House Appropriations Committee Chair Rep. Gary Mohr, R-Bettendorf, asked lawmakers on the Appropriations Committee Thursday to “stand ready” for future meetings, but did not lay out a timeline for when the committee will advance the remaining budget bills.
The difference between the two budget targets comes down to $36 million, a relatively small amount when comparing the$9.453 billion in the House proposal and $9.417 billion in the agreement reached between Gov. Kim Reynolds and Senate Republicans. However, Reynolds said in an interview on the WHO AM Simon Conway show this amount was still important during a time when the state needs to be “fiscally responsible,” as it faces lower revenue from income tax cuts and federal financial uncertainty.
“Somebody said, ‘Well, it’s not that much money, it’s only $36 million difference between the two,’ — well, it is a lot of money,” Reynolds said in the interview. “Ask Iowans how much money that is. And every time, it’s that kind of mentality, it’s that kind of thought process that grows government and gets you in trouble in the first place.”
But House Speaker Pat Grassley told reporters Thursday the differences between the two budgets largely entail spending for which House Republicans will have trouble compromising.
One of the largest pieces, $14 million, provides continued funding to raise the pay for paraeducators and other school staff. The measure was first approved in a 2024 law that also made changes to Iowa’s Area Education Agencies. Grassley said this spending was included in Reynolds’ original budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 and then removed in negotiations with the Senate.
“At no point did we think that that wasn’t going to be something that we were going to be able to fund,” Grassley said. “And I will be honest with you, that’s one of the pieces right now that I would say is one of the biggest sticking points. Our caucus feels extremely strongly that if we’re going to provide that level of support that we did with that bill last year, that we’re not going to go back and just cut that, and leave our schools in a situation to find the difference.”
Reynolds said Thursday in an interview with Radio Iowa that “nothing was mentioned about the $14 million” in earlier negotiations on education spending related to the State Supplemental Aid package passed in early April.
Other spending components in House Republicans’ package that differ between the two chambers are an $8 million bump for community colleges compared to the Senate proposal, and a $9 million difference in funding for certain nursing facility reimbursement rates.
Grassley said it is not out of the ordinary for the governor and Senate Republicans to be in closer alignment on budget goals than House Republicans.
“With 67 members representing every county across the state, we try to have a very open situation when it comes to our budget, take as much feedback and fund those priorities. And again, our goal is when we leave here (that) we fund the commitments that we’ve made to Iowans, as well as make strategic investments.”

Don Bacon, R-Neb., prepares for a debate for Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District against State Sen. Tony Vargas, a Democrat, on Wednesday, Oct. 9, 2024, in Lincoln. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — On the same day Densie Powell announced she is running in Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District, U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb, said Nebraska Democrats had learned nothing. 
“They keep running extraordinarily left-wing candidates in Omaha,” Bacon told the Nebraska Examiner. “If you want to win in Nebraska [2nd District], you’ve got to run a more centrist candidate.”
Bacon also reaffirmed his summer timeline for deciding to run or not, saying he will decide “thoughtfully.” He spoke during a monthly news conference with reporters about the reasons he is considering retiring from Congress. Among them: spending more time with his family and the dysfunction in his own GOP, which he said is wearing on him.
“It’s one thing to fight the other party, but when you have fights in your own party, the enjoyment factor is not the same,” Bacon said. “It’s become a blood sport.”
Former 2022 GOP gubernatorial candidate Brett Lindstrom has told people in political circles that he might be interested in a bid if Bacon retires. Another conservative being discussed is Dan Frei, who ran against Bacon in the 2024 GOP primary.  
Denise Powell launches bid in Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District

Bacon, who beat the last Democrat to hold a congressional seat in Nebraska in 2016, U.S. Rep. Brad Ashford, compared the first major announced 2nd District candidate, Powell, to former State Sen. Tony Vargas, who twice failed to unseat Bacon.  

Powell recently announced endorsements from Omaha’s State Sens. Margo Juarez and Dunixi Guereca and other elected officials in the district. Powell declined to respond to Bacon’s comments.
Powell, in an interview Wednesday, told the Examiner she wants to give the district an “everyday working” voice in D.C. She said she hopes for a political moment when voters are done with partisanship, as people are “frustrated by our elected officials who were supposed to represent us.”
Powell has criticized Bacon for “taking votes in DC that are hurting Nebraskans,” and said she would prioritize protecting Medicaid and Social Security and would, among other things, vote to ensure the federal government does its part to boost quality K-12 education. 
Bacon said State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha has a voting record that outside political groups would easily use to highlight his “left-wing votes.”

Cavanaugh publicly acknowledged in recent days that he is exploring a bid and said he would decide by the end of the session. He accused Bacon of using DC-style politics to “muddy the waters” before he even announces a potential bid.   
“While Congressman Bacon has continued to support policies that are making it harder for Nebraskans to afford things like eggs, diapers, and other day-to-day expenses,” Cavanaugh told the Examiner. “I have cut taxes on diapers, stopped a sales tax increase on food, and protected access to reproductive healthcare.”
The National Republican Congressional Committee also released a statement on Powell’s announcement, criticizing her and “any other extreme Democrat” as “another out-of-touch liberal pushing a radical agenda that puts woke ideology ahead of Nebraskans.” 
“Next year, Nebraskans will reject Powell, or any other extreme Democrat,” said Zach Bannon, an NRCC spokesperson.

(Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Some 120 South Carolinians who oppose the Trump administration lined the sidewalks of Columbia’s downtown post office as part of a series of May Day demonstrations spanning the country.
The protests held on a day commemorating the fight for workers’ rights and the national labor movement was organized by a group that calls itself the 50501 campaign, which stands for 50 protests, 50 states, one movement.
The movement, which originated online, has led to a wave of grassroots protests nationwide since President Donald Trump’s inauguration. The group has had at least four coordinated demonstrations in the past four months, including a gathering that attracted hundreds to South Carolina Statehouse grounds on President’s Day.

While signs, slogans and the issues protesters cared about Thursday went well beyond workers’ rights, organizer Sam Gibbons, of Columbia, said the group did want to highlight workers’ struggles.
At least one organizer from the Union of Southern Service Workers was in attendance and circulating flyers.
And among attendees’ variety of chants was “the U.S. mail is not for sale” in reference to suggestions by the Trump administration that the U.S. Postal Service should be privatized.
Gibbons, a 34-year-old educator, also criticized the administration’s tariff policies and potential impacts to union workers and the middle class.
If we stop importing goods, longshoremen working at Charleston’s port could lose work, he said. And if prices go up, retail workers may be affected.
The protest occurred the same day as Vice President J.D. Vance visited a Nucor steel mill in rural Berkeley County to tout the tariffs as bringing back manufacturing jobs.
Angel Lee, who also helped organize the Columbia event, said she’s worried about possible changes to federal law that impacts those with disabilities. The 46-year-old is disabled and works with a non-profit that aids those with disabilities.
“As a disabled worker and an advocate, I know how hard we have to fight just to be seen,” she said. “All we want is to be able to work with dignity and for fair pay.”
Lee will travel to Washington, D.C., Friday to protest with other members of the movement on the National Mall.

For Margot Robinette, of Columbia, it’s the president’s immigration policy and deportation efforts that are of the greatest concern.
The 26-year-old apothecary shop worker married into a family of immigrants. Her husband is a first-generation American whose parents immigrated to the United States from Honduras, and she said it’s difficult to see those she loves living in fear that they could be deported.
Robinette has also worked alongside immigrants on a farm in California.
“Immigrants are essential workers,” she said. “Workers’ rights and immigrants’ rights intertwined; you can’t talk about one without the other.”
Miguel Torres, of Batesburg, also is the child of immigrants who came to the U.S. from the Guanajuato region of Mexico.

The 22-year-old retail worker attended the protest outside the post office as well as a gathering of legal professionals outside the federal courthouse in Columbia earlier in the day.
Lawyers, federal judges and the dean of the University of South Carolina law school held that separate event as part of National Law Day.
“Attacks on judges for unpopular rulings, political pressure on legal professionals and a growing distrust of the legal system threaten the very foundation of fairness and equal justice,” Columbia attorney Nekki Shutt said in kicking off the program.
U.S. District Court judges DeAndrea Gist Benjamin and Joseph Anderson then led the lawyers in a restatement of their legal oath, which Benjamin said directs legal professionals to serve “without fear or favor, without allegiance to politicians or politics, to honest judgment, regardless of financial or social standing.”
Torres called the arrest of a county circuit court judge in Wisconsin for allegedly helping an undocumented immigrant avoid arrest scary.
“The rule of law in our country is just not being respected,” he said. “Every single day on the news it seems like there’s a new executive order.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DSC_0367-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-01 20:09:08.607111

(Nathaniel Bailey for the Daily Montanan)Montana Superintendent of Public Education Susie Hedalen celebrated the signing of House Bill 357 as a “significant step” toward strengthening career and technical education (CTE) for middle school students across the state, the Office of Public Instruction said Tuesday in a news release.
Sponsored by Rep. Eric Tilleman, R-Cascade, HB 357 ensures funding for CTE programs in middle schools, exposing students to career pathways in agriculture, business, health occupations, industrial technology and family and consumer sciences.
HB 357 appropriates $240,000 for the 2027 fiscal year. The bill says the legislature intends the money to be continued in the future.
OPI said the investment helps Montana students build technical knowledge and hands-on experience, “laying the foundation for future success in high-demand fields.”

In a statement, Hedalen thanked Tilleman for his leadership and for recognizing the importance of career and technical education in middle school.
“Montana faces a growing demand for skilled workers, and employers across the state are looking for professionals with both technical expertise and practical experience,” Hedalen said. “HB 357 responds to this challenge by providing the resources necessary for schools to foster career exploration, reduce dropout rates, and connect classroom learning to real-world applications.”
Tilleman said the bill allow grants of up to $5,000 to any CTE program in the state of Montana. High school students already receive similar support, and Tilleman told the Daily Montanan his bill will help bring the same ideas to younger students.
“We’re helping middle schoolers be able to see the employability skills early and give them the foundational elements for work-based learning,” Tilleman said.
OPI will develop and implement guidelines for distributing the funds so they can expand their CTE offerings, the news release said.
Hedalen said CTE not only equips students with the skills they need, it strengthens the workforce, economy and communities.
“The OPI team and educators across Montana are ready to build the bridge between education and industry,” Hedalen said. “Sparking students’ interest and beginning the career exploration journey in middle school will help our students be engaged in their education and see their incredible opportunities for years to come!”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250212_MTLeg-292-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-01 20:09:08.607111

The Department is asking the federal court to stop the law from being enforced.“I’m always proud to represent Vermont, and I look forward to doing so in this case,” Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark wrote in an email.

Trump executive order targets Vermont’s first-in-the-nation ‘climate superfund’  

by Olivia Gieger 
April 9, 2025, 4:53 pmApril 9, 2025, 5:15 pm 



The climate superfund law, Act 122, applies a polluters-pay framework, like a federal hazardous waste superfund, to the costs of climate damages — like flood recovery. Vermont was the first state in the nation to adopt this framework for climate disasters. In December, New York followed and adopted its own climate superfund bill.The Justice Department also filed lawsuits against three other states, targeting actions that hold oil and gas companies accountable for the costs of climate damages, specifically New York state’s climate superfund, and Hawaii and Michigan’s lawsuits against fossil fuel companies, according to a Justice Department press release.In its release, the Justice Department argues that these state actions “unreasonably burden domestic energy development” and put the US in a “national energy emergency.”“I will just note that there is no national energy emergency,” Clark told VTDigger in April, after Trump issued the executive order. “American energy is at an all time high, and state laws are not a threat to American energy,” she said.Make Polluters Pay, a national campaign that promotes laws and lawsuits that hold fossil fuel companies responsible for the costs of climate damages, called the four federal lawsuits against the states as “political theater, plain and simple,” as Cassidy DiPaola, the communications director said in a press release.“This is not a surprise,” Paul Burns, the executive director of Vermont Public Interest Group said in a press release. VPIRG was instrumental in the construction and passage of the climate superfund law. “This lawsuit is one more instance of our billionaire president holding the fossil fuel industry in a warm embrace by giving Vermonters the finger.”When Trump first filed his executive order targeting the Vermont law, Pat Parenteau, an emeritus professor at Vermont Law School’s Environmental Law Center, explained to VTDigger that the government was likely to argue that the federal Clean Air Act preempts the state law. But those claims ring hollow, he explained, since the federal law deals with the source of emissions, not payments for past emissions. In April, Parentau explained that Vermont should be ready for a long legal battle, saying that the federal government and fossil fuel industry have deep pockets to prolong these lawsuits that aim to “bleed its opponents dry.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Trump takes Vermont’s climate superfund law to court.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/charity-clark-1-20240618.jpg?fit=1024%2C680&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-01 20:09:08.607111
,Mississippi Today,2025-05-01 23:21:37+00:00,Mississippi Today,‘Goon Squad’ lawsuit settled for $2.5M,Jerry Mitchell and Mukta Joshi,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/05/01/goon-squad-lawsuit-settled-for-2-5m/,Rankin County officials announced a $2.5 million settlement with two men tortured in a warrantless raid in January 2023.,"Rankin County officials announced Thursday that they had settled a lawsuit filed by Michael Jenkins and Eddie Parker—who were brutalized by sheriff’s deputies in 2023—for $2.5 million. 
“This amount, for Mississippi, is historic,” said Trent Walker, the attorney for the two men. “I can’t think of an excessive force settlement larger than this.”
Six Rankin County law enforcement officers handcuffed, beat and shocked Jenkins and Parker with Tasers before shooting Jenkins in the mouth during a warrantless raid of Parker’s home.
“This is the ending of the Michael Jenkins and Eddie Terrell Parker case from the perspective” of the Rankin County Sheriff’s Department, said its lawyer, Jason Dare.
The county’s insurance policy will cover $2 million of that payment, he said. 
The remaining $500,000 will come from the sheriff’s coffers, which is funded by taxpayer dollars, Dare said, but taxpayers won’t have to pay for any increase to the department’s budget.
Last year, a federal judge sentenced the six officers — former deputies Brett McAlpin, Jeffrey Middleton, Christian Dedmon, Hunter Elward and Daniel Opdyke and former Richland police officer Joshua Hartfield — to between 10 and 40 years in federal prison for their roles in the 2023 torture of Jenkins and Parker.
Middleton’s shift called themselves the “Goon Squad” and created a WhatsApp channel and commemorative coins featuring the moniker and drawings of mobsters.
An investigation by Mississippi Today and The New York Times exposed a decades-long reign of terror by nearly two dozen Rankin County deputies, but the six officers are the only ones who have been charged.
During the officers’ sentencing hearings, former deputies and prosecutors said the torture of Jenkins and Parker was far from isolated. In at least nine incidents over five years, McAlpin brutalized people during arrests, prosecutors said.
“McAlpin is the one who molded these men into what they became,” federal prosecutor Christopher Perras told the judge. “He modeled that behavior for young impressionable officers, and it’s no wonder that they followed his lead.”
Dare said the sheriff’s office has taken steps to ensure such behavior ceases. “The compliance director, Captain Wayne Carter, and the [Internal Affairs] investigators, do an excellent job of going through everything now to make sure that something similar to what happened in January 2023 never happens again,” he said.
The events in Braxton had impacted not only Mr. Jenkins, “but also the Rankin County community and the fine, upstanding law enforcement officers who are with the Rankin County Sheriff’s Department, who have weathered the storm that has ensued since that day,” Dare said. “We hope that this resolution brings some sense of finality.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/01180341/IMG_0312.jpeg,,,2025-05-01 20:09:08.607111

Aug. 5, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen chose Kearney police chief Bryan Waugh as the new superintendent for the Nebraska State Patrol. He will replace retiring Colonel John Bolduc and starts in June. 
“Chief Waugh brings over 30 years of law enforcement experience, marked by innovation, collaboration and a public servant’s heart,” Pillen said in a statement. “He has led a growing department, managed a $13 million budget, achieved accreditation and launched programs like the Mental Health Co-Responder Initiative and a citywide license plate reader system that sparked a statewide effort. His leadership during the 2019 flood kept Kearney safe while strengthening community trust.” 
Pillen said he was confident he had chosen the “right person to lead the Patrol and build on its 88-year-old legacy.” The four candidates who were interviewed for the position were already working in Nebraska. Bolduc, who has served as NSP superintendent since 2017, is retiring because the Patrol has a mandatory retirement age of 60. Waugh’s annual salary will be $203,000.
Waugh became the police chief of the Kearney Police Department in 2019. He previously worked at the La Vista Police Department in various roles for 21 years. He also spent four years on active duty as a U.S. Air Force security police and law enforcement specialist at Offutt Air Force Base in Sarpy County.
Waugh said he was incredibly humbled and honored by Pillen picking him. 
“This storied organization’s professional men and women are first-class, dedicated, committed and driven toward providing the highest level of public safety and professional services for the entire state of Nebraska,” Waugh said.

Glenn Youngkin’s top political adviser, Matt Moran, head of the powerful Spirit of Virginia PAC, stepped down Wednesday — nearly one week after Moran allegedly advised the governor to pressure Republican lieutenant governor nominee John Reid, the first openly gay candidate on a statewide ticket in Virginia, to quit the race over explicit photos allegedly linked to Reid’s social media.
Moran’s resignation, which a source familiar with the development confirmed Thursday evening, marks a dramatic fallout in a political storm that has rattled Virginia Republicans, exposed deep internal divisions, and fueled charges of political backstabbing just months before the November elections.
Moran, 36, had remained silent until Wednesday evening when, less than two hours before Reid took the stage alone at a Henrico County GOP rally where Youngkin canceled his appearance, he denied accusations that he tried to bully Reid out of the race. 
“Let me be clear, facts matter, and they will demonstrate the accusations against me are unfounded,” Moran posted on X, formerly Twitter.
“I’ve known John Reid for years and consider him a friend,” Moran wrote, insisting he had been “actively supporting and assisting John as the Lt. Governor nominee.”
Moran also released a sworn affidavit and a sharply worded legal letter from his attorney, George Terwilliger III, pushing back on Reid’s claims. 
The letter argued Reid’s team had been misinformed and warned that continued accusations could bring legal consequences, with Terwilliger writing that Moran “never attempted to extort, coerce, or pressure Mr. Reid” but simply offered “sound advice regarding the viability of Mr. Reid’s candidacy to someone he counted as a friend.” 
Despite that, the letter hinted at a possible off-ramp, asking if Reid’s campaign was open to “scheduling a call where we might further discuss the matter.”
On Thursday, before Moran’s resignation became known, an audio recording surfaced that captured an April 27 meeting between Moran and members of Reid’s campaign, where Moran framed Reid’s withdrawal as the only way to stop damaging opposition research from surfacing — a stance Reid later described as bordering on extortion. 
The rift burst into public view last Friday, when The Richmonder reported that Youngkin had asked Reid, a conservative radio host and the first openly gay candidate on a statewide ticket, in a phone call to step down over sexually explicit posts shared by a Tumblr account with the same name of Reid’s other social media profiles. 
On Sunday, Reid alleged in a video posted online that “representatives of my campaign have been told by the leader of Governor Youngkin’s political organization that the attacks on me will continue unless I drop out.”
While Reid did not initially name Moran, his campaign followed up Monday with a cease-and-desist letter directly accusing Moran of defamation, claiming Moran told reporters Reid was behind the sexually explicit Tumblr account — a charge Reid’s team firmly denies. “While this account shared a common username with our client’s Instagram, he is not and never has been associated with the account,” the letter said.
Moran has spent more than a decade deeply embedded in Virginia politics. He got his start managing the campaign of a rural delegate and working as a legislative aide before climbing the ranks to become spokesman for then-House Speaker William J. Howell, R-Stafford, and later chief of staff to Speaker Kirk Cox, R-Colonial Heights. 
When Youngkin took office, Moran came on board as director of policy and legislative affairs — notably working without a state salary. Instead, he remained on leave from two consulting firms in which he held ownership stakes — Creative Direct and Link Public Affairs. That arrangement drew criticism from those who argued it posed serious conflicts of interest.
Meanwhile, Reid has vowed to continue his campaign as election season kicks into high gear.

Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s top political adviser, Matt Moran, temporarily stepped aside from his job as the head of the powerful Spirit of Virginia PAC, the PAC’s chief financial officer confirmed late Thursday evening. 
Lisa Jennings told The Mercury that Moran, who allegedly advised Youngkin to pressure Republican lieutenant governor nominee John Reid to leave the race, had informed her on Wednesday that he would leave temporarily. A senior administration official said that Moran decided to step away because the controversy created a distraction for himself and his work for the PAC.


Reid, the first openly gay candidate on a statewide ticket in Virginia, said the governor urged him to quit over explicit photos on a social media account bearing the same name as Reid’s but that Reid emphasized he had no connection to.

Vance told a crowd at the Berkeley County mill for the country’s largest steel producer that America is entering “a golden age” for manufacturing.
Vance spoke Thursday at the Nucor mill in rural Huger to celebrate the first 100 days of the Trump administration.
In his 20-minute speech, the vice president categorized the administration’s controversial tariff policy as the catalyst for an incoming boom in U.S. jobs and American-made products.
“One hundred days under Donald Trump’s leadership sparks the beginning of the industrial renaissance in the United States of America,” Vance told the crowd of around 500, made up of steel workers and other invited guests.
“I believe the golden age of American manufacturing started 100 days ago, and we’re building it right here at Nucor steel in South Carolina.”
Vance leaned on his own past as the grandson of a steel worker in his hometown of Middletown, Ohio. He spoke about how his grandfather, who helped raise him, was proud of his profession and could name every American car made from Armco steel.
He told the Nucor steel workers he hopes they get the same satisfaction.
“When you see a lawn mower, a water heater, a kitchen appliance in your neighbor’s home, or your home, I hope every single one of you guys in front of me feel a sense of pride,” Vance said as workers in the crowd nodded their heads. “Because these are the products that make America work.”
The promise of a stable, well-paying job with a good pension that drove people to companies like Nucor has largely disappeared, Vance said.
This administration aims to bring them back, Vance said.
“I think we’ve got to send messages to our young people that the most interesting work — the work that’s going to challenge your mind but also allow you to work with your hands — is found at American steel mills right here in Nucor Berkeley in South Carolina,” Vance said to applause.

Vance was introduced by Lee Zeldin, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, who looked at the crowd and said, “this is red, white and blue, made in America.”
He told them it’s possible to invest in manufacturing and still protect the environment.
“We choose both,” Zeldin told the crowd. “That is the Trump EPA, delivering for the people of South Carolina and delivering for the United States of America.”
Nucor produces a quarter of new steel refined in the U.S. The company is based across the state line in Charlotte, North Carolina, but founded in South Carolina and still employs more than 2,500 people total at locations around the state.
The Berkeley plant alone employs around 1,000 people and produces 3.6 million tons of steel annually.
The company has been a consistent supporter of the Trump administration’s tariff-laden economic plan. A 25% tariff on the importers of foreign steel products went into effect March 12.

Two days ago, Nucor CEO Leon Topalian told CNBC that the company has its biggest backlog in history, specifically mentioning the Berkeley mill in the interview.
Topalian thanked the administration Thursday “for continuing to level the playing field for American steel producers.”
While Topalian continues to back the tariffs, many South Carolina industries, like the state’s multibillion-dollar auto sector, are in a state of flux as they adjust to often-changing announcements about tariffs and how they’ll affect the cost of foreign-made parts used to build vehicles here.
U.S. Rep. Jim Clyburn, the state’s lone Democratic congressman, has been a staunch critic of the tariffs.
Clyburn said in a statement Thursday that Trump’s second in command would be better served meeting with South Carolinians “from all walks of life.”
“Trump’s exorbitant tariffs — imposed on countless essential products without any strategy — are increasing costs, jeopardizing retirement savings, threatening jobs, and putting small businesses at risk,” Clyburn said.
“South Carolina stands to be harmed disproportionately,” the statement said.
Vance told the crowd that tariffs are part of an effort to build up middle-class jobs in America, rather than let them be outsourced to other countries.
“Do you want to ship American jobs off to the People’s Republic of China?” He asked. “Do you want to rely on foreign corporations to make the things that you need in your home and your families need every single day?”
The crowd shouted “no” in response to both questions.
“So why don’t we rebuild America’s middle class?” he asked rhetorically. “Why don’t we rebuild American manufacturing? And why don’t we rebuild American industry, just like you’re doing right here.”

Bryan Posthumus (R-Rockford) testified in support of his House Joint Resolution B, which aims to amend the state constitution to require proof of citizenship for voters. | Kyle DavidsonMichigan House Republicans took votes on several policies aligned with President Donald Trump’s priorities on Thursday, achieving mixed results on measures to ban sanctuary cities, a proposed constitutional amendment intended to bar noncitizens from voting and legislation they say would end diversity, equity and inclusion practices in hiring. 
Though House Republicans successfully advanced several policies tied to undocumented immigration, Rep. Bryan Posthumus’s House Joint Resolution B, which requires residents to show proof of citizenship when casting their ballot and registering to vote, stalled when put to a vote, failing to reach the two-thirds supermajority needed to advance. 
However, the effort to amend the state constitution is not quite dead, with Posthumus (R-Rockford) moving to reconsider the vote and tabling the matter for another session. 
Additionally members of the Board of State Canvassers approved the language and form for a proposal that mirrors the House’s resolution, giving supporters 180 days to gather signatures in order to place the matter before voters on the 2026 ballot.

“There’s a potential that down the road we bring it back up and see what happens then,” Posthumus told reporters after Thursday’s session concluded. 
“Whether it is done legislatively, which, while it failed today, that doesn’t mean it’s dead forever, or whether it’s through the petition drive one way or another, I’m going to make sure it’s on the ballot,” Posthumus said. 
Posthumus first offered the effort in 2024 in response to reports of a 19-year-old University of Michigan student from China casting a ballot in Ann Arbor. 
The Department of State has since identified 15 additional cases of noncitizen voting in the 2024 election out of more than 5.7 million ballots cast.  
“This is a serious issue, one we must address with a scalpel, not a sledgehammer,” Benson said in an April 3 statement, noting that only U.S. citizens can legally register and vote in elections. “Our careful review confirms what we already knew – that this illegal activity is very rare. While we take all violations of election law very seriously, this tiny fraction of potential cases in Michigan and at the national level do not justify recent efforts to pass laws we know would block tens of thousands of Michigan citizens from voting in future elections.”
Voting rights advocates have repeatedly warned that Posthumus’ proposal would have serious consequences on the ability of married or divorced women who change their names, seniors and low-income voters to cast their ballot. 
“This is a poll tax, plain and simple. You have to pay money to produce documents in order to vote. That is a poll tax,” state Rep. Matt Koleszar (D-Plymouth) told reporters ahead of Thursday’s House session.
Though the policy does include a hardship exception to cover the cost for individuals who do not have the necessary documentation, Koleszar questioned whether that would include the middle class. While speaking on the floor, he also pointed to the impact of a similar policy in Kansas, which blocked 31,000 individuals who were otherwise eligible to vote from accessing the ballot. 
Rep. Stephen Wooden (D-Grand Rapids), the minority vice chair of the election integrity committee, compared the proposal to the Kansas law alongside another policy in Arizona and the SAVE Act proposed in Congress, all of which have drawn criticism for creating barriers to voting. 
The only substantive difference between these policies is that Posthumus’s proposal would leave the implementation details to be hammered out by a future Legislature, Wooden said.
  State Rep. Stephen Wooden (D-Grand Rapids) testifying on the House floor on May 1, 2025. | Kyle Davidson
Rep. Penelope Tsernoglou (D-East Lansing), who previously chaired the House Elections Committee pitched several alternatives to the joint resolution.
“How about having our Department of State do more audits before the elections and not after? What about using existing records to check new registrations on a rolling basis? How about adding bold, not-to-be-missed signage at every polling place laying out the consequences of voting as a noncitizen and let’s put it in some different languages that reflect the population of the district to avoid any potential language barriers,” Tsernoglou said. 
Tsernoglou’s office later announced a set of three bills sponsored by Wooden, Koleszar and State Rep. Mai Xiong (D-Warren) in cooperation with the Secretary of State’s office as part of the first phase of legislation aimed at tightening up Michigan’s election security.
The proposals include: 

Requiring the secretary of state to compare driver data to voter registration information to identify records of potential non-citizens that need further review.
Giving the secretary of state the ability to remove voters who haven’t voted in 20 years from the voter rolls after notice.
Requiring the secretary of state to regularly review the instructions on the voter registration form to ensure citizenship eligibility requirements are clearly described.

In his own floor speech, Posthumus challenged the arguments put forth by Democrats. While Koleszar noted the number of noncitizens barred from voting by the Kansas law was “statistically indistinguishable from zero,” Posthumus pointed to the 2000 Presidential election, where former President George Bush defeated Al Gore by a 537-vote margin in Florida. He also pointed to multiple recent elections in the Michigan Legislature that had been decided by double digit margins. 
Additionally, Michigan has the benefit of being able to learn from Kansas and Arizona’s mistakes, Posthumus said before urging a yes vote on the proposal. 
In the unlikely case that Posthumus’ proposal achieves the two-third margin needed to pass the House, it would need to win support from two-thirds of members in the Democratic-led Senate before the matter could be placed on the ballot for a majority of Michiganders to decide in the next general election. 
Republicans advance policies on undocumented immigration
Prior to taking a vote on House Joint Resolution B, the chamber cast its first votes of the day on a set of bills banning local and county governments from enacting or enforcing sanctuary city or county policies, ordinances or laws, which typically limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. If the bills become law, any locality with an existing sanctuary policy would have 60 days to eliminate it and comply with state policy.
The bills creating this ban, House Bills 4338 and 4339, passed along party lines, with full support from Republicans’ 58 member majority. However, House Bill 4342 — which would bar any city or village with a sanctuary policy in place from receiving state revenue sharing funds used to pay for key services like police and fire departments, funding for roads and sewers and garbage collection — did see the dropoff of one Republican, Rep. Jaime Greene (R-Richmond). 
Another set of bills, House Bills 4340 and 4341, which aim to bar noncitizens from receiving welfare and housing assistance, gained support from Xiong and fellow Democratic Reps. Peter Herzberg (D-Westland), Tullio Liberati (D-Allen Park), Denise Mentzer (D-Mt.Clemens), and Angela Witwer (D-Delta Township).
However, the bills are unlikely to advance in the Democratic-led Senate, as split control of the Legislature has led to deadlock.
Effort Republicans say would end DEI practices in hiring receives overwhelming support
In an uncharacteristic show of strong bipartisan support, nearly all members present in the House voted in support of a policy Republicans argue would end diversity, equity and inclusion practices in hiring at state agencies. 
House Bill 4288, put forth by State Rep. Erin Byrnes (D-Dearborn) states “a state agency shall not hire an applicant for unclassified employment unless the state agency bases the hiring on 1 or more objective and merit-based factors that include, but are not limited to, the applicant’s relevant education or work experience.” It does not mention diversity, equity or inclusion, or DEI hiring practices.
State Rep. Angela Rigas (R-Caledonia), who introduced nearly-identical legislation last year, said she was surprised to see Byrnes reintroduce the bill. However, when she began to mention DEI hiring practices, House Minority Floor Leader John Fitzgerald (D-Wyoming) raised a point of order, noting that  “the speech and debate on the floor of this house must contain and be relevant to the bill itself.”
  On May 1, 2025, State Rep. Angela Rigas testifies in support of legislation she said would end diversity, equity and inclusion practices at state agencies. | Kyle Davidson
“I do not find that —in the absence of any diversity, equity or inclusion language included in this bill — that that is relevant or germane to the debate here today,” Fitzgerald said.
Rigas was permitted to continue, telling the House “DEI has left us divided and lowered with lowered standards. H.B. 4288 fixes that by demanding objective, merit-based hiring. Agencies that choose to hire by race, identity or anything other than merit will face a $10,000 fine.”
The bill passed with support from 105 members of the 110 member body. State Rep. Dylan Wegela (D-Garden City) marked the sole vote against the legislation. 
While Wegela requested his name be removed as a cosponsor of the bill, Byrnes requested the board be opened for members to join in cosponsoring the bill, with the bill gaining support from 74 members by the time the voting board was closed. 
Fitzgerald later told reporters the bill was part of a larger pay-equity package, calling Republican’s description of the bill as anti-DEI bill as “a really poor misunderstanding of the legislation.”

“I think that really what we’re focused on is trying to make sure that people who are not necessarily relationally, or have a relationship with their workplace, that they’re applying to don’t get shut out indiscriminately. We want to make sure that people on their merit, on their capability, on their work experience, have the opportunity to do that,” Fitzgerald said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_1536-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-01 20:09:08.607111

(Provided by Montana State University)A federal judge extended this week an emergency order that prevents the U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement from deporting two Montana State University graduate students.
Last month, four international students affiliated with the Montana University System had their visas revoked and student visitor records terminated.
The terminations could subject the students to immediate deportation, and two of the students, graduates at MSU, challenged the decision in federal court.
The ACLU of Montana sued on their behalf, and the Trump administration subsequently and separately reinstated them in a database that keeps those records, the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System, or SEVIS.
However, Alex Rate of the ACLU of Montana said in an email Thursday that the students still need the court to step in because the recent reinstatement does not provide the students ongoing assurance.
“Given the chaos and confusion that the Trump Administration has created for our clients, the only thing that can bring them some certainty is an order from the court,” Rate said in an email. “This Administration’s conduct is cruel and illegal, and we will not stand idly by while our clients’ rights are being trampled.”
NBC News reported Wednesday the revocations affected an estimated 3,000 international students in the U.S.
On April 21, Inside Higher Ed said the terminations had resulted in at least 28 lawsuits across the country.
At a hearing of Roe v. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Missoula, Judge Dana Christensen agreed the reinstatements did not mean the case was moot.
Christensen extended the temporary restraining order an additional 14 days until he had an opportunity to rule on the students’ motion for a preliminary injunction.
A media contact from the U.S. Attorney’s Office District of Montana did not return a call for comment Thursday.
National media outlets said the terminations took place after Homeland Security ran the names of 1.3 million foreign students through a crime database and sent hits to the State Department.
The State Department then revoked visas and told Homeland Security to change their status from “active” to “terminated” in the SEVIS database, which university officials monitor.
The lawsuit said a terminated record requires a student to depart the U.S. immediately, citing a notification the students received from MSU.
However, the lawsuit alleged the visa revocation isn’t a legal justification for the termination of a SEVIS record. It said the students were not provided additional information about the terminations.
Therefore, the ACLU of Montana alleges the government’s actions circumvent the law and appear designed to coerce the students into “self-deporting.”
The lawsuit said the students had done nothing to violate their visa status, but the case challenges the terminations of their records in the SEVIS database, not the visa revocations.
The lawsuit also said the two plaintiffs from MSU had not been convicted of any crimes “in the U.S. or elsewhere” and both were “star students and model members of their respective school communities.”
In Judge Christensen’s emergency ruling, he found the case similar to one in New Hampshire in which the court found the federal government had not followed its own procedures in actions affecting students and violated due process protections.
At a hearing for a case in the Northern District of California in Oakland last week, an attorney for the Justice Department said the federal government would no longer terminate statuses based only on information in the crime database, according to NBC News.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MSU-enrollment-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-01 20:09:08.607111

DemasTestifying in front of Michigan state lawmakers last legislative session as a survivor of rape was one of the most terrifying and difficult experiences of Emily Bice’s life, she told state Senators Thursday. 
But seeing the legislation to expand the time window survivors of sexual assault have to sue perpetrators fail to make it to the governor’s desk in order to become law was a new level of pain.
This is the fifth session in a row that bills to expand the timeframe survivors of sexual violence have to file civil suits, as well as legislation to eliminate Michigan’s governmental immunity shield against sexual abuse civil cases, have been taken up. Advocates argue Michigan has needlessly narrow statute of limitation laws on filing civil suits after an assault, while it can take a survivor years to disclose abuse, often decades if the victim was a child at the time of the abuse.
Bice told lawmakers on the state Senate Civil Rights, Judiciary, and Public Safety Committee Thursday that at age 19 she wasn’t ready to disclose that she had been raped, much less advocate for herself and seek out justice. She recalled the first therapist she spoke to telling her ‘You were drunk and got into a cab alone. what did you expect to happen?’.
Currently, victims in Michigan have three years after realizing they have been assaulted or until their 28th birthday, whichever is later, to sue their perpetrators. The window used to be even smaller, with the cutoff being a victim’s 19th birthday before 2018, a change that came a result of mass legislative efforts to reform sexual violence laws following the Larry Nassar sex abuse scandal, where hundreds of athletes and former patients of the Michigan State University and Olympic gymnastics doctor came forward with their stories of abuse.
By the time the law changed in 2018, it was too late for Bice to sue her perpetrator when she was ready.
“I would not wish the last 10 years on my worst enemy, I would not wish this on anyone. The only thing I would wish for is change. When someone has to go through this, I wish that the world on the other end is kinder to them than it was to me,” Bice said.
Senate Bills 257, 258 and 259 seek to increase the timeframe victims have to file civil suits to 10 years after the crime, 7 years after realizing they have been assaulted or by the time they reach 42 years old.
Michigan has been the backdrop of two of the largest collegiate sex abuse scandals in recent years, bill sponsor Sen. Kevin Hertel (D-St. Clair Shores) told senators, with Nassar at MSU and then the late University of Michigan doctor, Robert Anderson, where more than a thousand individuals accused the sports doctor of sexual assault. With all the painful experiences that have “plagued” the state, Hertel said it’s time for lawmakers to learn from what has happened, and help end systematic failures that both abusers and institutions have exploited to avoid accountability.
Survivors of Nassar’s abuse have been at the forefront of the effort to create new laws to protect Michigan from sexual perpetrators and foster system changes aimed to ease the reporting of sexual crimes since 2017. Efforts to eliminate Michigan’s governmental immunity protections for public schools and colleges against liability in sexual violence civil suits have been unsuccessful each session.
Senate Bills 260 and 261 would remove governmental immunity in sexual violence civil cases for public universities, public colleges, and school districts when employees were the perpetrator and the institutions neglected to reasonably prevent, intervene or report the abuse.
It wasn’t until he was 54 years old, when Brian Hurtekant disclosed he had been repeatedly sexually assaulted by a priest his family became close with when he was 13, following the death of his brother.
The two connected over a love of flying, Hurtekant said, as the priest was a private pilot and would take him for rides because Hurtekant dreamed of becoming a pilot.
But the abuse made Hurtekant afraid of being around other men, preventing him from participating in sports, gym class and the Air Force.
“He robbed me… this is a murder of my soul. I could have been better. I still think I did pretty damn good,” Hurtekant said.
All the bills presented Thursday have a history of bipartisanship, though this session there are no Republican sponsors. But it shouldn’t matter what side of the political aisle lawmakers sit on, Hurtekant said, no survivor should be robbed of their day in court after losing so much to sexual violence.

New apartments reached almost 592,000 nationally last year, the highest number since 1974, with South Dakota and the Rapid City area approving new apartments at particularly high rates. (Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)This story originally appeared on Stateline.
More new apartments were built in 2024 than in any other year since 1974, but the Trump administration’s tariffs and deportations of potential construction workers, plus higher interest rates, could be a wet blanket on the boom.
A U.S. Census Bureau survey found almost 592,000 new apartments were finished last year, the most since the 1970s, when baby boomers sparked a construction surge as they moved out of their childhood homes. There were 693,000 new apartments built in 1974, when the country had about half as many households.
But there has been a steep slowdown in construction starts, as the newly completed apartments come online. The increased supply has lowered rents and increased vacancy rates, making new development less profitable. Some experts also say tariffs on construction materials and labor shortages caused by dips in immigration will create headwinds for new construction.

Apartment starts were down 27% in 2024 compared with 2023, and down 37% from a recent peak of 531,000 in 2022, despite the historic rate of completions. Apartment starts were at their lowest ebb since 2013.

Housing experts have long lamented that there aren’t enough apartments and single-family houses in the U.S. — at least not in places where people want to live and at prices they can afford. Estimates of the national housing shortage last year varied widely, from 1.5 million houses and apartments to 20.1 million; since then, another 1.6 million houses and apartments have been built. Most experts estimate a shortage of 1.5 million to 5.5 million, according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University.
Some states are building apartments faster than others, according to a Stateline analysis. Though completions aren’t tracked by state, permits that lead to new apartments have been granted at high rates in recent years in South Dakota, Utah, Arizona and Colorado. Rates are lowest in Mississippi, Wyoming, West Virginia, Rhode Island, Oklahoma and Alaska.
The massive jump in apartment construction has its roots in 2021 and 2022, when interest rates were low and rent growth was high, said Rob Warnock, senior research associate for Apartment List, a company that posts rental listings online.

“Those new apartments came online in 2023 and 2024, and while those deliveries are slowing down today, there are still many apartments in the pipeline,” said Warnock, who added that “supply and demand are coming back into balance.”
In response to greater supply, rents have fallen by about $50 per month (3.5%) from their 2022 peak, according to a report released this week by Apartment List. Apartment vacancy is at a 15-year high of 6.3%, keeping a lid on rents, but that could turn around as construction slows, according to an April report by Moody’s, a financial services company.
Apartment building has been a bipartisan priority as single-family home prices soar further out of the affordability range for young families. In South Dakota, the Republican-controlled legislature worked to prolong the building boom with grants and loans under the state’s Housing Infrastructure Financing Program. The program put $200 million of state and federal funding toward defraying the costs of development in new neighborhoods, such as roads, sewer lines and streetlights.
Republican state Sen. Casey Crabtree, sponsor of the proposal signed into law in 2023, told Stateline it was needed to address a housing shortage, especially in rural parts of the state.
“We have a drastic shortage of workers,” Crabtree said before a vote in 2023. “South Dakota businesses need more workers in our state. To get more workers, we need more housing.”

Armand Domalewski, co-founder of YIMBY Democrats for America, said overregulation is a barrier to housing construction in many areas that his party controls.
“A lot of blue-government areas and cities have extremely restrictive zoning, impact fees and other rules that make it very difficult to build housing,” said Domalewski. Another barrier is local opposition, he said.
“If it was just a free market, developers would want to build in the places like California, where prices are the highest and rents are the highest, because they’d make more money,” he added.
In California, the 2021 HOME Act was meant to spur more affordable housing and ease labor shortages, but it’s faced local opposition in some areas. At the end of last year, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed several measures that aim to streamline regulations and crack down on local resistance to the 2021 law.
South Dakota approved nearly 6,000 permits for apartment units in 2023 and 2024, which when completed would add about 1.4% to its 2023 total of 417,000 housing units. That’s the highest rate in the nation. By contrast, Mississippi during that same period approved about 660 apartment units — a fraction of 1 percentage point to its 2023 base of about 1.4 million housing units.










A lot of blue-government areas and cities have extremely restrictive zoning, impact fees and other rules that make it very difficult to build housing.


– Armand Domalewski, co-founder of YIMBY Democrats for America


Chas Olson, executive director of the South Dakota Housing Development Authority, said the full impact of the state infrastructure funding isn’t apparent yet, as many developments that received the help are still under construction.
Completions are still strong this year with about 39,000 apartments finished in March, not much different from the 41,500 in March 2024, which was the biggest March number since 1985.
Another impediment to apartment construction has been high interest rates, which make it harder to borrow money to build, said Danushka Nanayakkara-Skillington, an assistant vice president for forecasting and analysis at the National Association of Home Builders.
She expects apartment building starts to slow until later this year.
“We are going to be short of workers for a long time. That’s the way it is. And of course tariffs are going to have an impact,” Nanayakkara-Skillington said.

The notice must also tell individuals they have a right to seek an expedited appeal.“For many people, access to emergency housing is literally a matter of life and death,” said Maryellen Griffin, a staff attorney at Vermont Legal Aid, which is representing service providers and motel program participants in the ongoing case. “This allows people to understand what is happening to them before it happens to them.” The order is the latest ruling in a long-running suit that Legal Aid brought over a year ago, when the organization sought to halt the evictions of motel program participants at the end of the 2024 winter-weather eligibility period. Legal Aid wanted the state to pause evictions at the time in order to adequately screen unhoused people for continued eligibility granted by a newly-passed law, which expanded who counted as having a disability. A judge denied their preliminary injunction last March. The case picked up steam again this spring, Griffin said, as the latest round of evictions from the motel program began on April 1 after a prolonged political battle at the Statehouse.In some instances, state employees told motel program participants that they were ineligible to remain sheltered the very same day that they needed to leave, Griffin said.Susan Merchant, a 53-year-old with severe osteoarthritis who had been living at the Hilltop Inn in Berlin, attested in a court filing that one morning last month, she received a call saying that her voucher was being terminated “and I needed to leave my room.” The day prior, a Department for Children and Families staffer had told her that her voucher had been approved for seven days, according to the filing.Merchant believed she should still be eligible to remain in the program. “I don’t understand what the problem is, and they could not explain it to me,” she attested in the filing.Legal Aid ultimately helped Merchant through the state’s appeal process, Griffin said, and discovered she was simply a missing document. Once that was provided to the Department for Children and Families, Merchant’s voucher was renewed.Thursday’s order gives people a chance to challenge their voucher terminations in instances where they are incorrect, Griffin said. The notices must be provided in writing, not given over the phone, and must be specific to the individual’s case, she said. That differs from a common practice DCF uses when motel program rules change: directing motel owners and service providers to slip general notices under peoples’ doors.For people whose vouchers are terminated for legitimate reasons, the order provides more time to plan their next steps, she added.The order applies to people who have received motel vouchers since September 2024 and either continue to receive the benefit or were “subsequently terminated, not renewed, or informed that they were ineligible.” (The temporary order does not outline retroactive relief for people who have already lost their vouchers, though the court could consider future action.)Brenda Siegel, executive director of End Homelessness Vermont, said the order is a victory.“This is a huge win for people who are in the hotel/motel program, and certainly for our clients who have been being denied without notice and exited pretty regularly in the last couple of weeks,” she said.The Department for Children and Families did not provide a response to questions on Thursday afternoon.The order will remain in effect for two weeks, until the next hearing in the case on May 16. At that point — if state officials have not proposed a plan to comply with the order that the plaintiffs have agreed with — the judge will decide how to proceed, Griffin said.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Judge orders state to give motel voucher recipients more notice before evicting them.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/homeless-hotel-3-20240315.jpg?fit=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-01 19:10:38.225703

Bob Ferguson signed on Wednesday. 
Senate Bill 5337, would require assisted living facilities to be certified by July 1, 2026, to care for people with dementia. This certificate is intended to help ensure the health and safety of residents, transparency for families, and appropriate training for staff.
The Department of Social and Health Services would be required to create, manage and enforce the certification process. 
This bill “brings a baseline level of consistency to the definition for memory care,” said Cathy MacCaul, advocacy director at AARP. 
Facilities do not have to use terms such as “memory care facility” or “specialized dementia care” to be considered a memory care facility. 
Under the new certification, facilities would be required to maintain staff onsite 24 hours a day and provide staff with at least six hours of continuing education. 
A publicly available list of certified assisted living facilities specializing in memory care or that have memory care units would have to be maintained by the Department of Social and Health Services. The department would also conduct regular inspections to ensure the facilities comply with state law. Facilities that do not comply could face civil penalties. 
Memory care or specialized dementia care services vary across the 237 assisted living facilities in Washington, according to an informal study by the state’s Dementia Action Collaborative in 2021. 
This can make it difficult for individuals and families to understand the services and staffing that facilities offer. 
“If a facility wants to say that they’re providing memory care, they have to meet just some basic requirements,” MacCaul said. 
MacCaul said the bill was modeled after Medicaid definitions to ensure consistency. 
Older adults could outnumber children under age 18 for the first time in U.S. history by 2034, according to U.S. Census Bureau projections.
“We have to shift the way we think about all of our systems and make sure that we have adequate consumer protections, consumer awareness and transparency,” MacCaul said.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/long-term-care-hospital-wheelchair-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-01 19:10:38.225703

SPRINGFIELD — A plan to overhaul the way Illinois funds public universities is running into stiff opposition from the state’s largest higher education institution, the University of Illinois System.

The plan, which has been in development for the last four years, calls for adding roughly $1.7 billion in new university funding over the next 10-15 years, but distributing that under a formula that would give priority to schools that are currently the least adequately funded.

Senate Majority Leader Kimberly Lightford, D-Westchester, the lead sponsor of Senate Bill 13, said it is designed to bring equity and stability to the state’s higher education system.

“This bill does not just aim to increase funding,” she told a Senate committee Wednesday. “It tells us for the first time in our state's history what students and universities need to succeed and how to adequately fund universities over time to actually meet that need. It defines what universities require to educate, support and graduate students successfully, and then it directs resources to do just that.”

But Nick Jones, executive vice president and vice president of academic affairs for the U of I System, said the proposed formula would be detrimental to the state’s flagship university and that it needs considerably more work before it can be ready for legislative approval.

“The University of Illinois system is absolutely dedicated to expanding equitable access, enhancing student success and promoting statewide economic growth,” he told the committee. “The proposed legislation penalizes institutions that provide the most support for underrepresented and rural students while failing to ensure long-term access.”

History of underfunding

The proposal is a product of a commission that lawmakers established in 2021 — the Illinois Commission on Equitable Public Education Funding. The commission grew out of the Legislative Black Caucus’ efforts that year to enact sweeping social and racial justice reforms in the wake of unrest that followed the killing of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police the previous summer.

“Every university participated in the commission, and the work of the commission acknowledged that Illinois has never had a systemic approach to university funding, nor one that is rooted in student or institutional need,” Lightford said. “Instead, it has been a largely political process.”

Robin Steans, executive director of the advocacy group Advance Illinois, which took part in the commission, said Illinois went through a decadeslong period of steadily cutting its support for higher education, resulting in a system she said is so underfunded it can no longer be sustained.

As recently as 2000, she said, state funding for universities covered about 75% of their overall costs. Today, she said, state funding covers only about 35%, far below the national average of 60%.

“And the only place to go to make that up is tuition,” she said. “And so the lower we go, the more we're pushing those costs to students, pricing them out and driving them out.”

Proposed new formula

The proposed formula would operate much like the Evidence-Based Funding formula, or EBF, that lawmakers adopted in 2017 for K-12 education.

It would start with determining an “adequacy target” for each school to reflect how much they need to meet their educational missions. That would include such things as the cost of instruction and student services, operation and maintenance of physical facilities, and costs associated with meeting the school’s research and public service missions.

Like the EBF formula, that calculation also would take into account the unique attributes of each school’s student body and the higher costs associated with educating certain demographic groups, referred to in the bill as “underrepresented students.”

The formula then measures each school’s “resource profile” – the money it has available from sources such as state aid, tuition and fees, to cover the costs included in its adequacy target.

Those two calculations are used to determine each school’s “adequacy percentage,” which reflects the degree to which a school is underfunded, and its “adequacy gap,” the dollar figure reflecting the difference between its adequacy target and available resources.

According to preliminary calculations made public Wednesday, Western Illinois University in Macomb would rank as the most underfunded public university in Illinois on a percentage basis, with current resources meeting only 45.7% of its adequacy target. But because WIU is relatively small, its total “adequacy gap” would be just $104.3 million, ranking seventh among individual campuses.

In terms of total dollars, the University of Illinois Chicago would have the largest adequacy gap of any  campus, at nearly $475.5 million.

Meanwhile, the state’s flagship university, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, would rank as the best-funded university in the state, at 88.6% of adequacy. But because of its size – with total enrollment in the fall 2024 semester of more than 56,000 – its total adequacy gap would rank fifth among all campuses, at $137.4 million.

U of I opposition

“Although we support several of the key aspirational goals of the bill, we do not agree with the methodology proposed to achieve those goals,” Jones, of the U of I System, told the committee. “Nor do we agree that this will provide what the University of Illinois needs to succeed.”

Jones noted the U of I System as a whole – including the Urbana-Champaign, Chicago and Springfield campuses – enroll more than half of all public university students in Illinois, including 45% of all those who qualify for Pell grants, the federal need-based financial aid program for higher education. And yet, under the proposed formula, he said the U of I System would receive only 28% of any new funding provided in the first year of the program.

In addition, he said the proposal also includes a formula for allocating any potential funding cuts that could happen in future years, one that would protect schools that are least adequately funded while requiring those closest to their adequacy target to bear the brunt of the cuts. Under that formula,  the U of I System would absorb 74% of any future funding cuts.

“The University of Illinois system would support adopting a tiered, mission-aligned approach that better recognizes the distinct missions of the universities and equitably funds institutions based on their specific needs and contributions to student success and the state's economic priorities,” Jones said. “This approach would ensure that funding supports student outcomes holds institutions accountable for results and drives true equitable distribution of the state's investment in higher education.”

The Senate committee took no action on the bill Wednesday. An identical bill, House Bill 1581, is pending in the House. It is sponsored by Rep. Carol Ammons, D-Urbana, and is cosponsored by House Speaker Emanuel “Chris” Welch, D-Hillside, and Rep. Katie Stuart, D-Edwardsville, who chairs the House higher education budget committee.

Senate Republicans tried to add environmental rollbacks to the 2026 budget bill. The chamber voted against taking up the amendments.

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerAs the Senate passed its “Big Bill” on the state’s 2026 budget today, Senate Republicans took a big swing on a suite of environmental rollbacks.Minority leader Sen. Scott Beck, R-Caledonia proposed two amendments to H.493: one would have repealed both the clean heat standard and a clause in the Global Warming Solutions Act that opens the state up to lawsuits for failing to meet mandated emissions reductions. Beck’s second amendment proposed pushing back the timeline for adopting California’s electric vehicle standards, which would phase in widespread EV adoption starting next year.Neither amendment got an up or down vote. Republican Lt. Gov. John Rodgers, who presides over the chamber, deemed each one “not germane” to the budget bill, in response to concerns raised by Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden Central.Both times, Beck called for suspending the Senate’s rules so the amendments could be taken up, regardless of their germaneness to the budget. But senators rejected those motions on mostly party-line, roll-call votes.“I think he wanted to be able to have a roll call vote on it to have a political statement made,” said Sen. Becca White, D-Windsor, who sits on the Transportation Committee. The time for looking at pushing back adoption of the California standards would have been when the Senate approved its transportation bill, White said. “I think he essentially missed his opportunity and was trying at a second bite of the apple to bring it onto the budget.” Sen. Anne Watson, D/P-Washington, who chairs the Natural Resources & Energy Committee, disagreed with the floor amendment tactic too. “I think that trying to circumvent the committee process where you can properly vet ideas, where you can hear multiple perspectives, where you can tune language to be the best product is bad governance,” she said in an interview. Repealing the clean heat standard became a rallying point for Republicans last fall — though current law required the Public Utility Commission to report to the Legislature on how to put the framework in place, which happened in January. No further action has been proposed, but the lingering uncertainty surrounding whether lawmakers would implement the policy is an undue stress on Vermonters, Beck said in an interview. “Vermonters out there (are asking) ‘are you gonna put a 58 cent tax on me or not?’” As for the Global Warming Solutions Act and California vehicle standards, Beck said the state is not on track to meet the deadlines either one mandates. “There’s a whole lot of good that comes from shifting away from carbon, but we can only do that as fast as the technology and the affordability of the technology is,” he said. “We need to be more realistic about what that glide slope really looks like. Then, in three to five years, maybe there’s new technology, and maybe we have more resources, but we can’t bankrupt businesses and families to do this.” Senate Democrats agree that the state is not on track to meet the mandates of the Global Warming Solutions Act.“By 2030, Governor Scott will have had a decade to have gotten on track, and he has not,” Watson said. “What I am most interested in is not letting up. If you change the deadline, if you take away the teeth of any of the aspects of it, that reduces the sense of urgency that I think this issue deserves.”In the knowIn a well-timed vote that coincided with International Workers’ Day, the Vermont House of Representatives on Thursday passed Proposal 3, an amendment to the Vermont Constitution that would affirm the right of employees to organize unions and collectively bargain. The Senate approved the amendment in March. Both chambers had previously approved the measure in 2024. The amendment states that “no law shall be adopted that interferes with, negates, or diminishes the right of employees to collectively bargain.” The proposal also includes a constitutional protection for workplace agreements that require workers to join a union as a condition for employment. That means the measure would prohibit a future legislature from passing so-called “right to work” laws, which have been enacted in 26 states and which functionally outlaw such agreements. Thursday’s vote was just the latest in a long series of steps in the state’s ratification process. The next hurdle will be the 2026 November election, when Vermont voters will weigh in. The amendment succeeds if the  ballot question receives a majority vote.— Habib SabetOn the moveThe Senate on Thursday passed its proposed state budget for the 2026 fiscal year, which starts in July.The plan includes more state spending than in the version approved by the House, or that was presented by Gov.

The bill would fully exempt military retiree pensions and survivor benefits for people with incomes under $125,000 and create a partial exemption for those under $175,000. A refundable tax credit would be available to all veterans with incomes under $30,000. The bill passed committee in a vote of 10-0-1. — Ethan WeinsteinVisit our 2025 bill tracker for the latest updates on major legislation we are following.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Final Reading: A big swing at the Big Bill.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/scott-beck-1-20250225.jpg?fit=1024%2C676&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-01 19:10:38.225703

John Sauer said an order from a federal judge in California stripped a national security-based power from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.“So long as the order is in effect, the Secretary must permit hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan nationals to remain in the country, notwithstanding her reasoned determination that doing so is ‘contrary to the national interest,’” Sauer wrote.The emergency appeal, which asks the court to rule as soon as possible, was not available on the Supreme Court website late Thursday afternoon but a copy was uploaded by Politico.The appeal came after the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the administration’s request to pause an order from a trial court that blocked Noem’s decision to end Temporary Protected Status for one group of Venezuelans whose protections President Joe Biden extended.U.S. District Judge Edward Chen of the Northern District of California issued a nationwide pause in early April, noting the immigrant rights groups and TPS holders who brought the suit had a strong claim under the equal protection clause of the Constitution’s 14th Amendment because Noem has “made sweeping negative generalizations about Venezuelan TPS beneficiaries.”The equal protection clause was meant to bar the government from discriminating against classes of people.Chen was appointed by former President Barack Obama in 2011.President Joe Biden granted protections until October 2026 for two groups of Venezuelans. His administration granted about 250,000 Venezuelans TPS in 2021 and 350,000 more in 2023.Noem cited gang activity as her reason for not extending TPS for the 2023 group of Venezuelans, which, without a court intervention, were set to end in early April after she vacated the protections set under the Biden administration.TPS allows nationals from certain countries deemed too dangerous to return to remain in the U.S. temporarily. Those with the status have deportation protections and are allowed to work and live in the U.S. for 18 months, unless extended by the Homeland Security secretary.",,,,2025-05-01 19:10:38.225703

Phil Scott, earlier this year — though Senate leaders say they expect their proposal to soon get whittled down. The budget bill, H.493, now heads to a joint committee of legislative leaders to hash out their differences, which include, among others, how the state should pay for certain child care subsidies.

So, we’re working with the governor’s folks to see how we can move closer in his direction,” Perchlik told reporters at the Statehouse on Wednesday. “We definitely want the governor to be supportive.”Scott, for his part, has already criticized legislators’ budget proposals in recent weeks for exceeding, in some areas, the spending he proposed to them in late January. Overall, the budget senators approved Thursday totals $9.01 billion, while the Republican governor’s proposal totaled $8.99 billion. Last year, Scott’s repeated criticism of spending approved by the Democratic-controlled Legislature paid political dividends after a historic number of seats in both chambers flipped toward the GOP in November’s election. As a result, Democrats no longer have enough seats in each chamber to override a budget veto, as they did in 2023.“I do expect — and, Vermonters expect — that legislators will work with us to find common ground,” Scott told reporters last week at one of his regular Statehouse press conferences. “Instead, I’m concerned.”Floor debateAs it stands, the Senate’s 2026 budget would add about $50 million more to the state’s “base” spending — money expected to fund recurring expenses year-over-year — than Scott proposed, and about $25 million more in base spending than the House added.That spending includes a dozen new state government positions that Scott didn’t propose in January, including at the Vermont Labor Relations Board, the Green Mountain Care Board and a position at the Attorney General’s Office to support the state’s legal challenges to President Donald Trump’s administration, according to Perchlik.Scott’s Secretary of Administration, Sarah Clark, said at the press conference last week that the number of positions in the Senate’s budget was, also, too high. She argued the chamber would be creating too many future spending obligations at a time the state is facing deep uncertainty over potential actions by the federal government.Gov. Phil Scott speaks during his weekly press conference at the Statehouse in Montpelier on Wednesday, April 2, 2025. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerSen. Robert Norris, R-Franklin, said on the floor Wednesday that there were far more requests for new state positions than the Senate Appropriations Committee chose to put in the budget — and some state entities “made out better than others.” When the budget was up for final approval Thursday, Norris voted for it, as did the panel’s two other GOP members.Perchlik said on the floor Wednesday, before the budget bill won initial approval, that, overall, he thought his committee developed “a balanced budget that we thought was good for Vermonters and put us on a stable financial path for the future.” Still, he told reporters that he expects some of the Senate’s proposed positions will be cut in the upcoming conference committee process.Several GOP senators echoed Scott’s concerns over the amount of spending in the budget bill ahead of the final vote Thursday. The vote was also preceded by attempts by Senate Minority Leader Scott Beck, R-Caledonia, to insert measures into the budget bill to make changes to existing state laws aimed at combating climate change.Perchlik and Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden Central, raised objections on two separate occasions to the chamber considering Beck’s amendments, saying the proposals were not relevant to the budget debate. Lt. Gov. John Rodgers, who presides over the Senate, ruled in agreement both times, saying that Beck’s proposals were not “germane” to the legislation on the floor. Beck moved twice to suspend the chamber’s rules so the amendments could be taken up, regardless of Rodgers’ ruling. But senators rejected both of those motions. Senators then voted 20-10 to pass the budget, overall, with Beck and several other GOP senators backing it. Sen. Ruth Hardy, D-Addison, voted against it, after telling her colleagues that she didn’t think the bill adequately prepared the state, or some social services providers, for potential cuts to federal spending. Sen. Tanya Vyhovsky, a Chittenden Central Progressive/Democrat, also voted against the legislation.Perchlik, on the floor, pointed to a measure in the budget that would set aside some future state revenue — an estimated $45 million — to plug federal funding gaps.The Senate’s budget also includes funding for some of the measures that were in this year’s annual “budget adjustment” legislation that the House and Senate passed, versions of which were then twice vetoed by Scott, including flood recovery grants to certain municipalities and funding for county courthouse upgrades.Key differencesA large part of the Senate’s proposed spending increase — $19 million — comes from a push to continue drawing on the state’s general fund to support subsidies to families paying for child care. Scott had proposed reducing the general fund appropriation for that purpose by $19 million, after a payroll tax set up to support the subsidies brought in more money than the state expected, while at the same time, the program’s uptake was lower than expected.The House backed Scott’s proposal, which had drawn criticism from advocates for the state’s child care providers. Defending the Senate Appropriations Committee’s move on the floor, Baruth said he thought Scott’s, and the House’s, proposal “could create a tradition, or a practice, of slowly reducing the amount of general fund money — and that could destabilize the program, in our opinion.”The Senate’s budget also proposed setting aside an additional $10 million under a proposed new state framework for providing emergency housing. The money is tied to a bill that cleared the House last month and provides a potential off-ramp to the state’s mass use of motels as a primary form of shelter, among other measures.The bill, H.91, is now being reviewed by the Senate Health and Welfare Committee. Scott’s administration is opposed to putting any more money into the budget for the motel voucher program than it first proposed in January, Clark, Scott’s secretary of administration, said last week during the governor’s press conference.Another sticking point in budget negotiations could be the specific programs the budget funds to support new housing construction, and to what extent. For instance, legislators have earmarked more money for the independent Vermont Housing and Conservation Board than Scott proposed — but the governor wants more money for certain programs run by the Vermont Housing Finance Agency than, for instance, the House approved.The House and Senate proposed different spending for some housing programs from each other, too, something legislators said will feature in the conference committee negotiations. The committee could convene as soon as Friday, according to Baruth’s chief of staff, Ashley Moore. On the floor Thursday, Baruth also echoed Perchlik’s comments to reporters the day before.“It is impossible to predict what will come out of a conference committee — but if I had to predict, I would say that what we will see would be fewer positions and slightly less spending,” he said. “That would be my guess, based on conversations with people on both sides of the building — and understanding (Scott’s) position on this.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont Senate approves 2026 budget proposal, but legislators expect to cut spending further amid Gov.

Port of Seattle Commissioner Ryan Calkins predicts a 40% reduction in cargo, as President Donald Trump continues his tariff crusade with 145% levies on China, which has responded with retaliatory measures. That lost business means a similar drop in work for local longshoremen, truckers and warehouse workers. 
On a press call Thursday with port officials and senators from Washington, Oregon and California, Calkins said the effects “will ripple out through the whole economy in our port communities.”
“Fewer ships from across the Pacific means less cargo at our ports,” said U.S. Sen Patty Murray of Washington. “Less cargo at our ports means less goods for our truckers to transport, and that ultimately means bare shelves for our retailers and the American consumer.”
Murray, a Democrat representing one of the most trade-dependent states in the nation, compared the looming problem for small businesses reliant on trade to their plight during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Up to this point, local ports have seen surging traffic as shippers looked to get ahead of the tariffs Trump has long promised. While he has pulled back drastic levies planned across the board, the taxes on Chinese imports remain.
International imports in March were up 18% from March 2024 at the ports of Seattle and Tacoma, according to the Northwest Seaport Alliance, which oversees both. Exports increased almost 3%.
In Seattle, total trade volume was still up 7.3% from March 24 to April 24 this year compared to last year. 
Washington’s ports are still reeling from the consequences of tariffs imposed when Trump was first in office. 
That time around, import taxes on India undercut a booming apple export industry, with 11,000 containers shipped from Seattle and Tacoma in 2018 falling to about 360, said Dick Marzano, a Port of Tacoma commissioner. Years later, that number only returned to around 3,500 in 2024, a testament to the potential long tail of protectionist trade policies.
In a White House press briefing Thursday, top Trump adviser Stephen Miller defended the continued tariffs. 
“We need to have a trade relationship with China that does not do harm to our nation’s economic and national security,” he said. “At the same time, tariffs will bring significant revenue into this country that will allow us to pursue our dramatic plan of tax cuts and reforms.”
Calkins was in Virginia this week trying to gin up business from “renewable energy cargo,” like wind turbine blades and transformers. The seaport alliance has also sent delegates to Vietnam and South Korea in hopes of finding more customers to diversify away from relying on China. 
“We’re looking at all avenues to open up markets,” Marzano said.
But all those conversations are “conditional on resolution to the trade dispute,” Calkins said. 
“We’re having to play the long game here in hopes that either Trump comes to his senses,” he added, “or Congress and Republicans in Congress are willing to check his power.”
Other threats and oversight
Meanwhile, the state this week warned of trouble from China potentially suspending Boeing imports due to growing trade tensions with the United States.
Last year, Washington’s top export was civilian aircraft, engines and parts, worth $17 billion, according to the state Office of Financial Management. China accounted for $4 billion of that. Losing that revenue could, in turn, cost the state over $19 million in business and occupation tax proceeds.
The warned suspension, which China has walked back, could mean 19,000 fewer jobs and $1.7 billion in lost labor income. 
At the same time, new car registrations in Washington surged 18%, partly due to consumer anticipation that tariffs could push up auto prices, according to the Office of Financial Management. 
Washington state Treasurer Mike Pellicciotti met with local officials in Port Angeles on Tuesday. They told him about flagging logging exports and tourism from Canada, as well as businesses “freezing plans while they hope for more stable future conditions.”
“This is the backbone of the economy being broken all while the cost of groceries, housing and services are going up,” Pellicciotti told reporters Wednesday. “America is losing and growing weaker under the president’s economic policies.”
Pellicciotti was one of 11 state financial officers to pen a letter Wednesday to Republican congressional leadership calling on them to assert their authority in trade and broader fiscal policy. 
“We will continue to do our part: safeguarding public funds, managing risk, and investing in our people,” they wrote to House Speaker Mike Johnson, of Louisiana, and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, of South Dakota. “But if Congress does not rise to this moment, no state government will be able to shield its citizens from the consequences.”
U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell, a Democrat from Washington, has bipartisan legislation aiming to do exactly that.
Introduced last month, Cantwell’s Trade Review Act of 2025 would require the president to notify Congress of the imposition or increase in a tariff within 48 hours. The notice must explain the rationale and analyze potential impacts to the country’s businesses and consumers.
Within 60 days, Congress would have to pass a joint resolution approving the new tariff, or it would expire. Congress could also end tariffs at any time via resolution.
While the measure has attracted some Republican support, it has little chance of overcoming the hefty Trump-loyal wing of the party. Though Johnson opened the door ever so slightly Wednesday for potential congressional intervention. 
On Wednesday, a separate resolution seeking to undo Trump’s import taxes failed on a 49-49 vote in the U.S. Senate, with three Republicans joining Democrats.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/port-of-seattle-1024x595.jpg,,,2025-05-01 19:10:38.225703

Steve Drazkowski, R-Mazeppa, offered an amendment to a transportation funding bill Thursday that would mandate the Minnesota Department of Transportation use digital road signs that “convey a clear and simple message without witticisms, colloquialisms, neologisms, portmanteaus, hashtags, electronic or internet shorthand or slang, popular culture references that target or are comprehended by a limited segment of the driving population, or any other message relying on hidden meanings, targeted cultural knowledge, or unconventional syntax to understand the message.”
Drazkowski explained during a floor speech that MnDOT’s use of wit in its safety messages — which he called “Big Brother type messages — is distracting and dangerous.  
He read a few of the digital billboards in use by MnDOT in recent weeks. 
“Only the hot dish should be baked. Don’t drive high.”
“Weed like to remind you that driving high is illegal.”
“Don’t rely on a four-leaf clover. Drive safe and sober.”
The messages compel drivers, Drazkowski said, “to figure out what the message means and having the neurons in your head focusing on that, all the while distracting you as a  driver from the roadway.”
Drazkowski — who opposed the cell phone-while-driving ban in 2019 — cited an article in Science by a University of Minnesota researcher and a colleague, which used data from a Texas study to warn that “cognitive overload” can increase distraction and accidents.
Indeed, NPR reported last year that the federal government has issued recommendations “that states phase out signs that have ‘obscure’ meanings or use pop-culture references that could require drivers ‘greater time to process.'”
State Sen. Ann Johnson Stewart, who is a DFL civil engineer of Wayzata, said on the Senate floor that she’d called friends at MnDOT and been assured the signs are safe and merely a fun way to get the public — and especially children — involved in road safety.
Drazkowski, who has had moments of internet fame, like when he repeated debunked tales about schools providing litter boxes for students who identify as cats, said MnDOT shouldn’t be making the decision: “I did expect my Democrat friends to call the government. It’s one of my frustrations with this place … it’s reflexive: What does the government wanna do?  They just wanna fun. Fun kills at 65 miles per hour.”

(Screenshot, WPTV)The Florida Legislature on Thursday sent to Gov. Ron DeSantis a bill that would put an end to a 35-year-ban that prevents people from filing lawsuits against physicians and hospitals for medical malpractice.
The 33-4 vote by the Florida Senate capped a tumultuous 24-hours in which the main sponsor paused action on his bill a day earlier after the Senate narrowly rejected his call to cap how much someone could collect in a medical malpractice.
“It needs to be repealed, it is unjust,” said Sen. Clay Yarborough, the Republican who sponsored the legislation, of the litigation ban.
  State Sen. Clay Yarborough via: Florida Senate
The question is what will happen next. DeSantis has complained loudly about the influence of “liberal trial attorneys.” Yarborough on Thursday told reporters there was a chance the governor could nix the bill.
Under existing law, parents of single, childless, adult children cannot sue for noneconomic damages such as pain and suffering. Adult children, defined as those 25 and older, are also banned from pursuing wrongful death claims for single parents who die from medical malpractice. ‘
HB 6017 would completely eliminate this prohibition in law. It passed over strong opposition from groups such as the Florida Hospital Association, Florida Medical Association, the Florida Chamber of Commerce, and insurance industry lobbyists.
Florida Justice Reform Institute William Large said he will ask the governor to veto the bill.
“This bill is bad for Floridians. It’s bad for consumers. This bill will only increase healthcare costs for all Floridians,” Large told the Florida Phoenix, adding that he estimates as many as 500 additional lawsuits annually will result from eliminating the ban.

The vote for final passage Thursday followed emotional testimony wherein state Sen. Gayle Harrell’s voice cracked as she explained that she was being targeted by billboards for her opposition to the bill.
Harrell, a long-time champion of the medical profession, said she would have supported the expansion of lawsuits against physicians and hospitals if, in exchange, the Senate agreed to put a $1 million limit on wrongful death recoveries for all medical malpractice incidents.
Harrell said she was moved throughout the session by testimony from residents who shared stories of how their children, parents, and loved ones died allegedly from medical malpractice but were prevented from seeking redress in court. But, at the end of the day, she said she believes that without damages caps, physicians and hospitals will face increased costs and stop practicing.

“I can tell you we are going to have a huge increase in medical malpractice. And in addition we are going to have physicians not coming to the state of Florida,” she said.
Harrell said she has been targeted for her position. The Republican from Stuart didn’t say who was behind the intimidation.
“I can tell you this has become very difficult for me, personally. I am getting personal attacks on it because of my stand. There is now a billboard in front of my neighborhood saying Gayle Harrell supports profits over people,” she said, adding there is a “double billboard”  “attacking” her in another nearby neighborhood.
“And I can tell you, that is very devastating to anyone in a political situation where they think Gayle Harrell puts profits over people. I do not. I do not,” she said.
Harrell’s remarks solicited anger from a bipartisan group of senators who came to her defense.
Former Senate Democratic leader turned independent Sen. Jason Pizzo said: “I want you to hear me now. Nobody has done more to provide access to health care than Gayle Harrell. So if you know the person who put up the billboard, I’m not affecting anyone’s First Amendment rights, but you can tell them that Jason Pizzo won’t like them when he finds out who they are.”

Pizzo announced later that he had reached someone who had promised to take down the billboards.
Sen. Jim Boyd, a Republican from Bradenton, extolled Harrell for her work over the years on issues involving children, the elderly, and people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.
“There’s nobody more caring than you,” Boyd told Harrell. “An attack on you is an  attack on us. Anybody from St. Augustine or anywhere else in Florida that would put up a sign like that ought to think twice about it. It’s not fair. It’s not right. And it can’t be tolerated.”

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A legislative bill designed to help implement medical cannabis in Nebraska narrowly advanced from committee Thursday in the waning days of the 2025 session.
Legislative Bill 677, from State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, advanced 5-3 from the General Affairs Committee. It would set up a clearer state regulatory scheme for the medical cannabis system that voters overwhelmingly approved in November. Just two weeks ago, the bill failed to advance 3-5 after no committee member tried to adopt a narrowing amendment.
A new “compromise” amendment adopted Thursday passed with one major change: up to 2 ounces of cannabis flower or bud could be sold to a qualified patient or caregiver.
Smoking would not be allowed, and post-traumatic stress would not be a qualified medical condition, similar to the most recent version of LB 677 from Hansen.

The latest changes won over conservative State Sens. Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue and Stan Clouse of Kearney, who voted to advance the bill with three Democrats, State Sens. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, Dan Quick of Grand Island and Victor Rountree of Bellevue.
State Sens. Bob Andersen of north-central Sarpy County, Barry DeKay of Niobrara and Jared Storm of David City, all Republicans in the officially nonpartisan body, again opposed LB 677.
Hansen, a Republican, said Thursday’s action is the “first step of a few to move the ball forward, but instead of it being stagnant, it’s like you finally gave it a kick.” 
‘We are extremely happy’
Crista Eggers, executive director of Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana, whose son would benefit under the law, said LB 677’s advancement to the legislative floor was an “extremely huge win” for patients and advocates who have fought for more than a decade for the measure.
That timeline includes three ballot campaigns, multiple court cases and numerous legislative bills, including the most recent bill in 2021, which stalled by one vote.
“I think today we saw that the determination and the grit and the hurdles and the setbacks, they’ve all been worth it,” Eggers told reporters. “We are extremely happy.”

Hansen has said getting LB 677 passed this spring is critical to prevent the “Wild West,” as it’s unclear what would happen without state funds or clearer enacting legislation for the new Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission that voters also created. The law allows patients to possess up to 5 ounces of medical cannabis with a physician’s recommendation.
The Legislature’s budget-writing Appropriations Committee plans to provide an extra $30,000 to the Nebraska Liquor Control Commission, at the executive director’s request, to cover additional duties that his staff will jointly take on with the Medical Cannabis Commission.
The three commissioners on the Liquor Control Commission also serve on the Medical Cannabis Commission. LB 677, as amended, would explicitly allow commission staff to share resources in carrying out each group’s respective responsibilities.
‘It has to be done the right way’
Storm and Andersen again led opposition to LB 677 during a committee meeting over concerns it represented “big marijuana” and that the proposal, as advanced, essentially enables recreational marijuana, which Hansen denies.
Andersen called the latest iteration of LB 677 among the “most liberal” and asked how lawmakers could rectify LB 677 with the position of Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers that the Legislature should not act on any medical marijuana legislation. 
Holdcroft and Cavanaugh, the chair and vice chair of the General Affairs Committee, repeatedly pushed back and said they had to do something for the voters and that Hilgers’ opinion was just that, an opinion.
Part of the concern is that passing LB 677 could nullify the pending appeal to the Nebraska Supreme Court over whether the ballot measures should have been allowed to be voted on. In Lancaster County District Court, Hilgers lost.

This week, in an interview with Nebraska Public Media, Hilgers described the situation as a 60-yard or 65-yard game-winning field goal when there was “clearly” an offensive player offside or who had a false start, or some other penalty. In his analogy, Hilgers is the referee.
“It has to be done the right way or it shouldn’t count,” Hilgers said in that interview.
Holdcroft in March, questioning a representative of the AG’s Office opposing LB 677 at the bill’s public hearing, said he felt Hilgers “wants us to keep this law stupid, where he can find some loopholes in it and make it illegal.”
“The Legislature just isn’t that kind of body,” Holdcroft said at the time.
The ‘black market’
DeKay questioned whether LB 677 could lead to the “black market,” because of a patient’s immunity from possessing cannabis regardless of the source. Hansen’s bill would tax medical cannabis the same as other products — 5.5 cents per $1, prior to local sales taxes.
Cavanaugh, a lawyer, said black markets thrive on uncertainty and that if DeKay, Andersen or Storm wanted to stop that, then they should support LB 677.
“I am in favor of this because the voters voted for it, and this makes it safe, regulated and accessible,” Cavanaugh said, though he said he wished the bill also allowed PTSD as a qualifying condition.
  State Sen. Jared Storm of David City, center. March 26, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Clouse indicated that he still would have some amendments coming to the bill — the specifics of which he didn’t share. He has said he wants to allow the governor to appoint up to two more outside members in addition to the two he can already appoint. The governor also already appoints the three commissioners to the Liquor Control Commission.
Outside appointees, Clouse said, could perhaps include law enforcement or supply chain representatives. LB 677 would require at least one appointee to be a health care practitioner. Members would serve six-year terms.
Gov. Jim Pillen this week appointed Lorelle Mueting, the prevention director of Heartland Family Service, which, among other things, connects people to substance abuse treatment, and Dr. Monica Oldenburg, an anesthesiologist, to the commission. Both women opposed recent medical cannabis proposals in Nebraska, Oldenburg in 2019 and Mueting in March.
The General Affairs Committee will host hearings on the appointments this session.
At one point during the sometimes contentious afternoon meeting, Holdcroft said he wasn’t going to convince Andersen or Storm and called the vote. Holdcroft said the full Legislature deserved to be able to debate LB 677, with a chance of passage.
Other changes to the bill
Other changes advanced as part of the amended LB 677, from what voters decided in November, include limiting a qualified “health care practitioner” to licensed physicians, osteopathic physicians, physician assistants or nurse practitioners and practitioners. Medical providers could not recommend cannabis unless they have treated the patient for at least six months or if the provider primarily practices in Nebraska.
Currently, a provider just has to be licensed anywhere in the country and follow the law to write a recommendation.
Under existing statute, which has been the case since December, Nebraskans can use medical cannabis with a doctor’s recommendation for any ailment.

The amendment would limit “qualifying medical conditions” to 15 ailments, similar to a list drafted by former State Sen. Anna Wishart of Lincoln with the Nebraska Medical Association on a previous bill:

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
Autism with frequent self-injurious or aggressive behavior.
Cancer.
Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis.
Epilepsy or epileptic seizures.
Hepatitis C that causes moderate to severe nausea or cachexia.
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).
Huntington’s disease.
Parkinson’s disease.
Spinal cord injury or disease with residual neurologic deficits.
Terminal illness with a probable life expectancy of under one year.
Tourette’s syndrome.
A serious medical condition or related treatment that causes severe nausea or cachexia.
Severe and persistent muscle spasms caused by multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury or muscular dystrophy.
Severe or chronic pain lasting longer than six months that is not adequately managed, in the opinion of a health care practitioner, despite treatment attempts using either conventional medications other than opioids or opiates or physical interventions.

Acceptable forms of cannabis would include edibles, concentrates, ointments, transdermal patches or creams, nebulizers and vaporizer cartridges or pens. Products intended for smoking, such as bongs or joints, could not be sold.
Andersen and Storm said Nebraskans would just buy the flower or bud and make joints, which Cavanaugh and Holdcroft said would not be permitted.
The path ahead
Eggers, Hansen and Holdcroft all noted the path ahead wouldn’t be easy, with Eggers describing it as a “huge journey” and Holdcroft saying he anticipated an “uphill battle.”
Hansen said that it was still too early to tell whether he could get 33 votes and pass the bill over the finish line. That’s the minimum amount of votes needed under the Nebraska Constitution to amend a state law enacted by voters, regardless of a promised filibuster. Unlike other ballot measures this spring, supporters asked for companion legislation to beef up the proposal.

Holdcroft said he would argue in favor of the measure but would “reserve” his vote to see how the debate goes.
This Saturday in La Vista, Sunday in Omaha and Monday in Lincoln, Holdcroft, Hansen and Cavanaugh will host public forums for the public to weigh in on medical cannabis. Eggers said Thursday also represented that senators were listening to voters on this issue and encouraged any Nebraskans to get engaged.
Much of the next two weeks will be consumed by debate on the state budget. LB 677 is expected to be debated to its maximum debate limit across three stages of debate, lasting a combined 13 hours, leaving a tight timeline for LB 677 to become law.
The bill would need to pass by June 2, in case it is vetoed by the governor, who has so far declined to weigh in on the bill but has joined Hilgers in saying the two have reservations.
Hansen noted Hilgers’ opposition is nothing new but that Hilgers, a former state senator and speaker of the Legislature, is a friend whom he trusts on many things. 
“This is just one thing we differ on,” Hansen told the Nebraska Examiner.
Hansen continued: “I think he might know the legalities more than I do, but I know what the people want and what they deserve and what they voted for. We kind of have to meld those two things together somehow.”

(Photo by Eric Thayer/Getty Images)After being temporarily barred from deporting four international students at the University of Iowa who are suing the Department of Homeland Security for revoking their status as students, the agency is now contesting the students’ wish to remain anonymous.
The students’ lawsuit, filed last month in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, identifies the plaintiffs only as John Doe No. 1 through 4.
According to the lawsuit, each of the plaintiffs was admitted to the United States on an F-1 student visa. In their lawsuit, the plaintiffs claim the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has violated their due process rights by terminating their student status without legal justification or explanation.
Named as defendants in the case are Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, of which Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, is a part. Also named as a defendant is Acting Director of ICE Todd Lyons.
On April 25, U.S. District Court Judge Rebecca Goodgame Ebinger granted the students’ request for a temporary restraining order, blocking any efforts at deportation. Ebinger concluded the students had “demonstrated a likelihood of success” as to their legal claims and had also shown they could otherwise be subjected to irreparable harm.
The judge noted there had been no suggestion that any of the recognized, lawful reasons for terminating the plaintiffs’ status as students — such as providing false information to the government, engaging in unauthorized employment, or failing to engage in an approved course of study — appeared to exist or were even argued by Homeland Security as a justification for its actions.
“In the overwhelming majority of recent, similar cases, district courts have found orders for temporary relief appropriate,” Ebinger ruled.
In granting the order before the federal government had a chance to argue against it, Ebinger stated the students had been notified that their deportation “could occur at any moment without time permitted to secure possessions or conclude affairs.”
Order bars Noem from pursuing deportation
The judge’s April 25 order instructs Noem and Lyons to restore the plaintiffs’ status as students and further instructs them that they “shall not arrest, detain, or transfer plaintiffs John Doe No. 1, John Doe No. 2, John Doe No. 3, or John Doe No. 4 out of this court’s jurisdiction, or order the arrest, detention or transfer of plaintiffs out of this court’s jurisdiction, without first providing adequate notice to both this court and the plaintiffs’ counsel.”
In a motion filed April 28, U.S. Department of Justice lawyers for Homeland Security argued the case should not be allowed to proceed with the student plaintiffs identified only by pseudonyms — in part because, as a practical matter, the government needed the identifying information not only to defend the case but to comply with the court’s temporary restraining order blocking deportation of the four students.
According to the response filed two days later by the students’ attorneys, the government was informed on April 29 of the students’ identities. However, they argued, the names of the students should not be disclosed to the general public. Such disclosure, they say, would put the students “at risk for harassment, retaliation, detention, and deportation by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.”
They are now asking the court to let the case proceed under pseudonyms and to also issue a protective order regarding Homeland Security’s use of the students’ personal information.
They argue that while the federal government tries to “downplay the level of retaliation, harassment, and government enforcement” the students might face if their names were revealed to the general public, the students “fear public retaliation, given this hotly contested and socially charged issue … This fear is fueled by emails from the Department of State (giving) each plaintiff warning they could be immediately arrested, detained and deported — and could even be deported to some third country, rather than their home country.”
A hearing on the students’ motion for a preliminary injunction is now scheduled for Monday, May 5.
Students: Homeland Security has sparked ‘chaos’ 
Since beginning their studies, the lawsuit claims, the plaintiffs have maintained their status as students, are in good academic standing and have not committed any serious criminal offenses. Three of the four are studying chemical engineering, economics or exercise science, while the fourth is working for the State of Iowa as an epidemiologist.
The lawsuit claims that on April 10, 2025, ICE abruptly canceled, without explanation, the plaintiffs’ status as students within DHS’ Student and Exchange Visitor Information Systems database. The same day, the plaintiffs each received emails from the University of Iowa’s International Students and Scholars Services informing them of the cancellation and the fact that the university was not responsible for the action.
Four days later, the lawsuit claims, three of the plaintiffs’ visas were revoked without explanation. The three each received identical messages from U.S. embassies, warning them that “remaining in the United States can result in fines, detention, and/or deportation,” and adding that “deportation can take place at a time that does not allow the person being deported to secure possessions or conclude affairs in the United States. Persons being deported may be sent to countries other than their countries of origin.”
The lawsuit claims Homeland Security’s “lack of transparency and procedural safeguards created chaos within educational institutions and upended the lives of lawful F-1 visa holders.”
The lawsuit emphasizes that the plaintiffs are not challenging the revocation of their F-1 student visas but are instead challenging DHS’ termination of their student status to create a “pretext for future adverse immigration actions against them.”
The terminations are without legal justification, have violated constitutional guarantees of procedural due process, violate DHS’s own regulations and policies, and are “far beyond DHS’ statutory authority,” the lawsuit claims.
The plaintiffs are represented by University of Iowa law student practitioners under the direct supervision of Katherine Melloy Goettel, clinical associate professor at the university’s College of Law.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/noemjan172025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-01 19:10:38.225703

Read this story in English.
Los Demócratas de Connecticut han recorrido el estado durante los últimos meses para advertir a los residentes sobre los posibles efectos devastadores de los inminentes recortes federales a Medicaid.
Medicaid es el plan de salud más grande del país y cubre a más de 70 millones de estadounidenses. Conocido como HUSKY en Connecticut, Medicaid cubre a aproximadamente un millón de personas en el estado, según el Departamento de Servicios Sociales, lo que equivale a aproximadamente el 25% de la población.
Los estados dependen en gran medida del gobierno federal para financiar el programa. La Oficina de Políticas y Gestión del estado proyecta que Connecticut gastará un total de $11.6 mil millones en Medicaid este año fiscal. El gobierno federal aportó aproximadamente $6.9 mil millones, o el 59%, de esa financiación.
Los Demócratas de todo el país están alertando de que las prioridades presupuestarias de la administración Trump amenazarán la financiación federal, crucial para Medicaid. Ambas cámaras del Congreso de EE.UU. aprobaron recientemente una medida elaborada por los Republicanos que instruye al Comité de Energía y Comercio de la Cámara de Representantes a recortar $880 mil millones en gastos.
La resolución no ordena al Comité recortar Medicaid específicamente, y el presidente Donald J. Trump ha insistido en que su administración no recortará el programa. Sin embargo, según el gasto que maneja el Comité, es probable que Medicaid deba formar parte de la ecuación, lo que podría resultar en reducciones en el acceso para los afiliados.
Esto es lo que necesita saber.
¿Qué implicarán los recortes para los proveedores y los pacientes?
Medicaid cubre todo tipo de servicios para sus afiliados, incluyendo servicios médicos y de salud conductual, tratamiento por abuso de sustancias, así como atención domiciliaria y en residencias de ancianos para personas mayores y personas con discapacidad. Es poco probable que se conozcan todos los detalles de cómo se implementarán los recortes a Medicaid hasta el verano, cuando se espera que el Congreso vote el presupuesto final para el año fiscal 2026.
“Hay todo tipo de rumores circulando sobre cómo implementarían [los recortes]. Todas son malas”, declaró el Representante Estadounidense Joe Courtney, Demócrata por el Segundo Distrito, durante una conferencia de prensa en Hartford a principios de este mes.
Los proveedores ya se están preparando para los cambios, advirtiendo que podrían tener que reducir sus servicios si se aprueban los recortes.
Glenn Connan, director financiero del Consejo sobre Alcoholismo del Medio Oeste de Connecticut, un proveedor de tratamiento por el abuso de sustancias en Danbury, expresó su preocupación por que su organización tenga que cerrar algunas de sus clínicas, a pesar del aumento de la demanda de servicios.
“Si hay más recortes a Medicaid, tendremos que empezar a cerrar algunas de esas siete clínicas ambulatorias y solo tener quizás tres”, declaró Connan a los funcionarios electos durante un evento a principios de este mes en Danbury, centrado en posibles recortes a Medicaid. “Eso perjudicará a la gente de esas comunidades”. 
Jeffrey Shenberger, jefe de la división de neonatología del Connecticut Children’s Medical Center, afirmó que los recortes a Medicaid afectarían a algunos de sus pacientes más vulnerables: los bebés en la Unidad de Cuidados Intensivos Neonatales (NICU).
“Los recortes implicarían una reducción de recursos en el proceso de atención aguda en la NICU. Y afectarían a todas las familias y a todos los niños, independientemente de si pagan de forma privada, por cuenta propia o a través de Medicaid”, declaró Shenberger a los asistentes durante una conferencia de prensa celebrada en abril en el Connecticut Children’s Medical Center de Hartford.
Medicaid cubre aproximadamente el 40% de los nacimientos en Connecticut, según la organización de políticas sanitarias Kaiser Family Foundation.
¿Cómo afectarían los recortes a Medicaid a las finanzas estatales?
La administración del Gobernador Ned Lamont está analizando las implicaciones de los recortes a Medicaid para el presupuesto estatal. Si bien no está claro cómo recortaría el gasto el gobierno federal, el impacto de todos los recortes que el Congreso está considerando supondría una enorme presión para las finanzas estatales.
Actualmente, el gobierno federal cubre al menos el 50% de todos los costos de Medicaid del estado. Sin embargo, el Congreso podría optar por ofrecer una cantidad fija por cada afiliado a Medicaid, independientemente de cuántos o qué tipo de servicios utilice. En este escenario, Connecticut perdería 1,350 millones de dólares en los próximos siete años, o un promedio de 193 millones de dólares al año, según el Departamento de Servicios Sociales.
El gobierno federal también podría reducir o abandonar la garantía actual de que Washington reembolse al menos el 50% de los costos de Medicaid de todos los estados. En ese caso, Connecticut podría perder hasta la asombrosa cifra de 3,500 millones de dólares en reembolsos federales, según estimaciones del Departamento de Servicios Sociales. Esta financiación representa poco más de la mitad de los reembolsos federales proyectados que Connecticut recibió este año fiscal.
Las autoridades han dicho que es demasiado pronto para centrarse en cómo el estado podría recortar Medicaid en un escenario desastroso. Sin embargo, Connecticut ofrece beneficios que no son obligatorios para que los estados participen en Medicaid. Estos incluyen cobertura dental y farmacéutica, y atención domiciliaria para pacientes mayores.
La Senadora Cathy Osten, Demócrata por Sprague, copresidenta del Comité de Asignaciones de la Asamblea General, declaró al Connecticut Mirror que no está dispuesta a aceptar ningún recorte.
“No estamos presuponiendo… en un programa tan importante como Medicaid”, dijo Osten. “No vamos a empezar a considerar recortes a programas que mantienen vivas a las personas, y eso es lo que hace Medicaid”.

Kay Ivey Thursday signed a bill sponosred by Coleman extending presumptive MEdicaid eligibility to expectant mothers. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector_Gov. Kay Ivey signed a bill Thursday increasing access to Medicaid coverage for expectant mothers in Alabama.
SB 102, sponsored by Sen. Linda Coleman-Madison, D-Birmingham, would provide “presumptive eligibility” for pregnant women by allowing health care providers to determine eligibility for Medicaid based on preliminary information. The process is aimed at expediting access to prenatal care by allowing eligible women to receive Medicaid coverage and necessary medical services within the first trimester.
A spokesperson for the governor confirmed the bill was signed Thursday but did not provide further comment.

The legislation explicitly states that a pregnant woman can only receive one 60-day presumptive eligibility period per pregnancy. The Medicaid Agency is prohibited from retroactively denying coverage during the presumptive eligibility period due to the woman’s failure to submit a formal application or a negative decision on her application.
The provider must notify the Medicaid agency within five working days of determining a woman’s presumptive eligibility. They are also required to inform the woman that she must apply to the agency for Medicaid by the end of the following month.
This legislation is set to be repealed in October 2028.
Robyn Hyden, executive director of Alabama Arise, said in a statement that the new law has the potential to “save lives and money.”
“For too long, Alabama mothers have faced needless barriers to early prenatal care – care that can mean the difference between hope and heartbreak. SB 102 will lift some of those red-tape barriers at last,” Hyden said.
A’Niya Robinson, ACLU of Alabama’s Director of Policy and Organizing, said that ACLU is “pleased with the passage of the Alabama Maternal Healthcare Act” but acknowledged that the legislation will not entirely resolve the state’s maternal and infant mortality challenges.
“While this law will not end the maternal and infant mortality crisis in Alabama, we believe that it does have the potential to save lives and lessen the burden for pregnant people to access prenatal care early in pregnancy. As part of our reproductive justice work, we will continue working on policies to make Alabama safer for those experiencing pregnancy,” Robinson said in a statement.

Free.,Trump shifts Waltz out of national security adviser post after Signalgate flap,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-shifts-waltz-out-national-security-adviser-post-after-signalgate-flap,,"WASHINGTON — Mike Waltz, a former Florida congressman who became known for sharing U.S. plans to strike Yemen on a Signal group chat, was out as White House national security adviser on Thursday.President Donald Trump announced he will instead nominate Waltz to be the next U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, a position that requires U.S. Senate confirmation.“From his time in uniform on the battlefield, in Congress and, as my National Security Advisor, Mike Waltz has worked hard to put our Nation’s Interests first. I know he will do the same in his new role,” Trump wrote on his social media site, Truth Social.Secretary of State Marco Rubio, a former U.S. senator from Florida, will step into the role of national security adviser, according to Trump.“Together, we will continue to fight tirelessly to Make America, and the World, SAFE AGAIN. Thank you for your attention to this matter!” the president wrote.Strikes on Houthi rebelsWaltz’s apparent ouster from the National Security Council occurred five weeks after what became known as Signalgate.The Atlantic magazine’s editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, revealed Waltz had invited him, presumably by mistake, to a group chat of high-level officials that included Vice President J.D. Vance, discussing specific plans for strikes on Houthi rebels in Yemen.Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other Cabinet members denied that any classified information was shared in the chat on the commercially available app Signal, prompting Goldberg to release the chat transcript that detailed specific times and locations of the military strikes ahead of their scheduled launch.In the group chat on March 15, Waltz wrote “amazing job,” minutes after missiles landed, followed by emojis for a fist, an American flag and fire, according to Goldberg, who watched the Signal group messages in real time minutes before news of U.S. bombs in Yemen became public.The New York Times has since revealed that Hegseth shared details about the same Yemen strikes in a separate Signal group chat that included his wife, brother and personal lawyer. Hegseth has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.When contacted for details surrounding Waltz’s departure from the NSC, the White House directed States Newsroom to the president’s Truth Social account.Senate confirmation votes aheadWaltz will now face hearings and votes before senators for a post that Trump originally designated for New York U.S. Rep. Elise Stefanik. Stefanik withdrew from the running to remain among the House Republican ranks as insurance against the party’s razor-thin margin.Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, the top Democrat on the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, characterized Waltz’s exit as an “abrupt dismissal” that is “further proof of the chaos and incompetence that has reigned over President Trump’s White House and national security team during his first 100 days in office.”“The stunning amount of turnover of senior staff at both the National Security Council and at the Pentagon is alarming. Purges of senior military officers, mass firings of top career officials for perceived political disloyalty and the illegal dismantling of America’s foreign policy institutions only hurts our security and signals weakness to our foes,” Shaheen, of New Hampshire, said in a statement Thursday, while calling for accountability for those sharing information on unsecured channels.Shaheen further added, “We should remember that it was Secretary Hegseth who initially shared this material and did so a second time with his family. He too must be held accountable.”",,,,2025-05-01 18:06:20.829850

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Protesters took to the streets Thursday to air their grievances with the Trump administration in a nationwide day of rallies timed to coincide with May Day, a day meant to honor the labor movement and workers’ rights.
In Trenton, one of at least a dozen protests around New Jersey, the protest signs bobbing in the blue skies addressed everything from tariffs to climate change and immigration to national parks. With less than six weeks until New Jersey’s primaries, though, it didn’t take long for protesters to coalesce around one message — vote.
Activist Michelle Marcella-Morales led the crowd in a chant of “June 10th!” to remind protesters when to go cast their primary votes.
“We are the many, they are the few. And since we’re all pretty pissed and we outnumber them, we need to replace them! Make midterms the new mandate!” she shouted. “We have one major stab at this. They want smaller government. We want stable government. New Jersey, we have to save the Constitution, our democracy, and sickly enough, it falls squarely on our shoulders to save the world.”
Rally speakers included labor leaders, a state senator and activists, and drew a crowd that packed the plaza across from the Statehouse.
Lisa Saladino of Parsippany showed up dressed in a Ruth Bader Ginsberg collar and robe. She lamented the Trump administration’s recent attacks on judges, as well as President Donald Trump’s right-leaning judicial appointees.
“She was someone who fought for our rights, and we need more people like her in the Supreme Court,” Saladino said of the late, liberal U.S. Supreme Court justice. “We need the Supreme Court to remember they’re here for us and to uphold the Constitution. We are all going to lose our rights, and I just can’t sit back and watch it happen.”
State Sen. Andrew Zwicker (D-Middlesex) stopped by the protest after the Senate’s budget and appropriations committee, on which he serves, heard testimony about higher education funding in New Jersey. He warned the crowd that Trump and Elon Musk, Trump’s billionaire friend who’s overseeing federal cost-cutting, “are doing everything they can to dismantle higher education.”
“Why? Because if you want to go after democracy, what do you do? You go after education, you go after freedom of speech, you go after freedom of expression, you go after the ability to come together and protest,” Zwicker said. “We will not stand for that, not today, not tomorrow, and not ever.”
Several more May Day protests are planned in New Jersey through the weekend.

The offer was announced by the office of Rhode Island General Treasurer James Diossa Thursday in partnership with the Rhode Island Association for the Education of Young Children. 
“When we talk about giving kids the best start, it’s not just about those first steps — it’s about building a future full of opportunity and support,” Diossa said in a statement. 
An account must be opened on the CollegeBound Saver website with the promo code 529Day to receive the promotion. An account takes about 10 minutes to set up, according to the website. 
CollegeBound Saver is Rhode Island’s iteration of a 529 plan, which is intended to boost families’ savings for future education costs for children or other beneficiaries. Rhode Island plan assets grow tax-deferred and withdrawals are tax free when used for higher education costs. Savings can be put toward expenses at any accredited university or college in the U.S. or abroad. They can also be used for trade and vocational schools and registered apprenticeship programs. 
Last year, Diossa’s office participated in 529 Day, the national celebration of 529 plans, and deposited $300 contributions into new CollegeBound Saver accounts through a partnership with the Rhode Island Foundation and the Office of the Postsecondary Commissioner. That promotion lasted for 24 hours and kids ages 3 through 7 were eligible.

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)More than a month after losing nearly $1 million in federal funding, the University of Iowa International Writing Program is working toward a more hopeful future with outside donations and exploration of new programs, its director said.
The UI announced Thursday in a news release the writing program has received a $250,000 donation from Florida investor and lawyer Hugh Culverhouse Jr., alongside a challenge from the donor to see other supporters of the program match his gift.
“I am so very grateful to Mr. Culverhouse for giving us the chance to build a bridge to a sustainable future,” said International Writing Program Director Christopher Merrill in the release. “We look forward not only to welcoming a larger than planned cohort of distinguished poets and writers to our Fall Residency, but to exploring new ways of understanding what their role may be in our changing world.”

The program learned in February grants it received from the U.S. Department of State through the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs were canceled, causing the shutdown of summer programming and cutting the size of its fall residency in half.
Merrill said in an interview the process of choosing participants for the 11-week fall residency, the program’s main offering, had already begun, and staff at the time were waiting for the State Department to send information about nominations to consulates and embassies across the globe.
This step was not completed weeks after it was supposed to be, Merrill said, giving him an inkling of what was to come.
“We could read the writing on the wall,” Merrill said.
When the news first broke, Merrill said program staff were hoping to fund, at most, 15 participants for the fall residency program. With the donation, that number has increased to as many as 25, bringing the residency back to its usual capacity.
Summer programming for international high school students is still discontinued, Merrill said. Recruiting and nominations for that program had already been completed by the time the news of funding losses came.
He hopes to keep funding an initiative that sets up program alumni as mentors for young writers in their home country. Groups set up in Ukraine and Myanmar have been successful, he said, as well as in Afghanistan, where the alum has provided “a kind of lifeline” to young women writers not allowed to go to school. Virtual programming will also continue.
If he can figure out a new way to recruit and work with the 53 UNESCO Cities of Literature, of which Iowa City is one, Merrill said he’d like to plan a symposium for program graduates and others with a focus on what the role is of literary residencies and writers during these challenging times.
“We’ve got some support from the university to give us a couple of years to figure out a way to a sustainable future, and with this gift from Mr. Culverhouse and his challenge to other supporters to try to match the gift, that gives us the breathing room to try to come up with what we hope will be a model that will survive,” Merrill said.
From the moment President Donald Trump was elected, Merrill said he knew things would get complicated with the International Writing Program, and questions started flooding in after the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, started looking for areas to cut in the U.S. government.
In speaking with U.S. officials and working to prove the program’s necessity, Merrill said it became clear to him that the program’s operations were exactly the opposite of what the Trump administration was interested in supporting. That was proven by the funding termination letter, which stated the program no longer aligned with national interests. Merrill said the news was “a bit hard to stomach,” as the partnership between the UI program and U.S. Department of State was almost 60 years old.
Another program Merrill knew of that saw cuts was Battery Dance Corporation, which at that point had purchased tickets and otherwise paid for a trip to Beijing to perform, he said. The company had received $69,000 to perform in Wuhan, China, as part of a public diplomacy program, Iowa Capital Dispatch reported.
“These are prized cultural diplomacy programs that give a different picture of the U.S. abroad, and they’re just unbelievably inexpensive to put together,” Merrill said. “But there we go, let’s just make as many enemies as we can. Seems to be the defining feature of this administration.”

SPRINGFIELD — Illinois State Police released preliminary toxicology results that showed no drugs or alcohol in the system of a driver who crashed into a central Illinois after-school program, killing four young girls.

Illinois State Police Director Brendan Kelly said Thursday police are still investigating the cause of the crash but found one possible explanation.

“Some evidence has been developed indicating the possibility of a medical emergency leading to the crash,” Kelly said at a Springfield news conference. “However, the investigation of this information and other evidence has not yet concluded, and we will continue until all leads and research has been exhausted.”

Marianne Akers, 44, of Chatham, was the driver and only occupant of a Jeep that on Monday struck a building that housed the YNOT Camp, which stands for Youth Needing Other Things, an after-school camp in Chatham.

Those killed were Ainsley Johnson, 8; Kathryn Corley, 7; Alma Buhnerkempe, 7, all of Chatham, and counselor Rylee Britton, 18, of Springfield. All the victims died from blunt force trauma.

Six other children were injured at the scene and hospitalized. Two have since been released.

Akers was not injured in the crash and was taken to the hospital for evaluation. Kelly said she provided blood and urine specimens at that time.

He confirmed that toxicology screenings came back negative for all forms of alcohol including ethanol, isopropanol, methanol, and all substances including benzodiazepine, amphetamines, cocaine, opiates, cannabinoids, and phencyclidine.

The news release ISP published Tuesday said the incident did “not appear to be a targeted attack.” During the news conference Thursday, Kelly confirmed that statement.

“If you think about that terminology, a targeted attack, it implies a certain intent or some specific motive, or a link of some type, a nexus between the person, in this case, the driver, and that location,” he said. “And there's just no evidence of that that would indicate that this was something intended as some type of mass violence or terrorist attack, or something along those natures. There’s absolutely nothing to indicate that whatsoever.”

Although he would not confirm how fast Akers’ car was traveling at the time of impact, Kelly said her car covered over 1,300 feet “pre- and post-impact” — information ISP obtained using photography, drones, videos, diagrams and other information when investigating at the scene.

Kelly said ISP released Akers’ name a day after the accident because it was “already out there,” and that confirming her name did not provide any information that hadn’t already been publicly confirmed.

“We offer our sincere and heartfelt condolences to the family, friends and Chatham community during this difficult time now,” Kelly said before asking reporters gathered at the news conference to observe a moment of silence for the victims and survivors.

Chatham schools were closed through Friday.

This proved to be the case: The House sent the compromise to the governor’s desk with a vote of 73-32. No Democrats voted for it. Three Republicans voted against it.
SC House and Senate reach compromise on K-12 vouchers

Gov. Henry McMaster is expected to quickly sign the bill into law.
The issue was a top priority for Republican leadership after the state Supreme Court struck down private tuition payments last September as unconstitutional.
Private donors have been paying tuition for roughly 800 students since then.
In the coming school year, the bill would provide scholarships to up to 10,000 students whose families make up to 300% of the federal poverty level.
Eligibility would increase in 2026-2027 to 15,000 students living in households with incomes up to 500% of the federal poverty level. For a family of four, that would be nearly $161,000 under 2025 guidelines.
Students who are in public school and whose families make less than 300% of the federal poverty level would get priority in receiving the scholarships through early application windows.
While the compromise doesn’t create universal school choice like the version the House passed, it does leave the door open for legislators to put more money into the program if more than 15,000 students apply.
“Providing parents with more options for educating their children is in the best interest of our students, parents and the state of South Carolina,” said House Education Chairwoman Shannon Erickson, R-Beaufort.
Ultimately, the state Supreme Court will decide if the law takes effect.
The bill is almost certain to bring another legal challenge. In a statement soon after the bill passed, the South Carolina Education Association called the bill unconstitutional. The teachers’ advocacy group filed the last lawsuit that led to last fall’s ruling.
“Diverting these funds from the many for the benefit of a few, by whatever means, undermines our public schools and threatens the quality of education that is vital for all South Carolinians,” the statement read. “Our children deserve better.”
Supporters of the bill are hopeful that drawing from a different revenue source or sending the money through a trustee hired by the state superintendent will make this version constitutional.
That combines ideas from the House, which instituted the idea of a trustee, and the Senate, which wanted to pull from state lottery revenue. The final compromise leaves it for legislators to decide whether to take the money from lottery profits or the state’s general fund.
“We listened, we learned, we took both sides of the (Supreme Court) opinion, and we sat down and wrote what we thought was the best solution,” Erickson said.
Opponents weren’t convinced.
Regardless of the specific source, the money is still public, said Rep. Kambrell Garvin. The state constitution bars public money from directly benefitting private schools.
“It’s a bad idea because it is clearly unconstitutional,” the Columbia Democrat said.
Lottery profits are primarily used to pay for scholarships to colleges — both public and private. High school graduates earning the academic-based scholarships can use them at the South Carolina college of their choice.
Supporters in the Senate argued scholarships for private K-12 schools should be legal too.
Garvin, who spent three years as a school teacher, questioned whether using lottery profits for K-12 scholarships could reduce funding available for college scholarships. That would require legislators to dip into the general fund to provide all the scholarships they qualify for by law.
“I think what will happen is that we’re going to bite off more than we can chew,” Garvin said.
Democrats saw the bill as a step toward universal school choice, which would allow every student in the state to access the money, regardless of income level. The 500% poverty level already incorporates most families in South Carolina, including parents already paying for private schools, House Democrats said.
Garvin also pointed to what opponents say is a lack of accountability over the program. Private schools don’t have the same oversight as public schools, meaning the state will have little control over the quality of education students receive once they use the money, he said.
That could lead to any number of issues for students, he said.
“We are opening Pandora’s Box,” Garvin said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/DSC_0761-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-01 18:06:20.829850

“Green up day just naturally fits into our tradition. It's the way we're built, and I think it's a great example of what Vermont's all about,” Gov. Phil Scott said during a Wednesday press conference.

But this year comes with a twist. In an effort to attract even more volunteers, this year’s Green Up Day will have a Kentucky Derby theme. After picking up trash, volunteers have the option to participate in a Kentucky Derby-inspired hat contest, see live music and receive food and drink deals at breweries and bars throughout the state.Green Up Vermont Executive Director Kate Alberghini said the number of cleanup participants has steadily grown since she joined the nonprofit in 2019.Despite lower turnout during the Covid-19 pandemic, Green Up Day saw a 30% increase in volunteers from 2023 to 2024, which she credits to a successful campaign the organization ran that year to beat the Guinness World Record for the most pledges to pick up trash in a 24 hour period. The annual spring cleanup tradition started on April 18, 1970 — one week before the first-ever Earth Day. Interstate highways closed from 9 a.m. to noon so more than 70,000 volunteers could pick up trash to “green up” the state.READ MORE
A group of concerned citizens banded together in 1979 to create a nonprofit based on this annual day of stewardship, and since then, the organization — now called Green Up Vermont — has led efforts to expand the reach of Green Up Day.Last year’s Green Up Day eliminated more than 404 tons of trash around Vermont, according to the organization’s website. However, Alberghini said the work extends beyond just one day. The rest of the year, Green Up Vermont works to educate Vermonters about waste reduction, she said. “I would like nothing more than to work myself out of a job, but the reality is that there’s too much waste,” Alberghini said.On Wednesday, students at U-32 Middle and High School gathered at Gov. Phil Scott’s weekly press conference, held on the school’s campus in partnership with Green Up Vermont, where they asked questions about this year’s Green Up Day and voiced concerns about climate change.“As a young person, I feel very uncertain about my future, and I’ve spoken with other youth who feel the same. We want to know that lawmakers are hearing the youth’s voice and doing their best to create a sustainable world for us to inherit,” said Ella Thomas, an 11th grader at U-32 and winner of this year’s Green Up Day poster contest.Gov.

He said Vermont’s climate policy is too aggressive and creates conflict.“What we need to do is bring everybody along because I believe climate change is real,” he said. “We have to address it, but we all need to be on the same page.”Scott pointed to Green Up Day as an opportunity to engage in a community effort to reduce waste, emphasizing the importance of Green Up Day to the state’s environmentally conscious culture.“Green Up Day just naturally fits into our tradition,” Scott said. “It’s the way we’re built, and I think it’s a great example of what Vermont’s all about.”To volunteer this Saturday, Vermonters can visit the Green Up Vermont website to find their town’s event details.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Green Up Day celebrates 55 years in Vermont.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picking-Up-Trash-Green-scaled.jpeg?fit=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-01 18:06:20.829850

Green International Airport on Nov. 1, 2024, between 5:01 and 5:35 a.m. (Courtesy photo from the Rhode Island Airport Corporation)State airport officials claim the wait for passengers to get through the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) checkpoint at Rhode Island T.F. Green International Airport is taking too long, and they might have a solution: Replace the federal officers with private security workers.
The Rhode Island Airport Corporation (RIAC) filed a petition on April 25 to join the TSA’s Screening Partnership Program, which allows use of private screening contractors for airport security. Airport spokesperson Bill Fischer confirmed the application after the move was first reported by WPRI-12 Tuesday.
A copy of the petition was not immediately made available.
Fischer said the recommendation came from Virginia-based consultant Studdiford Technical Solutions after RIAC hired the firm last November to analyze increasing passenger numbers and “unusually long checkpoint lines” officials noticed the month prior.
“We have in fact seen unacceptable and increased lines and wait times that have become a concern for the board and management team,” Fischer said in a statement. “In anticipation of sustained higher passenger volumes, we feel it is important to evaluate every option.”
Fischer said airport officials are only exploring the option and have not made any final decision on the matter. Even if the TSA were to approve the petition, Fischer said the federal agency would retain oversight and continue to set security standards at T.F. Green.
‘That’s not a reason to privatize’
The head of the union representing New England’s TSA officers called RIAC’s justification for pursuing the possibility of privatizing screening “ridiculous.”
“That’s not a reason to privatize,” Mike Gayzagian, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 2617 headquartered in Boston, said in an interview. “Wait times are fluid.”
Since the start of 2025, TSA spokesperson Daniel Velez said 100% of all standard lane screenings at T.F. Green remained under the agency’s projected peak wait of half an hour. 
The longest wait time in the last month was at 27 minutes, according to TSA data obtained by Rhode Island Current. The average maximum wait travelers experienced in April was 10 minutes. Travelers who used TSA Precheck had an average maximum wait time of five minutes last month.
The average wait time nationally is just over four-and-a-half minutes and a little more than two minutes for those who’ve pre-checked. 
TSA tracks the data by handing a yellow card to the last passenger in line at the top, middle and bottom of the hour. Those passengers hold the card until they get up to an airport’s X-ray, Velez explained in an email Thursday. An officer will then add all of the time up and average out the wait time for that hour.
Federal officers may also use closed-circuit television to track how long passengers wait to be screened.
Velez said travels may see long wait times due to rescheduled flights or staffing shortages. T.F. Green has roughly TSA 170 officers, but Velez declined to state how many vacancies there are citing security reasons.
“We work closely with our airport and airline partners to be able to project the busiest times of the day and make sure we are prepared,” Velez said in an emailed statement.
Fischer acknowledged TSA has worked out some of the performance issues and that wait times in April have improved quite significantly. 
“We will continue to monitor this situation and make recommendations that are in the best interest of our passengers,” he said in an email.

Objections from congressional delegates
So far, half of Rhode Island’s congressional delegation has expressed opposition to RIAC’s privatization proposal.
U.S. Rep. Seth Magaziner, whose congressional district includes the Warwick airport, said he has concerns about shifting duties away from the TSA.
“Privatizing security services at T.F. Green is not in the best interest of Rhode Island travelers or local workers who keep the airport safe and running smoothly,” Magaziner said in a statement to Rhode Island Current. “As a frequent traveler at T.F. Green I see no apparent need to make such a change.” 
U.S. Sen. Jack Reed said  privatizing TSA duties could undermine safety and staffing at T.F. Green.
“We are fortunate to have a great airport, but the idea of privatization strikes me as the wrong approach,” he said in a statement. “I worked to ensure the airport got technology upgrades to make the security process more efficient and I also provide oversight to ensure TSA is accountable and reimburses the airport as needed.”
The TSA has 60 days to review RIAC’s petition to privatize screening duties. If approved, Fischer said existing transportation security officers would have the option to apply to be a screener under whatever private security firm airport officials would contract.
But Gayzagian said going private can come with a lesser salary and fewer benefits. TSA officers can make between $65,000 and $70,000 a year with a benefits package of health, dental and vision, and life insurance.
“Who do they expect to come to take those jobs?” Gayzagian said.
Gayzagian also claimed that privatized officers would have fewer worker protections compared to their federal counterparts.Fischer said that contracted screeners at other airports that have chosen to privatize TSA duties have unionized. 
Sure, worker organization is possible, Gayzagian said. 
“They’d have to start from scratch,” he added.
5% of U.S. commercial airports in program
TSA screens passengers at more than 430 federalized, commercial airports nationwide. Twenty-one airports, including Kansas City, Orlando and San Francisco have opted into the TSA Screening Partnership Program. The only New England airport participating is Portsmouth International Airport in New Hampshire, which joined in 2014.
TSA officers continue to run checkpoints at Bradley International Airport in Connecticut and Boston Logan International Airport, where Massport spokesperson Benjamin Crawley said there are no intentions at this time to privatize.
“We have a great relationship with our TSA partners,” Crawley said in an email. 
RIAC’s decision to explore privatization comes after rumors that airport officials sought to privatize its police force rather than hire sworn officers. Airport officials signed a five-year contract last October with Illinois-based Andy Frain Services for $5.5 million to provide workers who would inspect security badges, inspect vehicles entering restricted areas, and manage traffic outside the terminal. 
Fischer reiterated that RIAC has no plans to replace its police or fire departments with private contractors.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)As Utah leaders look more toward energy innovation and creating an abundance of supply, the state faces declining coal operations.
Last year there were five operational coal mines in the state, the fewest in its 150-year-old coal history, according to a new Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute research brief on Utah’s energy sector, part of the institute’s economic report to the governor. 
While the opening of the Fossil Rock mine, located in Emery County brought a slight increase in coal production — from 7 million tons in 2023, to 7.5 million tons in 2024 — the number is still well below the average of 24.5 million tons produced in the 2000s and is still 30% lower than what the state averaged two years ago.

“We peaked in coal production in the late 90s, early 2000s, up to 27 million tons a year. And since then, it’s been a pretty steady decline,” Michael Vanden Berg, energy and minerals program manager at the Utah Geological Survey and author of the study said on Thursday during a media presentation of the brief. 
The state’s coal exports, both domestically and internationally, have substantially dropped. In the early 2000s, Utah sent up to 16 million tons of coal to other states. That number fell to 377,000 tons in 2024.
The outlook for coal as an electricity generator has also substantially shrank in the state’s energy portfolio. In the year 2000, it accounted for 94% of the generation mix. That number dropped to 46% in 2024, with other resources booming. 
Natural gas, for example, went from making up 2% of the mix in the year 2000 to 34% last year. Solar went from nothing to 14% in those 24 years. 
Nuclear development and electricity rates to dominate energy discussion this legislative session

Looking ahead, the future of Utah’s energy production is on a trajectory to change even more. This year, Gov. Spencer Cox and lawmakers approved a plan to set up the foundation for another big resource — nuclear.
But, with the introduction of a new resource, Utahns may have to face changes when it comes to paying their utility bills. That could mean higher prices.
Preliminary numbers indicate that Utah kept its spot as a top state with the cheapest residential electricity bills. As state leaders make an effort to attract artificial intelligence, data centers and increased electrification, Utah is also looking at how to keep its energy costs low compared to other states, Emy Lesofski, director of the Utah Office of Energy Development said on Thursday.
However, with nuclear energy carrying a hefty price tag, balancing the need for innovation while keeping rates low is a challenge. 
“One of the things about small modular reactors, which is where the state’s focusing its initial interest, is that the idea is for them to be designed to be deployed much less expensively and more quickly, which will help the upfront cost of building nuclear,” Lesofski said. 
“And then on the back end, nuclear is very affordable to run once it’s built,” she added. “And so these are difficult questions that we’re gonna have to grapple with, but we definitely know that we need more power. We need it to be reliable, we want it to be clean, and nuclear provides those things.”
Additionally, energy consumption, which includes electricity, gas and other resources, has been on a steady increase of about 1.7% per year, according to the report, so state leaders are looking at how to keep up with demand when the increased need comes in gigawatt figures.
With more local input, Legislature signs on to the beginning of Utah’s nuclear future

While coal production in Utah is at one of its lowest levels, Lesofski believes it is still crucial for the state’s energy outlook.
“I think when the power isn’t needed because there’s other sources to replace it, then that discussion (about stopping using coal) may occur,” she said. “But, we need power now. We need more now, and our coal plans provide that reliable power that we need.”
That message is in line with the Utah Legislature’s actions protecting coal and preventing what lawmakers deem to be coal plants’ early retirement. They often call it an “all of the above” approach. 
Despite its decline, coal is still in high demand in Utah, prompting imports from other states. But, that might change a bit in 2026, when the newly opened Fossil Rock mine starts its full-scale mining, adding up to 3 million tons to the mix, according to the report. 
Also, some Intermountain Power Plant coal generators will convert to natural gas, removing demand for 2 million to 3 million tons of coal — despite legislation that will keep at least one of its coal-powered units active.
Still, Utah usually produces more energy than it needs. According to the study, during 2021 and 2022, the state became a net energy importer since its production couldn’t keep up with demand. However, that “importer” designation didn’t last long. In 2023 Utah went back to being an energy exporter, a designation that expanded in 2024.

Faith Winter, a Broomfield Democrat, speaks at the Colorado Capitol last week. She sponsored a bill that would add protections for transgender people in Colorado. (Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)An amended version of a bill that intends to add legal protections for transgender people in Colorado passed its first vote in the Colorado Senate after eight hours of testimony in the Senate Judiciary Committee Wednesday evening into early Thursday. 
House Bill 25-1312, dubbed the Kelly Loving Act in honor of a transgender woman killed during the 2022 Club Q shooting in Colorado Springs, initially proposed various new legal protections for transgender people in education, family legal matters and public accommodation. Sponsors amended out a provision that concerned child custody decisions — which drew intense opposition from parental advocates — and a stripped down version of the bill passed the committee. 
The bill defines deadnaming — when someone calls a transgender person by their previous name — and misgendering as discriminatory acts in the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act. It would also shield parents who help their child obtain gender-affirming care from laws in other states that outlaw the practice. The amended version removed references to “chosen” names in a section requiring school policies be “inclusive of all reasons” that a student changes their name, and it removed language around gender in the section that says schools must allow students to choose from any variation contained in dress code policies.

The committee removed a section of the bill that would have made judges in child custody cases consider deadnaming, misgendering or threatening to publish information related to an individual or child’s gender-affirming care as a form of “coercive control” in custody proceedings. Much of the testimony against the bill focused on that section, with many witnesses sharing concerns about the government involving itself in family matters. Sen. Dylan Roberts, a Frisco Democrat on the committee, said 95% to 99% of the concerns he heard related to the cut section. 
“If Section 2 were still in the bill, I would have been opposed. I think it was an intrusion into the parent-child relationship that would have had some negative consequences,” Roberts said. “And while I understand the intent maybe of the original inclusion, I think the policy implications were challenging at best.”
The committee voted 5-2 to move the bill forward along party lines, with Democrats in support and Republicans against it. Some committee members who voted in support of the bill said they still want to see more changes to reflect concerns from certain LGBTQ+ groups and around the shield law provision of the bill, but they said the amended version was better than how the bill started. 
“I think they’re bringing up some valid legal concerns, not questioning their support for trans Coloradans,” Roberts said. “ I think they’re bringing up valid legal concerns about the firmness of what’s on the paper here if it were to get challenged all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court.”
Hundreds testify
One Colorado, one of the largest LGBTQ+ advocacy groups in Colorado, initially supported the legislation but has changed course and has since taken an “amend” position on the bill with concerns that it could jeopardize current protections. After it passed the House with Democratic support, it stalled in the Senate as stakeholder conversations continued. One Colorado has not shared any details on what it wants to see change in the bill, and nobody with the organization testified at the bill hearing. 
“One Colorado is not testifying today because we want to continue our work with the proponents of this bill and community to make it stronger,” One Colorado spokesperson Cal Solverson said in a statement. 
Legislative staff said 726 people signed up to testify on the measure. Committee leadership limited debate to eight hours, four in favor of the bill and four against the bill, and asked those still in the room after witness testimony ended to stand to show if they were for, against, or seeking amendments on the bill. 










Does this bill do enough? No, and honestly legislation never will, but it does something ... It gives trans folks harmed across the state more access to legal protections than we have today.


– Anaya Robinson, senior policy strategist with the American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado


Those in support of the bill said it will save transgender peoples’ lives and make them safer. 
Anaya Robinson, senior policy strategist with the American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado, said his organization has had concerns with how the bill could be challenged at the federal level, but continued engagement with bill sponsors and stakeholders have led to changes addressing concerns as they come up. As a trans man, Robinson said his community needs “robust and clear protections that do not rely on federal law,” and the bill is a step in the right direction.
“Does this bill do enough? No, and honestly legislation never will, but it does something,” Robinson said. “It gives trans folks harmed across the state more access to legal protections than we have today, and in a time where our literal existence is being questioned, our history being erased, the legality of our bodies and our autonomy is being decided by people who do not believe we have a right to live, we need our elected officials and our community organizations to step up and do something.” 
Since President Donald Trump took office in January, his administration has issued orders to recognize only two unchangeable genders, stop offering non-binary passport gender markers, and attempted to stop funding care for transgender people under age 19.
Sybil Vane, a transgender woman from Brighton, described herself as an ordinary person who has led “a typical American life,” and she said “none of that has changed since I transitioned.” She said despite this, transgender people are not afforded the same respect as others.  
“I hope that the members of the committee and all those in opposition to the Kelly Loving Act can see me not as transgender, but as a fellow American, deserving the same dignity we afford to all,” Vane said. “Until such a day comes when we can see each other as humans first and transgender second, we need the Kelly Loving Act.”
The bill is sponsored by Rep. Lorena García, an Adams County Democrat, Rep. Rebekah Stewart, a Lakewood Democrat, Sen. Faith Winter, a Westminster Democrat, and Sen. Chris Kolker, a Littleton Democrat.
First Amendment objections
The committee voted to strike a portion of the bill that said Colorado courts “shall not give any force or effect” to laws in other states connected to taking children away from parents or caregivers who allowed the child access to gender-affirming care. Winter said that change reflects concerns around the Constitution’s full faith and credit clause and respecting laws of other states. But the shield provision retains other language that protects people in Colorado from other states’ gender-affirming care restrictions.
The amendment also clarified how a court should consider intentional, persistent deadnaming or misgendering as evidence of someone discriminating based on gender identity or expression, and it removed a provision around deadnaming and misgendering in a place of public accommodation. 
“The language around this is not if you call someone the wrong name by accident,” Winter said. “This isn’t if someone shows up at your workplace and you call them the wrong name or misgender them. There has to be intentionality to cause harm, and so this is about the action to the individual and not just speech.”
New additions to the bill include a provision that says someone does not need a court order if they want to change their gender marker on the driver’s license or identification a second or third time. Winter said Colorado allows an “X” gender marker on state IDs, but that has led to some people having trouble with student loans and passport applications, so some people may want to change their gender markers back. 
The bill now makes it so that a county clerk can issue a new marriage license to someone who has legally changed their name. 
Many who testified against the bill showed skepticism of gender-affirming care and denied that people can be transgender. Others questioned whether provisions of the bill would constitute compelled speech and violate the First Amendment.  
Wayne Williams, a former Republican secretary of state and attorney in Colorado Springs, expressed concerns with the shield law provisions of the bill and said it can create a “coercive” situation if states “do not give authority to the laws of others.” 
“There are a number of issues remaining in the bill that need to be fixed before it could be passed, and it should therefore be killed,” Williams said.
Sen. John Carson, a Highlands Ranch Republican on the committee, said “it’s pretty clear” that Colorado already has the laws it needs to prohibit discrimination.
“Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act prohibits discrimination in employment, housing, public accommodations, extending protections beyond federal law, protects individuals from discrimination based on disability, race, creed, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, marital status, religion, age, national origin and ancestry,” Carson said. “My belief is when we have adequate laws, we should focus on enforcing those.” 
The bill will go through the Senate Appropriations Committee before it will be up for debate on the Senate floor. The House will have to approve Senate amendments to the bill before it could be signed into law.
Democrats control strong majorities in both chambers of the Legislature.
The 2025 legislative session ends on May 7.

SPRINGFIELD – Nine Illinois police officers who lost their lives in the line of duty in 2024 were honored at a ceremony in Springfield Thursday.

The Illinois Peace Officers Memorial takes place every year on the first Thursday of May to honor officers who died on the job in the prior year. Families of the officers are given a plaque honoring their family member’s service by the state’s constitutional elected officials and the officers’ names are inscribed on a memorial outside the Illinois Capitol.

“They woke up every single day knowing that they may be called on to face extreme uncertainty, that on a moment’s notice, they may be required to put themselves in harm’s way to save another,” Gov. JB Pritzker said.

This year’s event honored DeKalb County Deputy Sheriff Christina Musil, Department of Corrections Sgt. Andrew Faught, Chicago Police Officer Luis Huesca, Cook County Corrections Deputy Sheriff Rafael Wordlaw, Chicago Police Officer James Crowley, Illinois State Police Trooper Corey Thompsen, Chicago Police Officer Enrique Martinez, Oak Park Detective Allan Reddins and ISP Trooper Clay Carns.

This year’s event also honored K-9s for the first time, including K-9 officers that died in the line of duty from Rockford, Lake County and Alton last year.

“The families that we induct today never asked to be a part of this somber club,” Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton said.

Treasurer Mike Frerichs also gave an emotional speech honoring his cousin, a California police officer who recently died. Frerichs’ office provides a college scholarship fund for children of first responders who died on the job.

Former ISP Trooper Kim Cessna, who leads a nonprofit for family members of fallen police officers, gave a personal remembrance of her colleague Thompsen, who was killed in a crash last October.

“We take these memories with us, allowing them to guide us, reminding us the beauty they brought into our lives,” Cessna said. “We carry their love in our hearts, and we let that love become a source of strength.”

Kathleen Rittmanic-Emme, the sister of Bradley Police Officer Marlene Rittmanic who died in 2021, described the emotional toll that court cases take on families following an officer’s death.

“Four years of hell to get what you call justice is absolutely heart-wrenching and ridiculous,” said Rittmanic-Emme.

Rittmanic’s killer was sentenced in January to life in prison.

Martinez’s death was on Comptroller Susana Mendoza’s mind. Martinez was shot and killed during a traffic stop last November on Chicago’s South Side by a man with an illegally modified gun, according to prosecutors.

But it was the suspect’s criminal history that Mendoza said bothered her the most. Block Club Chicago reported the man was on electronic monitoring when he killed Martinez and had multiple prior convictions, including battery, fleeing the police and aggravated discharge of a firearm. He was also awaiting trial on drug charges at the time of the murder.

“Chicago Police Officer Enrique Martinez would be with us right now and not on this button or the memorial wall outside if the monster that murdered him was locked up instead of out committing crimes while out on electronic monitoring,” Mendoza said.

Mendoza, a Chicago Democrat and sister of a Chicago Police officer, blasted portions of the SAFE-T Act – a 2021 police reform law championed by Democrats after Geroge Floyd's murder in 2020. She said as an elected official, she needs to do more to speak out against policies she believes jeopardize officer safety.

Mendoza called on lawmakers to remove a provision in state law that requires people on home confinement with or without electronic monitoring to be given two days of movement.

“When we give more rights to the criminals than we do to our police officers, we end up with dead officers and increased crime in our communities,” Mendoza said, earning applause from the officers and families in attendance.

,DC,2025-05-01 21:18:25+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,U.S. Senate Dems seek Trump administration report on human rights in El Salvador prison,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-dems-seek-trump-administration-report-human-rights-el-salvador-prison,,"WASHINGTON — Kilmar Abrego Garcia remains in prison in El Salvador after he was mistakenly deported more than a month ago, and Senate Democrats said Thursday they will file a privileged resolution that would require the State Department to report on human rights conditions in CECOT,  the brutal 40,000-capacity facility where Abrego Garcia was first incarcerated.The resolution also would force the Trump administration to detail its steps to comply with court orders on the removal of Abrego Garcia and other immigrants from the United States.The announcement of the resolution came after President Donald Trump, during an ABC News interview that aired Tuesday, acknowledged that if he wanted to, he could secure the return of Abrego Garcia from El Salvador.However, Trump then refused to do so, alleging Abrego Garcia has gang ties. He pointed to an altered photograph of Abrego Garcia’s knuckles that showed them displaying the characters “MS-13.”When ABC News journalist Terry Moran pointed out the photo was photoshopped, Trump argued that it wasn’t.“Why don't you just say, ‘Yes, he does,’” Trump said to Moran, referring to the MS-13 tattoo. Moran did not reply and moved to another topic.The Department of Justice has claimed that Abrego Garcia is a leader in the MS-13 gang, but has not provided evidence in court of those connections. Abrego Garcia was granted deportation protections by an immigration judge in 2019 over concerns he would experience violence by gangs if returned to his home country of El Salvador.The U.S. Supreme Court, an appeals court and a district court all have upheld that Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident who the Trump administration admitted was mistakenly deported to a notorious prison, must be returned.“Donald Trump should stop trampling on constitutional rights of people who reside in America, and the government of El Salvador should stop conspiring with the Trump administration to violate the constitutional rights of those who reside in America, including Abrego Garcia,” Maryland Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen said at a press conference on the Senate resolution.The Supreme Court last month ruled that the Trump administration must “facilitate” the return of Abrego Garcia, but stopped short of requiring it and sent the case back to a federal judge to clarify how the return could be “effectuated.”The case is now in closed proceedings before U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland as discovery and depositions from officials interviewed under oath about Abrego Garcia’s case continue. Xinis on Wednesday denied the Trump administration’s request for another extension to provide information on Abrego Garcia.$6 million payment The resolution, backed by Van Hollen, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, would require the State Department to issue a human rights report on El Salvador.It also specifically asks for a report on the prison known as Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT, where Abrego Garcia was initially sent in March, along with nearly 300 other men deported from the U.S.The State Department issued a 2023 report on human rights conditions in El Salvador, which noted that there were reports of “systemic abuse in the prison system, including beatings by guards and the use of electric shocks.”If the resolution manages to pass in the Republican-controlled Senate and House, and the State Department doesn’t issue a human rights report within 30 days, then any foreign assistance to El Salvador would be canceled, Kaine said.The Trump administration has stated that it’s paying El Salvador $6 million to detain the men at CECOT.Van Hollen said of that funding, the Trump administration has paid El Salvador about $4 million so far to detain the men and plans to pay as much as $15 million.Experts have raised concerns that the foreign assistance funds to El Salvador from the State Department violate the Leahy Law, which bars financial support of “units of foreign security forces” — which can include military and law enforcement staff in prisons —  facing credible allegations of gross human rights violations.Van Hollen meeting in El SalvadorVan Hollen also pushed back on the Trump administration’s insistence that because Abrego Garcia is in El Salvador’s custody, he cannot be returned.Van Hollen, who traveled to El Salvador last month seeking a meeting with Abrego Garcia, said during that trip he spoke with El Salvador Vice President Félix Augusto Antonio Ulloa. Van Hollen said Ulloa told him “the only reason the government of El Salvador is holding (Abrego Garcia) is because the Trump administration is paying (El Salvador) to do so.”Van Hollen was initially denied a visit with Abrego Garcia. But he was eventually able to secure an in-person meeting under the close supervision of Salvadoran officials.Abrego Garcia appeared with Van Hollen in civilian clothes — a stark difference from a video released by the Trump administration that showed Abrego Garcia in a prison uniform and being roughly handled by Salvadoran officials.In response to the in-person meeting, the White House wrote on its official social media account that Abrego Garcia “is NOT coming back.”Van Hollen said he has not had any update on the condition of Abrego Garcia since the visit to El Salvador.Message for BukeleDuring El Salvador President Nayib Bukele’s first-ever visit to the Oval Office in April, he declined to return Abrego Garcia. In that same meeting, Trump asked Bukele if he would take “homegrown” criminals, meaning U.S. citizens.Kaine said that he had a message for the president of El Salvador if he accepts U.S. citizens for incarceration.“You might think it's cute right now to grab attention by a bromance with President Trump,” he said, adding in Spanish that any alliance with Trump will be short-lived, ending with the conclusion of his term in office. “If you think we'll forget you violating the human rights of American citizens, you're wrong,” said Kaine.Van Hollen added that he, along with Kaine and Schumer, plan to introduce a bill to place sanctions against Bukele and “all those who are part of his government conspiring with Donald Trump to deprive residents of the United States of their constitutional rights.”",,,,2025-05-01 18:06:20.829850

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa Republican lawmakers are trying again to pass a ban on Medicaid funding going to gender-affirming care for transgender Iowans, this time by including language in the proposed budget for health and human services programs.
A Senate subcommittee advanced Senate Study Bill 1237 Wednesday, the HHS appropriations bill for fiscal year 2026. The measure included language that the funding allocated for Iowa’s Medicaid program “shall not be used for sex reassignment surgery or treatment related to an individual’s gender dysphoria diagnosis.”
Iowa has attempted to ban Medicaid coverage for gender-affirming care law before, but these laws were struck down by the courts for violating the Iowa Constitution and the Iowa Civil Rights Act. The Iowa Supreme Court ruled in 2019 that the state’s denial of two transgender women’s transition-related care through Medicaid violated the Iowa Civil Rights Act. A Polk County District Court judge also ruled in 2021 that a law passed after that state Supreme Court decision, which amended the Iowa Civil Rights Act to allow for the exclusion of Medicaid coverage for transition-related health care,  violated the Iowa Constitution.
Earlier this year, Gov. Kim Reynolds signed into law a measure that removed gender identity as a protected class in the Iowa Civil Rights Act. As activists rallied against the measure for potentially allowing for the legal discrimination against transgender Iowans, one of the arguments posed by lawmakers was the fact that previous laws attempting to deny Medicaid coverage for transition-related health care were blocked through the state Civil Rights Act.
Keenan Crow, policy and advocacy director at One Iowa, said Thursday that one of the major differences between the language in this year’s Senate appropriations bill and previous attempts to ban Medicaid coverage for gender-affirming care was the reference to all “treatment related to an individual’s gender dysphoria diagnosis,” not just sex reassignment surgery. This could impact transgender Iowans’ ability to access mental health care and other services, Crow said.
“Our first line of intervention on any gender dysphoria case is going to be mental health counseling, period, that is the primary treatment for gender dysphoria,” Crow said. “And obviously I am not okay with restricting surgical care either, but to go even further and and get into restricting medications and mental health supports and all this other stuff, that is truly wrong.”
Even with the removal of gender identity from the Iowa Civil Rights Act, denying transgender Iowans gender-affirming care could still be unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause. The 2021 district court ruling found the law prohibiting Medicaid coverage of transition care violated both state civil rights laws and the state constitution. The Iowa Supreme Court declined to rule on the constitutionality of the law in 2023.
House bill does not include Medicaid restriction, for now
The House Health and Human Services Appropriations Subcommittee met Thursday to discuss its version of the HHS budget bill, House Study Bill 342, which passed unanimously. The House legislation, in its current form, does not include the Senate’s language.
But House Speaker Pat Grassley told reporters Thursday that the House supports restricting Medicaid funds going toward transition-related health care.
“We don’t believe the taxpayers … should be paying for surgeries and other hormone therapies,” Grassley said. “I know that there’s a piece of that that’s in the Senate bill, I think you will see a piece focused on those two things that I just said on our side. But again, we have not negotiated the Senate language out with them. They may have some different languages where we may settle, but I think you could expect to us to, at least, have that conversation about the taxpayer paying for those two items.”
The chair of the House HHS appropriations subcommittee Rep. Ann Meyer, R-Fort Dodge, said she has spoken with Grassley about the provision, and that there will be discussions with the full House Republican caucus. However, she said that the House would likely consider different language on the measure that would not impact Medicaid coverage for mental and behavioral health care for transgender Iowans.
“If this were to come before the House, we would just be talking about surgery and hormone therapy,” Meyer said.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/transprotest2.24.25.2-scaled-e1740421311729-1024x611.jpg,,,2025-05-01 18:06:20.829850

Kansas State University has the only lab out of 17 that survived USAID funding cuts. Here, KSU was part of a conference in Senegal that addressed water accessibility. (Submitted photo)TOPEKA — The Trump administration defunded 16 of 17 Feed the Future labs across the country when it began wiping out U.S. Agency for International Development projects.
After months in limbo, Kansas State University found out its lab is the lone survivor.
Two K-State labs that are part of the Feed the Future network received stop work orders in January. In early April, K-State officials received notice that the Climate Resilient Cereals Innovation Lab could resume work, said Timothy J. Dalton, professor of agricultural economics and interim director of the lab.
The second lab, the Feed the Future Collaborative Research on Sustainable Intensification  Innovation Lab, which had a $50 million cooperative agreement for its operations, was terminated.
Dalton is unsure what the future funding will be for the Cereals lab. The original cooperative agreement allocated $22 million for five years.
“We are just completing our second year,” he said. “We receive our funding in annual increments. We’ll see what happens once this fiscal year ends.”
Dalton is pleased to continue the work the Cereals lab began, which involves collaborations with universities around the country, and with national agricultural research systems in Senegal, Ethiopia and Bangladesh.
But he’s concerned about the long-term impacts of ending 16 labs, each of which was doing work that affects farmers in the United States.
University spokeswoman Michelle Geering said U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran was helpful in getting the funding reinstated.
“K-State’s innovation lab is helping bolster American agriculture by creating crops that are resistant to drought and disease,” Moran said in a press release. “I appreciate (U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio) for recognizing the importance of the work being done at Kansas State University and supporting the continuation of this program.”
 International and local impacts

The research work at all the labs has implications internationally as well as for U.S. agriculture. Giving credit to another professor, Dalton borrowed an analogy to describe what the 17 Feed the Future labs were designed to do.
“We train our military to go and fight battles overseas in order to prevent similar problems from occurring in the United States,” Dalton said. “It’s a similar argument. What we’re doing with the Innovation lab mechanism is working on very similar problems that just happen to be food-related.”
Dalton said aligning with other countries to solve agriculture challenges like crop disease resistance pays off for the United States by preparing U.S. farmers for when those same issues come here, which they eventually do, he said.
For example, research in the 1980s to protect farms in southern Africa from the sugarcane aphid helped U.S. farmers with managing the greenbug aphid, Dalton said.
“I have always expressed my deepest concern about the halting of any international collaborative work, that it’s really going to fall on the shoulders of farmers because they’re the ones who are not getting the type of research to get out in front of these challenges that they will face,” Dalton said.
 Longterm research

Dalton also raised concerns that halting support for the other 16 labs sets agricultural research back because of the long-term, slow path that research sometimes takes.
Researchers are usually tied to the crop cycles, so they may only be able to do investigations in the fields during certain times.
“The work in Ethiopia has had tremendous impacts, but it started half a century ago,” he said. “Because ag research moves slowly and it’s all about persistence over time, rather than stop-and-go funding, you have to think about protecting the long-run interests.”
 Cereals research

Work will now continue in the Climate Resilient Cereals Lab, where they focus on researching four cereal grains: sorghum, millet, wheat and rice.
In Senegal, research is focused on wheat and sorghum. It’s on the border of the Sahara Desert, Dalton said, where it’s always hot and dry, allowing them to study wheat that is exposed to heat and drought. Those are two issues that regularly affect Kansas farmers.
Work studying rice in Bangladesh considers, among other things, the genes that rice varieties harbor that are resistant to disease. Identifying ways to fight rice blast, a fungal infection that destroys rice crops around the world, is part of that research.
Dalton said sorghum research is important because there are fewer researchers focused on it than on other grains. More than 50% of U.S. sorghum is grown in Kansas.
“There are so many more questions left to be answered about sorghum because it hasn’t had that intense level of research,” he said.

CT lawmakers try again on climate legislation,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/01/net-zero-2050-ct-house-bill/,"A plan to set CT on a course to net zero carbon emissions was approved by lawmakers Thursday, giving hope to advocates.","A plan to set Connecticut on a course toward achieving net zero carbon emissions throughout the economy by 2050 was approved by House lawmakers on Thursday, giving hope to climate advocates for one of their top legislative priorities.
The legislation, House Bill 5004, would strengthen the state’s existing carbon-reduction goals and create a new “Clean Economy Council” to develop strategies and policies to help meet those targets. In addition, it offers a variety of incentives and programs for solar canopies, energy-efficient heating and cooling systems, heat pumps, green jobs and sustainability-focused businesses. 
“It’s where to we need to get to and how are we going to get there,” said state Rep. John-Michael Parker, D-Madison, co-chair of the Environment Committee and one of the bill’s architects. “Let’s put these plans in place, think about funding, think about the process [moving] forward, but do it in a reasonable and responsible way.”

Under current law, Connecticut has pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 80% between 2001 and 2050. As preliminary step toward meeting that goal, lawmakers enacted a plan three years ago to obtain all of the state’s power needs from carbon-free sources by 2040.
H.B. 5004 would go a step further, setting a “net zero” emissions goal by the midpoint of this century. Net zero refers a point when any emissions are offset by efforts to remove those gases from the atmosphere, either through carbon-capture technology or more natural means such as planting forests and grasslands.
Many scientists and advocates say achieving net zero emissions by 2050 is necessary to prevent the global temperatures from rising to dangerous levels.
Republicans in the House criticized H.B. 5004, however, raising skepticism over the science behind climate change and inquiring about the feasibility of such a goal. Several pointed out that Connecticut has consistently lagged behind meeting its existing emissions targets, despite years of efforts.
“At times, I wonder whenever we put these bills out if we actually are trying to achieve something rather than put words in books,” said Rep. Tim Ackert, R-Coventry.
House Democrats succeeded in passing legislation very similar to H.B. 5004 last year — it even had the same bill number — only watch it fall victim to a Republican filibuster on the last day of the legislative session.
To avoid a similar fate this session, proponents say they’re giving the Senate plenty of time to consider the bill before the legislature adjourns on June 4.
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, told reporters Thursday that “there was a lot of finger pointing and blame and conspiracy theories,” after the failure of H.B. 5004 last year.
“I like nothing more than to prove people wrong,” Ritter added. “They said, ‘You guys didn’t really want to do the bill, you didn’t really want to do an environmental bill.’ It’s back, May 1, six weeks to go we’re setting it up.” 
In order to ease opposition to the bill, Parker said that several sections dealing mostly with a study of natural gas usage and other energy topics were removed ahead of Thursday’s debate.
Additionally, this year’s version of the bill excluded language declaring a “climate crisis,” that was a centerpiece of last year’s legislation. While the “crisis” outlined in that bill would not have granted the governor emergency powers as in other natural disasters, it became the subject of intense debate.
“It was just such a flashpoint for opponents making a big fuss about it,” said Lori Brown,  the executive director of the Connecticut League of Conservation Voters. “But it didn’t really do anything, and it was one of those things that got left behind.” 
Parker, the bill sponsor, said some of the energy-related provisions that were removed from the bill could end up being included in separate legislation being drafted by the legislature’s Energy and Technology Committee to address electric prices. Still, critics of the bill raised concerns that some of the incentives for technologies like electric heat pumps would add further demand onto the grid, raising prices even higher.
“There are a lot of initiatives in this bill that are high drains on electricity,” said Rep. Patrick Callahan, R-New Fairfield, a ranking Republican on the Environment Committee. “What’s missing is where we get our baseline power from.”
Parker responded that the purpose of the Clean Economy Council, which the bill would establish, is to develop strategies for advancing clean energy in a way that is not harmful to the state’s economy.
After more than three hours of debate, the House passed the bill late Thursday afternoon by a party-line vote of 98 to 47. 
It now heads to the Senate. Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, said Senate Democrats had yet to begin discussions regarding the legislation, which he acknowledged was a “priority” for the House.
“We’ll certainly caucus it and give it the same deference the House gives to Senate priority bills,” Duff said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/20221221_PowerPlant__Bridgeport_YK_067.jpg,,,2025-05-01 17:11:54.508082

The Hartford rally was one of thousands happening across the U.S. to commemorate May Day, or as it is known around the world, International Workers’ Day. It was fairly focused on Connecticut and the issues coming before the General Assembly, but that same frustration was channeled at President Donald J. Trump and his first 100 days.
The overriding sentiment from many of the participants was that Connecticut needs to fill in the gaps in federal funding and potential cuts to critical services and programs. Some raised concerns that state officials may be too fiscally cautious.
“We’ve already been fighting for fair budgets and demanding that the state amend their fiscal guardrails so that we can spend money. Now with what’s happening federally, we think that those cuts are even going to be deeper, and the hole that we’ve been in — it’s just going to get bigger,” said Norma Martinez HoSang, director of CT For All, a coalition of more than 60 faith, labor and other civic organizations. “We continue to demand for fully funded public services that support all of our communities.”

Thursday’s rally in Hartford was organized by three main organizations — Make the Road Connecticut, 32BJ SEIU and CT For All — that consist of various memberships across unions, immigrant rights groups and other advocacy organizations. Thousands were expected at a similar rally scheduled later Thursday in New Haven.
The groups were advocating for “just cause” eviction protections, fair wages, medical debt relief and HUSKY for immigrants, which would expand eligibility of who qualifies for Connecticut’s Medicaid program.
But even with the state-specific focus, many of the people at the rally were holding signs critical of Trump and his policies as well as calls for unity and inclusiveness.
One of those signs was Renee Hamel’s, which read, “We are here to stay.”
“The sad thing is that I got this from the first Trump presidency,” said Hamel, who works for a union that represents hospital residents. “I didn’t think I would have to be using this again. But here we are, and things are even worse, with people being under threat of deportation, people that have committed no crimes.”
For others, immigration was also a key part of the rally as the Trump administration ramps up deportations, including some targeting people who are legally allowed to be in the country. Advocates reiterated their support for Connecticut’s Trust Act, which state Republicans are pushing to roll back.
The Trust Act places limits on when state and local law enforcement can detain people who are being sought by federal immigration officials, though it makes exceptions for sharing information about an undocumented immigrant who has been convicted of a certain felony or a potential terrorist.

But the overhaul of the federal government and the changes to reliable funding streams for states had many of the rallygoers on edge. They called on Gov. Ned Lamont and other state officials to fill in some of those gaps left open by cuts to federal funding.
“I feel like our lawmakers are doing enough speaking out to push back on the agenda of the Trump administration, but when it comes to the budget, I’m so disappointed,” Hamel said.
“They are so adherent to these fiscal guardrails when we have so many programs that are being cut, and we have so much money, and it’s like if you’re not going to use it now, when are you going to use it?” she said.
May Day protests like the one on Thursday are common for groups like Make the Road CT. But they said they got even more support this time than compared to previous years.
“I think this is important because it’s not an event that only happens in Connecticut, but it’s an event that happens in other states,” Giselle Chavez, an organizer with the Make the Road CT, said. “And I think it’s important to be unified at the end of the day.”

“The Make America Healthy Again movement is not one of words, but of action!” Landry posted. “That is why today I signed an Executive Order banning soda and candy purchases from Louisiana’s food stamp program.”
Landry’s executive order doesn’t actually prohibit these purchases, as he does not have that authority.

Landry’s executive order does not define either soft drinks or candy. 
The governor also urged the Legislature to approve Senate Bill 14 by Sen.

Drinks that include milk or milk substitutes would be exempt from this prohibition. 
When McMath presented his bill to the Senate Health and Welfare Committee this week, he said he specifically decided not to seek prohibition of candy purchases with SNAP benefits. Many Louisiana residents live in food deserts, and McMath said he did not want to prevent people who might only be able to shop at convenience stores from eating.
Landry’s order also instructs DCFS to find ways to incentivize SNAP recipients to buy produce, such as participating in the Double Up Food Bucks program. The program provides matching aid dollars for fruit and vegetable purchases in more than two dozen states. 
The order sets an Oct. 1 deadline for DCFS to submit its waiver application to the Trump administration.

Jared Polis signs Senate Bill 25-63 into law at his office in the Colorado Capitol on Thursday. (Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)Colorado school districts will need to adopt policies by this fall about when and why library books can be taken from the shelves under a new law signed by Gov. Jared Polis on Thursday.
The goal is to safeguard public school libraries from the growing trend that targets certain books, often about diverse topics or by diverse authors, for removal.
“Books are so important because names, experiences, identities — these things are being erased. To be able to experience how others are feeling, to learn empathy, to be able to see yourself in books if there’s no one else in your world like you — these things are so critical to developing an empathetic society,” bill sponsor Sen. Lisa Cutter, a Littleton Democrat, said ahead of the signing.

Senate Bill 25-63 requires school districts to create policies about the acquisition, retention and display of library books and other materials by September. The policy will also need to govern book challenges and consider the process for removing any books for circulation.
Only parents of students in the school district will be allowed to challenge books, and reviews of individual books will be limited to once every two years.
The bill passed the Legislature on party-line votes, with Republicans opposed to it.
“We are able to have policies in place that will reduce discriminatory censorship and ensure that the books on the shelves and the literature available to our students open their minds, allow for exploration and really foster a growth,” Rep. Lorena Garcia, an Adams County Democrat and bill sponsor, said.
Book removal standards will need to comply with a 1982 U.S. Supreme Court case that determined school boards cannot restrict library materials simply because they disagree with their content.
In 2024, there were seven attempts to ban 137 books in public schools and libraries in Colorado, according to the American Library Association. The most challenged book in the country that year was “All Boys Aren’t Blue,” a memoir written for young adults by queer Black author George Johnson.
In Colorado, people have tried to remove books including “Beloved” by Toni Morrison, “The Kite Runner” by Khaled Hosseini and “The Hate U Give” by Angie Thomas. Many of the challenged books include LGBTQ+ themes, accounts of violence, and descriptions of discrimination and sexual activity. They are often by or about people of color or LGBTQ+ people.
The bill signing comes as a federal judge ordered Elizabeth School District to return 19 removed books, deemed inappropriate by the school board, back to the shelves. The law now requires school districts to follow a clear and consistent process to remove any books.
“This bill is about trusting the experience of school librarians, trusting local communities to make decisions based on the needs of their students and trusting young people to explore, wonder and to think critically,” bill sponsor Rep. Jenny Willford, a Northglenn Democrat, said.
Republicans, particularly Rep. Ken DeGraaf of Colorado Springs, argued during the legislative process that certain books are too mature for school students or contain what he deems pornographic material, and therefore should be subject to removal requests from parents and community members.
They attempted to amend the bill to widen who can challenge a book to include anyone who lives in the school district, parent or otherwise. They also unsuccessfully tried to shield the name of challengers from open records requests.
A similar school library bill died during the 2024 legislative session, though one focused on public libraries was signed into law.

The Thursday order comes nearly two decades after the kidnap and murder of a Gulf Coast woman. Jordan, 78, is set to be executed June 25 at 6 p.m. at the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman. 
“After due consideration, the Court finds Jordan has exhausted all state and federal remedies for purposes of setting an execution date,” the court wrote. “Accordingly, the Court finds the State’s Motion to Set Execution Date should be granted and a date should be set for execution of the death sentence imposed upon Jordan.”
Eight of the nine justices ruled to grant the execution, and Justice Leslie King was the sole person who ruled to deny Jordan’s execution.

Jordan filed his most recent challenge of his death sentence in November 2024, arguing that it was invalid because the death penalty was not constitutional at the time of the murder of Edwina Marter. 
He also asked for the U.S. Supreme Court to hear his case, but that request was denied in March. 
The Mississippi Supreme Court rejected Jordan’s post-conviction petition on May 1, the same day it ordered his execution. 
Jordan was first convicted in 1976 for kidnapping Edwina Marter from Gulfport, killing her in a national forest and demanding ransom from her husband. 
The Hattiesburg native served in the Army after graduating from high school and fought in the Vietnam War. After the war, Jordan married and had three children but found it difficult to adjust to civilian life and experienced symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder related to his combat experience, according to court records. 
In 1976 he was desperate for money and made plans to kidnap someone from a wealthy family and demand a ransom. Jordan called Gulf National Bank in Gulfport and found out the name of its commercial loan officer, Chuck Marter. 
He found Chuck Marter’s address from the telephone book and traveled from Louisiana. Jordan posed as an electric worker to get into the home, and then he took Edwina Marter to the DeSoto National Forest where he shot her. 
It took four trials spanning 20 years before Jordan was successfully convicted and sentenced to death. 
Jordan’s appeals have also been tied to legal challenges of the state’s lethal injection protocol. 
He and death row inmate Ricky Chase are lead plaintiffs in a federal lawsuit challenging the use of midazolam, a sedative, as one of the state’s three execution drugs. 
U.S. District Judge Henry Wingate hasn’t made a final ruling in the case, which he ordered stayed in March pending resolution of a 2023 motion for summary judgment by the prison defendants. 
In 2022, Wingate did not block the execution of Thomas Loden Jr., another death row inmate who was part of the lawsuit. If lethal injection is not an option, the state can put someone to death through other available methods: gas chamber, electrocution or firing squad.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/06081403/AP060710014048.jpg,,,2025-05-01 17:11:54.508082

(Courtesy image)OKLAHOMA CITY — State lawmakers moved one step closer to abandoning plans to construct a state-of-the-art inpatient mental health hospital in Oklahoma City amid massive cost overruns and construction delays.
A joint legislative subcommittee on Wednesday gave preliminary approval for the State Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services to abandon plans to build the Donahue Behavioral Health Campus located near the Oklahoma State University-Oklahoma City campus.
They instead greenlighted spending millions in federal American Rescue Plan Act money to purchase land and renovate an existing building in central Oklahoma City.
Officials did not reveal where in central Oklahoma City that they’re proposing to open a new inpatient mental health hospital, but said it would house 197 beds. That’s far fewer than the 330 beds that were supposed to be built in the Donahue facility. It was expected to include 55 beds specifically designated for children and adolescents. 
Skip Leonard, the agency’s interim chief financial officer, said his agency wants to spend $19.1 million to purchase land and $31.5 million to renovate the two buildings on the site. 
Mental Health Commissioner Allie Friesen said the latest hospital design would have less focus on children, but could house criminal defendants needing competency restoration services. Such a renovation would provide the state an additional 32 beds to comply with the recent lawsuit settlement, she said.
When mental health officials first pitched the Donahue facility, they promised the bed count would increase capacity by 100 beds compared to what’s currently available at Griffin Memorial Hospital in Norman, which it was intended to replace.
Friesen said property owners at the prospective site have been transparent about the potential flaws at the new site that was constructed in 2001 and last renovated in 2017.
“We feel confident that we have a plan moving forward,” she said, adding that it still meets the mark of what the agency was aiming for.
It wasn’t clear Wednesday how much money the state has already spent on the construction of the Donahue Behavioral Health Campus. 
Leonard told lawmakers during a budget presentation Wednesday that the agency had spent about $6.45 million on the Donahue project, but Melissa Houston said there are actually three different expenditure amounts that need to be rectified ahead of a final vote taken by the full committee. Houston’s consulting firm is helping oversee the Legislature’s expenditure of APRA money.
Houston said lawmakers initially budgeted about $87 million to construct the new Donahue hospital and expected to net $50 million from the sale of the land in Norman where Griffin Memorial is located. The total project cost was $137 million, and the facility was supposed to open in December 2025, she said.
Currently, there’s about a $125 million funding gap in the budget, and the facility will not open until 2028, she said.
The plan to move ahead with a new inpatient hospital location still needs approval from the Joint Committee on Pandemic Relief Funding.

(Photo by Nancy Lavin/Rhode Island Current)The state is shining the spotlight on solar panel sales companies, with a new law and registry system taking effect Thursday that holds retailers accountable for door-to-door sales tactics, financial disclosures, and contract terms.
The updated state regulations and new, online public registry system reflect legislation passed during the 2024 legislative session and signed into law by Gov. Dan McKee on June 10. Consumer complaints over solar panel sales skyrocketed in recent years, with a majority directed at one company being sued by Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha’s office for allegedly preying upon and deliberately misleading senior and disabled residents.
The 2023 lawsuit against the company, Smart Green Solar, and its CEO, Jasjit Gotra, remains pending in Providence County Superior Court. 
Accused of deceptive practices, R.I. solar company CEO operates in unregulated business climate

Meanwhile, complaints against Gotra and Smart Green are still piling up. More than half of the 116 solar sales-related complaints logged with the AG’s office pertain to Smart Green. Another 25 of the 35 complaints submitted from January through March 2025 are directed at the same company, according to information from the AG’s office.
Which is why state regulators are turning to a registry, and new code of regulations, to prevent other potential bad actors from taking advantage of consumers.
“Rhode Islanders want to do their part to mitigate climate change, but they are rightfully weary of being taken financial advantage of in the solar sales space, as my Consumer Protection Team knows all too well,” Neronha said in a statement. “Today’s launch of the Solar Sales Registry is a significant step in putting much needed guardrails on the industry, so that consumers aren’t disincentivized by the deceptive behavior of certain companies. I look forward to seeing the implementation of this registry and am certain it will help move Rhode Island closer to meeting our climate goals.”
Like other licensed industries regulated by the Rhode Island Department of Business Regulation, the department is relying on consumer complaints to inform enforcement, said Elizabeth Dwyer, department director.
As of 3 p.m. Thursday, Dwyer had yet to hear from any aggrieved solar company customers. But if and when she does, the department stands ready to investigate. Violators could face fines of up to $5,000, along with cease-and-desist orders.
New rules limit hours for door-to-door solar sales from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. unless appointments outside those hours are pre-arranged. There is also a required financial disclosure form prior to any signed contracts, listing names and contact information for solar sales representatives, financers, and installers. A chief complaint voiced by Smart Green customers in interviews with Rhode Island Current was the inability to reach Gotra or other company representatives after signing a contract, even if problems arose.
The regulations also codify the seven-day window for customers to cancel signed contracts, which is standard to other industries. Sales companies are also required to make a “good faith estimate” on project costs and expected energy savings.
“Rhode Islanders deserve transparency and accountability when it comes to solar energy sales—that’s exactly what this new program delivers,” McKee said in a statement. “My administration is committed to protecting consumers while continuing to support the growth of clean energy in Rhode Island.”

‘Our goal is to be as reasonable as possible’
Separate from the immediately enforceable sales regulations, DBR has also launched a public-facing registry. Companies that sell solar panels in Rhode Island must pay $750 to register, and renew their registration each year for the same cost.
There is no firm deadline by which companies must complete registration. Dwyer said Thursday she expects the department will begin taking action within 30 to 60 days if it finds out eligible retailers failed to sign up.
“Our goal is to be as reasonable as possible,” she said. “The purpose is to get as many people as possible to sign up.”
The public portal does not show any registered companies as of Thursday, though applicants must be approved before their information is posted online.
Registered companies risk having their licenses revoked if they violate any of the state’s rules around sales practices and contract terms.
Dwyer estimates fewer than 50 solar panel companies are subject to the registry requirements, which do not extend to individual salespeople. The department plans to oversee the new licensing and enforcement rules with its existing staff, and is using software with a contracted vendor, Tyler Technologies, for the online registry.
“There are some costs, but they are interior costs,” Dwyer said, referring to legal and licensing advice. “We felt this was a small enough group, we could absorb it into our current workload. We will reevaluate if we feel there’s a need.”
The department sent emails to solar panel sales companies over the past few weeks to inform them about the registration launch. So far, no one has complained to Dwyer about the cost to register, or other rules, she said.
Gotra, who denounced the registry and accompanying regulations last year as a barrier to achieving the state’s decarbonization goals, did not respond to inquiries for comment Thursday.
A consent order entered on March 14, 2024, in the state’s lawsuit against Gotra and Smart Green stipulates Gotra must “refrain” from misrepresentations in his interactions and marketing to customers, along with other disclosures, until the case is adjudicated or settled. A procedural hearing on the case is scheduled for May 8, according to the public docket.

Greg Gianforte speaks before a bill signing ceremony for a suite of bills that make changes to Montana's environmental laws. (Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)Three state representatives joined Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte for a bill signing ceremony for five new laws making changes to the Montana Environmental Policy Act. 
“At its simplest, MEPA is a process that ensures that we think about the potential environmental impacts of our decisions,” Gianforte said in remarks to press. “Last year, the Montana Supreme Court issued a series of rulings that led us to develop solutions to reduce potential litigation and provide certainty to Montana businesses, large and small, that are trying to make a living here in our state.” 
The suite of laws came as a direct response to the decision in the Held vs. Montana lawsuit, in which a district court judge found that the state could not limit the analysis of greenhouse gas emissions during the environmental review process. 
When the Montana Supreme Court upheld the ruling last December, incoming Republican legislative leaders told the courts to “buckle up” and brought a number of bills aimed at changing the judicial system as well as addressing the Held decision. 
“In the Held v. Montana court case, they tried to twist MEPA into something it was never meant to be — a tool to deny permits and block development,” House Speaker Brandon Ler, R-Savage, said at the signing ceremony. “With the signing of this MEPA reform package, we’re making it clear that Montana’s environmental policy is about reform decision making, not weaponizing and litigation.”
Earlier during the session, House Democrats pushed back against many of the bills related to MEPA, including one brought by Ler. 

“Montanans expect us to defend their Constitutional right to breathe clean air and drink clean water, and that’s exactly what House Democrats did,” said Rep. Jonathan Karlen, D-Missoula, in a press release. “But some Republican politicians are determined to erode what makes Montana the last best place. We will continue to fight those efforts every step of the way.”
The Held lawsuit, brought by 16 youth plaintiffs from across the state, was the nation’s first constitutional climate change trial. A district court judge in Lewis and Clark County sided with the plaintiffs in 2023, and in December 2024, the Montana Supreme Court upheld the decision.  
The court found in a 6-to-1 decision that Montana’s constitutional guarantee of a “clean and healthful environment” includes a stable climate system. 
“Plaintiffs showed at trial — without dispute — that climate change is harming Montana’s environmental life support system now and with increasing severity for the foreseeable future,” the order stated. 
In response to the Supreme Court’s decision Democrats introduced bills that sought to strengthen MEPA’s role in protecting the environment, although none passed.
The majority of bills introduced, including the five signed on Thursday sponsored by Republicans, put sideboards on the environmental review process and clarified the state’s existing laws. 
Speaker Ler introduced House Bill 285, which he said was designed to provide clarity and efficiency to MEPA. 
The bill emphasizes that MEPA is a tool for assessing environmental impacts, not a regulatory mechanism.
“House Bill 285 sets the record straight: MEPA is procedural,” Ler said. “It’s a way to gather facts, weigh impacts and then make informed decisions, not dictate them. This bill reaffirms the Legislature’s intent.”
Ler’s bill passed both Legislative chambers along party lines.

Other MEPA-related bills drew more bipartisan support. 
House Bill 270, introduced by Rep. Katie Zolnikov, R-Billings, updates MEPA language to remove the parts invalidated by the Held decision, alters the process if someone fails to comply with the act, and prevents state agencies from vacating permits without considering the economic effects. 
Her bill saw unanimous support in the House and saw only a handful of opponents in the Senate. 
Similarly, Senate Bill 221, carried by Sen. Wylie Galt, R-Martinsdale, also drew support from both parties. 
His bill directed the Department of Environmental Quality to develop guidance on greenhouse gas emission assessments while aiming to prevent industry and development from getting bogged down in litigation. 
“Our next steps will be to develop that guidance document that will outline exactly how we will do greenhouse gas assessments for fossil fuel activities, as well as what parameters we’ll look at for non-fossil fuel activities,” said Sonja Nowakowski, director of DEQ. “These will be very open and transparent processes, and we look forward to engaging with the public and getting everyone’s input as we move forward.”
Gianforte also signed House Bill 291, which prevents the state from adopting more stringent standards for air pollutants than the federal government; and House Bill 466, which defines “categorial exclusions” for projects that do not require environmental assessments, similar to the National Environmental Policy Act.
Combined, Gianforte said the package of bills would help protect the state’s environment while bolstering the economy. 

“Left unchecked, the rulings would have impacted our energy sector at a time when Americans have seen the cost of electricity soar nearly 30% over the last four years,” Gianforte said.
Anne Hedges, director of the Montana Environmental Information Center, criticized many of the bills Gianforte signed, especially SB 221 and HB 285, saying they reduced MEPA to a “paper exercise.”
“Without the requirements in MEPA to fully analyze a project’s impacts, the state does not have a mechanism to comply with the public’s constitutional rights to know, to participate, and to have a clean and healthful environment,” Hedges said in a prepared statement. “The people of this state will not stand for a loss of these constitutional rights, and so these bills will only result in conflict and wasted state resources.”

(Photo by Aristide Economopoulos/NJ Monitor)Adding to the list of gun legislation before lawmakers this session, the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee held a public hearing for a series of proposals about the business practices of licensed dealers, prohibiting firearms at voting places and more. 
Earlier this session, the committee heard proposals to modify the state’s concealed carry laws that were ultimately voted down. The committee is also working on legislation that could update the definition of a machine gun, as well as bipartisan proposals about firearm hold agreements. 
And during a vote last month, Democratic lawmakers on the committee were split on what to do with a proposal to ban the possession of large-capacity magazines.
Here’s a closer look at the latest proposals and what the public had to say about them. 
Allowing towns to ban guns at polling places
In the spirit of Maine’s emphasis on local control, Rep. Poppy Arford (D-Brunswick) introduced LD 1743 that would allow municipalities to adopt an order, ordinance, policy or regulation that limits or prohibits firearms within its buildings and voting places and at public proceedings. The municipalities would be required to post the rule in a prominent location outside of all buildings.
Though local and state government proceedings can be contentious, Arford said people shouldn’t be deterred from engaging in those meetings or voting out of fear of someone bringing a firearm. 
Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, who is also running for governor next year, said towns should have the option to regulate firearms in polling places because there is often anxiety over threats to election workers that data collected by her office shows persist. 
“This may not be right for every municipality, but for some, it could be the right option, and we believe they should have the option,” she said, speaking in favor of the bill. 
Bellows was asked if she was concerned over this proposal restricting one right for the sake of exercising another. She said this didn’t concern her, comparing it to the First Amendment limitations that already exist at polling places so as to not influence other voters. 
Opponents argued that people intent on committing crimes aren’t deterred by gun-free zones. 
Restoring Second Amendment rights
Working a patrol shift in Piscataquis County, Rep. Chad Perkins (R-Dover-Foxcroft), who is a former law enforcement officer, said he was accosted by two people. He needed help, as his nearest back up was 15 minutes away, when a nearby community member came out to help Perkins get both individuals into custody. 
After the situation settled down, Perkins went back to thank the individual who helped him and found out that he was barred from his Second Amendment right to bear arms given the felony conviction on his record from a burglary he committed when he was a teenager. 
Perkins has met others in a similar situation, which is why he proposed LD 1009, a “restorative justice bill” that would provide an avenue to restore civil rights for a person convicted of a nonviolent felony after they have repaid their debt to society. The legislation stipulates that those rights can’t be restored until 10 years after any imposed sentence is completed. 
Perkins was asked if he would support a different approach to defelonize those nonviolent crimes, but he declined saying there needs to be a price to pay to bring justice for victims. However, the representative is open to the committee amending the aspect of his proposal that lays out the process to have one’s rights restored so long as it maintains the intent of the bill. 
The bill language currently excludes drug offenses from the list of convictions eligible for a person to have their rights restored. Perkins was asked about this and said he would not object if the committee decided it wanted to allow someone with a possession conviction to be included. 
Maine lawmakers weigh proposals to beef up firearm storage, hold agreements

The legislation currently asks the Department of Public Safety to review applications for a person to have their rights restored by looking at criminal history and other pertinent information. The department would then notify the courts, which would ultimately issue the order restoring the right. 
The department opposed the bill because of limited resources that would make it difficult to take on the additional workload. While the judicial branch testified neither for nor against the proposal, a representative pointed out that there is not a current electronic mechanism for the department to communicate this sort of information with the courts nor does the bill leave room for any judicial review. 
Security requirements for gun shops 
While praising the professionalism of the vast majority of gun shop owners in Maine, Rep. Amy Kuhn (D-Falmouth) introduced a bill to help federal firearm licensees comply with regulations and feel more equipped to safely do their jobs. LD 1821 would require the Department of Public Safety to adopt rules specifying minimum security requirements for shops. This could include alarm systems, surveillance cameras and record retention. 
Kuhn said other states have adopted similar measures, but she didn’t want to copy from them completely. Instead, she hoped to give the department a chance to craft rules that take into account the small business landscape in Maine. 
The bill also outlines required signage that would need to be posted by firearm dealers and at gun shows about background check requirements, suicide prevention resources and firearm safety course information. 
While proponents of the legislation said it offered a chance for differing views to work together on common firearm safety goals, multiple gun shop owners said it would be impractical and a cost burden, particularly the proposal for shops to keep surveillance footage for multiple years. 
Additionally, the Sportsman’s Alliance of Maine argued that the bill was unnecessary because many of the requirements either conflict or overlap with existing federal requirements. 
“ATF’s got this covered,” said Executive Director David Trahan, referring to regulations developed by the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.
Kuhn told the committee she was going to create a chart showing which requirements already exist in federal or state law to more clearly illustrate which of the bill’s proposals are new. 
The Department of Public Safety, as well as the Maine State Police, opposed the bill because the agencies said they do not have the capacity to undertake a rulemaking process or enforce the proposed provisions. 
Public health signage
Though guns are deeply rooted in Maine’s culture, Rep. Holly Stover (D-Boothbay) said they also pose a risk to public health, which is why she sponsored LD 1379. She referenced the announcement last June from then-U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy declaring gun violence a public health crisis. 
The proposal would require firearm dealers and gunsmithers to post warnings stating the risk of firearms to public health and that access to them increases the risk of suicide, domestic violence fatalities and unintentional deaths.
Stover argued this would not serve as a ban, but as an awareness and prevention measure similar to the labels found on tobacco products or alcohol that meet consumers at the point of sale. She also characterized this as one component of a comprehensive approach needed to prevent deaths and injuries from firearms. 
However, Justin Davis, state director for the National Rifle Association, said that idea has been used as a “political football” in recent years. He argued that Stover’s proposal would deter first-time buyers, rather than steer them toward gun safety training for responsible ownership. 
“That’s not gun safety, that’s gun avoidance,” Davis said. 
Disposition of forfeited firearms 
After asking the committee to kill one of her bills that contained a drafting error, Rep. Melanie Sachs (D-Freeport) introduced LD 411, which would require most forfeited guns in the state to be destroyed. 
Current law requires that firearms used in a murder or homicide be destroyed. Other firearms that are forfeited in the event of a crime are often auctioned off by the state. 
Sachs argued the bill does not demonize firearms, but seeks to address the difference between firearms used in crimes and those used responsibly. 
When asked about cutting off forfeited firearm auctions as a revenue stream from the state, Sachs pointed to the fiscal note on the bill that showed the minor cost incurred by the bill could be absorbed in the existing budget. 
Trahan, of the Sportsman’s Alliance of Maine who also spoke against this bill, said he would submit an amendment for the committee to consider that would redirect the revenue from state hosted firearm auctions to safe storage measures. 
Also testifying against the bill, Davis cautioned the committee against thinking that people who want to purchase firearms at a lower price — like they usually are at these auctions — do so with the intention of committing a crime. 
No one spoke in support of the bill during the committee meeting Thursday.

(Getty Images)Nearly all of Kentucky’s 171 public school districts have signed an agreement to adhere to the Trump administration’s new restrictions on diversity, equity and inclusion programs in public schools.
Only two school districts — Fayette and Jefferson counties — did not sign a form from the U.S. Department of Education  to certify their compliance with the Trump administration’s interpretations of civil rights law, according to documents from the Kentucky Department of Education. 
Sent last month, the federal agency’s certification form says that “any violation of Title VI — including the use of Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion (‘DEI’) programs to advantage one’s race over another — is impermissible” and using “certain DEI practices can violate federal law.” Title VI of the 1963 Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color and national origin in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance.
The school superintendents of Fayette and Jefferson counties instead provided alternative documents saying they comply with federal and state laws. Jefferson County has the state’s largest student enrollment, followed by Fayette County. 
KDE provided the documents to the Kentucky Lantern in response to an open records request. 
In a joint statement to news outlets last week about the district’s decision, Fayette County Public Schools Superintendent Demetrus Liggins and school board Chair Tyler Murphy said they “want to reaffirm that Fayette County Public Schools remains steadfast in our commitment to ensuring every student receives the support they need to thrive.” The statement said the decision was based on data about students’ needs within the district. 
“As we affirm each year, we continue to fully comply with the requirements of Title VI and all civil rights laws, not simply as a legal obligation, but as a reflection of who we are and what we stand for,” Liggins and Murphy said. “We will also continue to support and defend the programs that help our students — all of our students — reach their full potential. That is a commitment that has not and will not change.” 
Jefferson County Public Schools Superintendent Marty Pollio wrote in an April 22 letter to USED that “the schools within our district are in compliance with” federal law, including Title VI. A spokesperson told the Lantern that as of Thursday, JCPS had not received any further communication from USED regarding the form. 
Kentucky Education Commissioner Robbie Fletcher has previously said KDE signed the form a couple of weeks ago, but added the form “is not without issues,” in a message to superintendents across the state. KDE did not suspend or pause any of its existing programs since it received the form from USED. 
Fletcher also advised that “school districts should consult with board counsel on whether the district will sign the certification form.” 
One superintendent, Teresa Morgan of Hardin County Schools, pushed back on USED’s request to sign the form. 
“It is with great disgust and sadness that I am signing this document,” Morgan wrote in an addendum to the form. “The fact that federal funds would be withheld from our neediest students — simply because of a refusal to sign a document that serves to further divide our country — is deeply troubling.” 
Morgan declined to expand on her comment in an email Thursday morning. The federal form outlined possible consequences for a state or local education agency that protects a DEI program that violates the new federal guidance, including losing federal funding or facing a federal lawsuit. 
One school district that did sign the form, Bowling Green Independent Schools, did so “at the request of the Kentucky Department of Education commissioner,” said district spokesperson Leslie McCoy in an email to the Lantern. She added the district believes it is “in compliance with all state and federal nondiscrimination laws” and has not received further contact from USED about Title VI compliance. 
USED’s targeting of DEI practices comes as Republicans at the national and state levels seek to roll back such measures, particularly in education. The GOP-controlled Kentucky General Assembly passed a law earlier this year to ban DEI programs at Kentucky public universities and colleges. President Donald Trump signed an executive order aimed at eliminating DEI programs within the federal government shortly after he assumed office in January. 
The 2023 U.S. Supreme Court decision to strike down affirmative action in higher education admissions has further fueled backlash against DEI programs. That ruling is cited in the USED form K-12 school officials were asked to sign. 
In general, DEI initiatives focus on supporting marginalized people in areas where they have been historically excluded. But they’ve come under fire, and not just from the right, as discriminatory themselves. DEI programs, the U.S. Department of Education acting assistant secretary for civil rights wrote in a February letter, “frequently preference certain racial groups and teach students that certain racial groups bear unique moral burdens that others do not.”
Kentucky’s legislature has not outlawed DEI in public K-12 schools, although legislation was filed this year to do so. Sen. Lindsey Tichenor, R-Smithfield, filed bills that would have prohibited DEI initiatives in the state’s public schools as well as state and local governments. Neither bill got a committee hearing.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/hs-classroom-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-01 17:11:54.508082

The trio has a new podcast out called “House of Maher.” Courtesy photo via the Community News ServiceMaddie Lindgren is a reporter with Community News Service, part of the University of Vermont’s Reporting & Documentary Storytelling program.The “House of Maher” is what you get when you combine three crazy funny women with a knack for storytelling and an obsession with sister FaceTimes.It’s a one-of-a-kind, unfiltered podcast where sisters Ilona, Olivia and Adrianna Maher share everything from intimate life confessions to hilarious stories.Born and raised in Burlington, the Maher sisters bring their unique personalities and life experiences to the mic — and they are not scared to shy away from anything. From childhood birthday parties in grocery store aisles to big life questions about self-worth and mental health, the sisters have built a space where laughter and vulnerability go hand in hand.“We wanted to do it right,” said Adrianna Maher, a 2021 Castleton University graduate. “What inspired us was our sister’s video calls — we always have such a blast. I feel like we’re our funniest selves over FaceTime.”And that FaceTime energy is exactly what listeners get. One moment you’re listening to Adrianna’s feud with neon signs outside of restaurants, and in other moments you explore deep conversations around anxiety or how working out and having some time off for yourself can influence the lives of people.“We talk about literally everything,” Adrianna said. “I know how lucky I am to even be in a space where we have a podcast that people want to listen to. And so, it’s been a cool time. I’m very grateful for everything.”The Mahers are a close-knit family and each member brings a very different personality to the table. Ilona is the Olympic rugby player, huge social media personality and “Dancing with the Stars” runner-up. She brings confidence and quick sarcasm.Olivia is the oldest sister and also a Castleton graduate. She’s the creator of the viral “Girl Dinner” trend, is unapologetically quirky and very creative.Adrianna Maher is a New York City human rights activist with a gift for insight, and is the youngest of the three.The sisters may be spread all over the country — Ilona and Olivia in California, Adrianna in New York — but their bond has never been stronger. Their podcast is not just content; it’s a connection for them.“It was just kind of the perfect project to start together and just be able to be sisters even more,” Adrianna said.Vermont makes regular appearances — whether it’s heartfelt memories from their small-town childhood or shoutouts to quirky Vermontisms that only New Englanders will understand.“I’m always going to be a Vermonter. Vermont will always have my heart,” Adrianna said. “We had a really good public school education there, and my mom, Olivia, and I all went to Castleton.”Dave Blow, a professor of communications at Vermont State University Castleton who taught both Olivia and Adrianna at Castleton, isn’t surprised the trio is taking over the podcasting world.“Liv was very outgoing … she was everywhere,” Blow said. “She played guitar on the steps of Woodruff (Hall) and made up a song to the tune of ‘12 Days of Christmas.’ She was a lot of fun in class.”Blow said he remembers a blog assignment of Olivia’s for his feature writing class that had her classmates, and him, howling. She called the blog “Liv Sips,” which she would write after a glass of wine or two.“It was hilarious,” he said. “People were tuned in to hear what she had to say.”Adrianna, meanwhile, left a quieter but lasting impression, and her time at Castleton was marred by the COVID-19 pandemic.“She was deep, but also funny. One that sticks out to me was something she wrote for a COVID Chronicles blog about taking the senior year thing too far — doing puzzles at home like she was a senior citizen,” he said.Some of her entries for the class assignment were turned into a book by Blow called “COVID Chronicles.”Blow says what makes the Mahers special is their mix of humor, heart and authenticity.“They come across as this cool, normal-ish family with good values,” he said. “They’re good people, raised right. It’s one of the coolest things about being a professor — seeing students like them take off.”Blow isn’t the only teacher at Castleton who holds the Mahers in high regards.VTSU Castleton communications Professor Michael Talbott said he remembers having the sisters in class as well.“Liv was one of those students who was exceptional from the beginning, a great contributor to class work, really engaged, jumped at every opportunity, involved in everything,” Talbott said.The sisters’ dynamic is strong, thanks in part to their openness and communication.“We’re very vocal people,” Adrianna said. “So, if we have an issue, we’re not stewing on it. Let’s fix it. Let’s figure it out.”Their creative process shows the trust they have in each other.“It’s wonderful to work with them,” she said. “We already have such a great foundation together … there’s always a way we can figure anything out.”While Olivia and Ilona are more used to sharing their lives online, Adrianna admitted she’s more cautious.“I’ve always been very aware of privacy and anonymity,” she said. “Olivia and Ilona have already shared so much. So, they’re less afraid, but I’m getting the hang of it more.”Still, the sisters are committed to honesty and authenticity.“We’re telling our stories unfiltered — little thoughts and situations that remind people: everyone feels this way,” Adrianna said.That balance of serious and silly is what makes “House of Maher” feel like a hug — with a side of sass.“We want to build something lasting,” Adrianna said. “More seasons and more episodes that people can come back to — a place where our three voices shine.” Whether they’re diving into awkward dates, recounting bizarre moments, or tackling heavy topics with grace and grit, the Maher sisters are a trio you’ll want to hang out with again and again.“The House of Maher” is available now on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, YouTube and other podcast platforms.Read the story on VTDigger here:  A pair of Castleton University grads join Olympian sister in new podcast.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/House-of-Maher-2.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-01 17:11:54.508082

(Photo courtesy of the New Mexico Early Childhood Education and Care Department)New Mexico officials say Head Start remains stable for now in the state amid mounting concerns about federal efforts to dismantle the program. 
While Head Start funding has been an ongoing issue since the start of President Donald Trump’s second term, recent reports that the Trump administration seeks its elimination have ramped up pushback. 
On Monday, several Head Start providers and parent associations filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, along with Secretary Robert. F. Kennedy Jr., for unlawfully attempting to demolish Head Start programs and going against Congress’ mandate to operate such programs in the country.
“All parents deserve the opportunity to provide a better life for their children,” Candice Vickers, executive director of Family Forward Oregon, a plaintiff in the case, said in a statement provided by the ACLU. “Head Start gives children and families, including Black, Indigenous, Pacific Islander, Latinx, and immigrant children and families, a fair opportunity to work towards a better life. Taking this program away continues cycles of poverty and unfairly targets the children and families it was created to support.”
New Mexico Democrats U.S. Sens. Martin Heinrich and Ben Ray Luján signed onto a letter this week, along with 40 other U.S. senators, to Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. “demanding” that the administration unfreeze funding to Head Start programs and “reverse” mass firing of program employees. Luján frequently comments on his time in Head Start as a child, and points out that he is one of two Head Start graduates to serve in the U.S. Senate.
“Already this year, this Administration has withheld almost $1 billion in federal grant funding from Head Start programs, a 37 percent decrease compared to the amount of funding awarded during the same period last year,” the letter reads. “It is abundantly clear that these actions are part of a broader effort to ultimately eliminate the program altogether, as the Administration reportedly plans to do in its fiscal year 2026 budget proposal.”
The letter also points to a statement made by the National Head Start Association in February, which claimed that programs in 23 states that were awarded federal grants were having problems accessing the money. The association projects more programs have been impacted in the following months.
New Mexico, according to the state Early Childhood Education and Care Department’s  February 2025 fact sheet, has 2,233 funded Early Head Start slots for New Mexico children and 5,457 funded Head Start slots. Programs provide accessible childcare and prepare children up to 3 or 4 years of age from low-income families to enter school successfully. Programs also provide meals to children and access to community resources for families at no cost.
Thus far, they remain unaffected, officials told Source.
“New Mexico Head Start programs are still able to access funds, and we have had no reports of interruptions. We have been in close contact with our Head Start programs to ensure that services continue without disruption,” Julia Sclafani, spokesperson for New Mexico’s early childhood department, told Source NM in a written statement. “We are monitoring developments regarding the proposed closure of regional Head Start offices and any potential federal funding cuts.”
And while the future of Head Start programs is uncertain at this time, Sclafani added that “the State of New Mexico remains firmly committed to supporting early childhood services, including maintaining access to Head Start programs for children and families.”

(Sophie Nieto-Muñoz | New Jersey Monitor)PHILADELPHIA — A federal appeals panel heard arguments Thursday in a high-stakes legal battle over a controversial New Jersey law that bans immigration detention facilities run by anyone other than federal authorities, a move private prison companies say hampers the federal government’s immigration enforcement. 
Solicitor General Jeffrey Feigenbaum from the state Office of the Attorney General argued that the law doesn’t ban detention facilities altogether, and that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security or Immigration and Customs Enforcement could build or lease a facility and operate it themselves without it substantially interfering in enforcement efforts. 
“The law says consider what’s available, including to buy or lease private facilities. That’s the preference,” he said. “They can buy or lease facilities today and operate it themselves. They could buy or lease the Elizabeth Detention Center itself. And then if it’s not there, go build your own.”
At the heart of the case is a 2021 state law prohibiting private companies, as well as local, county or state governments, from renewing or signing new contracts to operate federal immigration detention centers. CoreCivic, the private prison company that runs the Elizabeth Detention Center, sued the state over the law, charging it violates the Supremacy Clause by interfering with immigration enforcement. The Elizabeth jail is the only facility statewide now in use for federal immigration detention.
A federal judge in 2023 struck down the part of the law that bars private companies from detaining immigrants, and the state appealed. That appeal was heard Thursday after 18 months of waiting — and on the heels of a different private company announcing plans to open a new immigrant jail in Newark. A decision is likely months away. 
During the two-hour hearing at the James A. Byrne United States Courthouse, the panel of three judges hammered both sides with tough questions. U.S. 3rd Circuit Judge Cheryl Ann Krause called it a “complex, very interesting case.”

Outside, activists gathered to voice support for immigrants in a legal fight expected to determine the scope of federal immigration detention in New Jersey. They held signs urging the government to “stop kidnapping people.”
Feigenbaum told the appellate judges that the law does not bar federal authorities from detaining immigrants in New Jersey. Instead, it just doesn’t allow them to contract the facilities to a private company. If Congress passed a law laying out “a private right to provide detention for a company like CoreCivic, then this is an easy case,” he said. 
“The way our law handles competing burdens on private interests is by letting Congress make that choice,” he said. 
U.S. 3rd Circuit Judge Stephanos Bibas peppered him with hypotheticals, like whether a state could ban the U.S. Mint from hiring private contractors to print money or prohibit defense contractors from building munitions for the Department of Defense. Feigenbaum said those cases would depend on how the hypothetical law is written. 
New Jersey’s law doesn’t regulate immigration detention — that’s  ICE’s job — but rather, the market for prison services, Feigenbaum emphasized.
CoreCivic’s team countered that the law would be a “nightmare” for immigration enforcement, which has ramped up dramatically under President Donald Trump’s second term in office. Without immigrant detention centers in North Jersey, close to international airports, federal authorities would have to detain people in other states and spend hours transporting them to further locales, said Bradley Simon, CoreCivic’s attorney.
“The federal government has exclusive jurisdiction over immigration enforcement, and this is putting a major, major roadblock in their efforts to do their jobs in the state of New Jersey and would absolutely have a catastrophic effect on the whole area,” he said. 
The judges questioned whether New Jersey’s law would increase the feds’ immigration enforcement costs. 
“If the New Jersey statute went into effect, it would have enormous cost, but it goes way beyond cost, the whole analysis, the impact it will have,” Simon said. 
Attorney McKaye Neumeister, representing the U.S. Department of Justice, said states can’t regulate the relationship between the federal government and companies it contracts with. She also noted the government uses private contractors “all the time, for all sorts of things.” 
“There are all sorts of functions that the government relies on contractors, for various reasons. The reasons here are in order to ensure flexibility and for cost savings,” she said. 
After the hearing, Dante Apaéstegui of the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice said he wasn’t persuaded by CoreCivic’s arguments that the law would wreak havoc. 
“I was baffled that they said the law would be the cause of separating families, the cause of separating communities — not the fact that there was a detention center there in our communities profiting off of their incarceration,” Apaéstegui said.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – The Oklahoma Senate on Thursday sent Gov. Kevin Stitt a bill that would bar obscene performances on public property or areas where minors are present despite concerns that it is unconstitutional and aimed at impacting drag shows.
House Bill 1217 makes it a crime to engage in adult performances, or to permit them, on public property where a minor could view them. Violators would be guilty of a misdemeanor subject to a fine of up to $1,000, one year in jail or both.
Sen. David Bullard, R-Durant, the Senate author, said the bill does not mention drag shows.
“If the behavior is obscene, regardless of dress, then it should not be allowed in front of minors,” Bullard said.
Critics said state law already prohibits obscene displays. They said the measure targets drag performances, the LGBTQ+ community and violates constitutionally protected free speech rights.
“Let’s be clear from the outset that House Bill 1217 is an anti-speech, anti-queer, anti-art bill masquerading as a protection against obscenity,” said Sen. Carri Hicks, D-Oklahoma City. “It does not use the word drag. But make no mistake. This bill is absolutely about drag.”
Opposing the bill is a “wink at corruption,” said Sen. Dusty Deevers, R-Elgin.
“We are living in a time where grown men parade around in lingerie and exaggerated prosthetics, performing in front of wide-eyed toddlers in public and at libraries, and some call that progress,” Deevers said. “That’s not progress. It is perversion. And Jesus calls it evil.”
Deevers asked why it is acceptable to arrest someone for exposing themselves at a park, but not when they “wear exaggerated prosthetics and gyrate in front of children.”
Sen. Mark Mann, D-Oklahoma City, said because the language is so broad, it could ban theatrical performances, cultural performances and cheerleading routines.
“What this is really about is one small group in our community, a group of our neighbors, making another small group in our community uncomfortable, and so we’re going to have a piece of legislation to go after one group because it makes another group uncomfortable,” Mann said.
Sen. Regina Goodwin, D-Tulsa, said there was a time when Elvis Presley, known for gyrating his hips, could only be videoed from the top up because some felt he was so sexually obscene that it was not good for public viewing.
The measure passed by a vote of 39-8.

(Raze photo)Raze, a youth-led program aimed at preventing youth smoking and vaping in West Virginia for more than 20 years, will end this summer because of state and federal funding cuts, the organization said Thursday. 
The program will run out of money June 30. Leaders have started to alert participating middle and high schools and adult advisors that there will be no more support for the program after that, said Chaste Barclay, director of health promotions for the American Lung Association, which supports the program.
“We are devastated that the administration in Washington and state leaders eliminated funding support for tobacco education programs for Raze youth and their schools,” the organization said in a statement Thursday. “Over the years, this program has saved lives and reduced the burden of tobacco use in youth. The program made incredible progress in reducing youth tobacco use in West Virginia, and we can’t allow funding decisions to reverse this progress.”
West Virginia has some of the highest rates in the country for adult and youth cigarette and e-cigarette use. In 2022, 21% of West Virginia adults smoked, according to the American Lung Association. That same year, 27.5% of teenagers in the state used electronic cigarettes, the organization said. 
West Virginia also has among the highest rates for tobacco-caused cancer deaths in the country. 
Raze received $315,000 for the 2025 fiscal year, Barclay said. The majority of the funding was from the federal government. That money came from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control’s Office of Smoking and Health, which was eliminated as of April 1. 
As for state funding, a spokeswoman for the House of Delegates said the state budget has not included a regular allocation for the Tobacco Education Program since 2017, and a governor has not requested funding for the program since then. The state may have provided the program with supplemental funds since then, she said. 
“[The American Lung Association] has been around for 120-plus years, and have worked through all the different administrations and the ups and downs,” Barclay said. “So it’s just unfortunate the timing. But we’ll continue to look for funding. Hopefully we can get it back in some way and be able to support it.”
This year, 1,558 West Virginia teens from 53 different groups participated in the Raze program, the organization said in the statement. Participants completed more than 1,600 tobacco education activities aimed at bringing awareness to the dangers of tobacco use using peer-to-peer education, the organization said. 
While the program started with the goal of preventing youth cigarette use, the main messaging from the program for years now has been preventing use of e-cigarettes and vapes, Barclay said. 
Without the program, Barclay said the state’s youth smoking and vaping rates will increase. The tobacco-related products keep changing, she said, and younger and younger kids are using them. 
“We’ve heard of fourth and fifth graders using [them],” she said. “So I think without that activism out there, and peer-to-peer education, which has been so successful in the past, I think we’re just going to see an increase in numbers. And so that’ll lead to future generations being addicted, and additional health issues down the line, and billions of dollars in health care.”
The organization called on Gov. Patrick Morrisey to include a tobacco prevention bill that died during the regular session on the call for a potential special legislative session this year. 
House Bill 3521 would have allocated $1.19 million from a state settlement with the vaping manufacturer Juul to tobacco education efforts in the state. The state settled with the company in 2023 for $7.9 million in a lawsuit that alleged the company targeted minors with their advertising. 
The bill passed in the 93 to 6 in the House of Delegates but was pending in the Senate finance committee when the session ended. 
“We urge Gov. Morrisey to include this legislation in a special session to ensure that the funding is used for its original intent and continues the good work we have done to reduce youth tobacco use in West Virginia,” the organization said. 
The governor’s office did not immediately return an email seeking comment Thursday.

The CT Mirror’s staff won six first place awards for government reporting, investigative reporting, data reporting, continuing coverage, general commentary, and arts, entertainment, food & leisure reporting. CT Mirror reporters also placed second or third in religion, business, education and in-depth local reporting. 
John Moritz and Emilia Otte, who recently joined the CT Mirror staff, were also honored as for their previous reporting for Hearst Connecticut Media and the Connecticut Examiner.
The judges of the journalism contest presented Andrew Brown and Dave Altimari with the Theodore Driscoll Award for Investigative Reporting for several stories that explained how state officials abruptly cancelled a Medicaid audit that was examining the fraudulent billing practices for a Connecticut eye doctor. 
The Theodore Driscoll Award is one of the CT SPJ’s top honors and is awarded to stories that contain information that is “not readily available to the news media or public.”
The judges described the reporting as “a dogged investigation” that “revealed that a politically connected eye doctor was the only medical provider to have a Medicaid audit canceled.” 
“Through persistent FOI requests and careful analysis, Brown and Altimari exposed this irregularity, prompting federal scrutiny and leading to criminal charges. Their crisp pacing and accessible storytelling brought clarity to a complex topic, transforming dense policy reporting into compelling public service journalism.”
The judges also bestowed the contest’s First Amendment Award on CT Mirror reporters Ginny Monk and Andrew Brown for coverage that revealed a string of alleged child abuse at an adolescent psychiatric treatment facility.
The First Amendment Award goes a story or series that “increases the public understanding of the role of the press in a free society.”
Monk and Brown spent more than a year requesting inspection records and other documents related to the Children’s Center of Hamden. The documents revealed how state officials were forced to repeatedly freeze admissions to the facilities because of reports of child neglect and abuse. 
The judges credited that story as an “excellent use of public records and human sources to expose abuses in a system intended to protect vulnerable children.”
“It’s always gratifying to be recognized by our peers, and this year was particularly special as we received awards for some of our most ambitious work,” said Executive Editor Elizabeth Hamilton. “The stories recognized this year by CT SPJ not only show the breadth of talent on the staff, they also demonstrate how critically important it is to have a robust, free press in this country. Congratulations, too, to all the journalists at other Connecticut news organizations who were recognized for their work this year.”
The other stories that were recognized as part of the contest highlight the range of the CT Mirror’s news coverage during 2024. The award winners included the following stories and columns:

(Screenshot | DNR)Gov. Tony Evers on Thursday made two appointments to the Natural Resources Board, the body that sets policy for the state Department of Natural Resources and has been the venue for a number of partisan disputes in recent years. 
Evers reappointed Bill Smith, the board’s current chair, to his seat and appointed former Vernon County conservationist Jeff Hastings. 
Smith was first appointed to the board in 2019 and worked for the DNR for more than 30 years. 
“Over the last several years, the Natural Resources Board has worked on high-profile issues that have captured the attention of the public, and I am glad for the opportunity to continue this important work and advocate for the issues that people across the state feel so passionately about — our state’s green spaces and natural environment,” Smith said in a statement. “My years of experience on the Board lend a unique perspective on the challenges we address as a body, and I am grateful to the governor for the opportunity to continue that work.” 
In addition to working for Vernon County, Hastings worked at Trout Unlimited, serving as project manager of its Driftless Area Restoration Effort to conserve cold water fish habitat in western Wisconsin. Hastings is replacing Marcy West, whose term expired Thursday. 
“I am thrilled to be able to translate my years of work in conservation to the efforts of the Natural Resources Board,” Hastings said. “It is an honor to take up this role, and I look forward to working together with my fellow members to best serve the interests of Wisconsinites and uphold the responsibility we share to preserve and protect our state’s natural resources and wildlife.”
Members of the seven-person Natural Resources Board serve staggered six-year terms to prevent all appointments being made during one governor’s term. Three members are required to be from the northern part of the state, three members must be from the southern part of the state and there is one at-large member. At least three members must have held a hunting, fishing or trapping license in seven of the 10 years before their nomination. 
While the governor appoints members to the board, the Republican controlled Senate confirms them. The board, which has say over hot button issues such as wolf management and water quality standards, has become a regular flash point in the divide between Evers and the Senate. 
Both Hastings and Smith will need to be confirmed to their seats, but state law allows them to fill the role in the meantime.
In 2021, Republicans in the Senate worked with former board chairman Frederick Prehn to keep him in his seat on the board for more than a year after his term’s expiration in an effort to keep appointees of Gov. Scott Walker in control of the board. 
In 2023, the Senate fired four of Evers’ appointees to the board and last year the Senate failed to confirm another Evers board nominee.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The American dream Maranda Kealy was promised as a kid is nowhere to be found, she said at a rally Thursday in Topeka attended by hundreds in a display of collective action against President Donald Trump’s second term.
“It’s not the one any of us were promised,” she said.
Kealy, a 22-year-old from the small town of Harveyville about 45 minutes southwest of Topeka, held a sign that read, “Dude: This is so not the American dream.”
“We were promised freedom and the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,” Kealy said, “but the administration has taken that to mean life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness for some people, not all.”
The political grassroots group 50501 organized the event in honor of International Workers’ Day, celebrated on May 1 along with the European holiday May Day. The same group convened weeks before on April 5 at the state Capitol for a day of action, drawing a crowd of thousands. Thursday’s protest was more modest, with a crowd of around 300.
Kealy works for the U.S. Postal Service, and she is a member of the LGBTQ+ community. Both were impetuses for her presence on the Statehouse grounds.
“Every American deserves due process. Every American deserves a chance to live the American dream, and every person deserves a chance to have their voice heard,” Kealy said.
A mishmash of anti-Trump, pro-Ukraine, anti-Putin, pro-democracy, anti-Elon Musk signs and American flags — both upside down and right side up — speckled the south lawn of the Kansas Statehouse as the event’s speakers railed against the Trump administration and the president’s supporters.
The event’s speakers included 50501 organizers, Overland Park Democratic Sen. Cindy Holscher, the vice president of chapter 66 of the National Treasury Employees Union in Kansas City, Daniel Scharpenburg, and the Rev. Nori Rost, a Unitarian Universalist minister in Lawrence and social justice advocate.

Scharpenburg’s union represents roughly 6,000 employees of the Internal Revenue Service.
“I don’t know if you’ve heard,” he said to the crowd, “but we are not OK.”
The IRS’s Kansas City office is facing the possibility of being halved, Scharpenburg said. He lobbed critiques at the Trump administration’s moves to clamp down on unions.
“I have to say, if they were not afraid of working people, they would not try to union bust, right?” he said.
The American Federation of Laborers and Congress of Industrial Organizations, an international federation of more than 60 unions, said May 1 is “the day the world celebrates the bravery of workers throughout history who have sacrificed for safety, dignity and justice on the job.”
“Our solidarity is our strength,” the AFL-CIO said in a Thursday message. “We take pride in knowing that we are a global movement standing up to the billionaires who are threatening our rights and freedoms.”
‘Not where I want to be’
Holscher reminded the crowd of the president’s promise to lower prices at the grocery store. The crowd laughed.
“It is quite apparent, however, in these first 100 days of the Trump administration, we have been sold a bill of goods,” Holscher said.
She criticized state Republican leaders, referring to them as MAGA extremists, for a handful of their decisions during the 2025 legislative session, including the creation of the Committee on Government Efficiency and their “assault” on public education funding.
She warned of Republicans sending Kansas “back to the deficit days of the Brownback administration.”
The rally was 61-year-old Army veteran David Beck’s first time participating in something like it.
“This is not where I want to be,” he said.
He lives about 90 miles from Topeka and was born and raised in southeast Kansas. Everything is at stake, he said.
“What hasn’t he harmed?” he asked, referring to Trump.

Tina Hallenbeck, of Alma, celebrated her birthday by protesting the “scary, scary things” she sees happening under the Trump administration.
She said she was especially concerned for her husband, a retired active duty Army Gulf War veteran and a federal employee with a year left to retire.
Hallenbeck appeared at the Capitol dressed in the red uniform of “The Handmaid’s Tale,” the 1985 novel by Margaret Atwood about a near-future dystopia where women are forcibly assigned to produce children.
“It feels like it makes a statement. Somebody’s going to see this,” Hallenbeck said. “Today, May Day, it’s my birthday, I’m 58 years old, and this is what I’m doing today, and it’s a shame that I have to be, but I have to be. We have to be vigilant. We can’t have 1930s Germany in the United States.”
