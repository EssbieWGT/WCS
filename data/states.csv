For the past 30 years, it’s been clear: Native American children in Washington state are far more likely to be arrested and jailed than white kids. 
The state’s courts and Washington Department of Youth and Families have acknowledged the justice system continues to hold back Native American youth, funding committees and producing action plans to address racial inequities in the juvenile legal system. Advocates have called for fewer arrests, many of which are discretionary. Lawmakers have demanded more data on juvenile arrests.
Yet the gaps have continually worsened. Data from the nonprofit Sentencing Project and the federal Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention from 2019-23, the most recent available, shows that Native American children in Washington are more than 4.5 times more likely to be incarcerated than their white peers on average, up from 2.7 times more in 2001.
“As long as we’ve looked at data for Washington state, Native youth are much, much more likely to be incarcerated than their white peers,” said Joshua Rovner, a senior research analyst and the former youth policy director for the Sentencing Project, which researches incarceration nationwide.
While all youth of color experience unequal treatment in Washington state’s legal system, the inequities among Native American youth are especially stark, exceeding national averages, particularly for nonviolent offenses.
Indigenous children are significantly more likely to be jailed than their white peers in Washington, especially on the lowest level offenses and nonviolent crimes, Rovner said. Even when youth exit the system, courts are more inclined to send them back if they slip up.
Though there aren’t disparities in arrests and referrals present in every county of the state, the gaps, where they do exist, are so great they have shaped the statewide numbers.
In rural counties like Whitman County, the problems are worse — Native American children there are nearly seven times more likely to be arrested than white children, the largest disparity in the state based on 2023 data.
In Okanogan County, near the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, Native American children made up 52% of all juvenile arrests in 2022 despite only 8% of the county’s population being Native American. Colville citizens and lawyers representing those kids say many in the community feel that they are unfairly targeted by state law enforcement — pointing to high rates of discretionary searches of Native American drivers and traffic cameras directed at main roads on and off tribal land.
Even before they’re convicted of a crime, Native American children are 6.4 times more likely to be kept in detention than white children. After being tried in court, they’re 6.1 times more likely to be kept in custody rather than being given opportunities to serve their sentence in the community.
Advocates and those who work alongside young people in the state say the disparities are partly the result of structural racism in the criminal legal system rather than an intrinsic difference in behavior.
“I do not know what the solution is,” said Suzanne Hayden, an attorney with the Clallam County Public Defenders office and the sole attorney in the county who works with youth. “I don’t know how to make it different, unless I, you know, call the judge on his rulings afterwards and say, ‘Well, Your Honor, you were really racist.’”
Seattle lawyer Gabe Galanda, an Indigenous rights attorney, advocate and a citizen of the Round Valley Tribe, said Native Americans in Washington are also frequently unable to afford their own representation, and some Indigenous kids go through the system without the support of a parent or guardian.
“They’re going it alone,” Galanda said.
 Overpoliced

As a teenager, Derrick Belgarde was himself stuck in the revolving door of youth incarceration.
“I spent so much time in (detention), I was in and out, in and out, in and out for probation violations,” said Belgarde.
It took years of fighting the unrelenting beast of alcohol addiction — and the support of a rehab program that understood his culture and needs — for Belgarde to make his way to sobriety.
Now, in both his family and community, he sees how young people who lacked proper help and support during their formative years continue to struggle as adults to break that cycle.
“It was like a machine,” Belgarde said. “And it creates more harm than good.”
For kids trying to get on the right path, jail can start to feel like a never-ending cycle, according to Belgarde, a citizen of the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians and executive director at the Chief Seattle Club, a Native American-led housing and support services organization.
Early court involvement is closely linked to broader social and health inequities, research shows. Children drawn into the justice system often face poverty, unstable housing and limited access to mental health support, creating a cycle of disadvantage that persists into adulthood.
Belgarde’s repeated arrests caused rifts between him and his mother, who at one point threatened to sue the court system for disruptions in the family.
“It was ruining the household,” Belgarde said.
Native American children are disproportionately more likely than white kids to get caught up in that system.
Though they’re 2.5 times more likely to be arrested for a violent crime, Indigenous children are seven times as likely to be charged for nonviolent property crimes, according to 2023 data from the federal Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention.
Inside a youth prison in Marion County, Oregon, harsh conditions intensified Belgarde’s feelings of isolation and despair.
“It was very traumatizing,” he said. “It was very horrendous, and I can see how other kids probably got very damaged from going in and out of that place.”
Advocates say Native American kids are also disproportionately arrested for charges where officers are not mandated by law to make an arrest, such as for obstruction of justice, which is when a person is accused of hindering or delaying a law enforcement officer in doing their duties. 
“Obstruction [of justice] especially is, I feel, the most abused,” said Allie Steinberg, the diversion workshop coordinator with CHOOSE 180, an organization that provides diversion services to young adults in Pierce and King counties.
She added that overpolicing of communities of color leads to more discretionary arrests.
“Maybe nothing illegal actually happened, but the police officer was like, ‘I don’t like the way that you’re talking to me’ or ‘I’ve had a bad day.’”
Washington’s Department of Children, Youth and Families, which oversees the state’s juvenile incarceration system, faces serious overcrowding and complaints of mistreatment at its juvenile rehabilitation facilities, particularly Green Hill School, the state’s only facility equipped to handle boys and young men between the ages of 16 and 25. In an effort to alleviate overcrowding, the child welfare agency has been regularly transferring some incarcerated young people to minimum-security adult prisons. 
 Higher standards

Indigenous children are not only more likely to enter the justice system than white kids, but data shows Indigenous children have less room for error, even after they’ve been released.
“There have been white kids who go in front of a judge for probation violations, and the kids are saying, ‘Just give me another chance, I can prove this to you,’ and those kinds of things,” Hayden said. “And to my amazement and surprise, the judge will say, ‘OK.’”
But Hayden said this summer she had a Native American client sent back to jail over a probation violation, despite the child writing a three-page letter explaining his situation and promising to improve, which the child’s probation officer refused to read. 
“He wouldn’t even give this kid the respect of reading an incredibly well written, well thought out letter, and just went through a litany of everything this kid has ever done wrong in his life,” she said.
Hayden asked for a week for the kid to demonstrate improvement, but the judge refused. The child was sent back to jail for 30 days.
“As far as I was concerned, the court system had just told this kid, ‘We don’t believe what you have to say. We don’t care how well you say it. We don’t have any hope for you. So go sit in detention,’” Hayden said. “I’m appalled that that just happened. … I was so incensed in court that this guy wouldn’t even read the letter.”
Hayden says the boy received “very little” help with community re-entry
According to 2023 data from the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, Indigenous juveniles in Washington are nearly 30 times more likely to be sent back to detention over an administrative probation violation, like missing a check-in with their probation officer, than white children. 
Wanda Bertram, communications strategist for the Prison Policy Initiative, a nonprofit research group that advocates against incarceration, said the fact that Washington is jailing children over these violations is striking.
“These aren’t even crimes, right?” Bertram said. “These aren’t reasons for kids to be locked up.”
For Hayden, the court failed to look at the full picture of the child’s case before sending him back to jail, she said. 
“I was very upset at the judge for not giving this kid just a one week bump,” Hayden said. “You know, let him show what he can do in one week — he did it for all the little blue-eyed blondes.”
Despite growing evidence that children, particularly those accused of nonviolent crimes, do better in the future when given alternatives to jail like therapy and anger management, Indigenous children are offered fewer opportunities to do so.
“There’s no outcome where formal court processing does better for these kids,” Rovner said. 
 Starting in schools 

School can be another entry point into the criminal legal system, and Native American students in Washington are suspended and expelled at rates significantly higher than their white peers. Despite reforms aimed at promoting equity, statewide discipline data show a continuing trend of exclusionary practices.
In some districts, like Okanogan County, the connection between truancy and juvenile court is particularly stark. Truancy involves long-term, frequent and unexcused absences from school, and if classroom interventions to improve attendance don’t work, a child can be sent to court for it, at the behest of the school district.
Nearly 41% of truancy cases in the county involve Native American youth, primarily from the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, many of whom face barriers like a lack of transportation to school or mental health support. 
Belgarde was assigned a truancy officer in high school, who checked in on his school attendance and saw he was home by a curfew.
It didn’t work, and he kept struggling with school, skipping classes and feeling isolated. These patterns contribute to higher dropout rates and place Native American youth on a trajectory for greater risk of incarceration later in life. According to Washington’s child welfare agency, dropping out of school triples the likelihood of future involvement in the criminal legal system.
Belgarde dropped out of school himself, started working and became a young father by 18.
“When they let me off, I left home, but I didn’t have nowhere to go,” he said.
Native American children make up 26% of the state’s truant children despite making up around 1% of the school population, and they have the highest rate of truancy cases sent to juvenile court in the state, at roughly 10%.
Many Indigenous families have a historical mistrust of school and state systems based on prior abuses of Indigenous children in residential boarding schools and forced separations of Indigenous families by the federal government. When families don’t appear in court for truancy allegations, children are at risk of being placed under state supervision or referred for formal court charges, deepening their contact with the legal system.
Natalie Welch, a citizen of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians and the executive director of Rise Above, a Seattle-based nonprofit dedicated to empowering Native American youth, said that providing Native American children with increased support and community connections helps keep them out of the legal system.
“It’s a smart investment to put this money into helping kids upfront instead of trying to solve the problems on the backend,” Welch said.
Rise Above has partnered with school districts with high rates of truancy among Native American students to provide incentives for kids to show up to class. Her organization works with local businesses, schools and organizations to offer free sports clinics, mentorship and community involvement opportunities. Improving accessibility to such programs, particularly for middle school-aged students who are at a critical stage in their development, is important for avoiding bad behavior, she said.
“We’re trying to be there so they build that trust before anything bad happens,” Welch added.
 Left out of reforms

Advocates for Native Americans say Washington lawmakers should revisit a number of reforms, like considering tribal notifications for Indigenous youth involved in a juvenile court case or addressing specific statutes that youth of color are disproportionately charged with.
Still, data gaps exist that limit the understanding of the true scope of disparities involving Native American youth.
Tribal affiliation isn’t regularly recorded when youth are arrested, and courts aren’t required to alert tribes when their youth enter state court systems. That limits any potential cross-jurisdictional collaboration that could connect Native American youth to tribal resources for mental health, substance use or behavioral issues.
Hayden, the public defender, said that in her experience, tribes can step up to provide resources, like housing support or counseling, for kids in a tough spot.
Race data reported to the state and federal government to track youth in the system is typically collected through self-identification or through law enforcement officials’ estimates, which may undercount Native American youth or lump them into a “multiracial” category.
Washington has enacted broad juvenile justice reforms in recent years like allowing juvenile courts to retain jurisdiction until a person is aged 25 for crimes committed before they turned 18, expanding mandatory diversion for children accused of first-time, low-level offenses and ending the automatic use of juvenile “points” during sentencing, which can increase a child’s time in jail and impact sentencing decisions if they’re later charged as an adult.
But measures to explicitly address the disparities Native American children face in the justice system have been few — and recent efforts to address the inequities stemming from past use of juvenile points have died in the Washington Legislature, despite significant endorsement from advocates and groups representing tribes.
In the 2025 session, House Bill 1274 would have allowed for the resentencing of adults whose sentences were influenced by juvenile points, meaning crimes they committed as youths lengthened their sentence as an adult for a different crime. Tribal officials and advocates say Native American people in Washington are disproportionately impacted by the sentencing practice, which effectively punishes people a second time.
The Affiliated Tribes of Northwest Indians, an organization representing the interests of 54 tribal governments in the Northwest, and the American Civil Liberties Union have repeatedly called on the Legislature to change this process, pointing to how Native Americans are disproportionally impacted.
“Overly long state prison sentences resulting from incorrect choices made by Indigenous persons when they were juveniles diminish their hope for forgiveness, redemption, rehabilitation, return to their families, and reentry into their communities,” according to a 2023 resolution by the group.
Although HB 1324 eliminated the automatic application of juvenile points in 2023,  the bill wasn’t retroactive — leaving around 420 Native American people in the state’s prisons whose sentences were lengthened because of points as of 2023, and later bills to make the law retroactive have failed. That’s unlikely to change anytime soon. Advocates like Galanda say there’s little appetite in Olympia to pass legislation in the coming session that would allow their resentencing due to budget constraints.
Some Washington lawyers who work with Native American clients say the state is missing a critical opportunity to notify tribal governments that their minor citizen is involved in a state court case, which could allow the tribe to intervene with meaningful assistance, like legal, financial or spiritual support. A similar mechanism exists under the Indian Child Welfare Act, but for child custody cases.
“There’s really no good news story here because youth of color are treated more harshly than their white peers whenever the system touches them,” Rovner said.

“The senses are very much intensified. And so too are the experiences between people magnified. I think people are more open,” said John Miller, a photographer who documented hunting camp culture in the Northeast Kingdom.

As a young boy, Ben Osha watched his dad and grandfather head off to the backwoods of Orange County, where his family has maintained property since the 1970s, in search of bucks. 
“I remember always seeing the Johnson Wool red checkered shirts heading out to deer camp and thinking ‘I want to do that,’” he said.  “Magically they come back and they have a racker, and you’re like, ‘Whoa!’”
When he got old enough, Osha, now 24, went from hunting the family farm to joining the men at camp. 
“Going from watching it happen to being included, it’s so much more meaningful,” he said. “Each year you’re granted a little more responsibility.”
In Vermont, where almost 1-in-8 people hunt, the 16-day rifle deer season is a collective experience on par with Town Meeting Day or the emergence of black flies in May. For many, the season is defined by a trip to camp. It’s a ritual and coming of age opportunity passed between generations, sacred to those who spend the weeks reconnecting with family and the mountains. 
Though hunters have had the opportunity to harvest deer with a bow for weeks, rifle season, running Nov. 15-30, is far and away the most popular hunting season of the year. Pickup trucks gather at general stores with deer draped on tailgates. Onlookers gawk at the wide-racked bucks hoisted in the air, guessing the final weight as the scales tick upward. 
For some Vermonters, rifle season is their one annual vacation. Families gather not just for the Thanksgiving holiday but in the woods, disconnected from the internet and inaccessible without four-wheel drive. To better find deer, many pray for snow — a wish Mother Nature seems to have granted this year.

Osha, director of workforce and training for the Vermont branch of the Associated General Contractors, said the joy of camp is in the family connection and the quiet of the woods. Those same qualities, far away from the overstimulation of a noisy job site, make the deer hunting tradition important to many contractors and tradespeople, he said. 
“When you look at the construction season, spring and summer is go go go,” Osha said.“Deer season for a lot of these contractors is a time to mentally recharge and kind of get themselves centered again, because you’re alone. The only person you have to talk to is yourself.”
At camp, that time away is heightened. 
“It’s very surreal: The ability to not only be in the wilderness all day but come back to camp and sleep in the wilderness,” Osha said. 
‘To be a child again’
Hunting culture in Vermont — and the Northeast more broadly — revolves around the tradition of deer camps, setting it apart from other regions of the country. 
The phenomenon has drawn anthropological interest from those interested in the unique annual bonding ritual. 
Growing up in Coventry in the 1950s, photographer John Miller remembers people heading out of villages and off to camp during November. They seemed to him to be drawn into the woods by an almost animal urge that accompanied the changing of the seasons.
In the 1980s and 90s, he returned to the area to photograph and study deer season and its people, transforming his observations into the book, Deer Camp: Last Light in the Northeast Kingdom.
“It’s a time of pause from everyday life, spending so much time in the woods by yourself, listening, observing,” Miller, who lives once again in the Northeast Kingdom, said. “The senses are very much intensified. And so too are the experiences between people magnified. I think people are more open.”
That openness earned Miller invitations into deer camps across the Northeast Kingdom, where he documented the families, the antlers and the outhouses of those two November weeks.

The images and accompanying narrative depicting the camps offered a rare window into these secretive backwoods fraternities of 30 years ago, where most would rather stay mum than tell a reporter which ridge holds the biggest bucks.
Explaining the draw of camp life in his book, Miller found himself enchanted by the same forces that attracted his subjects. 
“I am here for similar reasons: to enjoy companionship in a place and time removed from the everyday, repetitive monotony of home, with its responsibilities and stress. To be a child again, curious, open, frightened, and in good physical condition,” he wrote. 
The deer hunting tradition, Miller contended, is one of independence. 
“People here, hunters, (they) want their young people to learn how to survive and take responsibility for generating food,” he said. “Many of the people I’ve worked with, they hunt, they garden, they freeze, they dry, they fish.”
And even for those that didn’t hunt, the 16-day season did not pass unnoticed in 1980s and 90s, with corners of the state shutting down. Miller recalled having his roof replaced one fall, only to find the workers had covered the half-finished project in plastic and decamped to the woods until the Monday after Thanksgiving, when rifle season was over.   
Today, while some small businesses sign off for those two November weeks, others thrive. Deep in Essex County — the heart of deer camp country — David T. Leidy owns the Lake View Store. The shop sits near the Norton-Averill line, two towns with scarcely more than 100 permanent residents combined.
Between Labor Day and rifle season, Leidy might only see one or two people a day. But that will change starting Saturday.

“It’s almost like a county fair,” Leidy said of deer season and the winter months. “There aren’t many bad moods.”
The Lake View Store serves as a big game reporting station, and Leidy said people come to weigh their deer from as far west as Jay and as far south as Burke. The 16 days brings more company than business — snowmobile season is the real money maker, Leidy said — but he enjoys the tradition of November, as people head up to camp in search of deer. 
“Especially if it’s like a son or a grandson, everyone’s very excited,” Leidy said, describing the weighing process, which he might do 100 times a season.  “And I’m excited right there with them, I can’t help it.”
Central to all of it is snow, which many hunters rely on to track down a buck. 
Asked how important snow is to Essex County’s deer season and his business in the winter months, Leidy laughed: “That’s like saying how important is sunshine to the crops.”
Camp culture wanes — and changes, too 
Though many deer camps live on, Miller, the tradition’s chronicler, said the heritage has declined for a slew of reasons, not least a general decline in Vermonters who hunt. Land and property maintenance are expensive, he said, and some camp owners lost their land leases when thousands of acres of paper company land turned into the Silvio O. Conte National Fish and Wildlife Refuge in Essex County. In other cases, people’s interests changed, according to Miller, or the patriarch of a family died. 
Often, the camps were places for two or three generations of men — warmed by wool and woodstoves — to swap stories, cook and play cards.   
“The nurturing would often take place between a grandfather and a grandson, or an uncle and a nephew,” Miller recalled of the unique intimacy of deer season.  

The male-dominated camp culture is apparent to Cheryl Frank Sullivan, a research assistant professor and entomologist in the University of Vermont’s Department of Agriculture, Landscape, and Environment, who started hunting in college. 
“I’ve never been exposed to the camp culture of hunting, and I’m very envious of that traditional camp culture,” she said. “Historically, and even now, it’s always been very male dominated. I think it’d be really cool if there was a camp of women.”
But Sullivan said that history is changing, and she participates in programs that introduce women to hunting, like Doe Camp Nation.  
Camp or not, Sullivan has found joy and success in deer hunting, harvesting bucks in the Midwest and New England. Deer hunting — particularly bowhunting — is a rare opportunity for her to step away from a busy life. 
“I live, eat, breathe, sleep bowhunting for whitetails,” she said, noting the preparation and scouting that makes the hobby a year-round endeavor.  
Sullivan prefers the challenge of bowhunting, the steps needed to have a deer walk within 30 yards, but she walks the woods with a rifle, too. Already this fall she’s had successful hunts in Illinois and New York, and she plans to hunt Vermont’s rifle season this weekend.  
While coworkers take time off to head for warmer climes, for Sullivan, each fall is marked by multiple “hunt-cations.” 
“I can disconnect from my phone and my computer, and I can just go sit in the woods,“ she said. “It’s really the only place I can go and be left alone.”

(Photo: Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)The Summerlin film studio bill currently under consideration by the Nevada State Legislature is expected to lead the state to a fiscal cliff in 2030, according to a fiscal analysis presented to lawmakers by their nonpartisan staff.
The fiscal projections were discussed during an Assembly committee hearing Thursday and have sparked much debate behind the scenes, but the complete set of numbers have not previously been made available to the public.
A copy shared with the Nevada Current shows that expanding the availability of transferable tax credits for film productions to $120 million per year beginning in 2029 will create a $62.1 million structural deficit for the state in fiscal year 2030.
The state is required to maintain a 5% ending fund balance. Legislative Counsel Bureau analysts project the transferable tax credits would result in the state being $102.6 million short of that requirement in 2030.
Assemblymember Selena La Rue Hatch, a fierce opponent of the bill who forced a surprise vote that almost killed the film studio bill in the first few hours of the special session, said she believes lawmakers will wind up having to make painful budget cuts in a few short years.
Nevada Legislative Counsel Bureau fiscal projections
The Legislative Counsel Bureau is the nonpartisan staff of the Legislature. They do not advocate for or against bills, which lawmakers often see as lending them credence over lobbyists and paid consultants pitching the project.
A separate analysis commissioned by supporters of the film studio project found that for every $1 of transferable tax credits the state received just 22 cents back in direct revenue.
Such fiscal analyses are driving much of the opposition to the bill, which is expected to be voted on by the full Assembly on Sunday.
On Saturday, Assemblymember Sandra Jauregui, the chamber’s majority leader and a sponsor of the studio bill, made a motion to declare AB5 an emergency measure. That would have allowed the chamber to immediately vote on the bill and send it to the state Senate for consideration. That motion needed to pass with a two-thirds majority and failed 26-16.
Despite the potential to majorly impact the state budget, the film studio bill only needs a simple majority to pass because it does not raise revenue.
A vote on a previous version of the film studio bill passed the Assembly 22-20 in the final days of the 2025 Legislative Session.
Getting and spending
The Legislative Counsel Bureau’s projection that the state is headed toward a fiscal cliff if it passes the film studio bill assumes that both state spending and state revenues increase by 3% every year.
If state revenues overperform, or if the state spends less, a fiscal cliff could be avoided. A table compiled by LCB shows that if state revenue grew by 4% and spending remained at 3%, there would be a $142.5 million surplus for the state.
Nevada Legislative Counsel Bureau state revenue and spending projections.
Without the massive expansion of the film tax credit program, the state is projected to have a $57.9 million structural surplus in 2030.
LCB staff told lawmakers during the Assembly committee hearing that over the past eight years state spending averaged 5.3%.
But that average includes the “unprecedented” cost of living adjustments for state employees made in 2024 and 2025. In those years, the expenditure growth rate was in the double digits.
With those fiscal years removed as outliers, the average expenditure growth rate was 2.9%.
Opponents of the bill argue that the state is facing additional expenditures as a result of federal policy changes, particularly to major programs like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
As for state revenue growth, LCB staff told lawmakers the eight-year average was 5.7%.
But that includes the post-pandemic fiscal year 2022, which had an expenditure growth rate of 22%. If you exclude that as an outlier, the average of the other seven most recent years is 3.4%.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSC08352-scaled-e1763298711940-1024x602.jpg,,,2025-11-16 08:56:30.875796

Nevada lawmakers responded Saturday by unanimously passing legislation to create a state program that would temporarily support nearly 500,000 Nevadans who depend on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in the event of another shutdown. 
The bill, SB 3, establishes the Silver State General Assistance Program under the Division of Social Services which would allow the state to quickly divert general funds to cover lapses in federally funded public assistance programs.
It was the first Senate bill to make it out of both chambers of the legislature during a jam-packed special session. The bill passed unanimously in both the Senate and the Assembly, and will now head to Gov. Joe Lombardo’s desk for final approval.
“Federal shutdowns and federal program disruptions are no longer hypothetical,” said Democratic Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro during a committee hearing on the bill. “I believe that this is not the first time that we will see this sort of political gamesmanship result in damage to Nevada’s families, and we have to be in a position where we can respond quickly and efficiently.”
Similar programs in other states allowed them to respond more quickly to the withholding of SNAP benefits by the Trump administration. 
“About half of U.S. states have general assistance programs. We did not have one. We had never needed one until this crisis hit,” said Robert Thompson, administrator for the Division of Social Services.
The program would only be triggered under strict conditions, including a gubernatorial declaration of an “extraordinary circumstance.” The state program would determine eligibility and distribute funds using data from existing means-tested public assistance programs like SNAP, Medicaid, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, and the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program.
Debbie Reynolds, deputy chief of staff to Gov. Lombardo, emphasized the program would only provide temporary aid to supplement lapses in federal funding for public assistance programs like the one created by the record-breaking federal shutdown. 
“The intent of this proposal is not to create a permanent entitlement program. It’s not to duplicate federal programs. It’s to ensure that it has a lawful and operational bridge when federal or other aid systems fail that can be implemented quickly,” Reynolds said. 
During the shutdown, the Trump administration refused to use available contingency funds set aside by the U.S. Department of Agriculture for emergencies to fund SNAP, even though those funds could have covered about half of the $8 billion needed for November benefits.
It was the first time in the program’s 60-year history that contingency funds were not used to ensure that SNAP benefits continue without interruption.
Congressional lawmakers sent a letter to Lombardo urging the governor to do more to ensure Nevadans received SNAP benefits during the prolonged government shutdown, including holding a special session to use state funding to hold up the program. 
The Trump administration told Nevada officials it was against federal regulations for the state to tap into the personal data from the SNAP program to provide substitute cash assistance because the state does not have an existing general cash assistance program at the state level.
“With this bill we will be able to access – for lack of a better term – our own data. We had the data, we just did not have a legal authorization to use the data,” Thompson said.
Without a dedicated general assistance program the governor and legislators responded to the lapse in SNAP funding by quickly funneling nearly $40 million in emergency aid to local food banks in hopes fewer Nevadans would go hungry.
Food bank operators warned lawmakers that the charitable food sector would not have the capacity to fill the hole left by disruptions to SNAP funding. For every meal that food banks provide, SNAP provides nine.
Full funding for SNAP only returned to states after the House voted to approve a funding bill that reopened the government after 43 days. President Donald Trump signed the bill later that afternoon.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSC08093-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-16 08:56:30.875796

BESSEMER — When Yale biologist Thomas Near and members of his research team visited the Yellowhammer State in October, the state’s famous Dreamland BBQ wasn’t the only thing on the agenda, though it was high on the list.
During their trip, the researchers documented the existence of the Birmingham darter, a newly identified fish species, just downstream of the site of a proposed 4.5 million square foot hyperscale data center, the construction of which Near said would put the already imperiled species at risk of extinction.
On Thursday, based in part on Near’s research, the Center for Biological Diversity, a national environmental nonprofit, filed a petition with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service asking that the agency list the Birmingham darter as an endangered species under the Endangered Species Act, providing the fish the legal protections experts have said its precarious existential position demands. The federal agency has 90 days to respond to the nonprofit’s petition and decide “whether the petition presents substantial scientific or commercial information indicating that the petitioned action may be warranted.”

Developers of the proposed data center have previously asserted that the species is not present on its project site, though neither council members nor the project’s developers have publicly released any environmental assessments related to the project.
The Bessemer City Council is scheduled to vote on final approval of Project Marvel on Tuesday at 9 a.m.
A representative of the developer did not respond to a request for comment on this story.
The presence of the darter is not the only problem ahead for those behind the project. The director of the Alabama Department of Transportation has notified the engineers of the data center proposal, known as Project Marvel, that the current plans for the data center campus conflict with plans for the Northern Beltline, a multi-billion dollar highway project that state and federal officials have pushed for years.
These updates—on both the Birmingham darter and the Northern Beltline—present potential obstacles for Logistic Land Investment, LLC, the developer pushing the data center project, and provide a potential lifeline for nearby residents, who are almost universally opposed to the massive construction project slated for their backyards.

‘All fecal matter rolls downhill’

Near is no stranger to the Birmingham darter. He was part of theresearch team that first identified the small, colorful fish as a species distinct from other, similar species that live in the surrounding areas of north-central Alabama.
Now, Near said he and his colleagues have done the necessary field work to show that the fish, scientific name Etheostoma birminghamense, is present in Little Blue Creek, which flows through the site of the proposed hyperscale data center in Bessemer, a suburb just southwest of Birmingham.
“They’re there,” Near said of the Birmingham darter on Monday. “And anything that happens upstream is going to have an effect on them.”

Near and his colleagues were unable to visit the data center site itself, which is privately owned, but the biologist said there’s little doubt that if the development moves forward, it could put the newly identified species at risk of extinction.
“It’s a crude saying, but all fecal matter rolls downhill,” Near said. “Every impact on the headwaters of Little Blue Creek will have impacts downstream.”
Given what is known about data center construction and operations, Near said, those impacts could include increased turbidity from construction and thermal pollution—an increase in the temperature of the stream that could completely extirpate the population of darters the researchers have now documented in Little Blue Creek.
In a previous interview with Inside Climate News, Near said the data center’s construction would “nuke” Little Blue Creek. “My assessment remains the same,” he said Monday. “And now it’s bolstered by the validation that the species indeed occurs in the creek.”
It’s also possible, Near said, that construction of the data center campus, slated to include 18 buildings, each the size of a Walmart Supercenter, could also put species like the watercress darter, already listed as endangered under federal law, at risk. Part of that risk comes from the possibility that developers may “dewater” aquifers beneath the site in order to level and stabilize the land for construction, Near said.
There’s a lot we don’t know about the data center, Near added, given the lack of transparency from developers and public officials alike. Bessemer’s mayor and city attorney, as well as at least one taxpayer-funded economic development staffer, have signed non-disclosure agreements related to the project.
“It’s shocking,” Near said. “I never fathomed a public servant could be beholden to a non-disclosure agreement. It’s just distasteful.”
Near said he accepts that there are cases where development that “improves the human condition” can be put ahead of the goal of preserving biodiversity: “This just doesn’t seem to be one of those cases.”
The Center for Biological Diversity’s petition requesting endangered status for the Birmingham darter is based in part on Near’s findings and on Inside Climate News’ reporting. The fish currently lacks protection because it has only been identified as a distinct species in the last few years.
Will Harlan, Southeast director for the nonprofit, said that listing the fish as endangered under federal law is critical to preventing the darter’s extinction.
“These phenomenal fish will slide further toward extinction if this data center is built, so we have to act fast,” Harlan said. “They’ve been swimming in these creeks for millions of years, but without immediate protections, they’ll disappear forever.”
The petition outlines the threats to the darter, including the proposed data center, and also points to a 2025 draft assessment by Alabama officials placing the Birmingham darter in its P1 category of “highest conservation concern,” meaning the fish is “critically imperiled and at risk of extinction or extirpation.”

Charles Miller, policy director at the Alabama Rivers Alliance, a statewide environmental organization, said it’s unfortunate that a newly identified species like the darter is already facing a threat to its existence.
“The fact that this and several other rare darter species found only in Alabama, were first described this year is a stark reminder that we are still uncovering the depth of world-class aquatic biodiversity in our state,” he said. “Protecting this irreplicable natural legacy will benefit Alabamians for far longer than allowing out-of-state developers to make a quick buck.”
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service did not respond to a request for comment on the petition.

A road to nowhere?

In a Nov. 4 letter to data center developer Brad Kaaber, ALDOT Director John Cooper said the data center project “appears to conflict with the planned alignment and interchange location for the Birmingham North Beltline and its connection to Interstate 459.”
Cooper said in the letter that ALDOT recognized the data center project “represents a major opportunity” for new jobs and tax revenue and believes the two projects could coexist if modifications were made.
“While proceeding with development on this site as proposed would create serious challenges for the eventual construction of the Beltline interchange, we believe your development can be planned in such a way as not to conflict with the Beltline,” Cooper wrote.

ALDOT also sent copies of the letter to several local and county officials and the text was widely circulated on social media.
A spokesman for ALDOT confirmed the authenticity of the letter, but said the department had no additional comment on whether it had begun discussions with the developers or whether ALDOT could or would stop the data center project if the conflicts could not be resolved.
The Birmingham Northern Beltline is a planned 52-mile semicircle through sparsely populated areas north and west of Birmingham. The project has been in the planning phase since the 1990s and has generated much controversy from people who call it a massively expensive “road to nowhere” that will do little to solve the area’s most pressing traffic problems.
The highway will also carry a huge environmental cost. The beltline, as currently designed, will cut through huge swaths of hilly, undeveloped forest land, including dozens of river or stream crossings. The first segment involved cutting through a forested hilltop and building massive bridge pilings over stream banks below.
“The entire beltline is 52 miles, and it’s going through some of the most scenic, beautiful mountains in Alabama,” Sarah Stokes, a senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, said last year. “It is going to destroy over 3,000 football fields worth of forest and cross and permanently alter the Black Warrior and Cahaba River tributaries in 90 different places.”
The Birmingham area relies on those rivers for its drinking water, and environmental advocates say the woodlands surrounding the streams provide natural filtration for the city’s drinking water, as well as providing habitat for numerous endangered species.
The Project Marvel data center, a $14.5 billion project according to developers, would likely be completed decades before the Northern Beltline reached it, if at all. The beltline construction began in the northeast segment of the route and will wrap around counter-clockwise toward the Bessemer data center, slated to be located at its western endpoint.
Miller said that ultimately, both the data center and the Northern Beltline pose serious risks to the environment. The difference, he said, is simply their vastly different timelines.
“The lower Valley Creek watershed was already facing a threat decades in the future from the Northern Beltline, but this hyperscale data center poses an imminent threat to the Birmingham darter population in Little Blue Creek,” he said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Birmingham-darter-fish-for-Nov-16-2025-story-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-16 08:56:30.875796

(Photo courtesy of Blavatnik Awards)The son of a Yankton truck driver took the stage last month at the American Museum of Natural History in New York to accept a $250,000 award for his pioneering work in polymer chemistry.
Frank Leibfarth said his formative South Dakota years helped set him on the path to that stage.
The Blavatnik National Award is the world’s largest unrestricted monetary prize — meaning winners can spend the money on whatever they’d like — for the scientific community. The 41-year-old Leibfarth was chosen as a Blavatnik Chemical Sciences Laureate, one of three people 42 and younger awarded the title by an independent jury of scientists. The field of contenders began with 310 people, representing 161 academic institutions, 18 of whom were chosen as finalists.

Leibfarth is the Royce Murray distinguished term professor of chemistry at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He and his team have created technology that can turn the planet’s most commonly discarded plastics into high-value industrial materials. They’ve also created a more effective filter for trapping and removing Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances — PFAS, or “forever chemicals” — from municipal water supplies, and put it to use for one of North Carolina’s most polluted water sources.
In a recent interview with South Dakota Searchlight, the University of South Dakota graduate and former kicker for the Coyote football team talked about how his upbringing prepared him to step outside the cultural mores of Ivy League research and chase his curiosity as a top-tier scientist.
The following conversation has been edited for length and clarity.
How did you wind up in chemistry?
Neither of my parents have a four-year degree, so their goal was always for me just to go to college. I would say in high school I never found my passion. After my sophomore year in college, I took organic chemistry and really loved it. It answered a lot of the questions I had about biology, those molecular-level questions about why some things happen.
I ended up doing a research project at a National Science Foundation-funded program in New York City, at Columbia University. I feel like I was very presumptuous at the time. I said to my professor, “Hey, I really like this organic chemistry. I would love to do research in it, and I would also love to travel. But my family doesn’t have money to let me travel, so I need it to be paid for. Also, I’d like to go out of state.”
Luckily, the NSF had programs that allow you to do exactly that. I applied to 10 of them, got rejected by nine of them, but got into the best one.
So the Columbia experience opened the door for a kid from Yankton whose parents didn’t go to college to become a Ph.D. working on our PFAS problem?
Yeah, I would say that, but I’m also a product of USD. It’s a very good state institution. It allowed me to do lots of different things. I was on the varsity football team, but I also could participate in high-level science. There were people who identified my trajectory early on and gave me quite a bit of individual mentoring.
I contrast that with this world of people who have Ivy League educations, who I interact with now on a day-to-day basis. When you’re in that kind of situation early on, you develop a sense for what’s allowed and what’s not within the academic structure. In some ways, because I was not a part of that, I didn’t know what unwritten rules I was breaking along the way. It allowed me to have a little more creative freedom. I feel like I was able to follow my gut a little more than some of the people who’d grown up in that atmosphere.
What drew you to PFAS and microplastics, to making new things out of our waste?
I really liked the idea of making things, partially because of my dad. He was a truck driver, but he always had a second job where he would refinish basements and things, because he was also a carpenter. I always worked with him and I enjoyed making things with my hands.
Plastics were great, because I would make things and get to hold them after I was done. I could pull them and push them and see what properties they had. That’s what drew me early on. And once I started working in that area, it was very clear to me, and honestly to the whole field, that the sustainability crisis and plastics needed urgent solutions.
Tell us about your work in what you call ‘upcycling’ plastic.
The key challenge is we’re worst at recycling the plastics we make the most of, two related plastics called polyethylene and polypropylene. Polyethylene is like what your milk jug is made out of. Polypropylene is more like the outside of your car, your harder plastic. In two days, we can fill up a football stadium with the amount of these plastics we make in the world.
Q&A: Award-winning SDSU researcher calls his lab a ‘security checkpoint’ for animal diseases

The number and scale of the factories that are already installed to make this stuff is going to be effectively impossible to supplant. So I thought, could we create better recycling technology for that class of plastics? Our idea was to take all the plastic waste that is generated, and to be able to do this chemical process to it, which makes the products of that process more valuable than the original material was. That’s why we call it upcycling.
What gives it its higher value? What’s it used for?
We can take polyethylene, or a milk jug, and turn it into a really durable material that typically is used for high-end plumbing piping, or the outside of really high voltage wires. If you have a new home, it’s the piping that goes from your hot water heater around your house, because copper got too expensive.
We were also able to turn mixed plastic waste into a really tough material that’s typically used as the second layer in a golf ball. That material is pretty unique. So again, if you can make it from waste, there’s a lot of value there.
The key is to be a revenue stream for recycling centers, because currently, recycling plastic is an economically losing proposition.
What can you tell us about your work with PFAS?
That was born out of problems in North Carolina. It was found in 2017 that the Cape Fear River had really high levels of PFAs, and the Cape Fear River feeds the third largest town in our state, Wilmington, North Carolina. A senator from the state Legislature came to our faculty meeting — which is a very odd thing that never happens — and essentially said, “Hey, we recognize this problem.”
I had an idea about how we could remove it from water better than current technologies. I worked on it for two years in our lab, did a small research project, published a paper, and we kind of thought that was going to be the end of it. But when the results came out, we got a call from the state senator. That initiated discussions with a whole group of legislators, and in the 2021-2022 budget cycle, they allocated $10 million to start what we call the NC Pure Center. Our legislative remit was to develop new materials that remove PFAS from water, scale them up and test them in at least three municipal water treatment plants.
How does the technology work?
What we developed is like what’s used in a Brita filter that goes in your fridge. It’s a material that you pack in a column and flow water through it. The water going into that column has PFAS in it. Our material adsorbs or soaks up the PFAS, and the water coming out should be clean. You can have the same amount of material, and it’ll work 35% longer, compared to current technology.
The EPA set regulations for PFAS about a year and a half ago. It’s estimated that there’s over 6,000 treatment plants in the country that are going to have to implement treatment. So our technologies are one option.
What do you plan to do with the proceeds of your award?
The piece of the puzzle we haven’t yet put into place is to get what we make in our lab into the hands of real people to make them healthier and able to live more sustainably. I want to use the unrestricted funding to help push that forward, and in the process learn how to do it so I can repeat the process throughout my career and make the largest positive impact possible.
What do you want to see change as a result of what you’re doing in this area, 50 years from now? 
If my sole job was running a company, my goal would be to run that company well, to make money for the company. And hopefully a byproduct of that would be the sustainability aspect. But since my primary job is in education, my main output is education. If I can educate 50 people, 80 people who can do a similar type of work, that impact can be magnified many times.
Can you talk a little bit about the importance of federal funding for science from that point of view?
The federal government has in the past been really generous with science funding, but also it’s a drop in the bucket. A large pharma company spends more per year in research and development than the entire U.S. budget for science. But a lot of the initial ideas for the innovations that come out of the U.S. that support our economy, make better medicines, make our world more sustainable, those start in academia because of the funding provided by these federal organizations. We’re the ones who can think 10 years out, 20 years out. A pharma company or a chemical company has to think about their next quarter’s profit, their next year, their next two years.
That’s always been the balance that has really kept the U.S. at the forefront of innovation. If we compromise that funding on either end, we’re going to really compromise this delicate balance. Cutting science funding now is going to hurt our economy tremendously in five or 10 years. There’s no way to get around that.

,WyoFile,2025-11-16 13:00:00+00:00,WyoFile,What happens when wolves leave Yellowstone,"By Mike Koshmrl, WyoFile and Nick Mott, Mountain Journal",,,,,https://wyofile.com/what-happens-when-wolves-leave-yellowstone/,"

Crossing Yellowstone National Park's protective boundary, an apex predator becomes prey. These wolves don't last long in the modern Mountain West.
The post What happens when wolves leave Yellowstone appeared first on WyoFile .","If not for a series of tones broadcasting her location, no one would’ve known she had died.
Like dozens of other Yellowstone National Park wolves involved in a three-decade-long study, researchers collared wolf 1331F as a pup in 2021 to track her movements. Gray with ribbons of brown fur fading into her pale muzzle and legs, the young wolf lived with the Wapiti Lake Pack, one of the largest in Yellowstone. 
Wildlife photographer V.C. Wald watched 1331 supervise black wolf pups hunting a wounded bison on the shore of the Gibbon River in the winter of 2023-’24. Easily visible from the road, the pups tried to take the bison head-on, only to scatter as it bluff charged. Then, 1331 demonstrated how to approach the massive ungulate more safely from behind, nipping at its hind quarters, Wald recalls, “[she was] a teacher, of young wolves, and of me.”

The scene isn’t out of the ordinary for the Wapiti Lake Pack, whose territory encompasses Yellowstone’s sagebrush-covered Hayden Valley in the center of the park. They chase elk and bison. They play and sun themselves on cold winter days. Much of this activity occurs under the gaze of humans. But every now and then, pack members leave the park. 
In late 2024, Yellowstone Wolf Project telemetry data suggest 1331 started a journey away from her pack. She headed north. First, she spent time around Mammoth Hot Springs. Then she crossed the park’s boundary into Montana. While tourists often lined roads to watch 1331 and her packmates inside the park, wolf watchers are sparser in the rugged and mountainous mix of public and private land just north of Yellowstone. Wolf 1331 had no way of knowing, but she’d crossed an invisible line where the national park gives way to state rule. It’s a consequential threshold: Wolves are protected from hunting on one side, but can be legally killed by gun, trap or snare on the other. 
Park officials don’t know if 1331 was permanently leaving her pack or if she would have eventually returned to Wapiti Lake’s territory; it’s not uncommon for female wolves of her age to disperse for days or even weeks leading up to breeding season in February — sort of a lupine rumspringa. But they do know she’d left the pack far behind. On Jan. 24, 2025, staff with the Yellowstone Wolf Project drove north of the park, wielding bulky telemetry equipment to listen for collared elk and wolves. They heard 1331’s signal, indicating she’d moved farther into Montana than ever. But, the beeps suggested, she hadn’t budged in at least 12 hours. 
Park staff turned the information over to Montana’s fish and game agency. Wolf 1331 would ultimately be found dead in a trap set by a prolific wolf hunter who manages a large ranch about 10 miles north of Yellowstone. The man who trapped 1331 would receive a warning for violating state trap-check laws and no other punishment. Her journey had come to an end roughly a month after it began. 
The Yellowstone bubble
Wolf 1331F’s fate was unusual only in that she made it so far north. When wolves leave the park, they die — often, quickly.
Yellowstone’s roughly 100 wolves are among the most famous and beloved in the world, attracting throngs of wolf-admiring tourists who spend tens of millions of dollars in the region every year. However, protected by federal law and tolerant of their adoring fans, Yellowstone wolves are uniquely vulnerable to hunters and trappers in surrounding states where killing wolves is legal. Their destinies are often shaped by which of the three surrounding state boundaries they cross.

“When we look at the fate of collared wolves that leave Yellowstone, most commonly they don’t survive the next hunting season,” Yellowstone Wolf Project leader Dan Stahler said in a May 2024 interview.  
Heading into Wyoming, wolves encounter wilderness and tightly controlled hunts, but greater danger beyond. Step into Idaho and it’s a free-fire zone, though few wolves go that way. Journeys north into Montana are the most common and have proven the most deadly, despite some state efforts to take it easy on park wolves.    
Yellowstone’s wolves die from hunting and trapping outside the park every season, but things seem to be getting worse. From 2009-2020, about 4.3 wolves from Yellowstone were killed legally by hunters and trappers each year, according to National Park Service data. From 2021-2024, that number nearly tripled when an average of 12.75 wolves died annually, according to Yellowstone Wolf Project data. 
It was clear to Doug Smith, retired lead of the Yellowstone Wolf Project, that the park’s porous boundaries would be an issue almost immediately after wolves were reintroduced in 1995. “This is a long-term problem for wildlife management, and particularly wolves,” Smith said in an interview this fall. 
Inside Yellowstone, wolves are managed “for the benefit and enjoyment of the people,” the now-famous language adorning the top of Roosevelt Arch, a striking stone gateway often surrounded by selfie-taking tourists at the park’s North Entrance. The sentiment springs from the 1916 act creating the National Park Service and stops at the park’s border. Outside Yellowstone, the states take over wolf management. There, wolves can get into trouble. They kill livestock, the occasional pet, and lots and lots of elk. And they’re especially naive to the many dangers in the new world around them.

Even in the early days of reintroduction, Smith remembers phone calls urging him to do the impossible: keep wolves inside the park. Back then, wolves had federal protections both in and out of Yellowstone. Hunting them was illegal, whether in Montana, Wyoming or Idaho, or inside Yellowstone itself. But within a month of releasing the park’s first wolves from their enclosure, a hunter named Chad McKittrick illegally shot and killed a male wolf, numbered 10M, after it left the park and ventured onto private land near Red Lodge, Montana. 
Fast-forward nearly 30 years and death also awaited 1329M, a striking green-eyed black male wolf, when he left Yellowstone. Researchers captured and collared 1329, born into the Wapiti Lake Pack just like 1331F. He was caught and joined the ranks of research wolves in 2021, the same year they collared 1331F as a pup. A year later, park scientists documented the young male, with a touch of silver on his chin, getting into a scuffle with other males, which could have spurred a dispersal. His collar’s GPS data shows he left Yellowstone on May 14, 2022, heading south. “[1329] beelined it all the way down through the trophy game wolf area,” said Stahler, the current Yellowstone Wolf Project leader.

The state of Wyoming tightly regulates wolf hunting in an area where wolves are managed as “trophy game” adjacent to Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks, with the area closed to hunting in the spring. But 1329 kept moving. GPS data shows his route, loping straight through the heart of Jackson Hole, then south, looping through the Wyoming and Salt River ranges. The black wolf headed into a valley where, three years later, Sublette County resident Cody Roberts would fight a felony animal cruelty charge for allegedly making a public spectacle of a wounded, juvenile wolf in a bar before the animal died. The incident made international news and divided the small Western Wyoming community. Wolves are fewer here. There’s a reason. 
Within two weeks of leaving Yellowstone, the roughly 2-year-old 1329 crossed another boundary and left Wyoming’s regulated wolf “trophy game” area for its “predator zone,” which covers 85% of the state and where there are virtually no regulations on how wolves can be killed. Running down and bludgeoning wolves with snowmobiles here is legal. The departure meant he could be killed any time of year, by almost any means, and without a license.
Toward the end of June 2022, wolf 1329 stopped moving in the mountains near Salt River Pass, near where the southern Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem transitions into the Great Basin. He’d stepped into a steel-jawed leghold trap. “It had been in the trap about four days,” Stahler says, “based on the location and movement.” By June 26, the trapped wolf was dead. The Yellowstone biologist’s best guess is that 1329 was exposed to the elements and died of dehydration. States surrounding the park require trappers to frequently check their wolf traps to reduce animals’ suffering and minimize harm to non-target species. Negligence is illegal. 
‘Risky life choice’ 
Wolves in the Northern Rockies are no strangers to controversy. Indeed, politicians in all three states surrounding Yellowstone have long seized on wolves as a prime example of federal overreach. “I remain seriously concerned with the uncertainty that continues to surround Yellowstone wolf reintroduction as it moves forward,” former Wyoming Gov. Jim Geringer wrote to U.S. Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt in 1995, after wolves were already on the ground. Former Idaho Gov. Butch Otter said he’d be the first to bid on a wolf tag back in 2007. And Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte was issued a warning for killing a Yellowstone wolf without the proper trapper education in 2021. 
Death by hunting, trapping or wildlife management official is the most common fate for wolves that leave Yellowstone National Park. Even in a natural system, the act of dispersing is already a “risky life choice,” according to Stahler. Solo wolves end up in territories of other wolf packs, where they clash and get killed. In fact, within Yellowstone, wolves are the leading cause of wolf death.

While the number of wolves that spend the vast majority of their time inside Yellowstone has stayed relatively static for more than two decades, wolf populations outside the park have grown by leaps and bounds. That’s in part because some Yellowstone wolves successfully dispersed and survived. At the same time, other wolves reintroduced in Idaho’s Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness established and bred. And yet more wolves filtered down from the north, crossing the Canadian border into the U.S. Today, populations of animals as reclusive as wolves are tough to estimate, but the most recent figures for Montana and Idaho wolf populations are roughly 1,100 and 1,200, respectively. In Wyoming, which has less mountainous, treed habitat, there are fewer wolves — about 350 — and they’re counted with much greater precision.
While those wolf populations outside the park grew, the human population inside Yellowstone expanded, too. Park visitation hovered around 3 million annually at the time of wolf reintroduction in 1995. Today, that number is closer to 5 million, evidenced by the sprawl of souvenir shops in the Yellowstone gateway towns of Jackson, Wyoming and Gardiner, Montana where tourists snap up T-shirts, stuffed bison and elk toys, and art emblazoned with wolves. This increased visitation, wolf biologist Smith says, is the biggest issue facing Yellowstone National Park as a whole.
“It’s the best place in the world to view wild wolves,” says Smith, adding that in the early days of wolf reintroduction, finding wolves inside the park was exclusive, inside information. That’s changed nowadays, he says, with the influx of eager, wolf- and grizzly-watching tourists. “There’s no inside tips anymore. Just look for the traffic jam.”

Wolf-watching tourism alone contributes at least $82 million annually to communities bordering the park, the most recent data show. However, all those people lining the roads and hillsides of Yellowstone come at a cost. “[When wolves] leave the park,” Smith says, “they get shot because they stand there and look at a hunter.”
Some wolves become so accustomed to people that they become habituated, according to Smith, meaning they walk up to humans in search of food or become so bold that they run off with tripods. In rare instances, park officials have euthanized habituated wolves.
The Wapiti Lake Pack, a major draw for wolf watchers and tourists, has been susceptible to human conditioning. These Yellowstone interior wolves, considered bison-killing specialists, often use groomed park roads to get around in winter, at times walking right by snowmobilers buzzing down the road on their way to places like Old Faithful or Tower Junction. They’ve even been hazed with paintballs as a result.  
But the vast majority of park wolves aren’t habituated, Smith says. Rather, they’re tolerant of people. “A wild wolf is avoidant,” he says. “They flee, they run. They know what humans mean: death. That’s not a park wolf.” Tolerance is the curse that leaves them vulnerable outside the park.

Justin Webb, executive director of the Foundation for Wildlife Management, says Yellowstone should do more to instill its wolves with a healthy fear of people.
“Wolves in the park should be given the respect of space, and I think that those wolves shouldn’t be conditioned to people,” says Webb, whose nonprofit makes bounty-like payments to trappers who kill wolves.
On occasion, Yellowstone wolves face circumstances that make them especially prone to human conditioning. The Junction Butte Pack, for example, often dens within eyeshot of Slough Creek, a popular trailhead for hikers and anglers. Tourists and Yellowstone guides have learned about the highly visible location, potentially dooming those pups. 
“Why don’t they close the trailhead down?” Webb asked. 
Yellowstone wolves leave the park for all kinds of reasons. Some, like 1331F, might take a temporary solo hiatus from their pack, while 1329M was likely in the midst of a more permanent dispersal, searching for new territory or a mate. However, the vast majority of Yellowstone’s wolves spend about 96% of their time inside the park, collar data shows. With no time to learn a healthy fear of humans, the 4% of the time they unwittingly leave their protections behind proves deadly. Instead of other wolves, people — either hunters or poachers — become, by far, the leading cause of death for wolves that depart Yellowstone, Stahler said. 
No fear
For the first decade and a half after wolves returned to Yellowstone, the Endangered Species Act outlawed hunting wolves throughout the Lower 48. Protracted legal battles meant the first lawful hunt didn’t occur until 2009, and it revealed the risk facing wolves that spend most of their lives inside Yellowstone. 
“They aren’t showing any fear,” one Montana wolf hunter told the Los Angeles Times after a successful hunt that year. “But they will, I’m sure.” Another hunting guide told the outlet about a wolf his client killed: “He was no more afraid of [the hunter] than the man in the moon.”
In 2011, wolves were permanently “delisted,” or stripped of federal protections under the Endangered Species Act, in Montana, Idaho and portions of three other western states by an act of Congress. In Wyoming, the change came more slowly because of litigation. Wolves were most recently delisted there in 2017.

After years of hunts in surrounding states, the story hasn’t changed much. In late 2024, members of the 8 Mile Pack crossed the park boundary into Montana. Three hunters were waiting. They left with four dead wolves. A fifth was found days later, dead in nearby bushes. That many wolves dying at the same time rather than fleeing at the sound of a gunshot, Smith says, likely means they had no fear of people. “Killing multiple wolves at once is a sure sign of that.”
In this way, 1331 and 1329 are outliers. According to Yellowstone National Park data, over the last few years, approximately 81% of wolves that lived in Yellowstone and were killed by hunters died in Montana. That’s largely due to terrain. Think of the Gardiner Basin just north of Yellowstone like a funnel: Elk migrate to the lower-elevation, arid area in search of forage in winter. Wolves follow. Of all those wolves killed by hunters in Montana, nearly 9 in 10 died within just a mile of the park boundary. The forays of 1331 and 1329 outside Yellowstone — clocking about 10 miles and over 100, respectively — mean they traveled much farther than most of their kind before meeting the same end. 
The lives of long-distance travelers, like the two Wapiti Lake pack members that died in traps, are less understood. Smith attributes the dearth of data to a simple reason: They die. 
“A wolf dispersing has a higher mortality risk because it doesn’t know the landscape,” he says. “So that makes it more vulnerable to getting shot because they’re wandering around going, ‘I don’t know where I am; I don’t know where it’s safe and where it’s unsafe.’” 
Montana and Wyoming’s respective wildlife management agencies investigated the trappings of 1331 and 1329. Both were found only because of their collar mortality signals, and both trappers were found to have violated state “trap-check” laws. Wolf traps must be checked every 48 hours in Montana. Leghold traps must be checked every 72 hours in Wyoming’s predator zone, the only place in the Equality State where wolf trapping is allowed.
The Wyoming trapper, a Cokeville resident named Ezra Cluff, was cited and fined $250 on June 30, 2022. “Cluff stated that he had got busy and had indeed failed to do his trap checks on time,” the warden wrote in a citation slip. Cluff did not respond to an interview request. 
Nearly three years later and on the opposite end of the ecosystem, 1331 was found in a trap about 10 miles, as the crow flies, north of Yellowstone. The trap was registered to Matt Lumley, who was at the time president of the Montana Trappers Association and vice president of the National Trappers Association. Lumley also has close ties to political leadership in Montana. He helped Gov. Gianforte trap and kill another collared Yellowstone wolf in 2021. Gianforte later described Lumley as his wolf hunting “mentor” in an interview with Lee Enterprise’s Statehouse Bureau. In addition, Lumley is a founding member of the Outdoor Heritage Coalition, a group currently suing Montana, arguing that state wildlife managers aren’t setting policy aggressively enough to reduce the wolf population.
Lumley did not respond to multiple requests for comment. But his comments in the Helena Capitol building are in the public record. “I’ve killed a lot of wolves,” he testified at the Montana Legislature just days before Wolf Project staff heard 1331F’s mortality signal. “I’ve never killed a Yellowstone National Park wolf. I’m killing all my wolves in Montana.”

Yellowstone park officials estimate that 1331 died on Jan. 16, 2025. Park staff detected her mortality signal on Jan. 23, and her remains were recovered even later. Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks submitted a “request for prosecution” for a trap-check violation to Montana’s Park County Attorney’s Office. Despite the state’s 48-hour trap-check regulation for wolves, the county attorney declined to prosecute.

“After a careful review of the reports, supporting documents, and available evidence, we determined that the facts did not establish a criminal offense that could be proven beyond a reasonable doubt,” Park County Attorney Chad Glenn said in an email to Mountain Journal and WyoFile. 
Glenn did not respond to follow-up questions or provide the documents he cited as the basis for his decision. Ultimately, Lumley walked away with a formal warning from FWP. Gianforte also walked away with a warning in 2021 after running afoul of trapping regulations while killing a wolf with Lumley on the same ranch, owned by Robert E. Smith, a co-director of Sinclair Broadcasting Group and contributor to Gianforte’s 2017 congressional campaign.
Elk, livestock and wolves
The saga of Wapiti Lake’s wandering wolves reflects the complexity of managing Yellowstone wolves when they leave protected areas like the park. Over the last few decades, the region has transitioned from an economy based on resource extraction to one heavily reliant on tourism and recreation. Outside the national park, wildlife managers are tasked with balancing hard-to-reconcile viewpoints in states where hunting and ranching have deep roots and large landowners hold sway. 
The overpopulated elk herds of Yellowstone’s Northern Range numbered around 15,000-20,000 in the years leading up to the 1995 wolf reintroduction. Counts are now closer to 5,000, much to the dismay of many a hunter who relied on the area’s abundance of ungulates for meat or trophies. 
“I’ve got an 18-year-old son that I want to get to experience elk camp in the backcountry,” Webb, the wolf-hunting advocate, told a Wyoming audience in 2022. “I want him to sit on a mountaintop on a ridge and listen to bulls bugle below him as the sun comes up, and I believe that if we don’t do something to control wolf populations, he won’t have that experience.”

Meanwhile, Lumley the trapper called the decline of southwest Montana elk “the greatest loss of hunting opportunity in the world” during the same legislative hearing he touted killing “a lot of wolves.” Decades before wolf reintroduction, elk were so numerous in the area that Yellowstone sometimes culled thousands of the animals in a single year. Later, the park took a more hands-off approach. Elk hunting outside the park became the primary management tool to deal with the overpopulated ungulates. Locals recall a “firing line” of hunters as elk moved toward winter range outside the park’s protections. 
Wolves were a factor — but not the only factor — in the region’s decline in elk numbers. Mountain lions and bears eat elk, too. And so do people. A long-running late-season elk hunt in the Gardiner area also played a role in the elk population’s shrinking size. Despite a drastic decrease in numbers from the days before wolves, elk populations north of Yellowstone still remain at or above the state-set goal for elk numbers. Access to elk is yet another important part of the hunting puzzle. Some hunters say the wary ungulates that remain in the area often take shelter from wolves and hunters alike on private land, making them next to impossible to pursue. 
Part of the tension around hunting both wolves and elk also centers on economics. While wolf-watching brings millions of tourist dollars into communities surrounding the park, outfitters north of Yellowstone have lost business as elk herds declined after reintroduction. The lawsuit filed by the Outdoor Heritage Coalition features outfitter Craig Neal, an outfitter in Townsend, Montana, as a plaintiff. Neal, the brief contends, “has been negatively impacted by restrictions on wolf hunting in Montana from a personal and economic perspective … his business opportunities are limited by the insufficient wolf quotas and reduced elk available for hunting.”

Elk aren’t the only hooved creatures wolves impact, either. Outside Yellowstone, they also occasionally kill livestock. Although wolf-killed cattle and sheep are a drop in the bucket among the many factors that kill domestic livestock, the impacts aren’t trivial for individual ranchers in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.   
In Wyoming and Montana each year, wolves typically kill at least a few dozen of the more than 3 million cows in the two states — though many ranchers argue that wolf kills can go unproven since remote carcasses are consumed before the kill can be documented. Depredation numbers in Wyoming notably spiked from 2014 to 2017, topping out at 121 wolf-killed cattle — a pulse of conflict that coincided with the three years Wyoming wolves were relisted under the Endangered Species Act. While those federal protections prohibited hunters from killing wolves at the time, wildlife managers trying to avert conflict could do just that. And they did, killing a record number. In Montana, complaints about wolves eating livestock peaked at 233 in 2009. Since then, in the wake of delisting, the number of reports has dropped off drastically, hovering at 100 or fewer annually from 2015 to 2024.
Pressure cooker 
To control the wolf population and mitigate their impact, hunting has become a fixture of wolf management in the Northern Rockies. Since legal seasons began earlier in the century, some animals that spend most of the year in Yellowstone are always lost to hunters’ bullets and traps outside park boundaries. 
In an attempt to resolve the tension between the park and surrounding states, Montana carved out small areas with more limited hunting called “wolf management units” directly north of the park. Wyoming tightly controls its hunts immediately adjacent to Yellowstone and Grand Teton, and has had minimal overall impact on Yellowstone populations. Idaho takes an aggressive, statewide approach to wolf hunting and trapping, but the topography and location of Yellowstone packs have limited its influence on park populations.

The vast majority of harvested Yellowstone wolves die in Montana, where tensions continue to flare over setting the state’s wolf season. In 2021, the Montana Legislature mandated a reduction in the state’s overall wolf population, numbering roughly 1,177 at the time. The new law simply set a minimum of 15 breeding pairs (corresponding to 450 wolves). In the years since, setting policy to reduce wolf numbers has fallen to the Montana Fish and Wildlife Commission, a citizen board appointed by the governor, currently Gianforte. The commission has considered a slew of ways to meet the mandate: lengthening hunting and trapping seasons, instituting a statewide quota, night hunting on private land, and neck snaring, among other approaches. Some of those aggressive tactics have taken effect. Others haven’t. Yet today, four years after the legislative mandate took effect, Montana still hasn’t seen a meaningful reduction in its wolf population. 
In 2021, about six months after Gianforte trapped and killed a Yellowstone wolf north of the park, the commission also removed quotas in the wolf management units, or WMUs, just outside Yellowstone. That winter, hunters killed at least 25 wolves that spent the vast majority of their lives inside the park. Roughly 1 in 5 park wolves perished — more park wolves than in any hunting season before or since. Yellowstone biologists worried about the impact of the hunt on their three-decade-old research project — some packs dissolved due to the hunt, and others formed. Behavior and reproductive rates changed, too. Wildlife guides were furious, concerned they’d lose business or wolf-watching opportunities altogether. 
Ultimately, the quotas were restored. But over the next two years, outcomes for Yellowstone wolves only marginally improved. At least 13 park wolves were killed in the 2023-2024 hunting season. Yellowstone Superintendent Cam Sholly voiced his concern to the Montana Fish and Wildlife Commission in a 2024 letter. “Wolves that primarily live within Yellowstone are exceedingly valuable to a great number of people across Montana, the country, and the world,” he wrote. “The park generates hundreds of millions of dollars in additional economic activity to Montana economies and wolves and other wildlife rate as a top reason why people visit the park and region.”
The pressure cooker of hunting policy around Yellowstone hasn’t let off steam. At the January 2025 legislative hearing, Lumley complained that the Fish and Wildlife Commission was setting policy that was too protective of wolves and listening only to out-of-state interests, particularly Yellowstone. Just 3% of the national park lies in Montana. “That’s what you are elected to do, protect Montana’s interests,” Lumley testified. “Not Yellowstone National Park’s.” 
In a Fish and Wildlife Commission meeting months later, Chris Morgan, Lumley’s successor at the Montana Trappers Association, made similar claims. He alleged that policy safeguarding wolves in the region around Yellowstone is a “political ploy” and touted the state’s responsibility for wolf reduction rather than wolf watching.

“We don’t have any state mandate that requires us to make sure that ecotourism thrives,” Morgan said. “Our mandate is to reduce the state’s population of wolves. Plain and simple. Period.” 
Wolf advocates were just as fired up in the day-long meeting. Cara McGary, a Yellowstone guide and cofounder of Wild Livelihoods Business Coalition, argued that plenty of Yellowstone wolves — like 1331F— die even outside the protective boundaries of the wolf management units. Southwest Montana receives far more wolf hunting pressure than anywhere else in the state, despite a lower overall wolf density than Montana’s northwest corner, according to Montana FWP data. It’s also the only area in the Treasure State where the wolf population was already on the decline. In 2024 alone, at least six wolves from the park died legally in the Yellowstone-adjacent WMUs and another five outside their boundaries. “That’s almost 10% of the product that our businesses depend on,” she testified. 
At the time of publication, wolf hunting season in Montana, Wyoming and Idaho is well underway. The heat over wolf hunting regulations around Yellowstone in that August commission meeting led to something of a middle-ground approach. But already this year, a Montana hunter legally killed a Yellowstone wolf beloved to the wolf-watching community, which described the dark black 1479F as playful and tolerant of crowds.
“She was one of the few wolves in the park that would walk right through a crowd of people to reach her destination,” wildlife photographer Deby Dixon told Cowboy State Daily.
The National Park Service has two chief goals: preserving and protecting natural systems, and visitor enjoyment. Wolves figure into both, and the scientific gains from studying Yellowstone packs are unparalleled: They’re both uniquely visible and, at least in theory, uninfluenced by humans. But as wolves deal with such direct mortality when they set paw outside the park, Smith wonders: “Do you have a natural wolf population or not?”
Some data suggests not. A 2023 peer-reviewed study led by then-University of Montana PhD student Brenna Cassidy found that Montana’s wolf-hunting regime has a clear effect on the overall survival of Yellowstone wolves. Without hunting, park wolves have a nearly 90% chance of surviving any given year, but the rate falls to about 80% when hunting occurs with quotas. When there’s unlimited hunting outside the boundary, Yellowstone wolves’ chances of surviving a year dip closer to 70%. 
Smith, Yellowstone’s retired wolf biologist, wants to be clear: He’s a hunter as well, and a self-described “gun guy.” At times, though, he worries that all the focus on Yellowstone’s wolves has an overlooked downside. It sucks the air out of the room in wolf management conversations, leaving too little focus on the thousands more wolves in Montana and the rest of the Northern Rockies that don’t have the same vocal proponents as animals in and around the park. Those wolves die too — often very quickly or brutally. In Montana, hunters and trappers can take a total of 458 wolves this season, including six in the WMUs outside Yellowstone and 60 in the larger region where 1331 met her end. There are no limits in Idaho, and it’s a wolf hunting free-for-all in Wyoming’s predator zone, where 1329 died in an illegally monitored trap. 
Thinking about intense hunting pressure throughout the Northern Rockies, Smith thinks wildlife managers should consider a bigger question: “Where do wolves get to be wolves?”

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Chris Campany and Devon Neary: Building the infrastructure necessary to keep Vermonters in Vermont.","This commentary is by Chris Campany, executive director of the Windham Regional Commission, and Devon Neary, chair of the Vermont Association of Planning and Development Agencies.


Vermont has made progress improving pathways to new housing, but an often-overlooked need is the wastewater and water infrastructure to support it. 
We need to create conditions to house Vermonters at all stages of life.  This includes young people moving out of the family home for the first time, couples having children, empty nesters downsizing, seniors and others seeking housing to fit their independent living abilities, and those who have lost their housing to disaster.  This means investing in infrastructure that supports building housing at scale to make it affordable.  
“Affordable” shouldn’t be a loaded term.  Here it means housing for which the household is paying no more than 30% of their monthly gross income for housing costs, be that an individual or a family.  “At scale” means the ability to build enough units at one time to harness economies of scale that minimize per housing unit costs. 
The housing solution does not lie with custom built houses on large lots along town roads.  Barring a collapse in home and land values ‚ and material, labor and construction costs — these homes are well beyond the reach of most Vermonters today and in the future.  
We need investment in existing buildings, development of vacant properties, multi-family housing, and clustered small home neighborhoods to create housing at scale, and it is nearly impossible to build housing that is affordable for Vermonters at scale in the absence of community wastewater systems and drinking water systems. 
For towns with zoning, making sure that zoning does not create unwise and unnecessary roadblocks to building housing, especially multi-family housing, can help.  But the underlying infrastructure is fundamental, especially in areas that have minimal flood risk.
Regional planning commissions play an essential role in supporting municipal land use planning, planning for the infrastructure to make action on those plans possible, and supporting engineering design and project construction, because most communities do not have the capacity to do it on their own. 
This support is necessary not only for the development of new systems, but improvements to the capacity of those that already exist.  We also recognize the challenges faced by municipalities that are already managing wastewater and water systems.  
Through collaboration with the Vermont Bond Bank, we are beginning work to support communities that are struggling to operate their existing drinking water systems.  Our goal is to make system management easier and more efficient and to ultimately identify operations and maintenance models that make more sense for Vermont’s small communities. 
It may be tempting to think that we shouldn’t consider new systems or improve the capacity of existing systems if we can’t handle the ones we already have.  That’s a false choice.  We need to develop effective operations and maintenance models even as we develop the systems we need now and for the future.  
Among Act 181’s reforms are improvements to regional future land use mapping.  The state’s 11 regional planning commissions are working with each of our municipalities to map our future growth areas.  This includes addressing flood adaptation needs. 
These areas should form the basis for a statewide infrastructure investment strategy that supports each step of infrastructure development — from the connection to land use planning to project construction.
Just as the state adopted an “all-in” approach to clean water, it is important for all Vermonters to be invested in the housing infrastructure solution.  We also need to make it easier to scale up operations and maintenance so that towns can more easily work together and towns aren’t left to figure out on their own what an intermunicipal, or regional, system could do more effectively.

Charcoal

Charcoal
is our preferred method
with which to sketch our days:
thick, dark swaths of pigment
that smear and make their mark 
unapologetically,
abstract, flowing, influential,
or as gashes across the page
like wounds that won’t close.
And neither are ugly,
though we can’t erase them.
They are the foundations of your life,
but details make the picture –
the careful lines and smudges;
noticing a twinkling eye,
or smiling with all your teeth. 
And everyone you meet
is drawing their own
conclusions and beginnings,
unfinished works
marbled with messy, rushed greetings
and slow, agonizing goodbyes.
Strapped to our backs and worn on our sleeves are these masterpieces,
every day being dotted
with someone else’s charcoall.
Our sketches are never finished,
but always beautiful.
But we forget, somehow:
We are all art.

Adopting universal health care would solve that problem.,"Based on their recent comments, perhaps President Donald Trump and some other Republicans are getting ready to embrace universal health care. 
Universal health care involves some form of the government ensuring everyone has medical coverage at little or no out-of-pocket cost, beyond what people pay in taxes. Many countries, including much of western Europe, have some form of universal health care. 
The United States does not, even though various Democrats, ranging from Harry Truman to Barack Obama, from Kamala Harris to Bernie Sanders, have embraced some form of universal health care at some point in time.
Republicans have portrayed universal health care as the bogeyman, as socialism, as the worst thing that could happen to the United States and would eventually lead to capitulation to Russia.
Yet, Trump and others seem to be warming up to the possibility.
In recent weeks, congressional Democrats have been fighting to extend enhanced subsidies for private insurance purchased on the Affordable Care Act’s marketplace exchange – a fight that was at the center of the 43-day federal government shutdown that ended last week. The federal subsidies pay a significant portion of the cost of the health insurance purchased on the exchange.

Trump recently posted on social media, as he is wont to do, that instead of providing these subsidies to big insurance companies, he would prefer to give the money for health care directly to the American people.
How would this work? He didn’t say, but that did not stop many Republicans from embracing the idea. And it does not appear many Republicans voiced concern about such a scheme.
But according to the Congressional Budget Office, as explained in an MSNBC article by Miranda Yaver, a University of Pittsburgh assistant professor of health policy and management, the health insurance companies received about $92 billion in federal ACA subsidies in 2023. During the same year, just the out-of-pocket costs – those not paid by the insurance companies – totaled $500 billion for Americans.
So, in short, if Trump diverts that $92 billion from insurance companies to individuals, there also must be a method to pay for the additional costs of health care Americans will incur.
The amount of the subsidies each individual would receive will not cover the cost of a serious illness or accident. Would the people facing major medical expenses be left to face the impossible-for-most task of paying those tens of thousands of dollars in health care costs by themselves? Or would they need some, gulp, insurance, to help pay for those additional costs?
Insurance, love it or hate it, exists to level the playing field. By having a large number of people on insurance, the costs paid by those with expensive medical needs are held down by those who have insurance but seldom or never have to use it.
So, all this begs the question: What is the answer for those, like President Trump, who don’t like subsidizing big insurance?
The obvious answer to that question is, drum roll please, universal health care coverage, often referred to as Medicaid and Medicare for all or a public option.
Universal health care could be fashioned a number of ways. People could be expected to provide, as Republicans like to say, some “skin in the game” by paying for some of the costs themselves.
It could be a program where, if you have private insurance and you like your private insurance, you can keep it just as long as it is not paid for with federal dollars.
President Trump and others have been obsessed with getting rid of the Affordable Care Act. The president seems upset that it is called Obamacare.
It is important to note that it was first labeled Obamacare by those who opposed the legislation that was passed way back in 2010. But now that polls show it is popular, Trump seems upset that it is called Obamacare.
As a matter of fact, he said that money for health care being sent directly to the American people “would be so exciting. Call it Trumpcare. Call it whatever you want.… Anything but Obamacare.”
Perhaps Democrats, many of whom always supported universal health care as the most logical way to deal with an often broken and complex American system, could achieve that goal by just agreeing to call it Trumpcare.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/14092304/AP25317126616807.jpg,,,2025-11-16 07:56:25.672375

President Chester Arthur is back in the spotlight. It’s been a minute. 
Netflix’s hit new historical series “Death by Lightning” tells the story of the assassination in 1881 of President James Garfield, so it’s only natural that Garfield and his assassin, Charles Guiteau, take center stage. But Arthur is the one who gets the redemption arc. Plus (spoiler alert) he’s the only one of the three still breathing at the end.
Arthur was an extremely unlikely president. He didn’t seek the office and only attained it through a bizarre sequence of events. In the years since his single term, the native of Fairfield, Vermont, has been largely forgotten, so it feels strange to see him get serious screen time in a major production. But the story can’t be told without him.
It seems a minor miracle the story is being told at all. What was the pitch to Netflix like? How did anyone convince the streaming service that viewers today would love a story focusing on a group of 19th-century politicians who can vie with Arthur for the title of “most obscure.” In addition to Garfield, whose name is rarely mentioned today outside of trivia nights, viewers are introduced to such former political heavyweights as Roscoe Conkling and James Blaine. 
Yet somehow the show works. It has its share of ahistorical aspects, such as characters speaking like modern Americans and cursing liberally. But other details that could seem invented to make the show more relatable — Black men serving in positions of power in 1880s Washington, D.C., and Garfield’s intense focus on rooting out political corruption — are drawn from real life.
“Death by Lightning” has a surprising amount of humor, given the topic, which might have helped get the project green lighted. The barrel-chested, heavily sideburned Arthur is played by Nick Offerman and in his early scenes, he provides comic relief as a man of unquenchable appetites, particularly for liquor and sausages. 
His outsized cravings could be a stand-in for the greed that was at the heart of the era’s rampant graft, in which Arthur actively participated. Famously, Chester Arthur served as customs collector for the Port of New York. Seventy-five percent of American imports flowed through New York’s harbor and it was Arthur’s job to collect import duties on those goods. In an era before the federal income tax, those duties provided nearly half of U.S. government revenues. 
Arthur and other top Customs officers were entitled to a “moiety,” or share, of any fines on importers or any seizures his department made. As a result, Arthur’s total annual income was the equivalent of about $1.25 million today, making him the nation’s highest-paid politician, including the president.
Overseeing a workforce of about 1,300 gave Arthur substantial political power too. He used the patronage or spoils system (as in, “to the victor go the spoils”) to dole out well-paid positions to applicants based on their loyalty to the Republican Party, not their qualifications for the actual job. Jobholders were expected to kickback a share of their paychecks to help fund the party. Showing up for work was often optional.
Arthur wasn’t at the top of New York’s political pyramid, however. He owed his job to U.S. Sen. Roscoe Conkling, who enlisted Arthur as his loyal protégé. 
“Death by Lightning” begins with James Garfield, an Ohio representative, attending the Republican Convention in Chicago to nominate another Ohio politician, Sen. John Sherman, for president. This was in the days before political primaries; convention delegates chose who was on a party’s national ticket, not voters.

The delegates divided into factions. Many supported former President Ulysses Grant, who was seeking a third term; presidents weren’t yet term-limited by the Constitution. James Blaine was the other main contender. (Among the lesser candidates, U.S. Sen. George Edmunds of Vermont received a smattering of votes.)
But no one was able to get the required majority. With the convention deadlocked after 33 ballots, 16 Wisconsin delegates voted for a new candidate, James Garfield. Garfield protested, saying the votes for him shouldn’t be counted, because he wasn’t a candidate. The convention chairman disagreed. Two ballots later, a majority of delegates swung their voters to this compromise candidate and Garfield was named the Republican nominee.
New York acted as a kingmaker in those days. As the most populous state, it possessed the most electoral votes. So Republican Party leaders curried favor with New York Republicans, and other supporters of the patronage system nationally, by having one of their own, Chester Arthur, selected as the vice presidential nominee. It was a fraught marriage of convenience, pairing a politician who vowed to fight the spoils system with one who embodied it.
After the Garfield-Arthur ticket won the presidency, things went about as well as you might expect. Once in office, Garfield took aim at the patronage system by appointing a new collector for the Port of New York without first consulting New York’s two U.S. senators.
Seeing this as a direct challenge to his political machine, Conkling resigned his senate seat in a symbolic protest, as did New York’s other senator. The incident highlighted the schism within the Republican Party. When Arthur opted to remain loyal to Conkling, he showed that there was a divide within the White House as well.
Less than four months into his term in office, Garfield was shot by Charles Guiteau. Clearly suffering from some form of mental illness, Guiteau had expected to be the beneficiary of the spoils system by being handed a plum job for his supposedly invaluable support of Garfield during the campaign. In fact, Guiteau believed he deserved to be appointed U.S. consul to Paris, a job for which he was wholly unqualified. 
As he was being arrested, Guiteau said excitedly, “Arthur is president now!” When Guiteau’s comment was widely reported, many Americans suspected Arthur of being involved in the plot. Arthur received death threats and was deeply troubled by the accusation. 
But Garfield wasn’t dead yet. 
He survived for weeks with the bullet lodged in his abdomen. Doctors tried repeatedly to remove it. Secretary of War Robert Todd Lincoln, son of the late president, summoned Dr. Doctor Willard Bliss (yes, Doctor was his first name) to tend to the president. 
Dr. Charles Purvis, a Black physician who was among the doctors treating the president, urged Bliss to employ the relatively new practice of surgeons’ washing their hands and using sterilizing instruments, but Bliss brushed him off. Garfield suffered through multiple attempts to locate the bullet, all without anesthesia.
When he died 79 days after being shot, an autopsy determined that the bullet hadn’t damaged any major organs and could safely have been left in place. The president had died of a massive infection, sepsis, caused by the unsanitary conditions under which he was treated.
Arthur had taken no executive actions while Garfield lingered, not daring to feed the rumors of a power grab.
In fact, the assassination seems to have reawakened Arthur’s long-dormant political integrity. Once in office, Arthur set his mind to reform, both of the political system and of himself. He worked to fulfill Garfield’s mission of dismantling the patronage system, by successfully championing the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act, which introduced competitive exams for many federal positions and made it illegal to fire federal employees for political reasons.  
People who had only known Arthur as a linchpin in the political machine might have thought these impulses came out of the blue. But as a younger man, Arthur had shown he could be highly principled. Like his Baptist preacher father, Arthur was an abolitionist. Early in his legal career, he represented a Black woman who had been accosted and thrown off a “whites only” New York City streetcar, winning a sizable judgement in her favor. 
As president, Arthur ultimately defied public expectations, running an administration free of major scandal.  
“No man ever entered the presidency so profoundly and widely distrusted,” Pennsylvania newspaper editor Alexander K. McClure noted at the time. “And no one ever retired more generally respected.”  
Or, as Mark Twain quipped: “I am but one of 55 million; still, in the opinion of this 1/55 millionth of the country’s population, it would be hard to better President Arthur’s administration. But don’t decide till you hear from the rest.”
While Arthur is the most significant Vermont appearing in “Death by Lightning,” alert viewers might note a couple other Vermont cameos. U.S. Rep. Levi Morton, born in Shoreham, appears in all four episodes, though as a minor character. In one scene, he tells Garfield he can’t accept the position of Secretary of the Navy (Conkling had pressured him to reject the position).
In real life, it was hardly the end of Morton’s career. Garfield soon appointed him U.S. minister to France. He was later elected governor of New York and, in 1888, vice president of the United States—along with Arthur and Calvin Coolidge, one of only three Vermonters ever to hold that position.  
Another Vermonter, John Humphrey Noyes, also appears briefly. Born and raised in Brattleboro, Noyes started a utopian commune in nearby Putney. His neighbors were outraged to learn of the commune’s belief in free love and he soon moved the community to Oneida, New York. 
Noyes appears in flashbacks with the future assassin Guiteau, who spent six years as a member of what people in series call a “sex cult.” Guiteau is depicted as getting on people’s nerves because he believes he is too good for the manual labor expected of all community members.
Despite the commune’s free-love edict, the women of Oneida want nothing to do with Guiteau, who they nickname “Charles Git Out.” That unlikely detail — like so many other startling aspects of “Death by Lightning”— is true.

This story by Patrick Billow was first published in News & Citizen on Nov. 13, 2025.
An 1850s Morristown home and barn, which raised a family and thousands of exotic plant species over the last four decades, will soon be wiped from the land — the home by an excavator and the barn by several eager members of the Vermont Youth Conservation Corps.
Don and Lela Avery met in Big Sur, California before they moved with their two sons to a 22-acre property on Duhamel Road in 1979. Leveraging fertile soil next to the Kenfield Brook, they started propagating famously stubborn plants with success, a hobby that blossomed into a renowned business, the Cadys Falls Nursery.
Customers from around the country visited Morristown to purchase rare plant species from Don and Lela. In elaborate gardens around their home, they planted more than 1,400 plant varieties — from showy Lady’s Slippers to dwarf conifers — complemented by paths, sculptures and rock walls that Don built over the years.
The Averys closed the nursery at the onset of the pandemic and opened their beloved gardens to the public. Don and Lela, unbothered and welcoming, would go about their day while guests, plant-savvy or simply seeking serenity, wandered the gardens freely.

But living at the confluence of the Kenfield Brook and Lamoille River has its disadvantages. In terms of 100-year floods— dramatic events that might occur once a century — the Averys have experienced eight in 40 years.
They hoped the flood of 1995 was the worst of it, and after initial concerns that they couldn’t live in the home, the flooding relaxed for decades, and the Averys decided to hunker down.
Then, the Flood of 2023 raised the water level to the first-floor windows of their home.
“We made a decision to stay there and get old there and die there, or whatever you can do,” Don Avery said. “But then 2023 came around and it just slammed us. We weren’t young anymore. We couldn’t really deal with it.”
After a two-year search for a new home, Don and Lela last week signed their property over to the State of Vermont. Vermont Emergency Management purchased the property through a flood-plain buyout for $850,000, and Vermont Fish and Wildlife will restore the land to its natural environment. That money covers the town’s assessed value of the property as well as the cost of removing the home and barn. Including the nursery, there are three active buyouts in Morristown and about 300 in the state.
While the home will be demolished and dragged away, the barn, with its historic features and towering timber frame, is getting a decidedly different treatment. Under the guidance of Huntington-based Building Heritage, volunteers with the Vermont Youth Conservation Corps are taking the structure apart piece by piece and rebuilding it at a different location.
By the end of the year, every structure and piece of material on the property will have been removed, down to bare soil, except for Don and Lela’s plants, which they have three years to relocate, a courtesy likewise granted to farms during a buyout.
The land will become public, rip rap in the river removed; beavers will move in, and the area will continue to flood, but that could improve flooding conditions downstream, according to Will Eldridge, an aquatic habitat biologist with Vermont Fish and Wildlife.
“This is really best for everybody, so I’m not as heartbroken as some people would think,” Don Avery said.
Built to last
Last Friday, volunteers with the Vermont Youth Conservation Corps climbed high into the barn’s rafters and used L-shaped metal rods to pry wooden pegs from timber-frame joints. Tyler Hadar, one volunteer, had devised a system for labeling the timbers with silver placards, so they’d know how to put the barn back together.

The volunteers work through different Conservation Corps programs, but they all have an appreciation for the structure they are disassembling. Hadar is with the timber framing program and other volunteers came from the farming and conservation program.
Working under the guidance of Building Heritage, a historic preservation company, the barn is the first project of its kind for several of the volunteers, and its new territory for the company as well. Interstate 89 travelers might recognize the massive red East Monitor barn off the highway near Richmond, one of the largest barns in the state, which the preservation company rehabilitated in 2023.
“We’ve renovated lots of old barns, but this is our first time taking one down,” Elliot Nathrop of Building Heritage said.
The barn should be disassembled and gone in five weeks, then rebuilt at Building Heritage’s headquarters in Huntington. Its next home has not been determined, but Nathrop said the company has a host of private and public connections for the structure.

As winter rolls in, the volunteers and three workers with Building Heritage are stripping the two-story barn down to the historic timber frame. Accessory structures attached to the barn, like greenhouses and out-barns, have been torn away and demolished, and the old clapboards and metal roofing thrown away, but the hand-hewn timbers and inside-facing boards will be repurposed.
For volunteers in the timber framing program, the project is a practical look at age-old building practices they’re learning about. For farming and conservation volunteers, it’s a lesson on how to deal with ancient structures that are common throughout Vermont’s landscape.
Jessie Gustafson, another volunteer with the timber framing program, is happy the barn is being saved, and she’s found a type of serenity among the hand-hewn timbers from 150 years ago.
“I feel like it’s a lot of respect for the trees that went into making this, and the people that took the time to make it,” Gustafson said. “It’s just such a beautiful barn, and it’s fun to be in here. It’s also fun just, like, ripping stuff up.”
Repurposing structures like the barn also cuts down on the amount of material deposited in a landfill, fulfilling a state mandate to reduce waste after a buyout. On Wednesday, King Construction knocked down the Avery’s home of 40 years with an excavator, and the remains will be thrown away.
Although it’s a historic structure with its own timber frame skeleton, layers of plaster and other material in the home rendered it too difficult and expensive to renovate.
Prior to the demolition, the Averys asked friends and neighbors to raid their home. Building material and appliances, including marble windows, a wood stove and hardwood went to seven surrounding counties in Vermont.
It was nice because it all went to people we knew, people who were building a house or renovating their house, so we knew it was all going to get used,” Lela Avery said.

Don’t whither away
With the structures slated for removal by the end of the year, the only thing remaining of the nursery will be Don and Avery’s gardens, but they have three years to remove them from the property.
Vermont Fish and Wildlife doesn’t want to manage the gardens, but the Averys wanted to break it up anyways. They’ve seen some private gardens wither once they become public.
“It’s too personal,” Don Avery said. “We always knew this wouldn’t be here forever, but we wanted someone who would take care of the plants after us.”
They don’t have a plan for all the species, but some of the rare conifers will return to Greg Williams, a Wolcott plant master who taught the Averys how to graft trees decades ago.
“It was a good long run,” Lela Avery said. “We really enjoyed it. We loved our little place there. We loved our business, and we loved our customers.”

REPORTING HIGHLIGHTSMoving Cars Fast: An analysis of 6,000 forms that Connecticut towing companies submitted to sell cars found firms regularly listed low values, which allows them to sell vehicles quickly.Some Companies Had Patterns: One company valued about 90% of the cars it tried to sell at exactly $1,500, the DMV cutoff to start the sales process after 15 days.Luxury Cars: Towers sought permission to sell about 150 luxury cars for less than a third of their book value despite the cars having no accident record in the state crash database.
The first time Ruedean Harvey saw the white Range Rover Autobiography at a New York City dealership, she fell in love.
“They took me up on this escalator, and the car was enclosed in a glass room, and I was like, ‘Yep, that’s the car for me,’” she said. The dealership arranged to have a limousine take her from their offices to get the bank check, she said, and when she got back, the salespeople had Champagne ready to pop.
Harvey, a construction contractor who now lives in New Britain, Connecticut, paid almost $135,000 in 2012 to buy her dream car. It had a handcrafted leather interior, walnut wood paneling and massaging seats with televisions built into the headrests.
But after the vehicle was towed from a public street in 2023, a tow truck company tried to sell it without her knowledge, writing on a form to the Connecticut Department of Motor Vehicles that it was worth only $1,475.
The value happened to be just under a $1,500 DMV threshold that allows towing companies to seek the agency’s permission to sell cars they tow after 15 days if the owner doesn’t claim it or says they can’t afford the fees.
Over the past year, The Connecticut Mirror and ProPublica have reported on how Connecticut’s laws have come to favor towing companies over drivers, including the 15-day provision, which was one of the shortest windows in the country. A law that took effect in October says towers must wait at least 30 days to sell cars.
Connecticut towers have publicly insisted that most of the cars they sell are junk. To sell a car, towing companies need to get DMV approval by filling out a form estimating the value, which the agency is supposed to check against the book value.
But a new CT Mirror and ProPublica analysis of more than 6,000 forms processed by the DMV in 2022-23 and obtained in a public records request found patterns of low values listed by tow companies. And it highlights the DMV’s lack of oversight of the process.
To analyze the towers’ and DMV’s handling of the sales process, the news organizations spent more than a year building a database from the forms, some of which are handwritten. That involved sorting through thousands of scanned documents and manually entering DMV employees’ handwritten vehicle values. Together, the records allow the public to know for the first time what kinds of cars are being sold after tows, who’s towing them and what happens to the vehicles.
The data shows towing companies frequently take advantage of the provision to start the sales process for lower-value cars after just 15 days. About 60% of the forms requested these fast-track sales. By valuing cars under $1,500, towers can sell cars privately and avoid a more cumbersome process that requires them to wait 45 days and sell vehicles at a public auction.
One West Hartford towing company, Elmwood Automotive, valued about 90% of the 33 cars it tried to sell in the past few years at exactly $1,500, our analysis found. The next highest, Lone Star Repair Service and East Coast Towing, both of Stamford, listed around half their cars at exactly that amount. None of those companies responded to requests for comment.
Attorney Eric L. Foster, who specializes in repossession cases and sits on a DMV task force studying towing regulations, said the odds of 9 out of 10 cars being worth exactly $1,500 is “zero.” Foster said it’s on the DMV to call out such data discrepancies and reject the tow companies’ forms because “until you get slapped on the wrist, you just keep doing the behavior.”
Many large companies value their cars below $1,500 and move the vehicles fast, the data showed. Nine companies that submitted more than 50 forms sought permission to sell over 90% of those towed cars after 15 days, as opposed to the longer 45-day process.
Even when towing companies do value vehicles over $1,500 and wait the 45 days, undervaluing cars helps. Under the law, towers are supposed to hold onto proceeds for a year, then hand the money over to the state for owners or lenders to claim later. Using a lower value allows towers to claim they had no profits after subtracting their storage fees.
It’s impossible to know the conditions of all the cars. But CT Mirror and ProPublica found that in nearly half the cases, the tower’s value was less than or equal to 50% of the book value.
In one of the starkest examples, towers sought permission to sell about 150 luxury cars, including nearly 40 BMWs and 20 Mercedes, for less than a third of their book value despite the vehicles having no accident record in the state’s crash database.
DMV spokesperson Shaun Formica said that the agency has reviewed its process for tows. She added that “recent discussions along with legislative changes have reshaped our process” for evaluating the values of vehicles.
At a meeting late last month, DMV program director Johnnine Dominique said employees review forms and make a call about whether differences between the towers’ estimates and the book values are large enough to cause alarm. Sometimes, they ask towing companies to submit evidence supporting the lower value.
“It’s not a good system regardless,” Dominique said, noting that it relies on judgment calls.
In Harvey’s case, the tow company filed the form exactly 15 days after it was towed. The car was having engine trouble, and the DMV approved the tower’s value even though an agency document examiner listed the book value at $17,250. Used car listings show several Range Rover Autobiographies, with more mileage and fewer features than Harvey’s, for sale at higher prices.
Lack of Data
CT Mirror and ProPublica’s initial investigation of towing company practices prompted a legislative overhaul of the state’s law that makes it harder to tow vehicles from private property and easier for drivers to retrieve their vehicles after a tow. As part of the new law, the DMV also had to create a task force to discuss more measures to address how sales occur and what happens to the proceeds.
At the task force’s first meeting in September, Sal Sena, whose company was authorized to sell more towed cars than any other in Connecticut in 2022-23, said nearly half the vehicles he tows aren’t registered, and many of them never get picked up.
But when Raphael Podolsky, a consumer advocate and attorney, pressed for data, neither the DMV nor towers on the task force could provide any.
“The implication was there was no way we could find these things out,” he said.

In fact, Sena’s company, Sena Brothers, which operates as Cross Country Automotive, used the 15-day process for 98% of the towed cars it wanted to sell in 2022-23. Two other companies — Corona’s Auto Parts and Friendly Auto Body & Towing, both of Hartford — used the fast-track sales process 99% of the time.
Sena said he isn’t surprised that he’s the highest-volume company or that most of his forms are filed after 15 days because of the condition of the vehicles he tows. “The majority of the cars that we tow are unregistered and inoperable,” he said. “We do everything from city of Hartford towing to the housing authority towing in multiple towns, and we’re cleaning the parking lots all day long.”
Tom Amenta, owner of Friendly Auto Body, said that his company follows “the letter of the law,” and that low values are a result of towing cars in poor condition. “We can only apply” for the sale, Amenta added. “DMV is the ultimate judge.”
Corona’s did not respond to calls and emails seeking comment.
Of the 6,000 forms processed in 2022-23 that the newsrooms reviewed, more than 2,000 listed values between $500 and $600. In addition, there were 362 where towing companies estimated the car’s value to be exactly $1,500. Metro Auto Body & Towing of Hartford submitted the most forms at exactly $1,500, with 60. Many of those were cars they towed for parking meter violations for the Hartford Parking Authority and not for crashes, which could significantly reduce the value.
Metro also did not return calls or emails.
Bristol resident Jason Trelli wondered how his 2011 Jaguar got such a low value after it was towed in May 2023. He was moving out of his rental home and loaded his possessions into a U-Haul, planning to return to get his car in a few hours.
“So I go to get the Jaguar back, and it’s not there,” Trelli said.
Trelli called the police, who told him the car was towed by Nelcon, which is also registered with the DMV as Maple Avenue Repair Service. But he said the company’s Plainville office repeatedly told him it didn’t have his car.
After several weeks, Nelcon acknowledged it had the car, Trelli said. He spent several more weeks calling the company. But he said Nelcon refused to waive the storage fees, which eventually mounted to $1,900, according to a text message his sister sent him right after speaking to the company herself in August 2023.
In a written statement, Nelcon’s owner, Saleem Khan, disputed portions of Trelli’s account and said, “No employee told Mr. Trelli we did not tow his vehicle.” He said, “Our records show Mr. Trelli was quoted a total price of $665,” when he initially called about his car.
Nelcon submitted a form to the DMV in August 2023 to sell the Jaguar at a public auction. Khan wrote the car was worth $3,500 — about $3,000 less than the book value a DMV employee wrote on the form.
Khan said he used the National Automobile Dealers Association value for the car, adding that the company sold the car to a salvage yard last month.
If Nelcon had written the DMV’s book value and sold it for that, the company would have owed Trelli the profits.
“I never felt so helpless and angry,” Trelli said.

Over the Limit
In addition to some companies valuing high numbers of vehicles at $1,500, some towers submitted forms for 15-day sales even though they listed a value above the $1,500 limit for shorter sales. The CT Mirror and ProPublica found more than 200 forms that listed higher values than allowed.
Rather than rejecting those forms, Formica, the DMV spokesperson, said the agency typically just holds onto the forms until the 45-day mark has passed.
“We generally put them aside, and then once it’s time, we’ll process them,” Formica said, adding that “nothing is getting through.”
That’s what occurred in the cases of Saundra Magana and her niece Eloise Bennett this summer. They had been fighting with the New Britain Parking Ticket Department about payment for their spaces in a city garage for months when Magana went to get something out of her red 2008 Hummer H3 in early July and discovered her car was gone. Gone too were Bennett’s Chrysler PT Cruiser and Jeep Cherokee with a Dallas Cowboys star custom-painted on the hood.
New Britain police told Magana that the city had hired Skytop Motors to tow the vehicles because she and her niece owed thousands of dollars in parking tickets.
Skytop requested the DMV’s permission to sell Magana’s Hummer on July 22. On the form they wrote the car was worth $5,900, well over the $1,500 limit to sell a car after 15 days. But Skytop still checked the 15-day box.
Records show the DMV gave Skytop permission to sell the three cars in August — 47 days after the tows.
Magana said Skytop never notified her that her car would be sold. Both women said they never got an itemized towing bill, and Bennett said she never got any notice from Skytop that it had towed her vehicles. The form Skytop submitted to the DMV listed Bennett at an address that was on her registration but that she hadn’t lived at for several years.

Magana and Bennett filed complaints with the DMV, which closed their cases because it was a civil matter that needed to be handled in the courts, according to letters they received.
A Skytop official said in a statement that the company had been “cleared” by the DMV and the state Department of Consumer Protection. “All cases have been dropped and found out we did no wrong doing,” the company said, without addressing specific questions.
Under the law, towing companies are required to provide evidence that they notified the registered owner and any lienholders, but relying on registration isn’t foolproof.
Foster, the attorney, said the biggest problem with the system is that owners aren’t notified about tows and pending sales because towing companies rely on the address used for registration, which is sometimes out of date.
The result is drivers lose their cars, and “the penalty should not be punitive,” Foster said.
Properly notifying people their cars have been towed is also one of the biggest issues towers face, Sena told consumer advocates at the task force meeting in September.
“If we could create a system where they’re being notified and everybody is aware of the situation, then half the problems you guys are dealing with — and half the problems we are — are going to go away,” Sena said.
As of the last week of October, at least two of Magana’s and Bennett’s vehicles, the Hummer and the PT Cruiser, could be seen sitting in Skytop’s tow lot. It’s unclear what happened to the Jeep.

“This Freaking Car”
For Podolsky, the problem that remains, even after the revised law went into effect last month, is making sure that people who want to get their car back can do so.
Consumer advocates and towing companies remain far apart as they try to agree on solutions to recommend to the legislature by a February deadline.
At the October task force meeting, Podolsky recommended stopping the fees from accumulating once a person notifies the tower they want the car back. Minnesota, for example, allows extra time for vehicle owners who notify the tower to pay. Towers proposed getting rid of valuing cars altogether and holding all vehicles for 30 days, regardless of the value.
Other states don’t rely on towing companies to value vehicles, according to a survey the Connecticut DMV conducted this year. Florida considers the age of the vehicle, for example, while Oregon requires certified appraisers to value vehicles.
“The end result should be they get the car back because they need the car and they don’t abandon the car because they don’t have the money,” Podolsky said.
Harvey was lucky enough to get her luxury Range Rover back.
Her ordeal started in 2023 when the SUV had an engine problem. She took it to a mechanic an acquaintance recommended in Bloomfield. But town officials closed the repair shop because of building code violations.
Somehow, the car was moved to a street in Hartford, where police noticed it sitting for weeks and, assuming it was abandoned, had it towed by Modern Garage.
Exactly 15 days after towing it, Modern Garage submitted a form seeking to sell it. Modern Garage used the 15-day process in 85% of its sales requests in 2022-23. Harvey said she was never notified her car had been towed, but after finding out the repair shop had closed, she called the Hartford Police, who told her that her car was at Modern Garage.
Harvey said when she got there, a man who identified himself as co-owner acknowledged her Range Rover was still there but that it was “leaving today.”
“My partner’s gonna be very upset; he was keeping the car for himself,” Harvey said the man told her.
Modern Garage owner Michael Sardelli denied anyone was planning to keep the car. “Nobody would have told her that,” he said.
Sardelli said the $1,475 value on the form was accurate because “there was a massive puddle of oil under it. It was clearly disabled.”
“They’re a dime a dozen,” Sardelli said of Range Rovers on the marketplace. “They are just so expensive to maintain and once they get mileage on them, the repairs of the car supersede its value tenfold.”
Harvey ended up paying nearly $2,600 that same day to get her car back. Still inoperable, it sits in her garage needing expensive engine repairs.
“I worked my whole life for this freaking car,” Harvey said.

How We Analyzed the DMV’s Forms
To build our database of more than 6,000 forms processed by the Connecticut DMV in 2022-23, CT Mirror and ProPublica extracted and manually entered information from over 10,000 scanned documents obtained through public records requests.
The forms, known as H-100s, were difficult to read, with illegible handwriting and inconsistent redactions, making it difficult to sort through thousands of duplicates across 11 batches.
Reporters manually reviewed the forms, recording the DMV’s listed book value, towing company name, tower license number, tow date, if the tower was selling within 15 or 45 days, the tower’s estimated value and the date a DMV employee signed the form. The vehicle identification number is included on the form but was sometimes illegible or redacted.
We removed rows that were not unique. It is possible that we are undercounting a situation in which two cars were towed and submitted to the DMV for sale approval on the same days and were valued exactly the same by the tower and by the DMV. The inherent inaccuracy of manual transcription meant some duplicate rows were not identical because of human error. We rereviewed nearly 2,000 rows where all but one variable matched, dropping an additional 900 duplicates.
Sometimes, a towing company submitted a new form for the same vehicle. We removed the first form and kept the resubmission when the tow date and VIN matched. Sometimes, it was impossible to decipher a handwritten number. We used our best judgment, generally picking interpretations closest to other dates visible on the form.
To check if high-value luxury cars were in disrepair, we joined our database with the Connecticut Crash Data Repository. Because we could only join the data by tow date, make and year, our counts of cars that were not involved in crashes is an undercount.

(Kansas Reflector screen capture from hesstongrocerystore.com)A grocery store like you’ve never seen.
Sometimes there’s a small-town voice in my head that wants to believe, that chides me for being too skeptical, that wants me to join the boosterism chorus. It’s me from another dimension. And it whispers things like this:
I mean, it was going to be a grocery store like the Ritz is a hotel. Yeah, it would be a place where you could buy milk and eggs and maybe some Hamburger Helper for dinner, but that’s like saying you go to Vegas to buy a lottery ticket. Know what I mean? The damn grocery store was going to be a certifiable work of art, a place — no, a destination! — that would draw people from all over just to say they shopped there.
You wouldn’t even have to park outside.
All underground parking, so you don’t have to get wet in the rain or cold in the snow. Lots of lighting and climate-controlled. Even parking and charging stations for your golf carts. No stairs to climb. An elevator would take you up to the store, just like you was going to heaven.
That was the pitch, right down to the parking. You can look it up yourself. Jobs for up to 50 people, a “Delicatessen-style restaurant,” a bakery and German food items in keeping with local heritage. The price tag was something like $20 million, and while there are cheaper ways to get a grocery store, they lacked the vision of this one rich guy.
It would be smack in the middle of this town in Kansas, a little place called Hesston that has 3,500 people tops, a nice town founded in 1886. It’s about 40 minutes north of Wichita. You know the kind of place, full of nice folks where you’d feel safe raising your kids. But like a lot of these burgs it’s been struggling lately, and the last grocery store went bust a few years ago.
That’s where the rich guy comes in.
His name is Brad Heppner. He’s 59 and lives in Texas, but he grew up at Hesston. There’s a video of him at a town meeting last year, and he talks about his connection to the town, about how he’s a sixth-generation Kansan and his people were one of the three founding families of the town way back when, and it’s like listening to somebody read all those begats from Genesis. It’s easy to understand why people trusted him.
He’s kind of a Sunflower Gatsby, see?
He made a lot of money in finance. Started a company and sold it to Lehman Brothers — yeah, the firm that went bust in 2008 — and he has a mansion in Dallas called “Sunfields Manor” where he has these big parties for his rich friends. He also has an estate named after himself out in the middle of nowhere Texas with its own heliport. Can you imagine that?
He founded this other company with a funny name — Beneficial or Beneficient or something, but Brad just calls it “Ben” — with this genius idea of creating a pawnshop for the rich. No, really. I guess the rich need pawnshops like the rest of us do, except instead of your dad’s Stratocaster they’re hocking their private equity or art treasures or vintage Duesenbergs for quick cash.
Brad came back to Kansas and set up a subsidiary for this pawnshop deal because his 80-something mom told him there wasn’t a grocery store in town anymore. He promised to build her one. That’s the story he told just about everyone. He told it to the town, to lawmakers, to the governor. You can look at this video of him saying it. He convinced just about everybody to get on board with the idea, and four years ago he convinced the state Legislature to let him launch the world’s first TEFFI — that’s the name for this kind of pawnshop, and it stands for technology and fiduciary and some other things, but it kind of makes my head hurt to think about it. See, the lawmakers were smart and ignored the Kansas bank commissioner who said there ought to be more regulation, because regulation just stifles business. It was all fine, because 2.5% of every transaction would be earmarked for economic development and, you know, the grocery store.
It would all go through a private nonprofit foundation run by Brad and his wife and their friends and associates, so you knew the money would be safe. Heck, the Heppners even gave $6.5 million to get it started. I mean, this was a great deal, and although nobody really understood how the pawnshop worked, everybody could see the potential. This is why there was such bipartisan support for it in Topeka.
What could go wrong?
Brad said Ben would be so successful there would be lots of TEFFIs popping up in Kansas, maybe 40 or 50 in a couple of years, and the money would roll in, all at no risk to Kansans. That money would come from rich people all over the world, maybe even people in Russia, he said. Imagine that! All those rubles helping to fund a grocery store in Kansas. Only in America!
There was going to be so much money to burn that the plan for the grocery store kept getting bigger and bigger. And it wasn’t just going to be a grocery store, it was going to be an entire shopping experience in downtown Hesston, with buildings made to look like they were straight out of 1886 and new spaces for the city offices. There would be child care and public transportation and all sorts of family-friendly fun.
Then Ben — the big company out of Texas — merged with an even bigger company and its stock went public and was being traded on the NASDAQ. That was a couple of years ago, and shares were going for more than $600. But you know, things have been tough since then, and last time I checked the price of a share was about 50 cents. That might sound bad, but it’s really a great opportunity to invest. Got a buck in your pocket? You could own a couple of shares of Ben.
And I hate to even mention this part, but the feds were looking into some of Brad’s past deals, right from the start. Then this summer some attorneys began asking questions about accounting procedures, and Brad was like, Hey, don’t you know all I’ve done for you? So he resigned rather than answer questions. Can you blame him? Talk about ingratitude. Brad even said it might be about time to shut down the company.
Even after Brad left, people wouldn’t leave him alone. You know how people are. Especially the government.
The feds arrested Brad on Nov. 4 and charged him with securities fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy, making false statements to auditors and falsification of records. Can you believe it?
The indictment alleges Brad misappropriated more than $150 million from a firm, GWG Holdings, forcing it into bankruptcy and causing $1 billion in losses to its investors. The feds claim the money was funneled through a shell company, and about $40 million was used to renovate the mansion in Dallas and his ranch estate. The feds also say he spent half a million bucks on jewelry.
Get this, here’s what the federal prosecutor, a guy named Jay Clayton, said:
“As alleged, Heppner abused his role as a public company executive to loot the company and to funnel money into his own pockets. When executives like Heppner lie and cheat to enrich themselves at the expense of everyday investors, they corrupt the integrity of our public markets.”
Whoa! Where does this guy get off? He just doesn’t get that Heppner is a job creator, somebody who gets things done, an individual who just wanted to help his hometown. I don’t see the feds rushing to build a grocery store for Hesston.
Now the foundation that’s in charge of building the grocery store says it’s going to have to scale back the plans. No climate-controlled underground parking.
For crying out loud, they’re going to ruin things for all of us.
Beneficient is run by different folks now, and they admit that Brad might have oversold the pawnshop idea. But, they said, the idea might still work and that they were committed to building “fundamental value,” whatever that is. They seem like nice folks. The interim CEO told lawmakers that the company was on the same side as law enforcement.
“You don’t have to be a Venezuelan drug cartel boat driver to know that you want to be on the government side of that,” he said, which I thought was kind of a weird thing to say, if you want to know the truth.
Brad entered a “not guilty” plea on Monday, Nov. 10, so I guess he’s going to fight. The feds arrested him in Texas but hauled him to New York, where the charges were filed. Figures. According to the indictment, they’re looking to take away Brad’s mansion and the ranch.
He’s presumed innocent until proven guilty.
Damn right!
This all reminds me somehow of a book I was made to read in high school about a guy named Gatsby. You know the story. Gatsby’s the hero, and he gets the girl and has this big house and has all these parties. I didn’t make it to the end of the book because it was so long, but I do remember something about a green light.
That’s what we all want out of life, right? A green light.
That’s not what it means. And Gatsby winds up dead.
Shut up!
When I was a kid, the highlight of my week was when I’d go with my mom to the local Piggly Wiggly and maybe be allowed to get a comic book from the rack near the front. Imagining the $20 million grocery store Brad was going to build, I had kind of the same feeling. You didn’t know if you were going to get a Fantastic Four or a Spider-Man, but you knew it was going to be good.
There won’t be any comic books for us now, just a lousy Bazooka Joe wrapper.
But the thing that bothers me most is thinking about Brad’s mom. She’s in her 80s, and everybody says she’s a great lady. It looks like she’ll never have the chance to go to the dream grocery store with Brad and park underground and go up the elevator. That makes me sad in the same way as when I think about when I learned there wasn’t a Santa Claus. I’ll bet it makes her sad, too.
Okay, we finally agree.

But are they always honest  when flyers face delays?","You ever get the sense the airlines are lying to you?
Sure, the government shutdown wasn’t their fault. But are they always honest — in this instance and others — when flyers face delays?


How often has a promised 20-minute delay morphed into an hour?  And then another hour?  And maybe even a cancellation?
Because these most recent delays were beyond their control (they can blame Congress), airlines were not required to do much… aside from apologize.  Some did offer meal vouchers and hotel rooms, but for the most part travelers were on their own as schedules and staff were juggled.
Overall, the federal shutdown is estimated to have cost airlines, hotels, and car-rental companies about $1 billion a week.  And that’s not even counting the cost to travelers for their time and expenses.
But when the airlines say, “We apologize for the delay, but it’s not our fault,” there are some things they can and do control, especially as they drive for maximum revenue on every flight… like paid-for seat assignments, one of the so called “junk fees.”
A U.S. Senate report says one airline alone, United, raked in $1.3 billion just for letting passengers pick their seats… more than the $1.2 billion they earned for handling checked bags.
Assigned seats ease the boarding process and give fliers what they want… aisle access, that comfy middle seat or, my favorite, the window seat.  I want to see where I’m flying and I’ll pay to get it.
So imagine the outrage of passengers on several airlines who paid $15 – $30 for a window seat and found it had no window!
United and Delta airlines are now facing a class action suit potentially affecting more than a million passengers who were affected, paying for window seats with no windows.  It’s just the way the aircraft were built and the seats were laid out, so the airlines knew before offering those seat reservations.
If they knew the ‘window seats’ had no windows, why not warn passengers before they click?
(I encountered the same problem on Amtrak on its new NextGen Acela, choosing a window seat in advance only to board the new train and find a bulkhead and no window.) 
What’s the airline’s defense?  Well, they say that just because it’s called a window seat doesn’t mean you get a window… that the seat name refers more to its placement nearest the fuselage vs the aisle.
In its defense, United’s attorneys literally said “The use of the word ‘window’ in reference to a particular seat cannot reasonably be interpreted as a promise that the seat will have an exterior window view.”
Really. That’s what they said.
All of which reminds me of former bosses at Metro-North in the bad old pre-COVID days of over-crowded, standing-room-only trains.  When one passenger suggested a refund for not getting a seat he was told, “You’re paying for transportation.  We never promised you a seat.”
Such customer service!",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/window-view-1024x894.jpg,,,2025-11-16 04:56:28.249955

(Photo by Christiana Botic/Verite News and Catchlight Local/Report for America)Calvin Duncan, who was wrongfully convicted of murder 40 years ago and sentenced to life in prison, was elected clerk of Orleans Parish Criminal Court Saturday night, handily defeating established incumbent Darren Lombard.
Duncan claimed 68% of the vote with all precincts reporting their results. Turnout for the election was 21.5%. 
The campaign between two Democrats saw Republican state Attorney General Liz Murrill challenge Duncan’s claim that he had been exonerated. She sent him a letter before the October primary election, saying he needed to “cease representing to the public that you were ‘exonerated’ to avoid further action from this office.” 
Court records confirm Duncan’s name was cleared in 2021.
Lombard also called into question Duncan’s criminal status during public debates and in a lawsuit that accused his opponent of making false claims in violation of state election laws. An Orleans Parish judge denied Lombard’s request for a temporary restraining order to halt Duncan’s campaign advertising. 
In addition to his own experience as a defendant, Duncan was a “jailhouse lawyer” while serving time at Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola, helping other incarcerated people with their post-conviction filings. 
After his release, Duncan earned a bachelor’s degree in paralegal studies from Tulane University and received his law degree from Lewis and Clark Law School. He founded the Light of Justice Program, which provides assistance to the incarcerated.
Duncan was given a life sentence for the shooting death of  David Yeager, 23, during an Aug. 7, 1981, armed robbery in the Tremé neighborhood. Yeager’s girlfriend, Kristi Emberling, was with him when he was shot and identified Duncan as his killer in March 1982. Police showed her a mugshot of Duncan, who was 18 at the time Yaeger was killed, taken when he was 14 years old.
The Innocence Project of New Orleans, now known as Innocence and Justice Louisiana, began representing Duncan in 2004. Its attorneys questioned the accuracy of Emberling’s identification, noting she said she was convinced that Duncan was the shooter only after she was him on television in handcuffs after being arrested. 
The defense team also compelled the release of withheld police documents in New Orleans in Portland, Oregon, where Duncan had moved to join a Job Corps program and was arrested. 
The documents revealed discrepancies in the investigation, which was led in Clackemas County by a detective who would later be convicted of illegal wire tapping in a separate case. The same detective had told Duncan he has been identified by his two prominent gold front teeth, which wasn’t true.
Mounting issues with the case led then Orleans Parish District Attorney Leon Cannizzaro to vacate Duncan’s murder conviction in 2011 and allow him to plead guilty to manslaughter and attempted armed robbery. Duncan was resentenced to 49 years in prison but released for the time he had served. Cannizzaro, who now leads the criminal division in Murrill’s office, was an assistant DA involved in Duncan’s prosecution in 1985.
In 2021, the Louisiana Legislature approved a law to allow defendants who’ve pleaded guilty to challenge their convictions if evidence of their innocence was withheld from court. Duncan sought such relief and after a judge vacated his 2011 conviction, current Orleans District Attorney Jason Williams dropped the charges against him. 
The clerk’s post puts Duncan in charge of record keeping for Orleans Parish Criminal Court, and he’ll oversee all elections in the city. 
Lombard will leave office after one term, having won the citywide post in 2021 after serving as clerk of the city court in Algiers since 2012. 
The incumbent’s chances to stay office in took a hit over the summer when it was discovered that several boxes of criminal court records, some dating back to the 1950s, were mistaken taken to a city landfill. Lombard blamed Mayor LaToya Cantrell’s administration for trashing the documents without his approval. The city had provided space to store records for the clerk’s office, which had run out of room for storage.

RANDOLPH — Vermont’s state chapter of the Democratic Party has a new leader — and he’s taking the helm at a challenging moment for the party in Vermont and across the country. 
Lachlan Francis, a political consultant from Westminster and former chair of the Windham County Democratic committee, was elected state party chair on Saturday at Vermont Democrats’ biennial reorganization meeting. Francis beat out one other candidate for the job — Justin Willeau of Vershire, the former secretary of Orange County’s Democratic committee and owner of a coffee business — by 33 votes to 12.
The two candidates were vying to succeed outgoing party chair Jim Ramsey, who’d held the job on an interim basis since February but opted not to seek it again. Ramsey took on the role with less than a full, two-year term left after former chair David Glidden resigned.
Also on Saturday, the party reelected its current vice chair — Amanda Gustin of Barre City — to another two-year term, as well as a slate of other statewide officers who oversee the party’s electoral strategy and manage its finances.
Only the race for chair was contested. The roughly four dozen people who voted in Saturday’s election, held on the Vermont State University campus in Randolph, were largely members of county Democratic committees from across the state. 
Francis steps into the job a week after Vermont’s Republican Party also elected a slate of top officers for the next two years. A key focus for Democrats — who are likely to maintain control in the 2026 election of both the state House and Senate — will be winning back seats the party lost in 2024. That’s when the state GOP flipped a historic number of seats in both chambers, dismantling powerful Democratic supermajorities.
Many of those races were colored by voters’ concerns over the cost of living and how safe they feel in their communities. The extent of Democrats’ success in 2026 will hinge on the party’s ability to find messages that resonate with many of the voters who spurned its candidates — some of them incumbents — in races a year ago. 
Meanwhile, at the national level, Democrats are grappling with what flavor of left-wing politics could appeal to the most voters as they attempt to win back control of both houses of Congress next year and set the stage for a White House win in 2028. 
The national party has also been divided in recent days over decisions by some members of its Congressional caucuses to break ranks and join most Republicans on a spending deal that ended the federal government shutdown, but without a guaranteed extension of enhanced health insurance tax credits. (All three members of Vermont’s congressional delegation voted against the measure.)
“Obviously, we’ve got a lot on our plate — to say the least,” Francis said Saturday in brief remarks after the results of the vote were announced. He added in a press release issued later Saturday that, as chair, he would “strengthen our grassroots infrastructure across the state, support candidates who put people first, and ensure that we make Democratic values winning values in every election, in every community.”Francis previously managed now-U.S. Rep. Becca Balint’s first campaign for Vermont state Senate and worked on one of former Vermont Attorney General TJ Donovan’s campaigns for that office. More recently, he has worked as a researcher at Global Strategy Group, a national Democratic polling firm based in New York City.

At age 29, Francis also brings more youth to Vermont Democrats’ ranks. His election Saturday makes him one of the youngest state Democratic Party chairs in the country, according to May Hanlon, the Vermont Democrats’ executive director. Hanlon herself is 26, which makes her the youngest Democrat in her role in the country, she said. 
To be sure, much of the state GOP’s success in last year’s election was thanks to campaigning by Republican Gov. Phil Scott, who continues to be among the country’s most popular governors. In recent polling Scott also remains popular with Vermont Democratic voters who have a propensity to split their tickets on Election Day. 
A major question facing the state Democratic Party in the first half of 2026 is whether it will run a challenger to Scott, assuming he runs for reelection, who would make for substantial competition. In the last two election cycles, Scott trounced his Democratic opponents, both of whom had relatively little name recognition across the state. 
Two state Democratic heavyweights — Treasurer Mike Pieciak and Attorney General Charity Clark — have been rumored to be eyeing the Fifth Floor job though have not publicly said yet whether they’re running.
Both Pieciak and the state party have been especially critical of many of Scott’s responses to actions taken by President Donald Trump’s administration in recent months.
Willeau, in his pitch to the room on Saturday, suggested the party take a less offensive stance against Scott — whom he called “our favorite punching bag” — because of the five-term governor’s popularity with Democratic voters.
“I think the question is, does this committee represent Democratic voters the way they actually vote?” he asked. “And, if it doesn’t — how well do we know ourselves?”

GLACIER — For going on three decades, Patricia “Patty” Davis was a fixture in the Glacier post office.
Her son said she always had music playing as she worked and used to bring her black dog, Bear, with her behind the counter.
“She was just a pillar of the community,” co-worker Jennie Ablondi said. “She was like the second mom to everyone.”
Davis, 70, died of heart complications on Nov. 1. Her passing has left Glacier residents not only mourning her loss, but also fearing for the future of the post office.
Rumors that the United States Postal Service plans to shut it down completely caused alarm this week in the rural community that relies heavily on physical mail. Cell service in the town is poor, while landline phones and WiFi are cut off during frequent power outages.
Glacier’s post office was not accepting outgoing mail on Monday, Nov. 10. The next closest post offices are in Maple Falls, almost 8 miles away, and in Deming, almost 20 miles away. Many locals do not get mail service to their homes.

Using the Maple Falls post office would present additional logistical challenges, in part because it is in a different zip code, said Glacier Water District Commissioner Deborah Ellen Baker. And she noted businesses having to change their address to another area would cause confusion. There are 215 mailboxes at the Glacier location, according to Baker.
“Currently, there is no updated information to provide” about plans for the Glacier post office, USPS spokesperson Janella Herron wrote in an email Wednesday, Nov. 12. She added she would respond again “as soon as I have any further feedback.”
In a Wednesday statement, U.S. Sen. Patty Murray wrote, “The post office in Glacier is not only an important part of the town’s history, but it’s essential to residents who visit every day to send and receive mail, get their medications, and so much else.”
“If this post office shuts down,” she added, “people in Glacier will be forced to travel much longer to get the basic mail services they rely on — I’m reaching out to USPS for more information and answers.”
On Monday, about 19 residents gathered in front of the post office entrance, some holding signs with messages like, “Save Glacier’s post office,” and “Deliver us from closure.”
Glacier Water District, which owns the building, doesn’t charge USPS for the space, Baker said. In fact, Davis paid a monthly $40 utility fee — the minimum the district could charge, Baker said — out of her own pocket.
Fay Catron, who joined the protest Monday, has lived in the area for almost 15 years. When her family first moved into their remote home, getting an address took some time, she said.
“Being out here, we don’t have a whole lot,” Catron said. “And so we — I — rely on this post office a lot.”
If the post office shuts down, Catron said, she may have to take time off work to get packages. She gets things by mail, she explained, because in this remote area it’s “an hour to anything.”
Some, like Diane Gilbraith, rely on the post office for prescriptions. Gilbraith, 80, said as she gets older, “I know my world is getting smaller. But the essentials are here.”
Getting medication by mail is “really important,” she said, “because I know it’s going to get to the point where I won’t be able to drive into town.”
There’s also a social aspect to the significance of the small office, which has a bulletin board for the town and a bookshelf that serves as a mini library.
“It’s our lifeline,” 50-year Glacier resident Jan Eskola said of the post office. “When the mail comes in, it’s a place where we can all gather and share information and ideas.”
After the protest dispersed, all was quiet again at the post office. Kodi Sortino stopped by to pick up her mail. The town has many elderly residents, Sortino said, for whom it would be hard to travel far for mail.
“Why make them go all that way and go through all the hassle of changing their town and all that nonsense?” she asked. Sortino, who’s lived in Glacier for 15 years, has most of her mail delivered to the post office.
Even if the post office stays open, locals will feel Davis’ absence. She took over running the post office in 1999 and had been there ever since.
“It’s just a small community,” Sortino said. “Everybody’s like family.”
Graham Davis said his mom was “my best friend since the day I was born.” She loved music, from The Beatles to Roy Orbison to Enya. Everybody knew Bear, her late dog and work companion.
Gilbraith said she never saw Davis lose her temper. “She just took care of people,” Gilbraith said. “That’s what she did.”
Sortino described Davis as a “free spirit,” someone who “just told you how it was.” It was always fun to chat with Davis on Ablondi on Sortino’s daily post office visits, she said.
“She was like — I don’t want to say a mom, more like an auntie to me,” Sortino said.
“I miss her,” she added. “It will be different without her.”
Graham Davis noted his mother “specifically requested that people celebrate her memory by listening to the song ‘Spirit in the Sky’ by Norman Greenbaum.”

It would abandon our 2030 emissions targets, gut our most effective programs, and lock Massachusetts into the very fossil fuel dependence that has driven today’s affordability crisis.","MASSACHUSETTS IS KNOWN as a leader in clean energy and climate action. Our policies have lowered emissions, created jobs, and helped families save money on energy. But a bill currently under consideration in the House of Representatives on Beacon Hill threatens to undo that progress and would be a damaging mistake for our state.  
This bill, proposed by Rep. Mark Cusack, the co-chair of the Legislature’s Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities, and Energy, is essentially a fossil fuel industry wish list. It rolls back the Commonwealth’s enforceable 2030 climate targets, weakens the Mass Save energy efficiency program, eliminates efforts designed to make energy efficiency more affordable for working families, and even resurrects the disastrous “pipeline tax” that would allow utilities to charge residents for unnecessary gas infrastructure. In short, it hands fossil fuel companies a gift while leaving Massachusetts households to foot the bill.  
At a moment when President Trump is dismantling federal climate policy, this bill would do the work for him. It would abandon our 2030 emissions targets, gut our most effective programs, and lock Massachusetts into the very fossil fuel dependence that has driven today’s affordability crisis. It would cede our hard-earned reputation as a clean energy innovator and put our economy, our health, and our climate at risk.  
Our lawmakers must be clear on what’s really driving high energy costs: it’s not clean energy. It’s fossil fuels, gas infrastructure, and aging transmission systems.  
In 2023 alone, Massachusetts consumers spent $20 billion on energy in their homes and businesses. Programs like Mass Save delivered over $34 billion in savings between 2012 and 2023 and generated more than $3 for every $1 invested. The program is the only tool we have that actively reduces energy burden for all of us, including low- and moderate-income households that are hardest hit by rising energy costs. 
Mass Save has weatherized 350,000 homes (including 70,000 low-income homes), created nearly 76,000 jobs, and saved the equivalent output of five power plants. Even if you’ve never used it directly, you’ve benefited from lower wholesale energy prices because your neighbors did. These are real savings in people’s wallets.  
By rolling back these programs and weakening enforceable climate targets, House members would lock the state into an outdated, expensive fossil fuel system. Weakening the 2030 climate target removes enforceable benchmarks that ensure our government takes the action we demand.  
Without those benchmarks, Massachusetts risks falling behind while other states, and the world, invest in the clean energy technologies of the future. Communities that are already most vulnerable to pollution and climate impacts—low-income and environmental justice communities—will feel the consequences first.  
The House also risks undermining the thriving clean energy economy Massachusetts has built.  
Our clean energy sector supports more than 115,000 workers, there are over 7,500 energy businesses statewide, and the clean energy industry has added more than $15.9 billion to the state’s economy since 2012. Clean energy is not just good for our planet; it’s good for our wallets. Weakening climate laws now would send a chilling signal to investors, slow innovation, and damage our long-term economic growth, not to mention dirty the clean air and water we deserve.  
This bill tells the rest of the nation that when federal leadership falters, Massachusetts folds. It tells clean energy workers that their jobs don’t matter. It tells communities on the front lines of climate and pollution that their health is negotiable.  
But that’s not who we are. Massachusetts became a clean energy and climate leader by setting ambitious goals. We still have five years to hit our 2030 targets. Our legislators must reject this fossil fuel gift and recommit to a future built on affordability, innovation, and climate responsibility. A vote for this bill is a vote to cede our leadership to the Trump administration and the fossil fuel lobby. A vote against it is a vote for Massachusetts – to protect our progress, our economy, and our environment.  
The choice is simple: Massachusetts can lead, or we can go back. The people of Massachusetts deserve leadership.

(Photo by Tracy Brooks | courtesy of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service).Lawyers for multiple conservation organizations argued during a hearing in Helena on Friday new Montana regulations around wolves could harm the species long term.
Several new state regulations, including new rules allowing for the killing of up to 558 wolves during the current hunting season, could put the species at risk of “severe population depletion,” they argued.
The conservation groups, WildEarth Guardians, the Earth and Land Institute, Footloose Montana, and the Gallatin Wildlife Association are asking First Judicial District Court Judge Christopher Abbott for a preliminary injunction to stop the 2025-2026 wold hunting regulations from going into effect. 
Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks and the Montana Fish and Wildlife Commission, which sets policy and regulations for the department, are the defendants in the suit, which is attached to a legal battle stretching back to 2022 over state wolf laws. The Outdoor Heritage Coalition and Montana Sportsmen for Fish and Wildlife are intervenors due to a similar lawsuit they brought against the state, but arguing wolf hunting regulations are too lenient.
“We’re here today because the state’s own population projections indicate that Montana’s wolf population will plummet if defendants are permitted to implement their plan,” Jessica Blome, an attorney for the plaintiffs, told the court on Friday.
Those new rules include increased wolf pelt reimbursement maximums and usage of night vision scopes on private land, in addition to an increased hunting quota. In arguments, the state said just one wolf has been killed this year at night. There have been 62 wolves killed so far this hunting season. Attorneys for the conservation groups also argued it’s a violation of the state constitutional right to a clean and healthful environment.
The state is operating on the assumption that 15 breeding pairs and 450 total wolves in Montana is enough for the species to survive. In their verbal arguments on Friday, a state lawyer said there are a little more than 1,000 wolves in Montana. That number is in dispute and lawyers for the conservation groups said only about half that number is confirmed to exist.
“Expert evidence will also show the defendants do not know how many wolves are in the state of Montana,” Susann Bradford, an attorney for the conservation groups said. “They will not know when they achieve the arbitrary number of 450 wolves, and they cannot ensure that the population will stay above this number, or that it is sufficient to sustain the necessary breeding population to ensure genetic health and is sustainable.”
The state’s arguments centered around defending its scientific practices and that the conservation groups can’t prove that 2025-26 wolf hunting regulations will harm the species long term. 
The state — in this case, Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks — also argued they’re being told to bring the wolf population down.
“The reason that the quota was so high this year was due to the fact that we have not recognized a decent reduction in the population in our eyes, that it has remained stable,” said Alex Scolavino, a lawyer for the state. “And we are statutorily mandated to reduce the wolf population.”
An attorney the intervenors, Gary Leistico also spoke in the state’s defense during the hearing. Outdoor Heritage Coalition is wrapped up in a separate lawsuit in Sanders County saying the state hasn’t reduced the wolf population.
Abbott said he would rule on the preliminary injunction soon. The wolf hunting season goes until March 15, and the trapping season begins Dec. 1 in some areas pf the state.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/RSGrayWolf_Tracy_Brooks_Mission_Wolf_USFWS_FPWC_HIGHRES-hpr-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-11-15 13:56:57.395623

It’s not a novel observation to say that supporters of President Donald Trump and supporters of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders find common ground on many issues. They often share a skepticism of entrenched power and a desire to dismantle systems that they think have ceased to serve everyday people.
In Indiana, this agreement includes a distrust of data centers.
“The MAGA crowd and the Bernie bros have both figured out that they’ve been getting duped,” said Kerwin Olson, executive director of Citizens Action Coalition, an Indianapolis-based consumer and environmental advocacy nonprofit. “It was data centers that really brought it all together.”
Olson’s organization is running a campaign to persuade Indiana lawmakers to place a moratorium on new data centers and to redesign electricity rates to protect residential consumers from rate increases related to data center development.
He has received an emphatic response, with groups from the left, right and in-between booking him for speaking engagements and offering their assistance.
Election results last week confirm a similar dynamic in much of the country. Democrats won races for governor in New Jersey and Virginia and for two open seats on the Georgia Public Service Commission, campaigns in which data centers and rising electricity costs were issues. Media outlets noted this pattern, including in an insightful report from Jael Holzman of Heatmap and a look ahead to next year’s elections from Marc Levy and Jesse Bedayn of the Associated Press.
Much of the discussion is about data centers, which are often large developments used to support cloud computing or artificial intelligence. But the underlying issues are broader, touching on the power of tech companies. For people who live near proposed data centers, there is an additional sense of powerlessness, which Inside Climate News has documented across the country, including the backlash to a plan for a huge data center in Bessemer, Alabama.
“It’s about big tech,” Olson said. “To steal Bernie’s words, [it’s about] these big tech oligarchs that are calling all the shots at every single level of government right now.”
I also see some similarities with local opposition to large wind and solar projects, a subject I’ve written a lot about over the years. A common theme is that residents feel frustrated when powerful companies want to make changes that would alter local landscapes.
Olson said he agrees that there is some overlap between opposition to data centers and large renewable energy development, but he views the latter as more of a rural phenomenon, while concern about data centers is rising almost everywhere.
Google scrapped its plans for a large data center in Indianapolis in September amid local backlash. In northwest Indiana, residents in the small city of Hobart have organized to oppose two data centers, raising concerns about the projects’ electricity and water consumption.
It’s notable that the opposition tends to highlight concerns about high electricity bills, but doesn’t talk as much about data centers’ negative climate impacts. Indiana can see the ramifications as officials push to delay the retirement of coal-fired power plants so the state can meet an expected surge in electricity demand, driven, in part, by data centers.
Political candidates can harness this mounting opposition and data center companies will need to devote more resources to engaging with the public.
Vivek Shastry, a senior research associate at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, told me that it’s important for the AI and data center industries to find ways to provide local benefits to host communities and to minimize any negative effects on household electricity costs.
He touched on these subjects in a recent blog post, co-written with his colleague Diana Hernández. When I read this, my first thought was, “Wait, there are local benefits?”
He explained that there are opportunities in terms of energy and money. He pointed to examples in Denmark and Finland of data centers harnessing their waste heat to contribute to district heating systems for local communities.
Beyond that—which I think would be a challenge to do in the United States—he said AI and data center developers can make community benefits part of their proposals. This could mean working with local leaders to find ways to address local needs through philanthropy.
“To the extent that there is a partnership with communities, and there are these pathways to enable tangible co-benefits,” he said.
The opposite can also be true, with local communities feeling like they are bearing the burden of a data center with few, if any, benefits.
Shastry’s larger point is that government officials and corporate leaders need to make sure that development does not harm the most vulnerable consumers by driving up costs of water and electricity. To do otherwise would feed into consumer unrest.
“It’s important to get those processes and protections right early on, because the pace of this growth is such that once you lock into certain kinds of rates and other pathways, it then becomes harder to reverse,” Shastry said.
Voters are already getting upset about electricity rate increases that they blame on data centers, even though the AI industry is in its infancy. The negative effects, if left to fester, could get much worse.
But there also is evidence that state officials have a sense of the challenge before them. The NC Clean Energy Technology Center at North Carolina State University shows this in its most recent quarterly report, the 50 States of Power Decarbonization.
From July to September, state regulators or legislators took 55 actions in 29 states related to laws or rules for large electricity users, which were usually motivated by the growth of data centers.
Some highlights:

The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio approved a proposal from the utility American Electric Power to create a new rate category for data centers that have electricity demand of at least 25 megawatts. Businesses in this category have special requirements, including that they must sign a 12-year contract. The practical effect is that data centers that close or use much less power than planned will still need to pay, which can help to shield other customers from covering the costs of lines and other infrastructure built to serve these large projects.


Florida Power & Light, a utility, entered into a settlement with other parties in a rate case that includes new rate categories for large power users such as data centers. The rates would cover new projects that need at least 50 megawatts, with provisions requiring companies to pay even if they use less power than planned. The Office of Public Counsel has said the settlement is “disproportionately favorable” to corporate interests.


In Delaware, the Public Service Commission staff and the Division of the Public Advocate jointly requested that the utility, Delmarva Power and Light, institute a new rate category for customers that need at least 25 megawatts. Delmarva responded by saying it would like the commission to hold a hearing on the subject.

As recently as two years ago, there was almost no activity in this policy area. Next year at this time, I expect to see action in nearly every state.

One key difference is that the drop-off from the peak would be more gradual than the agency had previously indicated. The peak and ensuing decline in fossil fuels would be driven by the rapid growth of carbon-free electricity sources such as wind and solar.
How the Trump Administration Is Seeking to Gut the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations: The Trump administration is proposing a $0 budget for the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, underscoring how far the office has fallen since it was a key part of planning for the country’s energy future, as Maria Gallucci reports for Canary Media. The office, which is part of the Department of Energy, was created by Congress in 2021 and received $27 billion to fund projects to scale up clean energy technologies. The sudden shift in funding priorities is ceding leadership to other countries, especially China, and is baffling to people who were connected to the office.
Sunrun Reports a Quadrupling of Participation in Virtual Power Plants: Sunrun, the rooftop solar and battery company, said 106,000 of its customers are now participating in home-to-grid virtual power plant programs, which is an increase of more than 400 percent from a year ago, as Brian Martucci reports for Utility Dive. Sunrun also said its business model, which encourages solar leasing and monthly subscription fees, positions the company to maintain growth even after an expected sales cliff in the rooftop solar industry when federal tax credits expire at the end of the year.
Green Steelmaking Advocates Look for Paths Forward Without U.S. Government Support: The Trump administration’s policies are reducing support for green steelmaking, leading companies and advocates to figure out how to maintain momentum in the short run, as my colleague Kiley Bense reports. The Ohio River Valley Institute, a nonprofit that promotes economic growth and clean energy in Appalachia, issued a report summarizing the effects of federal actions, such as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act’s phaseout of a tax credit for clean hydrogen in 2027 rather than the previous 2032. Despite the setbacks, companies are still moving forward with plans to use hydrogen to produce steel, including a plant in Louisiana being built by Hyundai.

(Photo by Christiana Botic/Verite News and Catchlight Local/Report for America)NEW ORLEANS — A decade of court oversight of special education services in New Orleans public schools, the result of a legal settlement, will most likely cease by the end of the year, the judge presiding over the legal settlement said Wednesday.
The decision, if it comes to pass, would come at the request of the Louisiana Department of Education and the Orleans Parish School Board, which have been subjected to intensive monitoring under a consent decree since 2015. The agreement settled a 2010 class-action lawsuit that alleged the city’s charter schools discriminated against special education students in their application processes and did not provide them appropriate educational services, as federal law requires.
The case was brought by the Southern Poverty Law Center on behalf of parents and guardians of special-needs students in New Orleans schools. Though problems with special education continue to be identified at some New Orleans charter schools, the consent decree was intended to address systemic issues — whether the state and district are catching those issues and implementing plans to correct them — not individual students’ experiences, said U.S. District Judge Jay Zainey.

For the past eight years, an independent monitor assigned by the court has found the defendants — the Department of Education and OPSB — in substantial compliance with all provisions outlined in consent decree. Citing those findings, the state and school board earlier this year formally requested an end to the agreement.
The plaintiffs oppose terminating the settlement, arguing that the state and NOLA Public Schools district have not created sufficient monitoring, oversight or complaint systems. Their opposition hinges on a 2024 report from the Louisiana Legislative Auditor that found faults in the state’s monitoring of special education programs — most districts self-reported their compliance with federal rules dictating education plans, without on-site monitoring. (However, some of those problems resulted from the fact that much of the state’s monitoring capacity has been directed toward New Orleans schools, possibly as a result of the consent decree, according to the audit report.) The audit also noted that the agency reduced the number of workers dedicated to special education between 2012 and 2019.
Lauren Winkler, lead attorney for the plaintiffs, said her team has asked the district to make it easier for parents to bring issues about schools forward to the central office through creating an open complaint system on their website. That was never implemented.
“[There are] really simple solutions that are not super costly,” Winkler said. “We tried to meet with them to agree to some and they just wouldn’t.”
Winkler said noncompliance still exists in the schools. More than people contacted the Southern Poverty Law Center about their negative experiences with New Orleans schools’ special education programs ahead of this week’s hearing.
“If we didn’t have any parents coming forward with issues, we’d maybe have a different position,” Winkler said. “With the breadth of issues in the amount of people that came to us, as we’ve been preparing for this, I think that’s indicative of the systemic issues that are still here.”
But in a court filing last week, Zainey wrote that the court anticipates ending federal oversight by the end of the year.
“The consent judgement was a temporary measure and was never meant to be a permanent fixture of the school system,” Zainey said in court. “Things have been much improved from how they used to be in Orleans Parish.”
Zainey invited parents to share their experiences with the court and representatives from the Louisiana Department of Education and Orleans Parish School Board during informal hearings on Nov. 12 and 13. Most parents asked the court to continue the federal monitoring of New Orleans schools, but it’s unclear whether their statements will change Zainey’s plans. Zainey encouraged the state’s ombudsman, who connects families with resources and informs them of their rights in relation to special education, to connect with parents following their statements.
But most of the parents speaking at the informal hearing were those who had already tried, and were still trying, to seek recourse through communication with district or state officials.
Grace Thompson spoke in front of the judge Wednesday morning about her son’s experience at Audubon Gentilly. According to Thompson, her son was supposed to receive speech therapy and a one-on-one aide to help in class, but never received them. Thompson said she’s tried to seek help through the district’s accountability office, which, she said, has offered little guidance and has been “slow” and “inconsistent” in its communications.
“I’ve literally been calling them for the last year and a half,” Thompson told the judge. “They know who I am.”
Steve Corbett, CEO of Audubon Schools, said Audubon Gentilly has provided students with all necessary services and has been found fully compliant with federal special education law. The most recent state special education monitoring report found “no unresolved areas of noncompliance” at the school.
Other parents also spoke of slow communication with the district and the schools their children attend. They said their children weren’t receiving the services outlined in their individualized education plans, that their learning has regressed, that schools were slow in performing evaluations and reevaluations, and that oversight was only afforded to children with parents that could be there to actively fight for them.
District Superintendent Fateama Fulmore and state representatives were present at the hearing. In response to hearing parent concerns, Fulmore said she appreciated the opportunity to hear from them directly and that her team will follow up.
“We have an obligation to every child in this system to get this right,” Fulmore said. “We are doing better.”
Lyric Lee, a former student at Morris Jeff Community School who had an Individualized Education Program and graduated last year, said she learned at a young age how to advocate for herself, her brother and other students who have special needs. She said the consent decree should continue.
“I’ve learned when people are not kept on a watch, they feel like they don’t have to do it, and they’ll do everything possible to make sure they don’t have to,” Lee said.

The Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries reported the arrests Nov. 10 following its enforcement efforts with U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the U.S. Coast Guard. The agencies conducted their operation Nov. 3-4. 
Wildlife and Fisheries personnel boarded oyster vessels to check oyster fishing regulation compliance, and Coast Guard and Border Protection agents reviewed crew members’ immigration status, according to an LDWF news release. 
No additional information about the immigration arrests was provided.
LDWF agents issued three citations to fishermen who did not possess seed ground gear permits and two citations for failing to report oyster harvest data. Agents seized 27 sacks of oysters and returned them to the oyster seed ground.
Oyster harvesting violations can result in a fine reaching $350 fine for each offense.

But it's also a day to think about solutions to this deadly problem.","A memorial bike for Sarah Langenkamp. (Photo by Luke Lukert/WTOP)I’ll never forget the elegant solution my wife, Sarah, came up with the day she died. She needed to get to the open house at our kids’ new elementary school while I went out of town, but our car was being shipped from abroad.  “I’ll just ride my bike,” she said.
That was not a surprising solution for Sarah, whose fitness came not just from a love of yoga and salads, but from prioritizing movement — almost any movement — in her daily life. She took the stairs, she walked a lot, and on this day, rode her bike to our kids’ school.
She was killed because of it. Literally run over by the negligent driver of a 40,000-pound truck.
I later learned that more cyclists died on U.S. roads that year, 2022, than any in U.S. history. The number in 2022, at 1,086, has only been exceeded by the number that died in 2023: 1,166.
But it isn’t just cyclists who are dying. More than 7,300 people died walking on roads in America in 2023, close to a 40-year high. Some 40,000 people die every year in vehicle crashes overall. That’s more than 100 people per day, as many as a commercial airliner, making vehicle crashes a top form of preventable death in America.

Last week, the Montgomery County Council passed a new law outlawing parking and driving in bike lanes. I thought about Sarah’s final ride when I read the flood of vitriol online responding to the news: “Another useless law … All of the biker lanes need to be removed … bicycles have no business being on the road … ”
Wow.
This Sunday is World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims. It’s a day to remember people like Sarah, and a day to think about solutions to this deadly problem.
Until my retirement and before Sarah died, she and I were U.S. diplomats — State Department foreign service officers — who had lived around the world. One thing I learned living abroad is that countries that are more pleasant and safer all do a good job of making it easy to walk, ride a bike, and get around in things other than cars.
Just before her death, Sarah and I spent six months in a city in a Polish city named Rzeszow (pronounced like JESH-ohv). It was a relatively mundane town by Polish standards, but it was wonderful to us Americans, boasting a lovely town plaza, a long walking street surrounded by cafes, restaurants and stores, and clean, punctual buses and trains that could whisk you almost anywhere in Europe.
Not only was this city pleasant, it was safe. And for most of the developed world outside the United States, it is normal.
Contrast this with the vast majority of American cities today, where you are between three and four times more likely to get killed walking on a road. Here in Bethesda, there is no way for my kids to ride their bikes to school without riding on a state highway. The walking street (Bethesda Row) is a single block long. And redesigning streets can set off battles that threaten political careers.
It makes sense that people care about their roads and infrastructure. But my view is that our debate shouldn’t be about bike lanes. It should be about the type of community we want to live in.
Do we want our kids to be able to roam freely in our neighborhoods? Do we want to be able to walk to the market and church on weekends? Or do we want to be entirely dependent on our cars to go everywhere?
Americans are making their choices, and the results are visible in our dangerous and congested roads, our less healthy lifestyles, our degraded environment, and our less pleasant cities.
Sarah made the right choice the day she died. I hope one day our community will catch up to her.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/LANGENKAMP-1-1024x683-1.jpg,,,2025-11-15 09:56:27.938323

(Photo: Howard Hughes Holdings)Half of the $1.8 billion in private capital investment promised in the film tax credit bill may occur not at the proposed 31-acre film studio site itself but instead at Downtown Summerlin, drawing criticisms that the bill is as much a giveaway to a real estate corporation as it is a “Hollywood handout.”
The inclusion of the existing retail and office space area known as Downtown Summerlin was highlighted Friday during an Assembly Committee on Jobs meeting as lawmakers continued to debate what could be the State of Nevada’s largest ever public subsidy — $1.65 billion in transferable tax credits over 15 years to film productions. Lawmakers are currently considering the proposal, Assembly Bill 5, in a special legislative session that began Thursday.
AB5 advanced out of the Assembly committee on a 9-5 vote with a lengthy amendment, but the bill was not considered by the full chamber.
Assemblymember Gregory Koenig — a rural Republican who noted he’d only been to Summerlin “twice in his life” — asked why developments in Downtown Summerlin counted toward the capital investment requirements in the bill.
“Doing a little bit of research, there was a vast difference between the corner of Town Center (Drive) and Flamingo” Road, where the planned studio and special entertainment district would be, “and Downtown Summerlin,” the border of which is two miles down Town Center and separated from the studio site by residential neighborhoods, said Koenig.
Matt Walker with Howard Hughes Holdings said the studio is expected to bring in more business than will fit within the studio site.
“We have the ability within the entertainment district to develop the studios and the associated infrastructure. That’s about 31 acres.”
Additional acreage will include hotels, and office space for businesses “with a nexus to the studios.”
“We need to prove to the GOED board, through the proactive approval, that there is a concrete nexus between that development at Downtown Summerlin and the studios,” he added. “It’s not as if we just build a new office building and call it connected.”
AB5 has faced fierce opposition from the first hour of the special session. A surprise vote taken by the full Assembly in the early hours of the special session suggested the chamber was nearly split in support and opposition.
Opponents characterize it as a corporate giveaway to the developer Howard Hughes Holdings, the mega studios Sony Entertainment and Warner Brothers Discovery who would earn up to $120 million in transferable tax credits for shooting in state, and other large companies who would purchase the transferable tax credits and apply them to their own gaming, insurance or modified business taxes.
The lengthy amendment adopted by the Assembly committee was clearly designed to address some of the concerns raised by opponents to the bill. It included banning gaming establishments within the project, diverting the majority of the room tax generated in the studio entertainment district into an account to fund certain medical expenses for retired state employees on the Public Employees’ Benefits Program, and expanding disclosure requirements.
Also amended were requirements around diversity. Production companies will be required to submit with its application “a workforce plan” with specific goals.
Assemblymember Selena Torres Fossett, who voted against the bill in committee, characterized it as a “watering down” of diversity goals. The earlier version of the bill had diversity targets for specific professions, which the Democrat from Las Vegas said was designed to insure that diversity in hiring wasn’t limited to the lowest paying jobs associated with any film production.
Walker from Howard Hughes said the amendment aligned the bill’s diversity requirements with previous economic development programs in the state and said the amendment represented a “compromise.”
Some other notable bills
Assembly Bill 4, Gov. Joe Lombardo’s wide-ranging crime bill advanced out of an Assembly committee Friday after lawmakers adopted several minor amendments. Like the film studio bill, it can now be considered by the full Assembly.
Senate Bill 3 establishes the Silver State General Assistance Program and authorizes the state to use general funds to provide temporary support for vulnerable residents when federal funding falters. Similar programs in other states allowed them to respond more quickly to the withholding of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits by the Trump administration. SB3 passed the Senate unanimously Thursday.
Assembly Bill 1 establishes a statewide Security Operations Center to better handle cybersecurity issues, like the massive hack that brought many state services to a grinding halt in late August. The bill passed an Assembly committee Friday.
Assembly Bill 2 would exempt major gaming companies from newly established payment rules related to purchasing alcohol from wholesale liquor dealers.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Reform for something as delicately interconnected as the state’s tax system should probably be handled with a scalpel. For the second year in a row, lawmakers have instead chosen to use a scattergun.
That scattershot approach was evident at the most recent meeting of the Legislature’s Comprehensive Property Tax Task Force. At that meeting, the task force approved 19 property tax reform proposals that will be forwarded to the Legislature. Those proposals were pared down from more than two dozen. Some of the proposals that didn’t earn task force approval will likely be offered as legislation as well.
In the Legislature, it seems that ideas about how to cut property taxes are like eyebrows, everybody has one or two.
Lower spending, higher sales tax, revenue shifts: A closer look at 19 ways to reduce property taxes

It looks for all the world like lawmakers are throwing property tax reforms against the wall, hoping that one sticks. That’s a trick they learned with mixed results in this year’s session when 30 property tax bills were introduced. The only one left stuck to the wall was from Gov. Larry Rhoden. His legislation was full of enough limits, caps, exemptions and expansions to make Rube Goldberg dizzy.
At the start of the summer, the task force members had high hopes. They said they wanted to find a way to cut property taxes for homeowners by 50%. They have been hearing an ever-increasing clamor from homeowners whose total property tax payments increased by 38.8% between 2020 and 2024.
Anyone hoping that a summer’s worth of work would lead the task force to come up with a single, simple solution to property tax reform has to be disappointed. Some of the solutions considered by the task force included: school tax limits, online relief applications, formula adjustments, a new education fund, capital outlay limits, tax relief for veterans, municipal rebates, tax increment financing restrictions, school levy elections, capital outlay elections, cutting general fund spending, an owner-occupied relief fund and a $500 property tax credit.
Even the simplest of property tax reform solutions face an uphill fight in the Legislature. One simple solution was considered and rejected by the Legislature in February. If approved, House Bill 1019 would have raised the state sales tax from 4.2% to 5%.
According to Tim Goodwin, a Rapid City Republican and one of the bill’s sponsors, the excess money generated by the sales tax increase would total $280 million. Those funds would be used to pay $417 of property tax relief per each $100,000 of valuation on owner-occupied dwellings in the state.
The bill was rejected by the House State Affairs Committee on a vote of 9-2. Its rejection offers an insight into what lawmakers in the next session will be up against with their own reform proposals.
Rep. Greg Jamison, a Sioux Falls Republican, kicked off committee discussion of the bill with praise for the $417 payment per $100,000 of valuation: “That’s a healthy reduction in their property taxes. It’s probably what people want.”
Moments later, Jamison would vote against the bill.
Despite his characterization of the bill as offering taxpayers exactly what they want, Jamison reasoned that it didn’t mesh with the mood of the Legislature. His colleagues, he said, would rather cut spending than raise a tax to generate new revenue.

If legislation that gives aggrieved taxpayers exactly what they want can’t make it out of committee, it’s hard to believe that other property tax reforms are likely to succeed. With so many proposals to consider, lawmakers who want to create true reform may be forced to vote for measures that go against the grain of what they believe.
The hard decisions they face will be a test of their political courage. They may have to put aside their dismay about raising taxes so that the revenue from one tax can be used to lower another. They may need to look past their belief in local control to put new restrictions on how and when school districts and county governments can raise taxes.  No matter how much pride they take in their role running state government, they may have to take a meat cleaver to the budget with the savings earmarked for property tax relief.
The endorsement by the task force of 19 property tax reform proposals points to the complexity of the problem and a lack of clarity on how to tackle it. It doesn’t take much of a crystal ball to know that the next legislative session will see a cluster of property tax reform bills. Here’s hoping that with so many ideas on the table, lawmakers can find one that offers true, lasting property tax reform.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/591A0214e-1024x677.jpg,,,2025-11-15 07:56:34.801212

It’s still not back online yet, and the senators who worked to pass the law are furious.
The Not One More Report was the product of The Not Invisible Act of 2020, which intends to provide tribes with solutions to combat the epidemic of missing and murdered Indigenous people and educate the general public about the crisis. The act was signed into law by President Donald Trump in his first term.
Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, a moderate Democrat from Nevada who sits on the Senate Indian Affairs Committee and introduced that act, said she was “outraged” to see the report had vanished from the federal forum.
“It is astounding that an administration that actually signed these bills into law, that wants to address the issue of keeping our communities safe from violent criminals, including our tribal communities, thinks that this isn’t an important issue,” Cortez Masto told NOTUS during an interview in her Capitol Hill office.
The report was taken down amid a purge of material from federal websites that the Trump administration deemed DEI-related. Both Cortez Masto and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a Republican senator from Alaska who chairs the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, told NOTUS that they reached out to the administration to inquire about restoring the Not One More Report.
Murkowski said that she wants the report restored “so that the information is out there.”
“If we don’t know what we don’t know, it’s pretty tough to say it’s a problem,” she said.
A commission including tribal leaders, human trafficking survivors, relatives of victims, and federal partners compiled the report from over 250 testimonies from tribal members about how the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous people has affected their lives. It also gave recommendations on how to alleviate the crisis — like having the U.S. Marshals Service help tribal law enforcement address the MMIP crisis, the premise of legislation that Cortez Masto recently introduced alongside Republican Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma.
On Feb. 3, over a dozen tribal leadership and advocacy organizations sent a letter to the administration and several high-ranking lawmakers who work on tribal affairs, urging them to preserve tribal members’ “legal status as a political class rather than a suspect racial class,” and exempt tribal nations from DEI-related crack downs. Less than a week later, Cortez Masto’s office noticed the Not One More Report was no longer available on the DOJ’s website.
“It’s an epidemic of violence against Native women, Native people,” Senate Indian Affairs Committee member Tina Smith told NOTUS. “If you want to solve a problem, you first have to see it and understand it, and that’s what that work was all about.”
Cortez Masto said that she and Murkowski sent a letter to the administration asking why the report was taken down. The White House responded it was taken down in compliance with the executive order, which Cortez Masto’s office specified was the “Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government” order issued on Jan. 20. Cortez Masto said she’s received no other information from the administration or an explanation on why it sees this report as a DEI issue.
The White House did not answer NOTUS’ question about whether or not it believes issues regarding missing and murdered Native Americans qualify as “DEI” issues and directed NOTUS to the DOJ. A DOJ spokesperson told NOTUS in a statement that the “report was removed to ensure compliance with OPM guidance regarding President Trump’s Executive Order Defending Women. The Commission’s report is still available on numerous external websites.”
The spokesperson added that the “joint DOJ/DOI response continues to be posted on the DOJ’s Tribal Justice and Safety website,” and included this link to a page of “archived content” that does not include the report itself. The DOJ did not answer NOTUS’ questions about whether it intends to restore the report.
The Wayback Machine shows a PDF of the report was last available on Feb. 8. A “Page not found” message appears in its place on Feb. 9. An error message was still present on that page as of Nov. 13.
When NOTUS asked Cortez Masto why she thinks the administration has kept the report off the DOJ’s website, she said: “They think they’re a race. They are ignorant to the fact of the trust and treaty obligation that we have to our tribal communities.”
“They don’t really care about addressing the violent crime in our tribal communities and Indigenous communities, and that has been very clear to me based on their reaction to the bipartisan letter from both [Murkowski] and I, to the comments that I get in the hearings when [nominees are] before me,” she continued.
Smith also described the administration’s re-classification of Native American nations from sovereign states to groups subjected to DEI.
“The Trump administration continually, and seems to me, purposefully, misunderstands the difference between Native people and tribal nations and other important and big groups in this country,” Smith said. “Tribal nations are not just another constituency. They’re sovereign nations, sovereign people, and it’s just so offensive to see that the administration isn’t interested in understanding what’s causing this epidemic of violence and what we should do about it.”
Cortez Masto said she wanted to “make it very clear to this administration” that this is not a DEI issue, and that the recommendations in the report will still continue to inspire more of her legislation.
“They can try to keep it off of the website, but the report’s there. The recommendations are there. The commission, I’m assuming, is still happening, and we’re still going to move forward to address it,” she said.

Eric Fass was just one year into his role as the town’s volunteer fire chief. He and wife Amanda also had been growing a small farm they bought eight years earlier. Their three kids, like many rural youths around this city of about 2,000, were showing 4-H livestock at the fair.

But a noise spooked the leashed heifer Jaden Fass was walking with alongside her dad and others. And in a chase to regain control of the runaway animal, Eric Fass was flipped on his head. Resuscitated on the spot in an alleyway, he was rushed to a hospital with traumatic brain injury.
Doctors advised Amanda to summon family and friends — that nothing short of a miracle would pull her first responder and farmer husband, then age 37, through the night.
Four years later, the Nebraska Examiner met with the couple determined to keep pushing through. Eric is trying to regain further mobility on his left side, depends on a wheelchair and breathes through a trach tube. 
Throughout it all, the Nebraska natives have refused to give up on their shared passion to farm. But a fund that helped keep their dream alive is on uncertain ground after next year.
Nebraska AgrAbility, a 30-year-old initiative that helps farmers and ranchers with disabilities stay active in the state’s top industry, was key to opening doors to modified equipment and other support that allowed Fass to get out in the field again to do certain chores.

Led by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln extension and Easterseals Nebraska, a primary AgrAbility funding source is the U.S. Department of Agriculture. States compete for four-year grants from the USDA, and the federal government awards for current participants expire next summer.
A new slate of awardees has yet to be selected.
“It helped us get the things we needed to stay on the farm and keep doing what we love to do,” Amanda said of the program. “And to give Eric a purpose.” 
A bale buggy, five cows and a big dream
Emily Jacobson, an Easterseals rural rehab specialist and program manager for Nebraska AgrAbility, said she realized quickly upon talking to the Fasses after the July 24, 2021, injury that their goal was to keep farming. 
The couple had launched their operation in 2013 with 20 acres, a blue tractor, a bale buggy, five mama cows and, as Amanda put it, “a big dream.” Today, in partnership with other families, they own or rent a couple of hundred acres and raise a small herd that fuels a direct-to-consumer beef business.

Before the accident, Eric also had other side gigs such as underground trenching, seed cleaning and custom hay businesses. Amanda worked for the Natural Resources Conservation Service.
“It was obviously going to look different with Eric’s injuries,” said Jacobson, herself a farm-raised Nebraskan. “But they wanted to create a legacy they could pass on down to their kids.”
AgrAbility does not directly buy equipment, but a free comprehensive needs assessment by Jacobson connected the Fasses to partner agencies and resources that largely paid for such tools as a side-by-side all-terrain vehicle tailored to Eric’s needs, a pickup truck with a wheelchair lift and a specialized skid loader with options to control by hand. 
For the Fasses, the Syracuse community raised additional funds that covered costs for a motorized chair that can maneuver over tough spots and for various medical and home adaptation needs.

“There was this huge momentum for Eric to begin to realize the possibilities,” Jacobson said. “I always tell people, ‘We’re gonna modify your practices, not your dreams.’”
While Jacobson says she provides in-depth assessment and connector services to 25 to 30 Nebraska farm and ranch families challenged by health and injury setbacks each year, the program reaches several thousand a year through education-related outreach.
AgrAbility salary and operational expenses are funded by the four-year $735,000 grant from the USDA, which provides similar support to about 20 other states that also must enlist a university and a nonprofit partner to oversee the local program. Local officials are gearing up to apply for the next round of funding, and are optimistic.
The Nebraska Legislature directed a total of $600,000 to the State Department of Agriculture for this year and next to help cover costs of assistive technology for eligible farmers served by AgrAbility. The farmer is expected to contribute to the equipment expense.
However, the state is facing a $451 million projected deficit in the two-year budget cycle, and the state Ag Department, in its mid-biennium budget request submitted last month, included a $300,000 cut for the program, saying the proposed reduction was not a reflection of the program but that department officials believe it could be funded by an alternative source.











Agriculture, it’s in our blood. ... We gotta keep hanging on. 


– Amanda Fass



State Sen. Dave Murman of Glenvil, himself a farmer who has championed AgrAbility in the Legislature, said he would do whatever possible to ensure state funding continues. 
“I know how important it is to the mental health of a farmer to continue doing what they like to do and still be productive,” he said. Murman said he wants Nebraska farmers to keep operating on their land whenever possible.

The state-federal Nebraska Vocational Rehabilitation program also provides equipment and other support to AgrAbility clients, Jacobson said.
AgrAbility participants range from ranchers suffering from arthritis to amputation or paralysis. Jacobson described Eric Fass as one of the more severe cases.
She gets choked up talking about what the family has gone through, including difficulty and expense of finding rural in-home health care workers. 
At one point, an urgent call went out to friends to locate a “sit to stand lift” to replace a broken one used to get Eric to the toilet. Even with specialized farm tools and equipment donated by AgrAbility partners and other resources, extra help and time is necessary, for example, to transfer Eric from wheelchair to farm vehicles.
“It’s put a load on Amanda’s shoulders,” Jacobson said. “Their story is quite amazing, to watch how they’ve overcome challenges and how they continue to work together.”
Work takes more time, planning
On a recent day, Amanda hoisted Eric up from his wheelchair into the driver’s seat of the modified side-by-side utility vehicle. She hopped in, and with Eric’s good arm steering, the two drove off to feed cattle.

“We do things a lot differently,” Amanda said. “Everything takes, I would say, three times longer … we have to be more careful, strategize and be really organized.”
After the accident, the Fasses downsized before starting to grow their operation again with local firefighter and friend Schuylar Argo as a partner. He lives in a camper trailer on the Fass land. 
Part of Fass Farms is the rebranded Down Home Beef business, which uses a local meat locker to process meat that’s marketed directly to consumers interested in knowing how the animal was raised. Amanda says the operation manages roughly 60 cow-calf pairs. They also source from other producers and recently bought A&E Feeds LLC. 
The Fasses have seen progress in the four years since doctors put part of Eric’s skull in his abdomen to preserve it while brain swelling went down. For example, Eric sometimes can walk short distances with a walker. Challenges continue.
“Everything we’re still doing requires someone’s assistance,” said Amanda. The left side immobility keeps Eric from running large equipment. He tires easily. Speech is created through a vibration device he holds to his neck to produce mechanical-sounding words. Amanda typically helps with conversations.
Amanda said she has at times been physical therapist, occupational therapist, speech therapist and more to help her husband. 
Medicaid-related battles to access skilled nursing care had her in tears, she said, before an Easterseals representative came to the rescue.
Ultimately, Amanda resigned from her 20-year conservation career job due to difficulty of finding reliable in-home health care aides, she said.
Agriculture ‘in our blood’
Despite frustration, the Fasses haven’t thrown in the towel on a profession both grew up around.

“Agriculture, it’s in our blood,” Amanda said.
The couple credited programs such as AgrAbility, Easterseals and community support for offering help and hope. Jaden now is in college, sons Abe and Braxton are ages 14 and 12. More recently, a Medicaid waiver program has stabilized in-home caregiving services.
From a medical standpoint, Amanda said, the farther Eric gets from the traumatic brain injury, the less likely he is expected to improve. But the family has overcome odds so far, she noted, and “we just keep working at it.”
Amanda said the Fasses view their operation as “helping to feed the world one family at a time.”
“We gotta keep hanging on,” she said.

Meyer and others reached agreements with the county Monday for its role in the raids. (Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA, Kan. — The county involved in a small-town Kansas newspaper raid in 2023 will pay a cumulative $3 million to three journalists and a city councilor.
In two of the four agreements, the Marion County Sheriff’s Office also crafted a statement admitting regret.
“The Sheriff’s Office wishes to express its sincere regrets to Eric and Joan Meyer and Ruth and Ronald Herbel for its participation in the drafting and execution of the Marion Police Department’s search warrants on their homes and the Marion County Record. This likely would not have happened if established law had been reviewed and applied prior to the execution of the warrants,” the statement reads.
Marion County’s board of commissioners approved agreements Monday with Eric Meyer, the owner and editor of the Marion County Record, and Ruth Herbel, the Marion city councilor whose home was raided in tandem with the newspaper office, and two other journalists. The agreements coincide with consent judgments expected to be submitted in their federal cases against the county.
The county was a secondary player in the raids, in Meyer’s eyes, but the agreements could play a part in the paper’s ongoing cases against the city.
“Everybody involved in this is 100% convinced we are going to go to trial with the city,” Meyer said. “This will make that easier in some regard.”
The county’s agreements with Deb Gruver and Phyllis Zorn, local journalists whose lives were upended by the raids, are more akin to settlements and don’t include admissions of regret.
The county agreed to pay Meyer $1.5 million, Herbel $650,000, Zorn $600,000, and Gruver $250,000, according to copies of the agreements obtained by Kansas Reflector.
Insurance covers most of those funds, but the county must pay Meyer $50,000.
In another lawsuit against former Marion police chief Gideon Cody, who is also facing criminal charges, Gruver settled last year for $235,000.
According to Meyer, Zorn has retired from her position at the Marion County Record, effective immediately.
Monday’s deals settle the county’s obligations within four federal lawsuits against the city of Marion and Marion County governments and officials in the wake of the raids. Five cases were consolidated into a single federal lawsuit, and the four agreements give the county and the sheriff’s office immunity from any future legal action related to the Aug. 11, 2023, searches and seizures at the Marion County Record, Meyer’s home and Herbel’s home.
The county agreed to make available Marion County Sheriff Jeff Soyez, Detective Aaron Christner, and Undersheriff Larry Starkey for official interviews, which could be used in other legal disputes. Previously, the cases were stalled, preventing interviews from taking place.
Claims against the city of Marion, its police department and other officials, including former Mayor David Mayfield and former police chief Gideon Cody, are not involved in the agreements.
Correction: This story has been updated to reflect the total sum of Phyllis Zorn’s and Deb Gruver’s settlements and Zorn’s position at the Marion County Record.

(Maya Smith for Kansas Reflector)Something deadly is happening all over the world, as well as Kansas. That something deadly is domestic violence.
Too often, women are abused emotionally or physically or both by their partners. Sometimes, women are the abusers. Whatever the case, domestic violence is horrible and it should stop.
My wonderful and beautiful grandma in Kingfisher, Oklahoma, endured domestic violence. She was married to my wonderful grandpa, my father’s father, until he passed away due to a heart attack. Then she married a farmer in Kingfisher and the hell began.
He hurt her over and over. At one point, we went shopping for a wig for her because he ripped out almost all of her hair. I really didn’t understand what was happening in that house on the farm. Finally, she moved into town in a small home someone provided for her. She was safe. I was thankful she was safe.
Abuse is wrong. There are too many men who are into their power and they exert it on their partners who are only trying to live their life. The counselors at the YWCA truly help these many women and they offer hope and healing for women in battered situations.
No one deserves domestic violence. No one deserves to be hit or demeaned or belittled. No one deserves that.
It’s also a spiritual issue. Domestic violence is also spiritual abuse. A woman may never see her relationship with God in a positive way after having been beaten or mistreated.
Our nation is at a crisis point. People are just plain cruel. They are mean spirited, and they are abusive. They run people off the road in their big monster trucks, and they scream at people in the drive through. Tempers are high, and anger is evident. People are stressed out. Too many people are taking that anger out on their partners.
The economy is terrible. Maybe someone lost his job and he comes home and takes out his anger on his wife and children. The pain is so real. It makes me furious and sad.
I have a friend who used to be in an abusive relationship. She is so kind and loves people. When I think of her being mistreated, it angers me. To get out of abusive relationships is very difficult. Too many times, the abusive partner is also financially abusive, and if the wife leaves, she loses her income. This is very challenging.
How can we reach out and help these abused partners? I feel like we can listen and offer a place to stay if that is safe. We can donate to the YWCA and other nonprofit organizations that help women in need. We can pray. We can be a friend. We can offer a listening ear.
Domestic violence is a stain on the moral fabric of America. This anger that is blazing through our cities must stop. Women are not sex objects or punching bags. The time is now to reach out and help these abused partners. Let’s start the healing.

Jim Pillen held a press conference to announce that he would opt Nebraska into the newly created federal school-choice tax credit program.

Lou Ann Linehan of the Elkhorn area participate in a debate on Nebraska education policy, including school choice, at the 50th annual Nebraska Ecumenical Legislative Briefing Day at Christ United Methodist Church in Lincoln. Feb. 8, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)In late September, Gov. Jim Pillen held a press conference to announce that he would opt Nebraska into the newly created federal school-choice tax credit program.
He could have used that moment to rally Nebraskans around a shared belief that every student in our state deserves support, no matter where they receive their education. Instead, he chose to push a polarizing narrative and double down on his attacks on Nebraska voters.
While the new federal program is similar to the state tax credit scheme repealed by voters in 2024, there is one crucial difference: unlike Nebraska’s now-defunct program, which was built to exclusively subsidize private-school tuition, the federal program allows approved organizations to support all students — including those attending public schools.
If that surprises you, you can thank the governor. He staged his press conference at a private school, deliberately framed the program as a private-school benefit and ignored the broader opportunities available to Nebraska students.
Worse yet, in his executive order he claimed he was opting Nebraska into the program because the Nebraska State Education Association had “stolen these opportunities for students” by supporting the repeal of Legislative Bill 1402 — an accusation that not only distorts the truth but also dismisses the clear mandate delivered by Nebraska voters.
Nebraskans will support keeping federal tax dollars in Nebraska

When asked how he could justify the move less than a year after voters rejected school-choice measures, Pillen insisted Nebraskans “totally agree” with such policies and even claimed some counties voted “unanimously” to keep LB 1402.
But more than 80 of Nebraska’s 93 counties voted to repeal the law, and even in the handful that supported it, fewer than 60 percent of voters backed keeping the voucher program. Rather than acknowledge the clear message his constituents sent and level with the public about what this federal program actually does, Pillen has instead chosen to advance a political narrative that serves his agenda, not our students.
The reality is that 57 percent of Nebraska voters chose to repeal LB 1402 – marking the fourth time Nebraskans have rejected efforts to divert public resources to private schools. Most Nebraskans understand that public resources should stay with our public schools so they can continue serving as the strong community pillars they are.
That’s why, when the “Big, Beautiful Bill” was debated in the U.S. Senate this summer, Nebraska U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer was one of three Republicans who voted for a bipartisan amendment removing this federal tax credit program from the legislation.
Now that Pillen has proudly “cannonballed” this federal tax credit program into Nebraska, the genie is out of the bottle. Our priority must be ensuring the program is used in a way that benefits all Nebraska students.
Under federal law, approved organizations can receive donations for expenses such as tutoring, technology and extended-day programs – costs that impact families regardless of where their children attend school.
Just imagine the good that could be done if the private foundations that support local public schools could apply to become approved organizations and donors could receive a full dollar-for-dollar federal tax credit for supporting students in their own communities.
Unfortunately, while states may approve organizations that serve public schools, nothing requires them to do so. That means Nebraskans will have to again raise their voices and urge the governor to approve organizations that support the overwhelming majority of our students – those attending public schools.
Our focus moving forward is to work with lawmakers to ensure Nebraska has approved organizations that serve all students, regardless of how they receive their education.
The governor had an opportunity to unite Nebraskans behind that shared goal. Instead, he used the moment to defy a clear message from voters and sow confusion about how this federal program can truly be used.
Every day, hundreds of thousands of students walk through the doors of our public schools to learn and grow. Here at NSEA, we will continue doing everything we can to ensure their needs remain at the center of decision-making in Nebraska.

Wes Moore wanted to hear from Maryland residents about the state's congressional district maps. At a Friday night virtual meeting of the Governor's Redistricting Advisory Commission, many opposed the idea.","Members of the Governor's Redistricting Advisory Committee took public testimony for the first time Friday night. A majority of speakers opposed redrawing the state's three-year old congressional maps. (screenshot)Gov. Wes Moore wanted to hear from Maryland residents about the state’s congressional district maps. At the first public comment session of the Governor’s Redistricting Advisory Commission on Friday night, many opposed the idea.
Moore created the panel 10 days ago and charged it with a “pressure test” of the state’s current congressional district map to ensure it is fair. He’s never defined the term and instead talked about Republican-led states that are engaged in hyper-partisan midcycle redistricting to send more Republicans to Congress in 2026.
But many of those who spoke during Friday’s nearly two-hour meeting said the redistricting scheme has less to do with fairness than with partisanship.
“Attempting to disenfranchise one-third of Maryland’s voters and deny them a seat in Congress is a vain attempt to capture the one remaining seat held by a Republican is not only a fool’s errand, it’s wrong,”said Gary Hodge. “This shouldn’t be the Maryland way.”
Hodge described himself as a lifelong Democrat who is interested in electing more Democrats, but he called on the panel to resist the urge to join the national redistricting frenzy.
“In these troubled times for our democracy, it’s more important than ever to set an example, remain true to our principles of representative government, and not be lured into a tawdry pursuit of base partisanship that has compromised the integrity and reputation of the Congress in the eyes of the American people and poisoned the civility of our politics,” he said.
The 40 speakers at Friday’s hearing, who included Republicans, Democrats and others, spoke against midcycle redistricting by a 2-1 margin. But supporters of redistricting said it’s necessary to respond to other states, like Texas, that are redrawing their congressional district lines for partisan advantage.
GOP counters Democrats’ push for redistricting with call for ‘fair and principled’ process

“We are at a moment where it’s not just Texas, but it’s North Carolina and Missouri, and other states are moving ahead,” said Hadley Anthony, a Baltimore City resident who lives in the district of Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) a prominent opponent of redistricting.
“Those three I mentioned have already changed the rules and changed their maps to consolidate power there, and this disenfranchises not just the residents of those states, but here in Maryland as well, because we are the United States of America,” Anthony said. “We have to stand up in this moment and move forward with this redistricting to make sure that we have fair representation, not just here in the state, but more broadly at the federal level.”
The virtual meeting of the five-member panel led by U.S. Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D) was the second meeting of the panel and the first at which the public was allowed to speak.
Alsobrooks and the panel are scheduled to hold a second public comment session Tuesday. Alsobrooks said she hoped to get two more meetings in in early December and possibly produce a map on which the public can comment.
The panel is expected to make a recommendation to Moore. That recommendation could lead to legislation drawing up new maps, possibly in a special session in December.
Moore has not committed to a special session nor taken the idea off the table.
Hodge was one of nearly a dozen who told the panel to reject redrawing the three-year old districts. He praised Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) for opposing calls to redistrict.
Ferguson, in a letter earlier this month, said midcycle redistricting was “too risky” and could backfire in a way that spawns court scrutiny or as many as three Republican seats instead of an 8-0 plan that eliminates Rep. Andy Harris (R-1st).
Ferguson, in a radio interview earlier this week, said his office received over 6000 calls. Less than 100 of those were said to be from Maryland residents, he said.
Hodge said the Senate leader offered “a wise, principled and practical argument against it.” This commission should heed his advice instead of getting down in the mud and wrestling with our political adversaries. Let’s beat them at the polls with better ideas for serving the people and solving the nation’s problems.”

Maryland has roughly 6.1 million residents, of which more than 4 million are registered voters. It’s hard to characterize the 40 speakers who were offered a chance to weigh in a representative sample. Especially when less than 40 spoke during the nearly two-hour meeting.
Pearl Seidman, a Howard County resident who once worked for Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, a 10-term Missouri Democrat, said she also opposed midcycle redistricting.
“I understand the concept of fighting fire with fire. I also know that humans have a less than stellar record in divining the future. I close with two questions for this esteemed panel. Can you anticipate the outcomes in Maryland of fighting fire with fire? How can you ensure a controlled burn?”
Hodge and Seidman were joined by Republicans who also decried an effort to eliminate the last Republican Maryland Congress member. A quarter century ago, the eight districts were split evenly between the two parties.
A small number of speakers called on the panel to recommend a nonpartisan or independent panel to oversee future redistricting efforts.
Eric Rockel said Maryland already has a reputation for its gerrymandered districts.
“This is not something that we should be proud of, and this is not simply an exercise to outdo the efforts by Republicans in Texas because Maryland, along with states like Illinois, Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Jersey are already highly gerrymandered,” Rockel said. “I would urge this commission, as one of its findings, to recommend that a non-partisan redistricting commission be established in time for the next census, so that we can have a little more objective and not as partisan a process in 2030.”
It is unclear how much of the testimony was heard live by Sen. Angela Alsobrooks, the chair. Alsobrooks opened the meeting and made brief remarks including a schedule of future meetings.
Then, about 9 minutes in as the first speaker began his remarks, Alsobrooks turned off her camera. The other four members remained on screen. Alsobrooks did not announce that she would turn off the camera.
A spokesperson for Alsobrooks’ campaign initially said that the senator was present but off camera. Later, the same spokesperson said Alsobrooks “left near the end and didn’t make it back for her closing.” She will not attend Tuesday’s meeting because the Senate is in session, the spokesperson said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-14-at-4.30.10 PM-1024x639.png,,,2025-11-15 08:56:35.516031

Ford/Maryland Matters)Legislation to ban immigration agreements between local law enforcement agencies and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement will return in the 2026 legislative session, after a year in which ICE raids have become increasingly aggressive and divisive.
Lawmakers have tried before to bl0ck 287(g) agreements, which delegate certain immigration enforcement abilities to local police, but those bills have failed so far.
In the past, say immigration advocates and community leaders, ICE tactics have become increasingly brazen under the anti-immigration administration of President Donald Trump (R), which has aggressively sought to expand federal involvement in local police enforcement.
So far this year, according to the immigrant rights group CASA, Maryland law enforcement agencies have transferred 119 immigrants from local jails into ICE custody.
“This bill is about community,” Del. Nicole Williams (D-Prince George’s) said Friday, backed by dozens of supporters at the CASA Welcome Center in Baltimore. “This bill is about ensuring that every community here in the state of Maryland is seen and is heard and is protected. This is about ensuring that our law enforcement is acting in the best interest of all of our communities throughout this entire state.”

Williams sponsored legislation this year on immigration protections that did pass that included language to help “sensitive locations” like churches and schools decide how to respond if immigration agents show, and it includes some privacy protections for migrant data. However, the 287(g) provision to bar local jurisdictions into ICE agreements was taken out on the last day of the session by the Senate.
For the upcoming session that begins Jan. 14, Williams said similar language may be incorporated into legislation for jurisdictions with current agreements with ICE would have a year to terminate them.
On Friday, Sen. President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) expressed support of the ban on social media.
“Now is the time to prohibit 287(g) agreements between ICE and law enforcement agencies in Maryland,” he said. “Recent months demonstrate that ICE and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security are operating with impunity, violating constitutional rights of American citizens and immigrants alike. For our law enforcement agencies to maintain the public trust, they cannot aid and abet that lawlessness.”
To amplify that message, Maryland House Democrats posted a video Thursday on social media to emphasize they voted to ban the agreements – twice.
“Maryland law enforcement should not be an arm of [President Donald] Trump’s extreme agenda,” the post said.
Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown (D) issued guidance last month to remind what local law enforcement agencies can do when working with federal authorities. One provision noted in the document prohibits civil immigration enforcement and for Maryland officers to perform “the functions of an immigration officer.”
As immigration arrests surge, so does number of Maryland sheriffs agreeing to work with ICE

Five sheriff’s office in Maryland signed 287(g) agreements with ICE this year: Allegany, Carroll, Garrett, St. Mary’s and Washington counties. Three others in Cecil, Frederick and Harford counties already had agreements in place.
Law enforcement officials have said the program ensures partnership with federal authorizes and protects communities from criminals.
Del. Chris Tomlinson (R-Frederick and Carroll) said in an interview Friday the program in Frederick has “worked great.”
Tomlinson highlighted a Prince George’s County case when a 19-year-old woman got killed this summer. Last month, 35-year-old Hugo Hernandez-Mendez was indicted for the murder of DaCara Thompson.
Immigration officials said Hernandez-Mendez is a Guatemalan native who has lived and worked in the U.S. illegally for more than three years. According to various news reports, Hernandez-Mendez was pulled over by U.S. Park Police in April and arrested for driving under the influence and other charges but was released.
“We have a serious issue where we have people in our country who shouldn’t be here,” Tomlinson said. “Not only is it a crime just to be here illegally, but they have convicted other illegal acts. Maybe if they [Prince George’s County] had a 287(g) program, maybe that guy would not have ever got out of that DUI and that girl would still be alive.”
Tomlinson continued: “It’s just appalling that Democrats turn a blind eye to stories like that in Prince George’s County.”
One jurisdiction on the Eastern Shore – Wicomico County – discussed about the possibility of entering a 287(g) agreement during a workshop session Nov. 4.
Wicomico County NAACP President Monica Brooks talks about opposition to a 287(g) proposal for the sheriff’s department in her county. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)
Because of certain changes the General Assembly may make in terms of the 287(g) program, Wicomico County Executive Julie Giordano (R) suggested to table, or hold off, on making any decisions.
Wicomico County Sheriff Michael A. Lewis said the attorney general’s office recent guidance “has made it very difficult, if not impossible, for our county executive working with my office to move forward to further protect the American people. A partnership that would continue to prioritize public safety over Maryland politics.”
Monica Brooks, president of the Wicomico County NAACP, said Friday at the CASA center in Baltimore that the community in her jurisdiction was a major reason the County Council “backed down” to not enter a 287(g) agreement.
“We call on a ban for 287(g), period,” Brooks said. “Let’s be humane and let’s act like we give a darn about the people that we’re supposed to represent. If you don’t agree with this, then you need to be voted out.”

This could become a more common sight at a state inspection program for EV chargers ramps up. (Photo courtesy Lanny Hartmann)Key players in the electric vehicle industry said they’re concerned that state-imposed costs to fund a new charger inspection program could suppress the budding EV industry in Maryland.
At a virtual meeting Thursday, EV companies, drivers and local government officials told the Maryland Department of Agriculture that the $150-per-port fee it will levy to pay for the cost of inspections could make it too expensive for companies or others to offer EV charging.
“This feels like such a sock in the gut to me,” said Lynn Parsons, an EV driver who testified at the hearing. “I hope I’m wrong. But for someone who has struggled to find EV charging stations, this just feels like it’s going to slow down the advancement of adding additional charging stations.”
But Agriculture Secretary Kevin Atticks defended the testing, which will be administered by the weights and measures division that already tests gas pumps, grocery store scales and other equipment around the state for accuracy. That division relies on fees to fund its operations, he said. And state oversight is something drivers are asking for, Atticks said.
“We heard from a number of owners and drivers of EVs about the need for not only registration, but inspection — and then inspection as a prompt for remediation,” he said.
Atticks said lawmakers gave his department the authority to levy inspection fees as part of the annual Budget Reconciliation and Financing Act this year. The department prepared the regulation, passed it to the legislature’s regulations committee and then opened a 30-day public comment period — that drew zero comments.
Some speakers at Thursday’s meeting said they felt blindsided by the news of the fees, which came in late September. They argued that the regulation was quietly ushered toward the finish line, and there wasn’t an effort to solicit robust comment from the public until Thursday’s meeting — after the regulation had already taken effect, and the department heard pushback.
Maryland joins suit against Trump administration on electric vehicles

Atticks said that the department did not directly notify any stakeholders, because the law doesn’t require it. The department followed its typical procedure for rule-making, he said.
The new policy requires that all EV chargers that offer a charge in exchange for payment be registered with the state by Jan. 1, and pay the $150 fee for each port at the station. Inspectors will begin visual checks in January, Atticks said, ensuring that chargers are registered (and affixing decals confirming that) and clearly display key information like the responsible party and the method of sale.
They’ll also tag and shut down any chargers that are inoperable, said Atticks, who recounted his own misadventures driving his state-owned electric vehicle around Maryland.
“There have been numerous examples that I have experienced where getting to a charger, the charger is not working and it is not easily possible — with the device or with the app that is associated with the device — to somehow prompt that it be refreshed,” he said. “I think over time, systems upgrade to allow that. Until we’re at that point, these inspections are going to be pretty critical.”
Sometime in the spring, he said the department hopes to begin testing the charging ports for accuracy, using a roughly $135,000 piece of equipment, known as a “standard,”  that will check whether chargers are accurately tabulating the amount of electricity dispensed.
The cost of the standard is just one factor that went into the department’s decision to charge $150 per port, Atticks said. The fee also needs to cover the cost of electricity for each test session, which can take up to 30 minutes per port, garage or parking lot entry fees, travel costs and the potential need for return trips if chargers are in use.
In short, “it will take a lot” to inspect the chargers, Atticks said.
In an early October letter signed by industry heavyweights, including Tesla and Rivian, the companies asked that the fee be paused, and ultimately lowered to $25 per port. They also asked to limit the total fees levied at any one location. Their letter said other states have set fees at $20-$25 per device. Connecticut charges $50 per device, and Florida $100, but Maryland would still be top of the pack.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“Maryland’s new EV charging device registration fee — the highest in the nation — will discourage EV charging deployment, will impose additional expenses on Maryland businesses, and will further hinder the state from achieving its EV adoption commitments,” the letter reads.
But Atticks said not all those states have to fund their operations through fees, as Maryland does. And some states have realized they “underestimated the amount of time and expense that it would take to accurately inspect EV chargers, and so they are going back to adjust their fees,” he said.
Atticks also pushed back against speakers who compared the EV inspection fee to the $20 annual fee the department charges for gas pumps. That fee is not per pump but per meter, he said, and with each gas pump having between four and 10 meters, the actual cost is $80-$200 per gas pump.
The new fees will leave businesses that offer EV charging with three options, according to the EV companies’ letter: Try to eat the cost, pass the cost on to customers, or cut costs by decommissioning chargers.
The changes come as the state grapples with ambitious commitments to electric vehicles — and ambitious climate goals.
Maryland is one of several states that follow California’s emissions standards, which require an increasing share of car sales be EVs, until model year 2035, when all new cars would have to be zero-emission.
But Gov. Wes Moore signed an executive order in April that allows the state to delay penalties for car manufacturers under the rule for model years 2027 and 2028. The EV charging companies point to that as evidence that the industry cannot afford additional stumbling blocks.
Moore issues executive order that could delay EV sales penalties

“The State has acknowledged the market challenges facing ZEV [zero-emission vehicle] adoption; now is not the time to impose a new annual registration fee on EV chargers that is the highest such fee in the nation,” their letter said.
Parsons and others Thursday were particularly concerned that the same fee will be levied for all types of commercial chargers, whether they are DC fast chargers at highway rest stops or slower Level 2 chargers at isolated condo or apartment complexes, which typically generate considerably less revenue.
Robert Borkowski, owner of EV charging company Plug IO, which focuses on installing chargers at multi-unit dwellings, said in an interview that many charging ports at housing complexes may not break even financially, because of the new fees.
“We do not have enough EVs to offset that cost, because right now, we are still in a very early [stage] of building out the infrastructure,” said Borkowski, who also spoke at Thursday’s meeting. “There may be not enough EVs, just even to generate the revenue to cover $150 per year.”
Others ech0ed the cost concerns. Anthony Willingham, public policy manager for charging company Electrify America, argued that the new fee structure will make it harder for his company to find welcoming sites for chargers, such as gas stations.
“It just makes the idea and the product much less attractive, especially when the registration fee is much higher than it is — or then it would be — in other jurisdictions,” Willingham said.
He said his company began installing chargers in 2017, some of which are still operational today. They are faltering not because of neglect but because of high demand, said Willingham, who compared it to :putting your dishwasher in a commercial kitchen. It’s going to struggle.”
Baltimore Gas & Electric, which operates hundreds of chargers around the state, also complained during Thursday’s meeting. Utilities are already required to report to the state’s Public Service Commission on the reliability of their chargers, and are required to maintain 97% uptime, said BGE’s Stephanie Leach. Charger shutoffs by Agriculture Department inspectors could make the PSC’s uptime standard harder to reach, she said.
And, like the others, she also bemoaned the inspection cost.
“We have over 700 chargers in the ground —public chargers and then additional multifamily chargers. So we’re talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars that will we will incur in registration fees this year,” said Leach, strategic programs manager at BGE.










This feels like such a sock in the gut to me. I hope I’m wrong. But for someone who has struggled to find EV charging stations, this just feels like it’s going to slow down the advancement of adding additional charging stations.


– Maryland EV driver Lynn Parsons, on her concerns that new inspection fees will reduce the number of EV charging stations


Several speakers asked whether the department could cut inspection costs by inspecting less often, for example, or bypassing the expensive equipment and conducting visual inspections only.? But department staffers seemed resolute, and didn’t indicate that any changes would be made to their inspection plans.
Borkowski said he worries that condos and apartments with EV chargers that aren’t used very much will rip them out, to avoid the registration fee, or a fee for an inoperable charger. It would take a homeowners association or condo board that is “really pro EVs” to convince residents they should keep paying for costly charging stations because it’s “going to benefit you in the future,” he said.
Borkowski said he is already considering lowering the number of chargers in two upcoming projects at multi-unit complexes, because of the new fees.
Brian Booher, an EV specialist with the Montgomery County Department of Environmental Protection, agreed with Borkowski about the risk of charger shutdowns. He said the department should focus on fast-chargers being used by travelers in need of rapid power, rather than slower chargers used by building residents who are not necessarily in a rush to find a charge.
“The issues that we’ve encountered with reliability really apply and are most frustrating when we’re trying to find that fast charging — when we need power quick and it just doesn’t work,” Booher said. “The Level 2s around the county are really often there for convenience or you need them overnight.”
Atticks said concerns with multi-unit dwellings would be “one of our priorities to take back and just consider: What is the path forward?” But he also noted that other states don’t seem to differentiate between types of chargers in their programs.
“Now, look, this is new. We’re only, at best, a few years into any state regulating EV chargers,” Atticks said. “If we can be the ones to innovate and come up with the newest, best alternative, we’ll be happy to do that.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/54486116423_04fa1b1fa3_o-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-14 22:56:52.203555

The latest ruling is arguably the most sweeping yet.,"In summary
The judge has previously sided with UC scholars several times since June in halting Trump’s termination of science and health research funding. The latest ruling is arguably the most sweeping yet. 


A California federal judge ruled today that Donald Trump cannot demand that UCLA pay a $1.2 billion settlement that would have imposed severe limits on the campus’s academic freedoms and efforts to enroll an economically and culturally diverse student body or risk continued funding freezes on grants the system relies on for research
The decision by Judge Rita Lin is a preliminary injunction and represents a significant victory for University of California scientists, professors, graduate students and other researchers. They and a national professors association sued Trump in September, claiming that his settlement demand — the most sweeping to date in his war on exclusive universities — represents an “unlawful threat” of funding cuts to coerce the university system into “suppressing free speech and academic freedom rights.”Lin agreed with that assessment, calling Trump’s actions toward the university “coercive and retaliatory.” Her ruling doesn’t just apply to UCLA. It largely ties the hands of the Trump administration to target the rest of the UC system for current and future research grants.
“Agency officials, as well as the President and Vice President, have repeatedly and publicly announced a playbook of initiating civil rights investigations of preeminent universities to justify cutting off federal funding, with the goal of bringing universities to their knees and forcing them to change their ideological tune,” Lin wrote in her ruling.Lin wrote that this same playbook is occurring at the UC.“With every day that passes, UCLA continues to be denied the chance to win new grants, ratchetting up Defendants’ pressure campaign,” she wrote. “And numerous UC faculty and staff have submitted declarations describing how (the Trump administration’s) actions have already chilled speech throughout the UC system.”
Lawyers for the federal government had argued that a federal court cannot block a federal agency from making a decision that hasn’t occurred yet, such as whether to approve new funding for a pending grant.“Notably, Plaintiffs’ fears about future grant suspensions and their claims about the likelihood of constitutional violations are entirely based on speculation about an opening settlement offer between the federal government and UC,” U.S. Department of Justice attorneys wrote to Lin.The legal documents in the case spanned 700 pages and included written testimony from more than 70 UC professors, staff workers and graduate students. 
The settlement demand and lawsuit
Trump’s settlement demand is a 27-page document sent to UCLA in early August that would have required the top-ranked public university to hire a senior administrator to review diversity, equity and inclusion efforts; limit campus protest; bar the campus’s medical center from performing gender affirming surgeries or hormone therapy on minors; deny admissions to foreign students with “anti-Western” sentiment and other restrictions.
The public was first able to see the document in late October after some scholars filed a separate lawsuit in state court to force UC officials to disclose the settlement demand.The settlement demand emerged a few days after the Trump administration froze more than $500 million in health and science research funding to UCLA over allegations that the campus tolerated antisemitism and enrolled students using racial preferences. Had UC agreed to its terms, the Trump administration would have released the frozen funds back to UCLA.
However, months before Trump sought the settlement, UCLA had already taken steps to address antisemitism on campus after its leaders commissioned a task force to recommend ways to create a more welcoming environment for Jewish students.Lin faulted the administration for disregarding UCLA’s efforts. The agencies did not “mention the remedial steps UCLA had already taken to address the issues described,” Lin wrote.UCLA is legally barred by state and federal law from admitting students using racial preferences. Trump’s demands would have also blocked UCLA from a practice the U.S. Supreme Court condoned: allowing students to discuss their racial identity in their personal essays. 
But almost all of that funding that Trump froze in July had since been restored after a separate wave of legal filings prompted Lin to temporarily undo Trump’s cuts in August and September.Lin has emerged as a key bulwark for UC researchers as she’s ordered the Trump administration several times to undo hundreds of millions of dollars in science funding cuts to the University of California, including roughly $500 million in science and health grant funding suspensions to UCLA alone. Between June and today, she’s sided with UC researchers and staff four times in rebuffing the Trump administration’s efforts to halt funding to scholars. Her initial ruling that has served as a basis for other preliminary injunctions against Trump was upheld by a panel of judges on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.UC faculty associations, among the plaintiffs in the case, wrote to Lin that some of its members who don’t have tenure and are international scholars now hesitate to teach issues related to Israel and Palestine or lead lessons on the health effects of climate change. Other scholars say they fear taking part in protests or other free speech activity due to fears about the government’s reprisals.“I am a mother, and the threat of jail time or federal involvement or oversight in campus policing would give me new fear” about protesting, wrote Hannah Appel, an anthropology professor at UC Santa Cruz, in a court document.
Faculty groups also argued that a $1.2 billion hit to UCLA would affect the whole system, as UC leaders would likely pull funding from other campuses to help UCLA absorb the loss. UCLA’s budget is around $13 billion, including its medical and hospital programs, while the UC system’s  is more than $50 billion — and a third of that comes from federal sources.UC President James Milliken called the situation “one of the gravest threats in UC’s 157-year history.” 
The ruling and evidence in detail
Lin’s written ruling mirrors the comments she made during a 90-minute hearing last week, in which she said that the Trump administration has told universities, including the UC, that “if you want the funding restored, then agree to change what you teach, change how you handle student protests (and) endorse the administration’s preferred views on gender.”“Defendants have submitted nothing to refute this,” she said then..
Twenty-one labor unions and faculty associations sued Trump and 15 agencies, including the top providers of science research funding — the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the Department of Defense, NASA and the Department of Education that together award the UC more than $4 billion annually. The UC system itself is not part of this suit but has received sustained pressure from students, staff and faculty — including hundreds of Jewish ones — to reject Trump’s settlement.
“This agreement violates the very foundations of higher education,” the UC undergraduate student association wrote to Gov. Gavin Newsom, UC’s president and campus chancellors in November. 
Faculty and staff wanted a return of all terminated grants and a block on denying funding to any pending grants that were preliminarily approved by science panels but were stalled for seemingly political reasons.  
Other faculty, staff impact
The UC has cut the hours or laid off more than 250 lecturers and librarians since Trump began his term this year, said Katie Rodger, the president of UC-AFT, the union of lecturers and librarians at the UC. Lecturers are a core part of the instructional staff at UC but generally lack guarantees of continuous employment that other professors enjoy.
The federal fiscal picture is a reason why at least some lecturers have received pink slips. The “School of Humanities has incurred budget reductions over the last four years, which have been compounded this year by national and state level budgetary impacts and planning projections indicate substantial future budget shortfalls,” said a termination letter at UC Irvine this past spring. 
And while lecturers do not lead labs that receive federal grant funding, they work in them. The loss of grant funding “already has and it will continue to impact us going forward,” Rodger said of lecturers during an interview. The union in August wrote a letter to UC’s director of labor relations leadership demanding that the system cease negotiations with Trump over the settlement.
Meanwhile, the dean of the largest college at the UC — the College of Letters and Science at UC Davis — wrote to faculty last month that it’s dealing with a $20 million budget shortfall across this year and next, after absorbing a loss of $6.7 million the past five years. “Budgets for faculty and graduate student employment will reflect these reductions,” the dean, Estella Atekwana, wrote. That would affect most lecturers.Several scholars and staffers wrote to Lin that the administration was freezing funding on pending grants that UCLA researchers would have likely received if Trump didn’t target the campus. One of those projects was supposed to go to Marcus Roper, a mathematics and computational medicine professor who submitted a grant to research how to better predict vision loss in adults with diabetes. 
The proposal also included a program to teach K-12 students how to apply algebra to analyze eye health. Roper showed in court filings that two grants he submitted won the recommendations of the agency’s program directors, but those were pulled when the Trump administration suspended all of UCLA’s existing NSF and National Institutes of Health grants. Even after Lin ordered Trump to restore the existing grants the agency suspended at UCLA, NSF personnel told Roper they were ordered to pause approval of funding for new grants.Also at UCLA, the NSF preliminarily approved the renewal grant for a math research program that’s been funded for 25 years, but also pulled it in July. If the program isn’t reupped again, Richard Bartlebaugh, a video producer, will lose his job months before he’s eligible for his pension and the program will close in May of 2026, he wrote to Lin. “In this scenario, my time at (the institute) will have represented a four-year and eleven-month career misstep.”
Trump didn’t follow rules, lawsuit said
Catherine Lhamon, formerly the top official during the Obama and Biden administrations at the Office for Civil Rights in the U.S. Department of Education, wrote to Lin that the way the Trump administration pulled funds was illegal. 
“What (the office) cannot do under the law — and what we never did — is move to immediate fund termination.”But that’s what the administration did. And as Lin noted in her ruling and comments during last week’s hearing, Trump officials bragged about it.“We’re going to bankrupt these universities, we’re going to take away every single federal dollar,” said Leo Terrell on a FOX News program in March. Terrell heads the Trump administration’s multi-agency Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism. His interview was submitted by lawyers for the UC workers as evidence. “The academic system in this country has been hijacked by the left, has been hijacked by the Marxists” he also said.
Llamon, who’s now a faculty member at UC Berkeley, wrote that federal law requires the agency to go through a lengthy process of warning a campus of any civil rights violations, such as ones dealing with antisemitism, and allow the campus to come to a settlement with an action plan. Sometimes the Office for Civil Rights leads an investigation at the school and encourages campus leaders to undertake policy changes. All of that occurs before the federal government pulls funding from a school.  While in charge, her office struck deals to combat allegations of antisemitism at numerous universities, including the UC.“Termination of funds was, as is required in statute and regulation, a last resort, and in the thousands of complaints my office received, we never needed to take this step,” she wrote.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/040825_UCLA-Funding-Cuts_JH_CM_27.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-14 21:01:22.005075

More than three dozen Hamtramck voters have been disenfranchised after three non-election officials walked into the city clerk’s sealed office on election night, compromising the security of absentee ballots that were mistakenly left there.
The Wayne County Board of Canvassers deadlocked Friday on whether to count the 37 ballots, which were discovered in that office the day after Election Day, having been opened but not removed from their envelopes. Because the board didn’t have a majority of votes in favor of counting them, the ballots will not be included in the final tallies of the election.
It’s not clear whether officials at any level are obligated to tell those 37 voters about the fate of their ballots. Greg Mahar, Wayne County’s director of elections, said he wasn’t aware of any requirements around that. State officials said they weren’t aware of any regulations on that either.
Those uncounted ballots could have been pivotal for the result of the closely contested, open-seat mayoral election in the city, which borders Detroit. According to unofficial results, engineer Adam Alharbi currently leads City Council member Muhith Mahmood in the race by only 11 votes.
At issue in the canvassing board’s deliberations was the ballots’ chain of custody, which must be maintained to ensure the results of the election are accurate and legitimate. Clerk’s offices are sealed around the time of elections, meaning only election officials come into and out of places where ballots are stored.
Due to what officials have said was human error by those who were counting absentee ballots on election night, the 37 ballots in question were opened but never counted. Upon noting a discrepancy in the numbers, election officials looked for the ballots, City Clerk Rana Faraj told the canvassers at their meeting Thursday, but did not find them until the next day. Those ballots were then sealed in a secure envelope and brought to the county.
But the clerk and her team later realized that three other city officials, including interim City Manager Alex Lagrou, walked into the office late on election night, Faraj said. That broke the chain of custody of those ballots, casting doubt onto whether they could be counted.
It’s uncertain why Lagrou and the other officials entered the office. Lagrou could not be reached for comment Friday. It’s not clear who the other non-election officials were.
Becki Carmargo, assistant corporation counsel for Wayne County, told the canvassers on Friday that the board had precedent to reject the ballots based on similar cases in the past. She recommended that the ballots be rejected.
The Democrats on the board, Richard Preuss and Edward Keelean, both argued the votes should be counted. Preuss, the board’s vice chair, said he would like to see affidavits or sworn testimony from the officials who entered the office, because “throwing out votes without having evidence is reckless.”
“I haven’t seen any evidence saying there’s any fraud,” he said, “and to say that these 37 don’t count because of an allegation of potential fraud is completely contrary to this board’s sworn duty.”
Lisa Capatina, a Republican and the chair of the board, argued that such an investigation would be outside of the power of the canvassers. The canvassers are ministerial, she said, meaning their primary job is to confirm the election results.
The canvassers ultimately voted along party lines, and the 2-2 deadlock means the ballots will not be counted.
The mayoral election now hinges on 120 cured ballots tabulated during the canvasser’s meeting Thursday. Those will be taken into the count on Tuesday as the board finalizes the canvas.
Mahmood, the currently trailing mayoral candidate, told Votebeat before the meeting that he hoped the canvassers “did the right thing.”
“At the end of the day, those are people’s votes,” he said. He declined to comment further after the meeting.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota is the fourth state in the country to commit to President Donald Trump’s federal education tax credit program, Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden announced Friday in Sioux Falls.
Under the program, South Dakotans who owe federal income taxes can either send up to $1,700 to the federal government, or they can donate that $1,700 to a government-recognized scholarship granting organization to public, private or homeschool entities in the state. The program starts in 2027.
Nebraska’s Republican Gov. Jim Pillen announced the state’s commitment in September. Republican governors for North Carolina and Tennessee announced their commitment this summer. Oregon, New Mexico and Wisconsin officials said they do not intend to opt into the program. Some critics nationally have questioned whether there will be proper guardrails, accountability and “quality control” in place.
Rhoden called the imminent program a “winning situation” for South Dakota taxpayers.
“I’d just as soon give those dollars to a private school than Uncle Sam,” Rhoden said at the announcement, standing in front of a row of students attending the St. Joseph Academy. “I think they know how to spend it a little wiser than the federal government.”
Rhoden added that the federal tax credit will “pair well” with South Dakota’s existing tax credit program, which allows insurance companies to donate up to a total of $5 million to a private school scholarship program for students whose families have low incomes.

The program will further support the state’s growing alternative instruction movement, Rhoden said, including homeschooling and microschools popping up throughout the state. Alternative instruction enrollment has nearly tripled in South Dakota in the last decade, making up about 7% of school-age children in the state.
Sara Hofflander, founder of St. Joseph Academy, said the school is “grateful” for the potential extra funding, though she plans to “approach everything cautiously.”
“Running an independent school obviously requires a heavy commitment from families,” Hoffman said, adding that the extra funding would “lift some of that burden, so we can focus more on the needs of our students.” 
Historically, “school choice” efforts in the state have met resistance from the public school industry. 
Advocates vehemently fought former Gov. Kristi Noem’s effort to introduce Education Savings Accounts, which would have provided public funding for private education and homeschool options during the last legislative session, calling the failed effort an attack on public education. Those same advocates referred to the state’s education tax credit program as “backdoor school voucher program.”
But Rob Monson, executive director for the School Administrators of South Dakota, said the program will benefit public and private education. South Dakotans can direct their tax credit dollars to organizations representing public schools in the state. The funding could be spent on not only tuition and fees for private schools, but tutoring, special needs services for students with disabilities, transportation (such as busing), afterschool care and computers.
South Dakota Department of Education fails to reach goals in legislative performance review

“That’s a huge win for taxpayers of South Dakota, but also every form of education across the state,” Monson said.
South Dakota Education Secretary Joe Graves said the program will support education innovations and a “robust competitive system.”
Graves told lawmakers on Thursday, while presenting lackluster test scores to a committee, that “innovation” would be key to improving student outcomes, especially for Native American students and children living in “education deserts.”
“We’re not doing well enough, and we need to do better,” Graves said at Friday’s announcement.
If more students attend private or alternative schooling options, that would mean less state funding for public schools because of decreased student enrollment. Monson told South Dakota Searchlight that state revenues could be impacted by participation in the tax credit program, since it would remove federal tax dollars used to support other programs or go toward states. The federal government would still be obligated to fund some federal education programs, Monson added.
The scholarship funds would be available to families whose household incomes do not exceed 300% of their area’s median gross income. The U.S. Department of Treasury is expected to issue proposed rules detailing the program’s operation.
Graves said he assumes there will be reporting “at some level” of how the funds are spent.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/591A2359-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-14 19:57:21.188237

Col. David “Boar” Gunter told the Idaho Legislature’s Committee on Federalism that the number of personnel could increase to perhaps 300 people – in Qatari personnel and U.S. personnel – as the training program reaches its full operational capabilities. Overall the training program could last for 10 years, he said. 
Gunter told Idaho legislators that plans for the Qatari training program have been under development for several years, and the squadron would be a U.S. flag squadron under the leadership of the U.S. Air Force.
“The program builds on the United States Air Force’s long standing tradition of hosting allies and partner nations for training with similar programs as to several Air Force bases here in the United States,” Gunter said.
 Training with allies to prepare for combat

Gunter said the ability to train with allies with Qatari Emiri Air Force at Mountain Home Air Force Base helps ensure they will be prepared to serve with multinational forces during more stressful, high stakes combat missions in the future.
“The United States Air Force and United States government relies on our allies and partners to multiply our capabilities and to continue to provide the safety and security that we provide around the world,” Gunter said. 
Gunter made a sports analogy to describe the training, saying a team of football players who practice and train together will perform at a higher level with better unity during high-stakes game situations.
“That is very similar to the advantages that we get by training with our partners and allies before we are in a very stressful situation that is air-to-air combat,” Gunter said. 
In addition to Qatari Emiri Air Force personnel, Gunter told Idaho legislators the Qatari personnel may bring dependents such as spouses or family members with them, but Gunter said it was too early to know details.
 Idaho’s elected officials were surprised by Qatari facility announcement

On Oct. 10, Hegseth announced the deal to train Qatari Emiri Air Force personnel at Idaho’s Mountain Home Air Force Base. 
In televised remarks, Hegseth said, “Today we are announcing that we are signing a letter of acceptance to build a Qatari Emiri Air Force Facility at the Mountain Home Air Base in Idaho.”

That same day, Hegseth took to social media to clarify his remarks, writing “Qatar will not have their own base in the United States – nor anything like a base.”
The announcement caught U.S. Sen. Jim Risch, Gov. Brad Little and other officials off guard, records obtained by the Idaho Capital Sun revealed. 
Late last month, Risch, Little, U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo and U.S. Rep. Russ Fulcher, all R-Idaho, wrote letters asking Hegseth for a briefing on the Qatari training deal and answers questions about logistics and national security.  
Risch also spoke to the Idaho Legislature’s Federalism Committee on Friday at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise. 
Risch, who serves as chairman of the U.S Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Idaho’s entire congressional delegation’s staff was meeting Friday morning with the Department of Defense to “find out exactly what happened” with the training program announcement.

Risch said the purpose of the Mountain Home Air Force Base is to provide training for aviators from the United States and its allies. Risch said U.S. allies from all over the world train on F-15 and F-16 aircraft at Mountain Home Air Force Base.

“People come from all over the world – not our adversaries – but people who are allies,” Risch said Friday. 
“Go out there any day and you’ll find people from all over the world training out there,” Risch said. 
Risch told committee members that Qatar is a U.S. ally and the U.S. operates a military base there. 
“Being careful of what I say here, they are not a perfect ally of ours,” Risch said. “But we have a huge military base in Qatar. It’s got thousands of soldiers, sailors, Marines, aircraft, ships – everything. If there’s ever a blow up in the Middle East, our war will be fought from Qatar because they host our base there.”
When it comes to the Mountain Home Air Force Base training deal, Risch stressed that the United States controls that base and Hegseth’s announcement doesn’t change that. 
“Nobody has control of that except the American government,” Risch said. 
 Several Idaho legislators voice concerns about Qatari Emiri Air Force training deal

After Gunter delivered his prepared remarks to the committee, several Idaho legislators voiced concerns about the training partnership with Qatar.

“I would assure you that Idaho has an unwavering support for you and the members of our Air Force, but when it comes to this, the support is waning greatly in the population,” Rep. Dale Hawkins, R-Fernwood, said. “I’m getting dozens and dozens and dozens of emails and phone calls with great concern that we are yoking ourselves and bringing people here that have been speculated to be a major funder of terrorism in other parts of the world.”
Sen. Cindy Carlson, R-Riggins, also told Gunter that she has concerns and has heard from many concerned constituents.
“I just want to go on record that I have concerns about this process about aligning ourselves with a known country of … sponsoring terrorism,” Carlson said. 
Gunter told the Idaho legislators there is a rigorous vetting process for everyone brought on the Mountain Home Air Force Base that takes about 30 days to complete. Gunter said there would be certain areas on the base and certain information the Qatari Emiri Air Force personnel would not have access to. Gunter also said there are numerous other security measures in place on the base that he could not disclose but that he said he had total confidence in.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)The General Assembly’s Democratic and Republican leaders assembled for a rare committee meeting Friday afternoon to consider requests to audit state waste, both fiscal and physical.
But any action on those asks before the Joint Committee on Legislative Services will have to wait for a future meeting. The five-member panel agreed to postpone action on a GOP request to probe the state’s quasi-governmental affordable-housing finance agency and a separate proposal seeking an assessment of  how much trash and recycling the State House generates.
Lawmakers began their hour-long hearing with a request by House Minority Leader Mike Chippendale to have the state’s Office of Auditor General investigate RIHousing. In September, Chippendale, a Foster Republican who sits on the committee, called for an audit of the housing agency he characterized as “bloated” and inefficient in its mission of tackling the state’s housing crisis. 
“The request for the entertainment of a performance audit is not a reflection of hostility, distrust, or personal criticism of the agency or its staff,” Chippendale told the committee. “On the contrary, it’s rooted in respect for the importance of their work and a deep desire to strengthen the systems that support it.” 
Chippendale provided fellow legislative leaders with a 17-page report by the House Minority Office that “reveals significant concerns related to transparency.” It’s separate from the six-page analysis Chippendale’s office produced in September, which mostly compared RIHousing to its peer agencies in the region.
The report handed out Friday looked at how much RIHousing spent in subsidizing new construction projects with $206 million federal pandemic aid over the last five fiscal years. 
The GOP’s latest findings mirror those in a 2024 analysis by the Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council (RIPEC), which found the state’s return on investment for its housing policies and programs has fallen short.
RIPEC in its report had proposed structural changes, such as setting up “strict cost standards” for housing projects seeking state funds and eliminating duplication of state and federal funding programs with a single, streamlined and easily trackable program. 
Chippendale said his office was inspired to independently crunch numbers to analyze RIHousing’s results in increasing housing production in the state.
Out of 42 projects reviewed by the House GOP, 14 of them — 33% — exceeded RIHousing’s own internal cost limits. According to the report, many of those projects exceeded limits by 20% to 140%, with per-unit costs ranging from $514,000 to $639,000. 
“We’ve seen various reporting inconsistencies when it relates to these monies,” Chippendale said. 
Chippendale acknowledged that RIHousing posts annual audits to its website, but he said they’re all purely financial.
“It does not look at efficiency, it does not look at performance, it does not look at output,” he said.
Chippendale said he did not expect any action to immediately be taken as the report had been given to the panel, along with RIHousing the same day as the meeting. House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi, the Warwick Democrat who chairs the panel, agreed that was fair.
Shekarchi did give RIHousing the chance to respond to Chippendale’s remarks. RIHousing Deputy Director James Comer attended the meeting while Executive Director Carol Ventura was absent.
Comer read a statement from Ventura highlighting $1.4 billion in financing the agency made available in 2024 for affordable housing, first home mortgages and rental assistance.
In addition to publishing financial audits, Comer said RIHousing provides monthly reports on its activities to the state’s Pandemic Recovery Office — which disburses shares of Rhode Island’s remaining federal aid funds for its financing programs.
“That’s what accountability looks like in practice,” he told the committee. “We welcome this hearing as an opportunity to reaffirm who we are — Rhode Islanders can and should have full confidence in how their statewide housing financing agency operates.”

Tackling State House waste
The Joint Committee on Legislative Services similarly held off on voting on a request by Rep. Lauren Carson, a Newport Democrat, to allow a nonprofit that has been setting up ​​composting programs in all of Rhode Island’s schools to find ways to reduce trash inside the State House.
Carson’s proposal calls for the Rhode Island School Recycling Project to look around the Capitol building’s waste receptacles and locate sources of food waste. The idea is to set up a waste sorting program inside the State House.
“We have an obligation in the State House to comply with state law and recycle, to lead by example and to demonstrate to the citizens of Rhode Island that we’re doing the right thing when it comes to waste,” Carson told the committee.
On hand to further sell the idea was Warren Heyman, organizing director of the Rhode Island School Recycling Project.. Heyman told legislative leaders not only would the Rhode Island School Recycling Project do the work for free, but reducing waste in the building could save the state some money once the Central Landfill in Johnston fills up — which is expected to happen in 2046.
“The cost of shipping our trash out of state will only increase,” Heyman said. “Everything we can do — whether it’s in our public schools, this building, or hospitals or nursing homes — that can reduce the amount of trash going to landfill is a dollar saved on behalf of the taxpayers.”
Shekarchi told Carson and Heyman that while legislative leaders have exclusive control over certain rooms in the building, responsibility is shared with the state’s Division of Capital Asset Management & Maintenance.
He suggested Carson and the Rhode Island School Recycling Project connect with the capital asset division before the next meeting, which has yet to be scheduled. Despite the delay, members of the committee underscored the need for a cleaner State House — including Shekarchi and Senate President Valarie Lawson.
“We need to consider here in this building what we can be part of this process,” Lawson, an East Providence Democrat, said.

(Photo by Barbara Hoberock/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – Two state panels charged with setting legislative and statewide elected official pay are set to meet again Tuesday after it was determined an ineligible member voted to raise pay.
The Board on Legislative Compensation and Statewide Official Compensation Commission both posted special meeting notices Friday afternoon after concerns were raised that one of the board’s members was a registered lobbyist. 
According to state law, lobbyists are barred from serving on the Board on Legislative Compensation, which meets in odd-numbered years to set lawmaker pay and leadership stipends.
“It does appear that a board member was prohibited from serving in that position,” said Leslie Berger, a spokesperson for Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond, whose office advises both panels. “It is our understanding that House leadership is aware and working to remedy the matter.”
House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, appointed James Leewright to the Board on Legislative Compensation. Both panels have the same members.
Leewright is a former Republican member of the House and Senate. He participated and cast votes in both meetings.
Leewright currently is a registered lobbyist, online news outlet NonDoc reported. He serves as the president and CEO of the Oklahoma Restaurant Association and CEO of the Oklahoma Hotel and Lodging Association and the Oklahoma Travel Industry Association.
Caroline Estes, Hilbert’s press secretary, said the special meetings were set after it was determined Leewright was ineligible to serve.
Tuesday would mark the third time the legislative compensation board will have met. Under state law, Tuesday is the final day it can legally convene.
The panels met earlier this week and increased by at least 25% the pay for nearly all statewide elected officials with the exception of the governor. Members also hiked stipends for legislative leaders, but kept legislative pay the same. The pay hikes would not take effect until after the November 2026 elections.
As of late Friday, the agendas for the meetings had not been posted.
Estes said she did not know if every item would be voted on again because each panel sets their agenda.
But Hilbert wanted “to do whatever is fair,” she said.
“Along with the replacement of an appointee, there are multiple outstanding items that need to be addressed,” Estes said. She did not elaborate.
Hilbert has appointed Krista Ratliff, president and CEO of FISTA Innovation Park in Lawton, to serve on the boards.
The legislative compensation board has set its special meeting for 2 p.m. in Room 230 of the state Capitol. The Statewide Official Compensation Commission has set a special meeting for 3 p.m. in the same location.

(iStock/Getty Images Plus)Salt Lake County says its first confirmed case of measles this year is worrying because it suggests the virus is spreading in the community. 
“This case is especially concerning because the source of the patient’s infection is unknown,” said Dorothy Adams, executive director of the Salt Lake County Health Department. “They have not knowingly had contact with anyone who had measles, which means their infection is the result of transmission somewhere out in the community.”
The county warned that anyone who went to Intermountain Health’s Taylorsville urgent care clinic on Nov. 7 from 3 p.m. to 7:15 p.m. may have been exposed. The virus is highly contagious and can linger in the air for up to two hours, so it doesn’t need direct contact to spread.
Measles reaches highest level in 33 years, now in 39 states

With that in mind, health department employees were getting in touch with people who might have been in close contact with the patient or visited the same spaces within a few hours. 
The department first learned Wednesday night that someone tested positive. Citing patient privacy reasons, it did not give the patient’s age or gender, or say where the person lives. 
On Oct. 27, the county announced a likely case based on the symptoms of a patient who refused testing. The last time the county recorded a positive test was in 2023, when a Utah resident got infected while traveling out of state, said spokesperson Gabriel Moreno.

Outbreaks happened earlier this year in rural parts of the state, including along the Utah-Arizona border and in Cache County. 
Two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine prevent more than 97% of infections, the health department said, and those who are vaccinated and still get sick tend to have milder symptoms. Unvaccinated people — including babies too young to be eligible and immune-compromised Utahns — are more likely to experience severe complications. 
Symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose and red or watery eyes, followed by a rash that typically begins days later on the head or face.  
For those who don’t know if they’re immune, the county said receiving an additional dose of the MMR vaccine is safe and widely available, including at its vaccine clinics.

After receiving feedback from mental health providers who said the change would put a significant dent in their bottom line, the insurer is taking a step back to evaluate the proposal.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Blue Cross Blue Shield VT postpones controversial change to therapy billing .","Savannah Lord, the clinical director of a Burlington nonprofit mental health clinic, got an email from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont this month and was immediately alarmed, as were many of her colleagues across the state.
What transpired since then provides a small window into the highly complicated world of health insurance in the United States, where even the insurers who set reimbursement rates, and the providers who bill for them, can become confused. That complexity can also get in the way of efforts to improve patient care.
The Nov. 5 email from Tom Weigel, the chief medical officer for the state’s largest private insurer, explained a billing change the insurer planned to implement. Starting in January 2026, unlicensed mental health providers would receive 24% less in payment for services than their licensed counterparts.
The change, Weigel wrote, was intended to encourage those unlicensed providers to complete their licensing requirements, and to align the private insurer’s reimbursement practices for mental health services with those of Vermont Medicaid. The insurer had found upon review that “trainees were practicing for many years without clear progress toward licensure. Some even practicing more than 10 years as trainees.” 
Lord knew right away the change would be a massive financial blow to her clinic, called Eden Valley, which treats patients of all ages. Four of the clinic’s six staff members are pre-licensed supervisees. Nearly 75% of Eden Valley’s revenue comes from patients covered by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont. 
“This is how we keep the lights on; this is how we pay utilities. This is how we pay our taxes. This is how we function,” Lord said.
Also, something didn’t sit right with Lord about the letter’s explanation of mirroring Vermont Medicaid rates for mental health: The state’s program for lower-income Vermonters has paid the same rate for all of Eden Valley’s practitioners, licensed or not.
“The insinuation that we have been overpaid all of these years is quite scary,” Lord added. 
In the days that followed, mental health providers in and around Burlington quickly rallied against that Blue Cross Blue Shield of VT proposal. They circulated a protest form letter among patients and other clinicians and on the popular Burlington Facebook group Sensi-Babeington. The letters said that the reduction would result in fewer therapists entering training and even further reducing the number of therapists and social workers in a state where they are already scarce, particularly those who take insurance.
This week Blue Cross Blue Shield of VT informed mental health providers that it would pause implementation of the policy to gather more information. 
“We’ve received feedback from some of our network providers who disagree with the change, and we take that feedback seriously,” company Vice President Andrew Garland said in an emailed statement to VTDigger.
“We think we have this right, but we are going to postpone the policy start date so we have more time to discuss the policy change with our network providers and community leaders,” he wrote.

(Mis)alignment with Medicaid
The licensure process is an important part of consumer protection, said Lynn Currier, a licensed inpatient clinical social worker and the executive director of the Vermont and New Hampshire chapters of the National Association of Social Workers. 
The process ensures that practitioners have passed their qualifying exam and that they are participating in the continuing education required to maintain a license, she said.
“When I look at Blue Cross Blue Shield’s reasoning, (and) that they’re seeing people who never get out of the trainee status, they’re not wrong,” Currier said. “There are clinicians who’ve been working decades without a license, because they can work under the license of somebody else, and that’s a problem.” 
But ensuring that insurers and regulators have the tools to assess a provider’s licensure status is complicated. 
One issue is that many types of mental health professionals can practice in the state of Vermont without a license, explained Lauren Hibbert, deputy secretary of state. To practice this way, a provider is required to enroll in what her office calls the roster of non-licensed, non-certified clinicians, giving the state a way outside of licensure to monitor who is providing mental health care in Vermont. 
Some of the mental health professionals on the roster have degrees in psychology, social work or counseling and are working toward full licensure. To achieve that, a trainee must log around two years of practice, meeting with clients and providing clinical care under the supervision of an already-licensed clinician. 
Another group of therapists on the roster may be career-long unlicensed practitioners, who might offer different kinds of mental health therapy, may not be able to pass the licensure exam, or may have not completed their education. There are many mental health care professionals who may never intend to pursue licensure, Hibbert said.

The distinction between the two tracks — those who are working toward licensure and those who stay in this unlicensed, rostered status for long periods — can easily become muddled. 
Blue Cross Blue Shield’s Weigel wrote that the reduction in reimbursements for pre-licensed clinicians “aligns with Medicaid to create consistency, reduce incentives for trainees to remain unlicensed, and focus resources on high-quality, well-supervised care that benefits members.”
But, in fact, it did not align with Medicaid’s rates for unlicensed therapists.
Vermont Medicaid does indeed reimburse many trainees at 76% of the program’s set fee schedule, which does seem to parallel what BCBS VT initially proposed. But, the state program also reimburses many fully licensed therapists the same percentage.
Medicaid distinguishes its billing rates based on the provider’s education status, not their licensure status, explained Alex McCracken, a spokesperson for the Department of Vermont Health Access, which administers Medicaid. 
A psychiatric physician or nurse practitioner receives 100% of the Medicaid set rate for a clinical mental health service. A psychologist with a PhD receives 93% of that full fee; a psychologist with a master’s level degree receives 76% of that allowed amount. This is true regardless of whether they have achieved their license yet. 
This has been the case since the inception of this supervised billing structure, nearly a decade ago, in 2016, McCracken said. DVHA has no plans to change that, she added.
‘We need to get this right’
Still, the concerns of long-rostered, unlicensed clinicians that Blue Cross Blue Shield initially set out to address remain.
Both DVHA and the state’s Office of Professional Regulation are trying to make it easier to tell who is working toward their license and for how long, officials there said. 
Starting in 2026, DVHA will require non-licensed providers to enroll individually with Vermont Medicaid and appear on the claims submitted for reimbursement — rather than submitting under their supervisor.
“This change helps DVHA ensure providers billing under the supervised billing system are working towards licensure,” McCracken explained. 
Previously, the department had tried to address this by implementing a five-year billing limit for rostered professionals. That rule will sunset at the end of 2025, after DVHA received feedback from providers who found the rule difficult to operate under, as it took some people longer to complete their training.
The Office of Professional Regulation is exploring proposals from a 2024 report that recommends changes to better streamline licensure in the state.
One idea, that would require a legislative change, could be implementing two different types of credentials for unlicensed clinicians — one for people training toward licensure and another for individuals who intend to only stay on the roster. Other states, like New Hampshire and Massachusetts, have conditional licenses for trainees working toward full licensure. 
“The public needs to understand that there is a difference between seeing someone who is licensed or someone who is on their way to being licensed than someone who is not licensed and not on their way to being licensed,” Hibbert said. “It makes sense to me that reimbursement follows that.”
In Weigel’s letter to providers, he cited another concern. There is no cap on how many trainees a provider can oversee, “raising concerns about real-time oversight.” The insurer said that some supervisors had reported retaining “all or part” of the reimbursement from their supervisees, leading to worries that hosting trainees might become “a profit center.”
In his statement to VTDigger, Garland said he did not know yet how long this postponement of the rate change will last, but that the insurer will spend the time listening and sharing information with trainees and supervisors. “In the end, we need to get this right for our members. Many Vermonters, including many of our members, are struggling with the cost of healthcare,” he wrote.
Clinicians have their own concerns and criticisms of the current system. Some worry that reducing the amount a supervisee can make will discourage licensed professionals from taking on the administrative burden of a trainee. 
“Supervising a supervisee who’s not yet licensed requires a significant amount of oversight,” said Danielle Bergeron Ingram, a licensed psychologist and the owner of Green Mountain Psychological Associates, in Middlebury. She also sits on the board of directors for the Vermont Psychological Association. 
Bergeron supervises one trainee in her private practice. “Working under my license, there’s a significant amount of time spent reviewing notes, ensuring quality of care,” she said. “I’m reading my supervisee’s notes, any treatment plans, any documents that are produced by the client.” 
With the high overhead cost of going through undergraduate and graduate school to become a therapist, Bergeron Ingram also worries that a lower reimbursement rate will be yet another economic barrier for those trying to become therapists. 
“We are absolutely going to lose people going into the field in the first place.” she asked. “If they’re not compensated fairly, why go into the field?”

Called debris flows, these fast-moving slurries of floodwater and sediment can hurtle down slopes carrying cars, trees and even boulders with them.
They’re like “a flood on steroids,” said Jason Kean, a research hydrologist with the U.S. Geological Survey’s landslide hazards program. “It’s really hard to stop these things. The best thing to do is get out of the way.” 
Forecasters expect the heaviest rain Friday into Saturday night; predictions are for wet days through next week. Storms may stretch from Santa Barbara County south to Los Angeles County, and could spread inland to parts of Orange County and the Inland Empire. 
Burn scars — slicked by fire and stripped of plants — are especially vulnerable. A storm after the Thomas Fire in 2018 spurred debris flows in Montecito that killed 23 people. And in February, a debris flow in the Palisades Fire burn zone swept a Los Angeles Fire Department member and his SUV into the Pacific Ocean. 
The Los Angeles County Department of Public Works warns that there’s a risk of moderate debris and mudflows capable of blocking roadways and endangering some structures in the burn scars of almost a dozen fires — including January’s Eaton, Hurst and Palisades fires. 
The county has issued evacuation warnings, as well as some targeted evacuation orders for specific properties “at higher risk for mud and debris flows impacts.”
The public works department says that most burned properties have been cleared of fire debris, and the rest have been shored up with gravel bags and other materials to keep debris in place. 
Gov. Gavin Newsom also announced today that more than 400 personnel and resources including fire engines, helicopters and search and rescue teams have been pre-deployed to Southern California counties. 
“It’s a pretty serious situation,”  said National Weather Service meteorologist David Gomberg.
By Friday morning, the storm had already unleashed up to 5 inches of rain in parts of Santa Barbara County, Gomberg said, and Southern California is bracing for more. 
There’s also the possibility of thunderstorms, small tornadoes, and a worrying amount of rain hitting the Eaton and Palisades burn scars. Even just a half-an-inch to 0.6 inches of rain could trigger a debris flow in these areas, said Gomberg, who added that his office is forecasting between half an inch to one inch per hour in these areas. 
“And the more you exceed the threshold, the probability of a more damaging debris flow increases,” he said.
We spoke with the U.S. Geological Survey’s Kean, an expert on debris flows after wildfires, about what to expect. This conversation has been edited and condensed. 
As this storm really takes hold in LA and Southern California, I’m hearing a lot of concern about it hitting areas that burned this past year, including in the Eaton and Palisades fires. Why is this such a big concern? What could happen?
Last January those fires removed much of the vegetation on really steep slopes, and that made those slopes really vulnerable to erosion during intense rainfall. That protective blanket of vegetation is gone, and heavy rain can rapidly make a flash flood. And that flood, in some cases, can pick up material and turn into what we call a debris flow — which is like a flood on steroids.

These burn areas are still vulnerable, even though it’s now many months after the fire and there have been flows already. There’s still plenty of material that could be mobilized. So the threat’s still there. And so we know they’re bad actors, and we’re concerned they could be bad actors again. 
I’m hearing a lot of different terms: mudslide, debris flows, landslide. What are the differences, and which ones are the burn scars at risk for? 
Landslide is an umbrella term that captures all kinds of mass movements, from rock falls to debris flows — these floods on steroids — to big, slow movers. The type of flow that we’re most concerned about in a recent burn area is a debris flow. It’s also called a mudslide. But geologists don’t like to use the word mudslide as much because it sounds like there’s some mud on your driveway — not a big issue, not something that could kill you. And these things, if you’re in the wrong spot at the wrong time, they can cause serious damage.
You called it a flood on steroids. What happens in a debris flow? 
Flash floods are bad, and they can cause lots of problems, too. They can get even worse if they pick up enough sediment to turn into the consistency of wet concrete. But it’s worse than just concrete, because it can contain boulders the size of cars. And, very close to the mountain front, it can move very quickly — faster than you can run. And when it gets all bulked up with debris, the rocks, the gravel, the mud, trees, the flow can be a lot bigger. It just turns into a different animal. 
Now, debris flows pack a bigger punch than floods, but thankfully, they don’t have as long of reach. So usually, the debris flows are confined really close to the mountain fronts. That’s where they put those debris basins to catch them. But if there isn’t one protection like that, then they can travel downslope and impact neighborhoods, and then flooding can extend even further down. 
Is there something about Southern California that makes it higher risk?
Southern California’s kind of the world capital for these kinds of events. It’s got this combination of very steep topography, like the San Gabriel Mountains that just shoot right up, Santa Monica mountains, Santa Ynez — very steep topography. It burns fairly frequently. And then there are a lot of people living very close to the mountain front, so that’s what puts the risk up. 
The thing about a burn area is it takes much less rainfall to cause a problem than it would in unburned conditions. So we’ve now made the slopes really vulnerable. They’re extra steep. There’s a lot of people there. That’s why the risk is so high. 
We’ve seen debris flows in Northern California burn areas as well. It’s not just a Southern California problem, and it’s not just a California problem. 
Is there anything that could have been done to reduce this risk? Anything that should be done now? 
Not long after the fires, in particular the Palisades Fire, (there were) a number of fairly widespread debris flows that disrupted the roads. There were also, in the Eaton fire, floods and debris flows there. Thankfully there’s a dense network of LA County debris basins, which are designed to catch the material before it enters neighborhoods, and those largely saved the day. 
Planners have planned ahead and put in these debris basins — these big, giant holes in the ground — designed to catch the material. That’s the best defense against these. They’re not everywhere, but there is a good network of protection. Other than that, it’s really hard to stop these things. 
What should people who live near the recent burn scars know? What should they do now, as the rain starts? 
The best thing you could do is, if you’re really close to a drainage in one of these burn areas, is to get out of the way. You’re going to get a heads up from the National Weather Service, who’s closely monitoring the rainstorms. They know how much rain it’s going to take to cause a problem, and they’ll get out warnings, and local authorities will reach out to get people out of the way. So there’s a lot of eyes on the situation. And so at this point, the best thing to do is listen to the weather service, listen to local authorities. 
If they ask you to get out of the way, take their advice. These things can happen really fast if there is an intense burst of rain, a flash flood, where debris flow can start within minutes. 
So there is no escaping a debris flow once it starts? 
It’s pretty difficult. If you have a two-story home and you happen to be there at the wrong time, get up to that second floor for sure. Fight like heck if you get trapped in one. But best to be out of the way.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/021425-EatonFireMudslides-JAJ-10.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-14 18:58:27.084444

(Photo by Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas State Library Board approved disbursing $1.37 million in state aid to local and regional libraries on Friday with little discussion.
The board approves payments of state funds to libraries each quarter, and the amount approved Friday was for the second quarter of state fiscal year 2026. The state Department of Education had authorized payment of the first quarter in September, when members of the newly constituted board had not yet been confirmed by legislators and could not officially act.
The State Library operates independently under the umbrella of the education department, and the board’s primary responsibility is to disburse state funds to local public libraries.
The meeting marked the board’s second since Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ appointed them under Act 903 of 2025, which dissolved the previous seven-member board and required the governor to appoint new members. Sanders appointed six members in August and has yet to appoint the seventh.
The previous board had clashed with some lawmakers as well as one of its members, National Association of Christian Lawmakers founder and former state senator Jason Rapert, over withholding funds from libraries that do not restrict minors’ access to “sexually explicit” content.
The appointment of an entirely new board came after the previous board fought for more than a year over whether it should withhold funding from libraries that do not restrict minors’ access to “sexually explicit” content. Elected officials at the state and local levels have tried to regulate public library leadership, funding and content for the past few years.
At Friday’s meeting, board member and former state lawmaker Jack Fortner of Yellville asked whether criteria other than population could be used to determine how much money individual libraries can receive. The state funds currently are apportioned based on the population served by a library.
Saying he thought some smaller, rural libraries are used more often than those serving larger populations, Fortner asked whether data on library usage might help provide more funds for libraries serving fewer people.
State Librarian Jennifer Chilcoat replied that such data might be available and said she’d have staff try to gather it.
Most of the remainder of the board meeting was spent hearing reports from various State Library department heads and a presentation from education department attorney Daniel Shults on state laws affecting the board and its duties.

The casino knew for years  that gambler Mathew Bowyer, an illegal bookmaker from California, lacked a source of funds to support his vociferous appetite for gambling.   
Bowyer, best known for taking sports bets from baseball star Shohei Ohtani’s interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara, who stole millions of dollars from Ohtani, gambled for years at Caesars Palace, despite the hotel’s knowledge that he lacked the income to support his gambling. 
He is currently in prison serving a 20-month sentence for bookmaking and money laundering.
Bowyer was a patron at Caesars Palace from before 2017 until January 2024, the complaint says. The company and its subsidiaries identified “suspicions” about Bowyer as early as 2017, such as his lack of an apparent source of funds. Multiple due diligence checks by the casino revealed Bowyer did not have a source of funds to support his play. 
In 2017, Bowyer made front money deposits of more than $4 million on multiple visits to Caesars Palace. The same year, the casino noted “source of funds/employment could not be determined for Bowyer.” 
The casino received an anonymous call in June 2019, in which the caller identified Bowyer as a “bookie.” The same month, Caesars deemed Bowyer to be “high risk” and once again was unable to verify his source of funds. His play was “elevated” to a Caesars anti-money laundering  because of his “lack of occupation/source of wealth” and “over $2 million in actual loss over the last 12 months.”
The next month, Caesars suspended Bowyer’s account. Bowyer, in response, presented his 2018 tax return to the hotel, which did not lift the suspension. He then provided a statement indicating winnings of just under $3 million from the Cosmopolitan in 2018, and Caesars lifted its suspension of his account. 
In November 2020, the casino again noted Bowyer’s high risk status based on “undetermined/unverifiable” income. 
In May 2021, the casino again noted Bowyer was high risk because of “undetermined current income level” and a “314b request,” a financial form affiliated with the U.S. Patriot Act. 
Caesars suspended Bowyer’s account again in July 2021, noting he may be a bookie. Bowyer, the complaint says, provided tax returns for 2019 and 2020, resulting in the lifting of his suspension in September 2021.
The casinos reported “no revenue found” for three of Bowyer’s businesses in 2022. 
Finally in 2024, he was banned. The company was aware since 2017 that two other casinos had banned the gambler. 
The complaint says Caesars only banned Bowyer in 2024 after news reports surfaced that his Orange County home had been raided by federal agents investigating gambling by unsavory characters in Las Vegas casinos. The Current was first to report Bowyer’s home had been raided in October of 2023.  
“Media outlets reported extensively on Bowyer, including his activities in Las Vegas casinos, his operation of an illegal bookmaking business, and his money laundering activities,” the complaint says. 
Caesars is the second resort company disciplined by the GCB for taking Bowyer’s action. 
Resorts World agreed to a $10.5 million fine earlier this year. 
The GCB is investigating Foutainebleau, where Bowyer gambled, as well.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2211848134-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-14 18:58:27.084444

In the Linn County case, the Iowa Board of Pharmacy alleges that on Dec. 24, 2024, a 22-month-old child was prescribed antibiotics to treat pneumonia. A pharmacy technician at the CVS Pharmacy in Marion allegedly gave the child’s mother azithromycin tablets instead of a liquid and failed to provide counseling on use of the medication. The tablets were subsequently returned when the mother discovered the error, according to the board.
The CVS Pharmacy was charged by the board with failing to provide pharmacist counseling upon receipt of a new prescription drug order; failing to review records to identify any issues such as incorrect drug dosages; and dispensing an incorrect prescription.

In order to resolve the matter, the CVS Pharmacy and the board agreed to settlement that calls for the pharmacy to accept a warning and pay a civil penalty of $5,000.
In addition, the pharmacy must also implement a training and remediation plan, specifically with regard to pediatric dosing and milligram/kilogram dosing and the maintenance of a “proper computerized system protocol” that has the capability to catch errors. Pharmacists will be required to double-check the system to ensure errors do not occur.
Board settles case with Fairfield pharmacy
In the Jefferson County case, the Board of Pharmacy charged Summit Pharmacy of Fairfield with willful or gross negligence, alleging that over the previous several years, many controlled substances had been diverted from the pharmacy’s inventory for the personal use of the pharmacist owner at the time.
Since the initial investigation of that matter, Summit Pharmacy has changed ownership and, according to the board, has “embraced changes” to come into compliance with pharmacy regulations. The pharmacy and the board agreed to resolve the charge of willful or gross negligence with a warning.
The board records do not identify the pharmacy’s current owner.
Board records indicate the former owner, Bryan Vander Linden, admitted in 2024 that he had intentionally diverted controlled substances “for personal use” over the course of six years while working at a Hy-Vee pharmacy in Fairfield.
According to the board, Vander Linden’s admission came about after federal agents with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration launched an investigation into some form of unspecified “discrepancies” at Summit Pharmacy.
The board charged Vander Linden with knowingly making misleading or untrue statements in the practice of pharmacy; habitual intoxication or addiction to drugs; being convicted of a state or federal law related to drugs or the practice of pharmacy; stealing prescription drugs from a pharmacy for one’s personal use; and practicing pharmacy while under the influence of illegally obtained drugs or while impaired by legitimately prescribed drugs.
Vander Linden’s license was suspended last year when he signed an agreement to refrain from practicing. Earlier this year, the board agreed to settle the charges, in part by lifting the May 2024 license suspension and allowing Vander Linden to “return to practicing as a pharmacist at Summit Pharmacy.”
The settlement also stipulated that Vander Linden must pay a $500 civil penalty and participate in the state’s Impaired Practitioners’ Health Program for Pharmacy and submit to any required drug screenings.
As a result of the DEA investigation, Vander Linden was criminally charged last year with acquiring controlled substances through fraud, deception or misrepresentation. Prosecutors alleged he stole 3,800 doses of Oxycodone, 1,001 doses of Hydrocodone, and 428 doses of Carisoprodol.
Earlier this year, he was convicted of the charged offense and sentenced to four years of probation and fined $9,500.

(Photo by Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas Division of Environmental Quality revived its Natural State Stewardship Program (NSTEP) after a brief hiatus Thursday, inducting a Fort Smith motor factory into the program for its commitments to reduce emissions.
ABB Inc. manufactures electric motors for everything from conveyor belts to solar panels and was inducted into NSTEP’s diamond tier this past summer, but its addition to the program’s ranks was not announced until this week.
The NSTEP program started in 2019 to incentivize environmental stewardship, according to DEQ. Those who commit to voluntarily reducing their emissions, completing energy efficiency projects or other environmentally friendly initiatives can be inducted into one of the program’s three tiers. Members can be considered for perks such as expedited technical assistance for permit renewals or modifications, reduced reporting requirements or advance notice of inspections “on a case-by-case basis,” according to the programs handbook.
Prior to this year, the program had four inductees — Dassault Falcon Jet and Pratt and Whitney, both in the aviation industry; the Arkansas Department of the Military; and ECCI, an engineering and environmental consulting firm. But until this year, the last induction into the program happened in 2022.
To be inducted into NSTEP, companies have to meet permit compliance and “beyond compliance” requirements. Facilities that had “serious violations” of their DEQ-issued permits within a year of applying for the program are not eligible, nor are facilities that have been convicted of law violations or have entered into out-of-court settlements within three years.
The additional, “beyond compliance” requirements vary by the tier a facility applies for. For the diamond tier, the highest tier, a facility has to commit to completing two environmental stewardship projects within a three-year period. At least one of the projects has to be community-based, and at least one “must demonstrate an improvement of performance of either the facility, its activities, products, or services.”
As part of its induction into the program, ABB committed to significantly reducing emissions from its Fort Smith manufacturing facility. It plans to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, “a central element of its stewardship,” a press release from DEQ said.
ABB will also reduce Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions by 90%. Scope 3 emissions are indirect emissions from sources not directly controlled or owned by ABB, such as employee travel and contracted waste disposal.
The company’s local initiative is a garden project with a nearby Boys and Girls Club to teach hands-on gardening skills and reduce food waste.
“What makes this recognition meaningful is not just the title, but the measurable, ambitious commitments behind it,” Department of Energy and Environment Secretary Shane Khoury said at the induction ceremony at ABB’s Fort Smith manufacturing plant. “These are not just abstract goals. They are measurable, time-bound actions that reflect true leadership and responsible stewardship.”",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_5944-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-14 17:57:28.412675

Shelley Hughes, R-Palmer, resigned from the Alaska Senate on Friday to pursue her gubernatorial candidacy, according to a news release from her campaign.
Her resignation follows that of fellow Senate minority caucus member Mike Shower, who represented Wasilla and resigned at the end of last month to focus on his run for lieutenant governor.
Senate President Gary Stevens, R-Kodiak, confirmed he received Hughes’ resignation letter Friday.
Hughes’ resignation was expected. She told the Alaska Beacon in October she planned to resign in time for her replacement to be in place before the legislative session begins in January.
“My constituents, they’ve been my peeps all these years. I want to make sure that they have representation from the get-go,” she said on Friday afternoon.
Gov. Mike Dunleavy will select her replacement from among a number of nominees to be selected by Republican party officials in her district. Republican Senators must confirm his choice before that person is seated.
Hughes’ replacement must be a Republican and meet the state Constitution’s requirements to hold office.
Hughes said she expects that Rep. Cathy Tilton, R-Wasilla, will be among the nominees for her seat because Tilton has already filed to run for senator in the district. If Tilton were appointed, the governor would then have to select someone to fill the empty House seat.
Hughes was initially appointed to her seat in 2012 by then-Gov. Sean Parnell, which she credits, in part, to the fact that she was already running.
“I think that when a candidate does that, that shows real interest,” she said.
She said she does not expect her departure to cause significant changes because her district reliably produces “reasonable conservative” lawmakers.
Hughes is one of 12 Republicans and 14 total candidates that seek to be elected governor in 2026. Gov. Mike Dunleavy is termed out and cannot seek reelection.
Hughes said she has fond memories of her time in the Capitol.
“It’s a big change, stepping into the gubernatorial race,” she said. “You know, there are unknowns with that, but I have tremendous peace about this. I really did feel that my chapter was closing in the Senate.”
She represented her district for 12 years.

As of Thursday, between 140 and 180 members of the Guard were patrolling the streets of Memphis on orders from Gov. Bill Lee, according to Theresa Carlson, a Memphis Police Department spokesperson. 
“Over the next few days, we anticipate the total presence will increase to roughly 350,” Carlson wrote in an emailed statement. “These men and women are working in the community, serving as additional eyes and ears to support law enforcement.”
The Guard personnel are among more than 1,000 state and federal law enforcement officers deployed to one of the nation’s largest majority Black cities as part of the Trump administration-convened Memphis Safe Task Force.
Judge mulls arguments over deploying Tennessee National Guard to Memphis

Late Friday, lawyers representing Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris and other elected officials who originally challenged the Guard’s presence filed court papers highlighting the need for the court’s urgent intervention. 
“The upscaling of Governor Lee’s arbitrary and unlawful deployment exacerbates ongoing irreparable injuries to the Plaintiffs and their communities,” the lawyers wrote. 
“The expanding scope of this indefinite military occupation underscores the urgent need for injunctive relief,” they wrote.
Davidson County Chancellor Patricia Moskal has been weighing the request for a temporary injunction to halt the Guard’s activities in Memphis since she held a court hearing in the case on Nov. 5. 
Stockard on the Stump: National Guard could roam Memphis streets for a year

Harris, two state representatives, a state senator and members of the Shelby County Board of Commissioners and Memphis City Council originally filed suit on Oct. 17 seeking to oust the guard, arguing Lee’s deployment of the men and women to Memphis to combat crime and illegal immigration violates the Tennessee constitution and state law. 
The Tennessee Constitution permits the Guard only in “circumstances amounting to a rebellion or invasion,” they argued. “Even then, the legislature must declare, by law, that the public safety requires it.”
The lawsuit also cites state law that entrusts local officials with the authority to determine whether there has been a breakdown in law and order requiring the presence of the guard. 
Guardsmen have been deployed to the city since Oct. 10. Agents with state and federal law enforcement agencies — among them the Tennessee Highway Patrol, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Homeland Security — have conducted traffic stops and made arrests in support of the effort.

Legislators say they will remember Eklund for his mentorship, kind spirit and thoughtful approach to lawmaking. 
The post Wyoming Rep. John Eklund dies appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming State Rep. John Eklund, a Laramie County Republican and rancher, died Friday after a battle with cancer. He was 74. 
First elected to the House in 2011, Eklund focused much of his tenure on agricultural issues and water policy. His colleagues told WyoFile they’ll remember him for his mentorship, kind spirit and his thoughtful approach to lawmaking. 
“John Eklund was one of the finest people I have ever known,” said former Speaker of the House Albert Sommers, who served alongside Eklund for 11 years. “It was an honor to serve with someone who had his incredible heart and integrity.”
Gov. Mark Gordon ordered the Wyoming State Flag to remain at half-staff at the Capitol and in Laramie County until sunset on the date of Eklund’s internment. It was already at half-staff in honor of former Vice President Dick Cheney, who died Nov. 3.
“Wyoming has lost a dedicated public servant, a steadfast advocate for agriculture, and a man whose kindness touched everyone who had the privilege to know him,” Gordon said in a statement. “Jennie and I hold his wife, Suzi, and the entire Eklund family close in our thoughts and prayers during this difficult time.” 
Eklund “brought a steady hand, a gentle spirit, and a deep commitment to Wyoming’s agricultural community, work that earned him respect on both sides of the aisle,” Gordon said. 
That respect included Laramie Democrat Rep. Karlee Provenza, who served with Eklund on the House Agriculture, State and Public Lands and Water Resources Committee. 
“There was never a doubt in anyone’s mind that John Eklund cared deeply for the people of Wyoming and his district,” Provenza told WyoFile. “He led with his heart and treated everyone with compassion and kindness despite any contention our chamber was grappling with. I will miss his calming and loving presence and think about him often.” 
Jackson Democrat Mike Yin said, “it’s going to be hard for Laramie County to replace him,” and “I am thinking about Suzi and their family during this time.”
In the 2025 general session, Eklund co-sponsored successful bills to limit eminent domain for energy collector systems, to bolster private landowners’ rights to build fencing along state land and to create easements for local roads on state lands. 
He also brought legislation earlier this year to support veterans, including a bill to update the Wyoming Veterans Memorial Museum in Casper and to build a new veterans’ home in Buffalo.

Eklund chaired several committees throughout his time in the Legislature, including the House Agriculture Committee, Select Water Committee, as well as the House Transportation, Highways and Military Affairs Committee. 
During its Friday meeting in Cheyenne, the Joint Education Committee took time to reflect on Eklund’s service to the state. 
Eklund and Sen. Chris Rothfuss, D-Laramie, were part of the same freshmen class of lawmakers in 2011. 
“So I’ve served with him my entire time I’ve served in the Legislature,” Rothfuss told the committee. “He was such an incredibly positive, kind, friendly, supportive person that really thought highly of the Wyoming Legislature, the institution. And so he served with class and with honor and certainly with endless hard work.”
“John was kind of a mentor to me, a great encourager in my first term,” Rep. Martha Lawley, R-Worland, told the committee. 
“He cared about new legislators, and he was willing to step in if you were open and receive that encouragement, guidance, those kinds of things. So it’s a loss, and we need more men and women like him in the Legislature,” she said.
Rep. Bob Davis, R-Baggs, told WyoFile he also benefited from Eklund’s mentorship. The two had first met about a decade earlier when Davis was a conservation district representative. 
“But then it was really unique when I got elected as a representative. John was there to greet me as a freshman,” Davis said. “And he helped me, showed me the path in the House, and what to look for and things like that. His insight was tremendously helpful to me.”
Speaker of the House Chip Neiman, R-Hulett, said that he admired Eklund for his kindness and his devotion to his community — as was shown, Neiman said, by his district’s decision to have him represent them for so many years. 
“I think he did a wonderful job of trying to be very fair, and really kept his constituents, I believe, at the forefront of his mind,” Neiman told WyoFile
The Wyoming Republican Party, the Wyoming Freedom Caucus and Secretary of State Chuck Gray also issued statements of remembrance. 
Long before he was a legislator, Eklund grew up in Albin, where he was boyhood friends with former lawmaker Dan Kirkbride. The two played sports and did FFA together. 
“He was just one of your nice friends from a good, rural family growing up,” Kirkbride told WyoFile. “And that’s who he was, and then he became all of that when he was an adult.”
As a lawmaker, Kirkbride said, “for him, it wasn’t war. It was an opportunity to serve.” 
“His family should be very proud of the man that he was,” Kirbride said. “I’m sure that they are.”
(Disclosure: Kirkbride serves on WyoFile’s board, which does not have authority to direct news coverage or news content.)
Sen. Barry Crago, R-Buffalo, served with Eklund when he was in the House. The two ranchers would go on to become family friends. 
“He was the epitome of a family man,” Crago said, adding that Eklund would travel all across the state to watch his grandkids run track and play sports. 
“He was just a great human being,” Crago said. “It’s a huge loss for the Legislature. Huge loss for the state. We were lucky to have him while we did.”

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)In the first days of the federal government shutdown, North Carolina officials were wary of an already extensive recovery from Hurricane Helene hitting even more obstacles.
Over 43 days, the longest shutdown in history, state leaders rushed to prevent key federal programs from lapsing and ensure that rebuilding in the mountains could continue, even as Washington stood still.
Now, with the shutdown in the rearview mirror and federal workers back on the clock, North Carolina appears to have avoided any major stumbling blocks in hurricane recovery.
“Time is of the essence, always, with recovery,” Matt Calabria, who leads Gov. Josh Stein’s recovery office for western North Carolina, told reporters Friday. “So delays in getting reimbursements are material, to local governments in particular. But a lot of the broader … concerns that we had we’ve worked really hard to figure out how to avoid.”
Two programs paid for with federal dollars were set to lapse during the shutdown: one that provided crisis counseling, and another to hire displaced workers for recovery-related jobs. Both have since been extended.
U.S. Department of Agriculture county offices are reopening across the state. And the U.S. Department of Housing & Urban Development, which oversees a $1.4 billion pool of money to rebuild homes destroyed by the storm, is back to full capacity after weeks of skeleton staffing.
North Carolina officials have not been able to use that HUD money, but have been able to lean on a separate bundle of state dollars to keep their homebuilding program, Renew NC, running.
“Our folks estimate that has cut months off the clock,” said Calabria.

While the state has managed to tread water during the shutdown, many local governments are struggling to stay afloat.
The already laborious process to get paid back for rebuilding costs slowed to a crawl during the shutdown, leaving cash-strapped communities desperate for repayment. FEMA assistance continues to flow — the agency announced $155 million in aid last week — but bureaucratic hurdles are frustrating local officials.
Kevin Leonard, executive director of the North Carolina Association of County Commissioners, said the federal repayment process had effectively created a “recovery gap.”
“Accountability should not become red tape,” Leonard told state leaders during a meeting of the governor’s advisory committee on Helene recovery. “It’s resulting in major cash flow strains across our cities and counties.”
Local governments would benefit, he said, from waivers that would allow them to bypass reviews for routine payments like debris cleanup. DHS requires any payment over $100,000 to be signed off on by Secretary Kristi Noem and be cleared by the Department of Government Efficiency. Leonard says that’s leading to longer waits.
Ryan Cody, the town administrator for Marshall in Madison County, said Friday it was “really frustrating” to navigate the extensive reimbursement justification process when the results are already tangible — in the form of parks, sidewalks and a water treatment plant. He asked state officials to search for solutions to get money “directly appropriated” so projects wouldn’t face further delays.
“We have advocated for not having to jump through those additional hoops,” Calabria said, emphasizing that conversations with federal officials are ongoing.
A flurry of deadlines are approaching for local leaders and groups to apply for more funding. Over the next two months, applications are due for local government capital grants, recreation projects, broadband repairs and volunteer-led rebuild grants.
And the state’s most expansive program — single-family home rebuilding and repairs — stops accepting applications at the end of the year. As of Friday afternoon, the program has almost 4,700 active applications, according to state data.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_3427-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-14 17:57:28.412675

More than half of the University of Alaska system schools attend UAA or one of its satellite campuses. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The University of Alaska is anticipating an increase of up to 10% for health care costs this fiscal year, on par with what employers are anticipating nationally, according to officials presenting to the Board of Regents at their meeting on Nov. 6. 
Nikole Conley, chief of human resources for the university system, gave a presentation outlining the university system’s health care costs so far, and projections for the rest of this fiscal year, ending in July 2026. Her presentation included medical, dental and pharmacy care. 
“We do see health care costs across the nation going up and increasing, and we’re not necessarily expecting this to decline anytime soon,” she said.
The university is projecting 8% to 10% overall cost increases across the system for this fiscal year. That means health coverage for 3,442 employees is estimated to cost $85.5 million.     

A screenshot from a University of Alaska presentation on health care costs on Nov. 6, 2025, shows a rise in costs in recent years.
 

“​​We are seeing trend increases of 8% for medical, 13% for pharmacy and 4% for dental. We’ll do another recast in January of 2026 and hopefully try to firm up that figure and what that’s going to look like,” Conley said. 
Nationally, employers are expecting an 8.5% increase in medical costs and an 11% increase in pharmacy costs, she said, so the university’s costs and projections are mirroring that trend. 
Health care costs in Alaska are among the highest in the nation, according to state data. Since 2023, the average cost of a health insurance marketplace plan in Alaska rose by more than 16% each year. In 2023 alone, the cost went up by an average of 18.4%.
The university has a cost split for health care with 18% paid by employees in premiums, and 82% paid by the universities. Conley presented total cost projections to the board. 
Conley said the number of university employees isn’t growing, but more people are opting into the university’s health care plan. She said system-wide the largest cost increase is in pharmacy claims, but her department is expecting to renegotiate pharmacy costs, which could save the university about $3 million. 
Last year, the university saw pharmacy spending increase 11.2% from the year before. Over the last five years, overall pharmacy costs more than doubled from $9.2 million to $19.2 million, she said.
Conley said that’s partly due to a rise in prescriptions for drugs used for weight loss and to treat diabetes, known as GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic. They were the second highest pharmacy claim within the university’s plan, totaling $4.1 million last fiscal year.
“We’re also looking at the potential elimination of GLP-1s, because they are a major cost driver for us,” she added.
University of Alaska Regent Karen Perdue pushed back against that idea, pointing out that weight loss can also improve employees’ health outcomes and result in less health care costs. “It’s not just a plus, there can be a minus on the bottom line as well,” she said.     

A screenshot from a University of Alaska presentation on health care costs on Nov. 6, 2025 shows the highest claims for medical and pharmacy care
 

University of Alaska President Pat Pitney also pointed out other high pharmacy costs last year. The largest costs were on inflammatory diseases, with the highest cost at $4.3 million, and cancer treatments at $1.3 million.
The highest medical costs for the university last fiscal year were for muscle, joint and bone claims at $10.7 million, followed by cancer at $7 million, and behavioral health and disorder treatments at $5.3 million.
Last year, the university’s total costs came in at $80.1 million, which was $1.1 million over the university’s projection. Conley said next year’s premiums will go up to recover those costs. 
Conley said her department is working to push more education and use of wellness programs and preventative health care.
“Not only are we seeing this growth of 8% to 10% in cost, but we’re also seeing less use, for some reason, of our preventative health care. And so we’re really trying to encourage folks to use preventative health care, because that will help minimize some of our costs in the future,” she said. 
According to university data presented by Conley, only half of health care participants used preventative screenings, like annual physical exams or checkups; nearly 38% of emergency room visits could have been avoided with better primary care or urgent care use; and 38% of participants are categorized as pre-obese or obese. 
The university is insured through Premera Blue Cross, and Conley said her department discusses health care plan changes with the university’s Joint Health Care Committee, an advisory committee made up of representatives from the faculty union, management and staff. 
The university is also expecting a health care rebate, which is a benefit paid back to employees if they utilize the prevention programs throughout the year, like cancer screenings, dental care, and regular check ups. 
“We’re estimating about a $1.5 million rebate,” Conley said, for this year, ending in July 2026. “We’re going to see up to a $2.5 million rebate increase in FY27 with new rates. So that’s a good positive.”
The debate around national health care, federal tax credits, and costs for Americans has been at the heart of bitter negotiations around ending the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. This week, the U.S Congress approved a stopgap spending bill ending the shutdown. Democrats have introduced a discharge petition to force a vote to extend tax credits for three years under the Affordable Care Act. White the Senate Majority leader has promised a vote by the end of the year, leaders of the Republican-majority House have remained opposed, and discussions on health care are ongoing.

Kim Reynolds and Iowa State University President Wendy Wintersteen celebrated the expansion of bioindustrial manufacturing in Iowa as they joined executives of BioMADE at the ISU BioCentury Research Farm Friday for a groundbreaking ceremony.
The event celebrated the kickoff of the $40 million project to bring BioMADE, a Manufacturing Innovation Institute backed by the U.S. Department of War, to the ISU facility. The Iowa facility was funded using $10 million from the Iowa Economic Development Authority, $10 million from ISU and $20 million from BioMADE, in addition to receiving support from the U.S. Department of War.
The site, which measures 15,000 square feet, will be a pilot-scale biomanufacturing plant in Boone, designed to support the development and research of bioindustrial products to bring them to commercial and defense markets. The project includes plans to expand the ISU’s fermentation facilities, with 5,000 and 10,000-liter industrial fermenters, as well as lab space and downstream processing capabilities, for businesses to use to test products before deciding whether to move ahead with investing in their own manufacturing facilities for a product.
Reynolds said that nearly a year prior to the event ISU and BioMADE leaders visited her office to showcase their vision for the project.
“It was a bold, practical plan to bring together Iowa’s strengths in agriculture, research and manufacturing to build something truly transformative — and what an incredible moment it is to see all of that take shape today,” Reynolds said. “Today’s milestone is a reflection of the power of partnerships and the potential that it creates when government, industry and academia work side by side.”
Reynolds said Iowa and ISU in particular are a great fit for the project, as the university is already a leader on biomanufacturing, production and research, saying “the type of expertise and infrastructure that’s needed already exists” for BioMADE’s goals at the ISU BioCentury Research Farm.
“This new pilot (and) scaled-up facility helps complete Iowa’s biomanufacturing ecosystem,” Reynolds said. “It will take the discoveries from the lab and scale them into real world applications, accelerating American research and development, creating great new jobs and ensuring that breakthroughs developed in this country are made in this country.”
BioMADE CEO Douglas Friedman said that alongside the Iowa facility, the organization has also launched similar pilot projects in California and Minnesota with different production capacities and equipment, filling “a critical gap” in pilot and demonstration infrastructure, allowing for businesses to experiment with different products and materials throughout the country.
Wintersteen said much of the work already being done by researchers and faculty at the ISU facility is already focused on “identifying and fulfilling the critical gaps” in bringing products to market in bioindustrial fields, and that there will be opportunities for collaboration between the university and BioMADE.
“It will also serve as a hub for hands-on training and workforce development, preparing the next generation of bio-processing engineers and scientists,” Wintersteen said. “So we’re excited about what’s going to happen here, and the faculty that will be working here, and their efforts and efforts of many others that will produce key breakthroughs in bio-manufacturing.”
Friedman also said these pilot projects are crucial for “leading the way to more bio-based products being manufactured right here in America.” In Iowa, there will be a specific focus on food-grade capabilities — “ingredients like prebiotics, probiotics, sweeteners, flavors,” he said.
“We’ll be able to tie into the robust biomanufacturing ecosystem that is already present here in Iowa,” Friedman said.
Friedman also praised state government and ISU leaders for allowing the project to move forward quickly, “at a speed that makes sense in this era of global competition.” The facility is scheduled to open in 2027.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/biomade2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-14 17:57:28.412675

Jeff Landry has established a new government efficiency task force to look at ways to cut state government spending.  (Hilary Scheinuk/The Advocate, Pool)A task force Gov. Jeff Landry assembled is recommending that Louisiana’s colleges and universities join six other university systems from Southern states in a new conservative accrediting body. 
The governor’s Task Force on Public Higher Education Reform voted Thursday to request the Board of Regents, which oversees higher education in the state, ask for state money to pursue membership and a board seat on the Commission for Public Higher Education
The alternative accreditor is being formed by state university systems in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. Accreditors are necessary to ensure schools meet minimum educational standards. 
The task force did not provide public notice of its meeting, which is a violation of the state’s Open Meetings Law. The statute requires all public bodies to take basic steps to ensure the public’s right to observe government proceedings. The Illuminator, which had requested notice to be sent, only learned of the meeting after it occurred when an attendee shared a copy of its recommendations. 
Louisiana’s move to change accreditors comes as conservatives have sparred with the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges, which evaluates colleges and universities in Louisiana, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia. 
Conservative politicians have taken issue with traditional accreditors at times because of their standards related to diversity, equity and inclusion. They also require safeguards that are intended to limit the influence of external forces, including politicians, in public higher education. 
The Southern Association does not require any DEI measures on its members’ campuses.
The Commission for Public Higher Education is seeking expedited recognition from the U.S. Department of Education, which is required for any school it approves to receive federal financial aid. 
The task force also recommended state legislation that would allow colleges and universities in Louisiana to be accredited by any group with the U.S. Department of Education’s recognition. The governor’s panel also recommended the removal of all references to the Southern Association from state law and higher education policy. 
Landry’s task force is also seeking legislation to prohibit any accreditor from having required standards that would violate state law. Legislators have previously filed legislation that conflicts with accrediting standards, but typically scale back or pull the bills once they are made aware they could risk universities’ accreditation status. 
In 2024, a bill that would have given the governor the power to directly hire university system presidents was significantly rolled back after good governance groups voiced concerns it would risk violating standards that prohibit undue external influence on universities. 
Task force members also recommended legislation to require schools post on their websites any documentation they submit to their accreditors to gain or maintain approval. 
Every member of the task force has been directly appointed to their job by Landry or his conservative allies except two: Commissioner of Higher Education Kim Hunter Reed and Superintendent of Education Cade Brumley, who served as chairman. 
Besides Reed and Brumley, the other members are: 

 Misti Cordell, Board of Regents chairwoman
 Mark Romero, University of Louisiana System board chairman
 Scott Ballard, LSU System board chairman
 Tony Clayton, Southern University System board chairman
 Tim Hardy, Louisiana Community and Technical College System chairman 
 Sen. Rick Edmonds, R-Central, Senate Education Committee chairman
 Rep. Laurie Schlegel, R-Metairie, House Education Committee chairwoman 
 Wade Rousse, incoming LSU System president
Angelique Freel, Landry’s executive counsel
Taylor Barras, Commissioner of Administration

The number of people the Trinity food shelf serves in Windsor has grown by about a third over the last couple of months, according to Nan Pariseau, a church member who also serves as operations director.

This story by Liz Sauchelli was first published in the Valley News on Nov. 13, 2025.
WINDSOR — The federal shutdown ended late Wednesday night with a bill that extends the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP benefits, through the end of next September.
Even in spite of the restoration of these benefits, however, those who use SNAP and those who work to address food insecurity in the Upper Valley remain concerned about the program’s future.
“There’s a lot of uncertainty,” Maria Rogers, who, to supplement her SNAP benefits, uses and volunteers at the food pantry at Trinity Free Evangelical Church in downtown Windsor. “Not just a little. A lot.”
Rogers and others interviewed this week before the shutdown ended said that their concerns would persist even after the shutdown ended.
When the shutdown started on Oct. 1, the federal government paused SNAP payments for Rogers and millions of others who receive the monthly benefit. States tried to make up the difference, but the uncertainty and lack of payments led to growing food insecurity for residents.
Each month, when Rogers, a 65-year-old Windsor resident, gets $166 from SNAP, she starts looking at what area grocery stores have on sale. Then, she asks herself a question: “Is the gas worth it?”
Brenda Egbert, of Fairlee, supplements her grocery shopping with produce and other items from the food pantry at at the Orford Congregational Church, which is run by the organization Orford Cares and the Orford, N.H., Democratic Committee on Tuesday, Nov. 11. This year an average of more than 40 people each week visit the pantry to pick up non-perishable food donated by community members or purchased with donated funds, and produce provided by Willing Hands. “It definitely makes a dent in the grocery bill,” said Egbert.

This month that math was harder to do because of the delay in SNAP benefits. Rogers received half — $83 — from the state of Vermont on Nov. 7, but she had yet to receive the remainder. (A Vermont official told lawmakers on Thursday that a full month’s benefits were set to go to recipients on Friday via Electronic Benefit Transfer cards, though the process could take until Monday for direct deposit into bank accounts.)
Rogers and her husband are both disabled. She has also volunteered and cooked meals for Upper Valley food pantries for close to 40 years.
“Oh no,” Rogers, of Windsor, said when asked if the money covers her monthly grocery bills. “Especially if you get meat, that barely covers for a month.”
The number of families the Trinity food shelf serves in Windsor has grown by about a third over the last couple of months, said Nan Pariseau, a church member who also serves as operations director for the food shelf.
“We’ve been expecting it,” Pariseau, 56, of Claremont, said during an interview at the food pantry. “We’ve been preparing for it.”
Fall and the upcoming holiday season are typically busy for food pantries. The colder temperatures and shorter days mean fuel and electricity costs rise. Children are home from school for vacations and families are trying to create special holiday memories. Even with SNAP benefits fully restored, those other stressors do not go away, Pariseau said. “It’s a storm brewing,” she said.
The Trinity food pantry is averaging 52 families per week. Usually the number is around 34 families per week, with more showing up toward the end of the month as SNAP benefits run low. Many of the new patrons are older adults with one- or two-person households and families with more than five people. “Those are the ones that are really struggling,” Pariseau said.
The Trinity food pantry spends around $2,500 a month on food and is projected to spend about 15% more than that this month, Pariseau said.

She has been applying for more grants, in addition to working with other community groups and food pantries. She and food pantry volunteers are also working to spread the word that Trinity’s doors are open for anyone in need. “The biggest barrier we have is shame,” Pariseau said. She noted that she used SNAP herself years ago while she was raising three children and going through a divorce.
Shame shouldn’t be a barrier, said Shawn Dennett, a Windsor resident and single father of two children, ages 11 and 9, who volunteers at the Trinity food pantry. He uses SNAP to help feed his children. “How am I going to do this?” was his first thought Dennett, 38, said when the shutdown started. “I told my kids that whatever is in the apartment, you guys have at it.”
When his children asked him what he would do, he said he’d manage. He and his family got $287 in SNAP benefits on Nov. 7, half of their usual allotment, and are making it work, including by using the food pantry.
“It’s scary,” he said about the uncertainty surrounding SNAP. “After this shutdown … even if it does get lifted, going forward, what’s going to happen?”
Dennett works as a landscaper during the warmer months, but the jobs dry up as it gets colder. He also wants to be able to spend time with his children, including being home when they get home from school and to cook dinner for them every night.
Pasta dishes are a hit and his 11-year-old son is a fan of T-bone steak. Some nights, when he’s too tired to cook or had a rough day at work, the kids get microwavable Chef Boyardee ravioli cups as a treat. Meat takes up the biggest share of the budget, Dennett said, and he’s noticed costs are rising. He noted that eggs and dairy products have also gone up in price.
“SNAP is out there to help families,” he said.
Food pantries are too. Dennett is a member of Trinity Evangelical Free Church. “I was a little wary at first” to use the food pantry, but thinks differently now. “Nobody needs to go hungry,” he said.

Many patrons are older and some struggle to prepare meals for themselves. Others are working multiple jobs while caring for family members and don’t have the time.
“A lot of people want prepared food,” Rogers said. She cooks using items donated or purchased by the food pantry. Beef Stroganoff, spaghetti with sauce, macaroni and cheese and salmon pea wiggle are among the more popular dishes. The food shelf prepares meals that are portioned out that people can then take home to heat up later.
Patrons who liked a dish often ask for the recipe. Sometimes, Rogers will teach them how to cook it in Trinity’s kitchen.
Each year, the food pantry puts together 65 Thanksgiving baskets — filled with all the fixings for a Thanksgiving meal — and as of Wednesday had 91 families signed up, with the Nov. 14 deadline a few days away. Panty staff are currently working on figuring out how to get turkeys, which cost around $15 each, for each of the baskets.
“We are digging deep,” Pariseau said.

The community is as well. The food pantry has seen an influx in donations. There are some products that are harder to come by and more expensive that patrons need, including gluten-free items. Many of the older patrons are coping with health challenges and need low-sodium and sugar-free options. There’s also a need for canned fruit and cooking oils.
“They really need more fruits and vegetables in their lives but if they can’t afford it, they should come here and get it,” said Ginny Barr, 75, of Reading, a longtime food pantry volunteer. She noted that there are no barriers to getting help: the food pantry does not ask patrons for income information or other proof that they’re in need.
“They’re here for a reason,” Barr said at the food pantry. “They’ve got their reasons. We don’t have [to] know their reasons. We just serve them.”
Even before the shutdown, other Upper Valley food pantries were experiencing similar increases: In the last year, the Upper Valley Haven has seen a 20% increase in patrons, said Jennifer Fontaine, director of operations at the White River Junction-based nonprofit organization. “In October 2025 alone, there were 2,099 visits — a 16% increase over September’s numbers, continuing a steady rise that began in August,” she wrote in an email.
The Haven saw 108 new households in October and another 103 households who hadn’t stopped by in more than a year — “[c]lear signs that many neighbors are still struggling with high costs and ongoing financial strain,” Fontaine wrote.
To meet patrons increased needs, the Haven ran a fundraising campaign. Food donations are still needed, including items such as cooking oils, spices, baking supplies, shelf-stable milk and jams or jellies. “Many individuals and groups have reached out to host food drives or volunteer, and we hope that enthusiasm continues even when the government reopens and SNAP benefits resume,” Fontaine wrote. “With food and consumer costs remaining high, the need for assistance will still be there.”

(Photo via Providence Warwick CVB)A proposed $300-per-tenant annual fee for landlords who provide student-only housing drew strong reactions during a public hearing before a Providence City Council committee Thursday night, mostly from opponents.
In June 2025, Councilors Shelley Peterson and John Goncalves introduced the proposal to amend the city’s housing laws and allow for the fee for owners of off-campus buildings rented solely to college students. Noncompliant landlords could face fines of up to $500 a day. The ordinance would require the city’s colleges and universities to supply lists of students living off campus. 
There was no vote at Thursday’s meeting of the Committee on Ordinances, which was held expressly for committee members to hear residents’ thoughts on the proposed “student impact fee.” In her opening remarks, Peterson acknowledged her proposal was controversial, adding that disagreement is an ingredient in the democratic process. 
“What we’re discussing tonight isn’t about politics or personalities,” Peterson said. “It’s about whether we believe that everyone who benefits from our city should also share in the responsibility of taking care of it.” 
Peterson — who presides over Ward 14, home to Providence College (PC) and dense with off-campus housing —  then went on to “dispel a very immediate rumor” that the fee is “about punishing students.” 
“It’s about holding accountable the landlords and developers who profit most from student housing while contributing the least to the neighborhoods that they reshape,” Peterson said, and cited the example of Ward 14, where the city has had to install more than 200 new parking signs, clear drains, and “respond to more police and sanitation calls [near student housing] than any other part of the ward.”
The council’s ordinances committee first took up the issue at its July 17 meeting, and planned for a future public hearing. Before Thursday’s meeting, Goncalves removed himself as a sponsor. Goncalves did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday. 
Peterson told the students who turned out to testify in opposition that they’re being misled by landlords. A handout at the meeting also sought to counter the claims made by landlords about the ordinance.      
“Contrary to everything that they’ve told you, the city does value you,” Peterson said. “You are part of the fabric of Providence. You do support our businesses. You do volunteer your time, and you do bring life to our streets.” 
“You’re not the problem,” Peterson continued. “The problem is an unchecked housing system that treats you as a product and your neighborhood as a profit margin.”
There’s much profit to be made off students living off Providence’s many campuses, which include Brown University, Providence College, Rhode Island College, Rhode Island School of Design and Johnson & Wales University.
But most of the 150 pages of written testimony the council received leaned heavily against the measure, with 135 pages of opposition to 15 pages of support. A good chunk of the opposition letters were names from a petition.
Providence Mayor Brett Smiley submitted a letter in opposition to the ordinance as drafted, citing “serious operational and enforcement concerns.” Forcing colleges to share information on students’ addresses might conflict with federal privacy laws, Smiley suggested, and matching anonymized student data to specific properties could prove tricky and time-consuming.

Broke college students
The proposal is another chapter in what’s been a woeful year for the finances of Rhode Island’s capital city. A November 2024 settlement with the state education department forced city officials to come up with $11 million, leading the city to ask for the General Assembly’s permission to increase its overall tax levy. The successful maneuver nevertheless offered a rare moment at the State House where landlords and tenants decried the effect the legislation would have on property taxes, which had skyrocketed in the latest cycle of property reevaluations.   
The levy increased 5.85% for fiscal year 2026 only, but the increases fell upon homeowners in unequal ways. Non-owner occupied, multifamily homes with two to five units — the kinds of housing inhabited by college students — were subject to an average 13% increase in property taxes for fiscal year 2026.
That trickles down, argued Kevin Keaveney, a Providence College senior studying finance and business management. He told the committee Thursday that students “are genuinely worried about the financial strain this proposed plan would place on them.” 
“The stereotype that college students are broke exists for a reason,” Keaveney said. 
Peterson actually voted against final passage of the fiscal year 2026 budget in July, one of only two councilors to do so. The additional student fee money would not go into general revenue or municipal services, however. Instead, Peterson said the fees would be directed to the city’s new home repair program, which she said “helps our low-income homeowners fix code violations by making repairs and staying in their homes in a city where the median household income is $66,000.”
“The money collected here won’t go to the general fund,” Peterson said. “It’s not going to get lost in red tape.”
Peterson said the ordinance targets landlords, not students, and she cited the largest off-campus landlord in Ward 14’s Elmhurst neighborhood who provides housing for roughly 1,200 students, pulling in an estimated $7 million a year in rent. Add in fees — “There’s added fees for pretty much everything that you guys have, right?” Peterson said — and the landlord could rake in $660,000 monthly in fees alone, in the councilor’s estimate. 
That business model incensed Peterson and Councilor Justin Roias, a co-sponsor who strongly defended the ordinance. Toward the end of the meeting, Roias observed Keaveney said his rent was $1,290 a month in an eight-person house. Roias did some rough math and argued that a triple decker could pull in hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in rent income.
“I would argue that the student housing developers in Ward 14 specifically have had a monopolizing effect on the neighborhood,” Roias said. “They’ve actually set the market…I look at this ordinance as one of very few tools that we even have as a city to discourage student developers from continuing this business model.”
The ordinance, Roias said, is not against “mixed” housing, with “a student on the first floor and a family on the second floor,” he said. “This is exclusively student housing that this ordinance targets.”
‘It’s economics 101’
Perhaps most targeted by councilors’ ire were companies like the 02908 Club, a student rental business near Providence College in Ward 14. The Club had recently sent out multiple emails regarding the hearing and public comment period to students. While Peterson did not name the company in her opening remarks, her handout did, and she called the email blasts “a waste of time.”  
Shannon Russell, who sent those emails as part of her job as operations manager for the 02908 Club, disagreed.
“It’s my company that’s being attacked and lied about here tonight, just to put that out there,” Russell said in her turn at the podium.










I would argue that the student housing developers in Ward 14 specifically have had a monopolizing effect on the neighborhood.


– Providence City Councilor Justin Roias


She said the fees could absolutely be passed onto students. Distributors’ costs are passed onto sellers who pass those increased costs onto customers, she said. 
“It’s economics 101,” Russell said. “It’s simple. It’s basic.”
But ordinance supporter Joanne Rich argued the $300 fee was modest compared to the rents being charged.
Rich said the situation near Providence College — such as a highly publicized incident on Halloween night, which Russell and the college claimed did not involve PC students— was evidence that Ward 14 “has already been converted to an unruly, unmonitored extension of the PC campus.” 
Rich then apologized for being “a little snarky” but pressed ahead anyway. She said that if landlords pass along the fees, “I would suggest that the students impacted spend $8 less a week on alcohol, which might go a little way toward lessening the nuisance towards their neighbors as well.”
A date for a committee vote has not been set as of Friday.
“Having the public hearing was really the only planned next step,” City Council Chief of Staff June Rose said in an email Friday. “The sponsor will now consider the feedback from the community, decide on any amendments, and then she would request from the chair that it be scheduled for a vote.”

In a 13-page filing, the attorneys cited the presence of the parent of a CHOOSE Act parent in the lawsuit, which seeks to prevent AHSAA from enforcing transfer eligibility policies on students who go to private schools under the plan.
“The plaintiffs likewise acknowledge that the affected students can protect their own interests, which Jaclyn Hall is attempting to do by joining the lawsuit on behalf of her minor child Z.H.2,” the filing said.

The lawsuit, filed by Ivey and Ledbetter in September in Montgomery County Circuit Court, alleges that AHSAA is discriminating against CHOOSE Act athletes who transfer to another school by having them not participate in athletics for a year.
The CHOOSE Act is a voucher-like program that allows families to claim up to $7,000 in tax credits for non-public education expenses including private school tuition. 
Student athletes that receive CHOOSE Act funds and transfer to another school are required to be ineligible for sports for one year.  AHSAA considers it financial aid that brings its transfer policies into play, which AHSAA said ensures fairness.
Attorneys for Ivey and Ledbetter filed a preliminary injunction to replace the temporary restraining order they were granted on Sept. 5 and also added an additional plaintiff to the lawsuit in September.
The court is scheduled to hold a hearing in the lawsuit on Nov. 21.
Attorneys for AHSAA also argued that neither Ivey or Ledbetter have been harmed in their roles as governor and speaker of the House.
“Gov. Ivey and Speaker Ledbetter do not identify actual, concrete and particularized injury in fact either has suffered personally in his or her official capacities,” the rebuttal said.
A message seeking comment was left with the AHSAA Friday. Gina Maiola, a spokesperson for the governor, said in a statement Friday Ivey will continue to advocate for CHOOSE Act families affected by AHSAA’s regulations.
“Gov. Ivey’s mission is to simply let the kids play, and she refuses to stand by while the AHSAA unfairly and unlawfully discriminates against CHOOSE Act student-athletes,” she said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Nathaniel-Ledbetter-Kay-Ivey-Feb-12-2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-14 17:57:28.412675

He stayed at the Mercy Housing and Shelter Corporation and was eventually able to get a job and an apartment, which the organization subsidized. The shelter’s help is the “only reason” he is housed, safe, healthy and “living with dignity” today, he said, speaking at a press conference Friday.
But the Trump administration said late Thursday that it planned to cut federal funding for permanent housing programs like the one that helped Chris, who asked to be identified by only his first name.
In Connecticut, the policy change means long-term housing programs could lose as much as $69 million, risking the housing of 6,500 people, according to estimates from the Connecticut Coalition to End Homelessness and the CT CAN End Homelessness campaign. 
A notice from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development posted Thursday announced changes to what’s known as the Continuum of Care program, which provides most federal homelessness relief funding. Having a disability is a condition to receive permanent housing through Continuum of Care.
According to the notice, the Trump administration plans to lower the cap on permanent housing spending from 90% to 30% of all homelessness relief funding. Instead, funding will flow to programs that provide temporary housing with work requirements, treatment mandates and other conditions.
At the Friday event, held by U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, service providers spoke out against the policy, saying that permanent housing is the most effective, proven method for supporting unhoused people.
For decades, U.S. policy has been guided by a theory, known as “Housing First,” that permanent shelter is a necessary first step for people, who can then — from a more stable living situation — move on to finding health care and steady work. 
The Trump administration favors a different approach.
A U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development said in a press release Thursday, “The failed ‘Housing First’ ideology… encourages dependence on endless government handouts while neglecting to address the root causes of homelessness, including illicit drugs and mental illness.” The press release described the policy change as an effort to increase accountability for service providers by creating competition between them for grants. 
Louis Gill, CEO of housing aid nonprofit Columbus House, said it’s hard for people to improve their lives without first having permanent housing. “When you destabilize housing, you destabilize everything built upon it: medical care, mental health, sobriety, income, employment, community, and safety,” he said.
Gill added that the Trump administration’s policy change will force people who have already become self sufficient to start over, especially those with disabilities.
“These cuts ask providers to look disabled, medically fragile residents in the eye and tell them that the stability they built, the stability our government promised them through this program, may no longer be within reach,” he said.
Sarah Fox, CEO of the CT Coalition to End Homelessness, said it’s not so simple to rework longstanding programs to comply with the new rules. Providers are set up to supply permanent housing and most grants will now be awarded for temporary housing with strings attached, she said. “It is a big separation from our morals.”
What comes next
Critics of the new policy said they hope to stop it from going into effect — or find other funding.
Jennifer Paradis, executive director of the Beth-El Center shelter, said she believes the change is illegal. For one, she said, the policy directs funding to programs that help police clear homeless camps and mandate mental health or addiction treatment in exchange for housing. 
“Nothing in the law authorizes HUD to require criminalization or treatment compliance as a condition of funding,” Paradis said. She also argued it discriminates against disabled people.
Sen. Blumenthal said he expects there to be lawsuits against the policy. 
Blumenthal wants Congress to pass a budget appropriation of $4 billion that specifically requires permanent housing. “It’s on us,” he said.
Connecticut legislators said permanent housing could be funded with some of a $500 million emergency fund they approved on Thursday. Gov. Ned Lamont has discretion over how to use the money, though it’s intended generally to backfill federal funding losses for human services.
State Representative Eleni Kavros DeGraw, D-Avon, said she wants to “ensure that that $500 million gets spent, and that some of it gets spent on this.”
But she said that the emergency fund isn’t enough to support permanent housing along with other programs that have lost funding. “Do we honestly believe that that will be enough when we are hearing just the numbers for this one issue?” she said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0266-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-14 17:57:28.412675

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Democratic lawmakers in each chamber of the Florida Legisature have re-introduced a bill that would establish a protocol allowing schools to search for students with autism who wander off.
The bills requires public schools to create plans and a cohort of personnel to address situations in which students with autism “elope,” or wander away from safe areas. 
“This long-overdue measure would finally bring Florida in line with states that have already taken action on this issue,” Sen. Kristen Arrington, a Democrat from Kissimmee, said in a news release. 
“By establishing clear, statewide guidelines, we can equip school districts with the tools and support they need to protect our most vulnerable children. It also gives parents confidence that, in an emergency, their child’s school will be prepared to respond quickly and effectively.”
The bill calls for creating school elopement plans involving immediately contacting the parent of the student, conducting “an immediate, coordinated on-campus search and contacting emergency services only when the student is reasonably believed, based on verified information or direct observation, to have left school grounds and to be at risk of harm.”
The School Staff Assistance for Emergencies teams would annually update the school elopement plan, respond to all elopements, and train school personnel on response. The bill would require a student-specific “quick reference guide” for students prone to eloping.

“As a society, we need to be more assertive in protecting the needs, safety, and dignity of the neurodiverse population. All special needs students in Florida deserve the same protection,” Monica Carretero said in the news release. Carretero is the mother of a child with autism who once was found at an outdoor basketball court after eloping from his classroom.
The identical bills, HB 423 and SB 494, were filed by Rep. Anna Eskamani, an Orlando Democrat, and Arrington. 
Nearly half of children with autism attempt to elope from safe environments, according to the National Autism Association. Some of those children have accidentally drowned. 
“With nearly half of children with autism attempting to elope from safe environments, these safeguards are urgently needed,” Eskamani said in a news release. “Every student deserves to be safe at school, and every parent deserves peace of mind.”
Arrington filed the bill in the 2024 and 2025 sessions. Neither received a committee hearing. 
Eskamani filed the bill in 2023, 2024, and 2025. The 2023 and 2025 bills made it through one subcommittee but died, while her 2024 bill did not receive a hearing.
Lawmakers last session took a particular interest in addressing problems faced by Floridians with autism and their families.
During the 2025 session, the first bill to pass the Senate increases early detection opportunities and educational interventions for children with autism, a top priority for Senate President Ben Albritton, a Republican from Wauchula. That bill, SB 112, is now law.
That bill was among others last session that created a workforce credential for students with autism, and another relating to employers covering benefits for children with autism.
The session starts Jan. 13.

Purdue developed and patented the drug OxyContin in 1996. The prescription painkiller is an opioid, a class of drugs that can relieve pain but can also be highly addictive and debilitating. For years, company officials and the Sacklers, the family that owned the company, downplayed the risk of OxyContin, even as evidence mounted that its frequent prescriptions were leading to more overdose deaths across the country.
Although physicians prescribed fewer bottles of OxyContin and other opioid painkillers over the last decade, research indicates the legacy of Purdue’s marketing campaigns continues to jeopardize American lives. People addicted to prescription painkillers often switched to using illicit opioids, like heroin and fentanyl, when pills became less available. A 2023 Yale study found that states where the company’s marketing was less regulated continue to have higher rates of fentanyl overdoses and infections related to injection drug use, like hepatitis C.

Each year since 2022, Mississippi has been paid tens of millions of opioid settlement dollars, money that is supposed to help respond to the overdose public health crisis. But 15% of those dollars — the money controlled by the state’s towns, cities and counties — is unrestricted and being spent with almost no public knowledge. Mississippi Today spent the summer finding out how almost every local government receiving money has been managing the money over the past three years.Read The Series

The company has pleaded guilty for its marketing of OxyContin in the past, but it and the Sackler family have largely avoided the large national lawsuit payouts other companies have agreed to by filing for bankruptcy in 2019. A previous proposal would have required the family to pay up to $6 billion throughout the United States, but the Supreme Court rejected that settlement in June 2024 because of its civil lawsuit protections for the Sacklers. 
The new settlement, agreed to by state attorneys general in June, instructs the Sacklers to pay $7.4 billion to the states and doesn’t include the same legal shields for the Sacklers. Mississippi is set to receive its nearly $41 million share of that over the next 15 years. 
If finalized, Purdue’s payout brings Mississippi’s contributions from companies to around $421 million in reparations for their roles in the opioid epidemic — a public health catastrophe that has killed over 10,000 Mississippians. Health services in the state responded to close to 5,500 non-fatal overdoses just in the first seven months of 2025, according to the Mississippi State Department of Health.
Purdue’s settlement is subject to similar rules as the previous opioid lawsuits — 70% must be used for future strategies to address addiction, and the remaining 30% can be used for any other public purpose. 
The Legislature and 147 Mississippi local governments will split that 30%, or $12.3 million. So far, few of those local governments’ leaders have chosen to use their money to address the crisis Purdue and the other companies contributed to. Those decisions and delays in the state portion of the opioid settlements have led to Mississippi having committed less lawsuit money to prevent overdoses than every other state in the country as of this summer — both in total dollars and as a percentage of settlement shares.
The 70%, or $28.7 million, that does need to be spent on addiction-related purposes will be overseen by Mississippi Opioid Settlement Fund Advisory Council. The council has been meeting over the past few months, and state law says the council is required to recommend how the Legislature should spend the funds by Dec. 7 of this year.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/07043334/AP_17227561183611.jpg,,,2025-11-14 16:57:36.142633

TerraGen, a renewable energy developer, opened the Monte Cristo I Windpower Project in Hidalgo County, Texas this week. The facility has a 238.5-megawatt capacity — equivalent to powering 81,000 homes a year. And, 78.5 of those megawatts are committed to the copper mine outside Salt Lake City. 
The agreement strengthens the company’s renewable energy portfolio in the country, Rio Tinto Kennecott managing director Nate Foster said in a statement.

“It’s the latest in a series of renewable energy projects for Kennecott, following the installation of a 5MW solar plant in 2023, and a second 25MW solar plant nearing completion,” Foster wrote. “We continue to look for ways to power our operations while also lowering our emissions to help achieve Rio Tinto’s long-term decarbonisation goals.”
Kennecott’s Bingham Canyon mine has been in operation for over 120 years and currently is ready to remain active until 2026. Up until recently, there were plans in place to extend mining until 2032, but the company is also preparing feasibility studies to prolong the mine’s life until 2040.

The agreement also follows a switch to renewable diesel to power haul trucks and other heavy machinery equipment at the open-pit mine. In the past, the company also made efforts to reduce emissions, including the full closure of its coal-powered energy plant in 2019 in favor of solar and wind power sources. 
“Around 78% of the electricity Rio Tinto uses globally comes from renewable sources, and the company is making investment and supply decisions to increase this to around 90% by 2030,” Rio Tinto said in a news release.

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)For Hannah DeLange, the most rewarding part of managing Redhead Hemp’s Durham location has been “creating a space for people to feel comfortable and confident” — crafting an inviting social setting much like a coffee shop or bar.
The shelves are lined with CBD gummies, Delta-9 sangrias, and THC caramels, among a host of other drinks and candies with promises like “sleep with benefits” and “lower calories, higher vibes.”
The shop interior has a cozy feel, with plants lining brick walls flush with brightly colored artwork, and plush sofas and chairs to relax on. At the store’s “Canna Cafe,” customers can sit down with hemp-infused teas and coffee.
“It’s just kind of a space for all,” DeLange said. “It should be a plant for all the people, and it should be accessible — and just creating a space that’s able to really just personify that.”
Now, the future of that space and many others like it are in doubt, with the vast majority of their hemp-based cannabinoid products set to become illegal in November 2026.
North Carolina hemp business owners and their counterparts across the U.S. are bracing for the ban’s impact, with some pursuing advocacy efforts to reverse the ban and others working to pivot to the narrow slice of CBD products that will remain legal.

‘I think there’s a lot of fearmongering’
“We found out the morning of the Senate vote that this was occurring,” said Emma MacAdam, the owner of Redhead Hemp. “It was pretty clear when they slipped it in the bill that that bill was going to pass, so it kind of felt like a really sleazy way for them to just slide their agenda into a bill that was very necessary and important for so many people.”

Hemp and marijuana are both varieties of the cannabis plant, differentiated mainly by the levels of the psychoactive compound THC, with hemp having far less of it. CBD, another chemical produced by the cannabis plant, does not have intoxicating effects by itself but produces a calming effect and has been shown to help treat pain and anxiety.
The ban, which sharply decreases the allowable level of THC in hemp products, passed earlier this week as part of an Agriculture appropriations bill that was paired with the stopgap funding agreement to end the federal government shutdown.
It bars the sale of any hemp product, including CBD products, containing more than 0.4 milligrams of THC per container, which DeLange and MacAdam said represents about 99.5% of their stock. This would eliminate “full spectrum” hemp products, which they said make up most typical CBD products.
“Basically, they’re saying we can only use the parts of the plant that are not intoxicating,” DeLange said. “For a lot of people, the THC compound — even that small amount that you see in full spectrum — is what’s really important for pain relief, anxiety, sleep, things like that.”
DeLange said that using CBD products has also helped some customers stop using opioids or drinking heavily. “The drinks have been a really great resource for a lot of people who want to have a healthier alternative for that.”
The ban comes after years of lobbying by the marijuana industry and state law enforcement, who argued the hemp industry exploited a loophole to sell products with many of the same effects of marijuana but none of the regulatory oversight. Senators say they never intended to open a recreational hemp market and only desired to enable industrial hemp farming.
The rationale, according to Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and other backers of the Agriculture bill is to “keep these dangerous products out of the hands of children while preserving the hemp industry for farmers” by closing the loophole that allows the sale of CBD products with less than 0.3% THC, the threshold originally set by the 2018 Farm Bill he helped pass.

“Unfortunately, companies have exploited a loophole in the 2018 legislation by taking legal amounts of THC from hemp and turning it into intoxicating substances, and then marketing it to children in candy-like packaging and selling it in easily accessible places, like gas stations and convenience stores all across our country,” McConnell said Monday.
MacAdam and DeLange pushed back on the claim that the products target young customers. They said their shop has a strict over-21 policy.
“It’s very easy to use the ‘save the children’ flagship banner for a lot of things, I think there’s a lot of fearmongering surrounding cannabis — that’s the history of cannabis, period,” DeLange said.
“And absolutely no talk of parent responsibility in that matter, also no talk of how liquor is not childproof, and a lot of new liquor companies are just as cute and colorful,” MacAdam added. “I think it’s a complete cop-out.”
‘The wild west’
The rapid shift to prohibition represents a marked change for an industry that has had little to no regulation for the past seven years in many states, including North Carolina.
North Carolina, has failed to enact any regulations on intoxicating hemp products, even basic age restrictions, despite bipartisan backing from the state Senate, Gov. Josh Stein and Attorney General Jeff Jackson.
In February, the state’s child care task force reported a 600% increase in emergency room visits for minors related to cannabis use since 2019. Stein launched an advisory council on cannabis products in June, urging that “our state’s unregulated cannabis market is the wild west and is crying out for order.”

Last month, Jackson joined 38 states’ attorneys general to call for regulation from Congress on the sale of CBD products, asking lawmakers to “clarify the federal definition of hemp” during the appropriations process.
“State efforts to outlaw hemp-derived psychoactive products to protect their citizens cannot solve this problem,” the letter from the attorneys general read. “Such efforts can only lead to an uneven and ineffectual patchwork of bans and regulations that differ from State to State and will not stop the flood of mail-order THC products from streaming through interstate commerce.”
Bills proposed in North Carolina this year that failed to advance include bans on selling to minors and sales permit requirements as well as childproof packaging and printed warnings. A bill that passed the Senate in June, which Jackson spoke in support of, would forbid sales of hemp-derived drinks, gummies, and other products to anyone under 21 and ban their use on school grounds, among other regulations like a licensing process.
That bill and many others died in the powerful House Rules Committee, now chaired by Rep. John Bell (R-Wayne), who became the president of hemp company Asterra Labs in 2024. Bell did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this story.
MacAdam said the lack of regulation has been a benefit in some ways, such as making the industry more accessible to those with relatively few resources, creating greater opportunity for nontraditional business owners.
“It’s really cool to see what an industry can do when there’s no barrier to entry. There’s no license you need to pay $100,000 for. I started this business with a tiny bit of money and a big goal, and I’m very grateful for all the people that we’ve met along the way,” she said.
‘That’s part of our livelihood’
Also left in the lurch are farm owners who grow floral, or smokable, hemp — the crop grown to make CBD products. Dana Rider, co-owner of Otherside Farm in rural Buncombe County, said the industry had become “kind of jaded” by close calls on potential bans since the legalization of hemp products in 2018.
“We’d be freaking out and then everything would be okay, or they would postpone it for another year,” Rider said. “Obviously, [the ban is] going to strike a chord somewhere, because, you know, that’s part of our livelihood.”
He said his family started growing hemp a year after starting their farm. Other farmers he knows switched to hemp to revitalize old tobacco farms and dairies that had fallen into disrepair. They now operate an online shop, Otherside Hemp, and also sell their products in stores around the state. “It’s part of our income and helps keep the farm afloat,” he said.
He said for many customers, the goal isn’t to experience a chemical high but instead to manage pain and other conditions like insomnia and anxiety.
THC, CBD, and Delta-9 products line the shelves at Redhead Hemp on Nov. 13, 2025. Store owner Emma MacAdam said many of their products are from small businesses and family-run farms. (Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)
“Your grandmother and your great aunt and your parents, they don’t want to feel different, they don’t want to have this altered consciousness,” Rider said. “They just want to feel better.”
MacAdam and Rider both say they have been in conversation with other business owners working to push back against the ban in the year before it takes effect.
“We carry a lot of small businesses, a lot of family-run businesses, so we’re really worried about our friends,” MacAdam said.
Otherside Farm plans to urge its supporters to contact their state and local representatives about the ban, Rider said. “We have a year to either figure it out or we have a year to just like, crush it and fight for the plant and hope that we can change this with legislation.”
“We’re going to kind of wait it out,” he added. “Until they tell us that we can’t sell our stuff anymore, we’re going to keep selling our stuff and growing and producing our products.”
While some farms and shops will be able to continue to legally sell products processed to remove any THC, also known as “CBD isolates,” Rider said his farm lacks the equipment to produce them. Because they sell full-spectrum products only, their entire array of products would be wiped out by the ban.
“For us, we can’t really pivot, right?” Rider said. “We would not be around anymore, basically, which is sad to think about.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Redhead-Hemp-Product-Rack-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-14 16:57:36.142633

Anyone who’s purchased ByHeart Whole Nutrition Infant Formula should throw it away immediately or return it to the store where it was purchased, state health officials said in a news release Friday. 

At least 23 infants in 13 states have been sickened with infant botulism traced to ByHeart formula since August. There have been no deaths attributed to the outbreak, and none of the cases were in Louisiana. 
ByHeart Inc. started a recall of its powdered formula earlier this week. Two couples whose babies have developed the infection have also filed lawsuits against ByHeart in Arizona and Kentucky, according to the Associated Press. 
Louisiana officials advise families who have purchased ByHeart to take a photo or write down the product’s lot number, found on the bottom of the can, before disposing of it. Containers and surfaces the formula might have touched should also be washed with hot soapy water, they said. 

Babies who have injuested the bacteria might not get sick for days or weeks. They should be monitored for 30 days after their last exposure to the formula for signs of illness. There is no testing that can be done to see if a baby has ingested the bacteria unless symptoms surface. 
Signs of infant botulism include constipation, poor feeding, loss of head control, difficulty swallowing, decreased facial expression, a weak or altered cry and muscle weakness. Babies who develop these behaviors should be seen by a medical professional immediately, according to the state health department. 

The Louisiana health department is working with retail businesses and others to ensure ByHeart formula is taken off shelves in stores. ByHeart only makes up 1% of the baby formula market nationwide, so federal officials do not expect its recall to trigger a larger shortage of infant formula.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/infant-formula6-1024x577.jpg,,,2025-11-14 16:57:36.142633

(Keila Szpaller/The Daily Montanan)A political fight among Republicans in Ravalli County that resulted in the ousting of Freedom Caucus allies from local leadership posts earlier this year may serve as a warning to the Montana Republican Party.
In March 2025, Ravalli County District Court Judge Jennifer Lint found the Ravalli County Republican Central Committee had disenfranchised voters and infringed on their constitutional rights by failing to hold an election of officers.
In the complaint, Stevensville Republican Tony Hudson alleged the local party chairman, influenced by hardline members of the GOP, was failing to hold a central committee election contrary to state law, and was illegally holding onto power.
Defendant Ron Stoltz, then chairman of the Ravalli County central committee, argued state GOP bylaws, amended in June 2024, precluded a local election until after Dec. 1, 2026, and he said he had held off at the direction of the state GOP.
But the judge said that stance ran contrary to state law.
Without a local election, precinct captains elected in June 2024 wouldn’t have the chance to run for leadership or select officers or delegates to the state convention, and the judge ordered Stoltz to hold one.
The results ushered in new leadership on the Ravalli County Republican Central Committee, and some Republicans say the case helped end a caustic period within the local GOP, one pushed by  power-hungry members of the Freedom Caucus.
But shrapnel from the case could still hit the Montana Republican Party.
Hudson, who filed the lawsuit, and his lawyer, Joan Mell, said the case could open the door to legal action that challenges election outcomes from the June 2025 state GOP convention — an organization that itself trumpets concerns about election integrity.
The case also raises questions about how the Montana GOP will move forward.
In a July email and memo obtained by the Daily Montanan, Montana GOP Chairman Art Wittich told central committees to hold off on local conventions and officer elections until December 2026, as the state GOP advised the Ravalli County chairman prior to the lawsuit.
Through a spokesperson, Wittich declined an interview for this story.
Hudson, though, said the state GOP has misled “good Republicans,” it has let bullies from the Freedom Caucus run roughshod over the organization, and it needs a similar restoration of order for which he fought in Ravalli County.
“We need to follow the law in the Republican Party,” Hudson said. “If we are going to be the party of law and order, then we must.”
 Takeover, fighting in Ravalli County Republican Central Committee

The Covid-19 pandemic ratcheted up anti-government sentiment among some members of the hard right in the Bitterroot Valley, deepening political divisions and opening the door to new leadership on the central committee.
Terry Nelson, selected this year to replace a resigning state legislator, had served as chairperson of the central committee for more than a decade.
In 2023, state Sen. Theresa Manzella, a Hamilton Republican and flashy hardliner, successfully nominated Stoltz as chairperson of the Ravalli County Republican Central Committee.
The 2023 central committee election put control of the executive board in the hands of the more extreme members of the Republican Party.
Hudson, on the Stevensville Public Schools board, said under the influence of Manzella and other activist hardliners, local GOP leadership ostracized Republicans who didn’t fall in line.
Manzella declined an interview and did not answer written questions in time for this story. 










We need to follow the law in the Republican Party. If we are going to be the party of law and order, then we must.


– Tony Hudson


At central committee meetings, Hudson said Stoltz would cut off public comment if he didn’t agree with the speaker.
“It was their beliefs 100% or nothing,” Hudson said. “There was no dialogue. There was no communication.”
Patty Franklin, current vice chairperson of the central committee, said local GOP leaders took actions that were out of step with party tradition, such as spending money on primary races.
But Franklin said when members who weren’t in lockstep with leadership tried to raise a collective voice and reason with elected officers, they were met with animosity.
“This group was very hostile,” Franklin said.
 Hudson mobilizes new members, ‘Dirty Thirty’ accusation flies

Hudson decided he had seen enough of the central committee leadership and its influencers.
In 2024, within two weeks of the deadline for Ravalli County Republicans to sign up to run for precinct captain, Hudson said he recruited 30 or so fellow Republicans for the positions.

“I just made up my mind I was going to do it,” Hudson said.
In 2018, Hudson’s son Wyatt died at the age of 19 in a car accident, and Hudson decided he could “crawl into the bottle,” or he could honor his son and family and improve the world. He’s also a rancher with a bias for action.
“​​As ranchers say, ‘We’ve been doing so much with so little for so long, we can do anything with nothing at all,’” Hudson said.
Hudson turned the names of GOP recruits into the county clerk five minutes before 5 p.m. on filing day, he said, and he turned to face the wrath of the central committee.
“These people went apoplectic,” Hudson said.
The Ravalli County Republican Central Committee took out a full page advertisement in the Bitterroot Star calling the new recruits “The Dirty Thirty.”
The letter, addressed “Dear neighbor,” said historically, the seats are difficult to fill, and “there are virtually never multiple candidates interested in the job.”
It accused Hudson’s recruits of using “dirty tricks” to try to “retake” the committee.
Most won at the ballot box anyway.
Typically, the central committee holds elections among precinct captains to select leadership positions, as state law and its bylaws require, but Stoltz, the chairman, never called for one.
“There was never a formal conversation about elections, but the implication always was, ‘We’re not going to have elections because the state party had decided to not have elections until basically the fall of 2026,’” Hudson said.
 Hudson takes Stoltz, central committee to court

In February 2025, Hudson took the Ravalli County Republican Central Committee and Stoltz to court, and he asked the judge to grant a type of relief legally defined as “an extraordinary remedy.”
He asked the court for a writ of mandate, an order that forces a public official to take action the person has a legal obligation to take, in this case, to hold the local election.
As he saw it, if the state GOP could amend its bylaws to preclude elections for a couple of years, he wasn’t sure what would stop it from doing so for longer.
In the complaint, Hudson alleged Stoltz had no authority to continue serving as chairman past April 1, 2025, but intended to control the local central committee “without election to office in 2025 through 2027.”
He alleged members of the Freedom Caucus intended to control the Republican platform and had taken control of many local committees, but its members knew local committees still weren’t “stacked in their favor.”
And he said Freedom Caucus members sought to extend their power anyway.
At the 2024 state convention, as outlined in court documents, GOP delegates amended party bylaws to say local elections should take place between Dec. 1 of each even-numbered year and March 31 of each odd-numbered year — starting on Dec. 1, 2026.
State convention delegates Paul Fielder, a Thompson Falls legislator, and Brad Tschida, former legislator from Missoula and former Public Service Commission director, drove the changes, according to the complaint. 
Stoltz did not respond to an email requesting comment, but according to the district court order, he argued the amendments meant no central committee election could be held until Dec. 1, 2026, and none could be held “until the State Chair authorizes” it.
The judge disagreed.
Until Dec. 1, 2026, the judge said the current rules for local elections remained in place, as did state statute, and she ordered Stoltz to hold one by April 1, 2025.
 Activists out, ‘old guard’ returns

To his credit, Stoltz complied with the district court order and called for the local election, said Matt Roth, current chairman of the Ravalli County Republican Central Committee.
He and others said Stoltz never showed up for it, nor did his allies.

In holding off on the local election, Roth said Stoltz was only following the directive of the state GOP, but the results contravened the rights of the people.
“It’s fundamentally against the law, fundamentally against the Constitution of the United States, and fundamentally against our republic,” Roth said.
He said he had hoped the new board would be mixed and include GOP members from across the political spectrum, but the Freedom Caucus activists did not show up.
Franklin, vice chairwoman, said in one way, the extremists sidelined themselves. She said she talked to eight people at a recent dinner who used to support Manzella and will no longer do so.
“They got too noisy and too obnoxious, and people stopped taking them as seriously as they used to,” Franklin said.
Roth said he took the helm of the local central committee reluctantly. He said he’s aligned with much of the Freedom Caucus ideology, but not with its means.
“My hope and prayer is that all conservatives in the valley come back to the table and have a good heartfelt discussion of how we move forward in 2026,” Roth said.
How the state GOP moves ahead is another matter.
 Order appealed, found moot

The case went to the Montana Supreme Court, and last month, the justices issued an order finding the matter was moot; the original controversy over the election in Ravalli County had ended.
It said Stoltz had not demonstrated the disputed part of the state Republican Party bylaws — “subject to amendment or clarification by the Party” — were likely to be applied in the same manner again.
“(Stoltz’s) suggestion that the other central committees might so apply the bylaws is speculative,” the order said.
The state Supreme Court also said the statute the district court relied on remained in place.
“The county central committee shall meet prior to the state convention of its political party and organize by electing a presiding officer and one or more vice presiding officers,” says the state statute.
In Ravalli County, the central committee bylaws require the local convention take place between Feb. 1 and April 1 of odd-numbered years, the order said.
Lawyer Abby Moscatel represented Stoltz in the appeal, and when reached by phone about Hudson vs. Stoltz, Moscatel stated she had no comment and hung up.
The Montana Republican Party did not answer questions about the guidance it gave to central committees, but a July 14 email and memo from Wittich told central committees that Montana GOP bylaws “trump county bylaws.”
In the email, Wittich said any county bylaws that conflict should be amended to be in compliance with state GOP bylaws.
“Please be advised that no county conventions will be called until December 1, 2026,” the email said.
The attached memo, also dated July 14 and marked “draft,” said GOP rules had been subject to “conflicting interpretations” and central committees may be “confused.” It did not reference the district court order or appeal.
Wittich did not answer questions for this story, including about any subsequent guidance the state GOP has given central committees.
“MT GOP wasn’t a party to the case and didn’t appear in the case, so we don’t have comment to provide,” Wittich said through a spokesperson.
 Moving forward

Some Ravalli County Republicans believe the results of the state GOP convention in June could be called into question if other counties also should have held local elections and had the chance to select state delegates.
In other words, if county central committees sent illegitimate delegates to the state convention, what does that mean for the results of elections at the state GOP?
“That’s a serious issue within the GOP that needs to be looked at,” Franklin said.
Mell said in the lawsuit, the party was trying to override statute and take the will of the people away. 
She said not every county has “a Tony,” but Republicans shouldn’t sit on their rights and assume those in control of the state party are controlling precincts as well.
A breadth of voices is needed to fairly represent the party, but people need to work for it, Mell said. 
“Complacency is death,” Mell said. “People need to know their rights and get involved and question — and not be afraid to question — the leadership of the GOP.
“It’s not a foregone conclusion. The local voices matter. And participation really matters.”
Hudson believes that without some change at the state GOP, a powerful minority will retain dominance at the expense of a party that once boasted about a big tent.
“(But) this is not their private club,” Hudson said.
Freedom Caucus Chairman Jerry Schillinger, a Republican legislator from Circle, said every party and group has different factions, and he isn’t concerned some members of his group may have besmirched its cause.
He said to be a member of any group is to accept the bumps and bruises it brings along the way and to be willing to have the backs of others despite their imperfections.
“If it ever came to an issue, whether it’s a Freedom Caucus or any other group, that some member is totally out of step with the goals and the ideals of that group, then likely that person will find themselves sitting on the outside,” Schillinger said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_6127-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-14 16:57:36.142633

The plaintiffs — Nicole White, Brent Smeins, Miria Schuster, Dave Wedeking, Devontez Roberts, Jeff Mason, Kimberly Browning, Anthony Haubrich, Gayle Robinson, Leland Williams and Kerigan Kammeyer — are each current or former emergency medical technicians or paramedics employed by the ambulance department of the Waverly Health Center.
WHC operates an array of medical clinics located in Waverly, Janesville, Nashua and Shell Rock.
The plaintiffs allege that while employed by WHC, they had a regular rotating schedule in which they worked a 24-hour shift and then received 48 hours off, while occasionally working additional hours beyond their regular shift.
In May 2022 and again in April 2023, WHC allegedly announced a policy to begin paying hourly employees who worked nights and weekends a “shift differential” in addition to their regular rate of pay. In August 2024, the policy was allegedly revised to state that hourly employees who worked nights and weekends would receive a shift differential of $2 to $15 per hour depending on when the hours were worked.
The lawsuit claims the 2022, 2023 and 2024 shift differential policies were communicated to the paramedics and EMTs by email, with each recipient required to review and acknowledge the policies electronically.
Despite this, the lawsuit claims, the EMTs and paramedics never were paid the applicable shift differentials.
The lawsuit, filed in state court before being transferred this week to federal court, seeks unspecified damages for alleged violations of Iowa’s wage laws and the federal Fair Labor Standards Act.

(Screen capture by Kansas Reflector from MPSC meeting)Missouri utility regulators on Thursday approved electric rates to ensure large power users on its system are responsible for paying their fair share of the effect their usage has on the power grid and other customers.
The Missouri Public Service Commission approved a large-load rate submitted by Evergy, which operates in Kansas and Missouri, and that was supported by most parties in the case.
Unlike in Kansas, where a large-user rate was unanimously agreed to by all intervenors, including business, environmental groups and a data service coalition, two groups did not support the Missouri order.
Missouri Public Service Commission staff and the Missouri Office of Public Counsel, an organization that advocates for small business and residential customers, did not support the order.
In fact, the staff and OPC submitted a separate proposal that commission chairwoman Kayla Hahn said was too confusing and could cause large users to avoid locating in Missouri.
“Staff’s proposal requires upwards of 25 different charges that a large user could be subject to paying,” she said. “The evidence showed us the vast amount of charges and uncertainty make it unclear if a large user would be paying too much, too little or more likely if a large user would forgo locating in Missouri altogether as even a sophisticated user would be unable to predict what its ultimate bill responsibility would be.”
The tariff reflects broad stakeholder consensus and “contains strong safeguards to ensure that large new loads pay their fair share while enabling growth that benefits Missouri,” the commissioners said in the order.
Large-load users were defined in the order as those requiring 75 megawatts per month at peak times, a parallel to the Kansas order approved Nov. 6 by the Kansas Corporation Commission.
“I’m satisfied that this will result in the large-load customers bearing the financial responsibility for the costs that are incurred for infrastructure improvement, be they transmission or generation,” said commissioner John Mitchell. “I’m also satisfied that the agreement does establish reasonable protections both for the existing customers and for the large-load customers, and ensure that the large-load customers will pay their fair share.”
Evergy spokeswoman Gina Penzig said Missouri rates include similar protections to those put in place in Kansas for existing customers by ensuring that companies pay their fair share for access to the grid. The rate for these new large customers is higher than that paid by existing commercial and industrial customers.
“This premium rate helps pay for modernization and maintenance of the power grid that is shared by all our customers,” she said. “In both Kansas and Missouri the commissions have recognized the value of attracting large energy users and the importance of making sure existing customers don’t foot the bill.”

It’s impossible to fully grasp food insecurity in Vermont without showing up and talking to people in pantries, churches and community centers across the state. During the government shutdown, when thousands of Vermonters faced a painful gap in benefits, the issue gained new urgency.
What I witnessed in recent weeks reminded me why this work matters, and why we depend on readers like you. Your support today powers fact-based local reporting and, through our partnership with the Vermont Foodbank, sends three meals to a neighbor.

Donate and send 3 meals

In the Statehouse, I watched officials debate and approve a $6 million plan to help combat hunger. In the days that followed, I met Vermonters who still had to wait a week for that relief, and heard reports of people watering down meals or skipping them altogether to make food last. Often, people were willing to share their stories, generously offering a window into their hardships.
With federal food benefits to resume, but many challenges still ahead, I will continue to follow the impacts of state programs and federal changes to food assistance. I will keep showing up and listening, not just to lawmakers and judges, but also to those their decisions impact most.
This Thanksgiving, your donation powers this kind of reporting. Reporting grounded in facts, informed by real experiences, and freely available to everyone. And through VTDigger’s partnership with the Vermont Foodbank, your gift also sends three meals to a neighbor in need.

Noel Frame, D-Seattle, makes remarks during a Washington State Budget and Policy Center panel discussion on Nov. 12, 2025. (Photo courtesy of Washington State Budget and Policy Center)SEATTLE — Democratic state Sen. Noel Frame traces her interest in tax policy to her time as a teenager in the 1990s, concerned about scarce funding for her school district in Battle Ground, Washington.
“There was something there about taxes that I needed to figure out,” she recalled to a room packed with progressives here this week. “Here I am, I’m 45, and I’m fighting the same exact fight that I was fighting when I was 16.”
The upcoming bouts will be high-stakes, with lawmakers vexed by a budget shortfall that billions of dollars of tax increases, coupled with spending cuts, failed to resolve this year.
In the state Senate, Frame, who is from Seattle, is running point for Democrats on tax policy.
“The Revenue Queen.” That’s how Eli Taylor Goss, who leads the Washington State Budget and Policy Center, described her at the group’s Budget Matters Policy Summit, held this week at the Northwest African American Museum.
It was a crowd brimming with the belief that the state’s corporate titans and tech executives are not paying their fair share, and must shoulder more of the financial burden for publicly funded education and human services.
Pressure is building for Democrats to take a big swing on taxes, beyond this year’s hikes. How far Frame and her allies can deliver on that goal in 2026 is an open question. Next year’s legislative session, which begins in January, is just 60 days and happening ahead of an election.
“I want to have a future for Washington state where it’s not just a rich person’s playground,” Frame said. “I don’t want to be called the Cayman Islands of the United States.” (The Cayman Islands are considered a tax haven.)
One of the hotter ideas percolating is a possible income tax on wealthier individual earners. Early descriptions suggest a 9.9% tax on adjusted gross income above $1 million.
Senate Democrats have discussed the concept, and it’s circulating among insiders. There’s no draft bill or firm plan on paper yet, Frame told the Standard.
Two other significant — and controversial —  revenue bills are already on the table. One, the so-called wealth tax, sponsored by Frame, would tax certain assets, like stocks and bonds, over $50 million. Another would apply a payroll tax to large companies with higher earners.
‘Be prepared to win three times over’
Washington is one of nine states nationwide that do not tax individual wage and salary income.
For progressives, changing that is a holy grail in their quest to rebalance the state’s tax code so it falls less heavily on low-income households. It’s also a third rail. A concept Washington voters have repeatedly rejected and that the state Supreme Court has blocked.
Frame said during a panel discussion Wednesday that she’s “heard more chatter about the income tax in the last six months than I’ve heard in the last 15 years.” 
Cynics question if this surging interest has to do with businesses looking to prevent their taxes from climbing further by generating state revenue elsewhere.
That aside, Frame had a cautionary message for the audience — many of whom would be counted on to help enact such a tax.
“Passing that bill in the Legislature is the first step, not the last. We will need to fight and defend this in court. We will have to defend this at the ballot,” she said. “If we do it, we’d better be prepared to win three times over.”
“If we are going to do this, we need to do it right,” the senator added. “And all of you in this room know what that means, what it looks like, and we are going to be the ones that do the work.”
Wealth tax still in play
Frame’s still bullish on the wealth tax.
Her bill cleared the Senate on a 26-21 vote on the final day of this year’s session. The House didn’t debate it, and Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson objected to relying on the tax to balance the budget, citing the likelihood it would get tied up in court.
Frame points to its strong public support and years of refining the legislation since it was first introduced in 2021.
“We have done everything to this bill that we could possibly do, and there is only one argument left,” she said. It’s that rich people will leave the state if the tax is imposed, she explained, adding that research indicates that’s not likely to happen.
Frame doesn’t shy away from her role as a tax champion, even though it puts her at the center of some of the toughest debates in Olympia. “Somebody’s got to do it,” she said.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/noel-frame-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-14 16:57:36.142633

Rick Hoheisel, a Republican from Wichita and chair of a House-Senate oversight committee, says indictment of the former CEO of Texas-based Beneficient is sufficient cause to evaluate the state's issuance of a bank charter to Beneficient in 2021. The idea of an inquiry has bipartisan support. (Photo by Thad Allton for Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Bipartisan support exists in the Kansas Legislature to scrutinize a state bank charter issued to a company whose founder has been indicted and accused of syphoning millions of dollars from a now-bankrupt business to finance his opulent lifestyle.
Rep. Nick Hoheisel, a Republican from Wichita, said the Legislature should examine results of state law that guaranteed a charter in 2021 for Texas-based Beneficient, an alternative investment company relying on the banking credential to attract wealthy clients to its business of exchanging cash or stock for illiquid assets.
“Frankly, my committee will be looking at the TEFFI Act as we get into session,” Hoheisel said. “We will be taking a look at this whole thing.”
Hoheisel serves as chair of the House Financial Institutions and Pensions Committee, as well as the joint House and Senate oversight committee responsible for supervision of the TEFFI Act, which opened the door to Beneficent’s bank charter.
He said he wasn’t eager to pull the plug on Beneficient, because he wanted to offer the company’s executives “an opportunity to get this right.” The 2026 Legislature convenes in January.
Official exploration of Beneficient didn’t gain bipartisan traction until a federal indictment against Beneficient founder Brad Heppner for alleged securities and wire fraud. He was arrested in early November after a grand jury approved a five-count indictment alleging approximately $300 million had been transferred from GWG Holdings to Beneficient and that Heppner subsequently funneled more than $150 million of that total to a shell company he secretly controlled. Heppner was chairman of Beneficient and GWG Holdings from 2019 to 2021.
The FBI said Heppner “allegedly falsified documents, made misleading statements to investors and auditors, and obstructed an investigation by regulatory authorities.” He faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.
The indictment says Heppner purportedly spent $40 million on his Dallas home, $10 million for upkeep at the mansion and an East Texas ranch, $20 million to pay tax liabilities, $10 million for personal credit card debt and private air travel expenses, and $500,000 on jewelry.
In wake of the indictment, Democratic Rep. Rui Xu of Mission Hills said it was time the Legislature considered ending the state’s alliance with Beneficient by revoking the state bank charter.
The charter was authorized in April 2021 as a pilot project. The Legislature adopted a bill in 2022 requiring the charter be made permanent retroactive to December 2021. That bill was championed by Senate President Ty Masterson, R-Wichita, and signed into law by Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly.
“All this stemmed from a poison seed, if you will. We just kept trying to water and water it,” Xu said. “Just from its inception this has smelled a little funny and continues to smell a little funny. This is not a thing, I think, Kansans want the state to be involved with.”
Sen. Brenda Dietrich, R-Topeka, said legislation ought to be introduced in the House and Senate to forbid state agencies from accepting receivership of any portion of Beneficient if the company filed for bankruptcy or was declared insolvent.
“I think we need to protect our state, protect our constituents,” Deitrich said. “That just makes sense.”
The TEFFI law was controversial because Kansas Bank Commissioner David Herndon opposed the unique arrangement with Beneficient, complained the Legislature placed unreasonable limits on state regulation of Beneficient and its subsidiaries. He also expressed frustration the Legislature wouldn’t consider revocation of Beneficient’s charter. Herndon’s pleas generally fell on deaf ears at the Statehouse.
To gain traction for legislation tied to Beneficient’s bank charter, the company’s allies donated thousands of dollars to Republican and Democratic politicians and directed cash to partisan political action committees in Kansas. The original bank charter bill unanimously passed by the Senate and was endorsed 103-20 in the House.
Lobbying led by Herndon, until he resigned from Beneficient in summer of 2025, included promises the partnership between the state and Beneficient would create an economic windfall for Kansas and trigger a surge in business development in rural Kansas.
In the past several years, questions were raised about Heppner, or others associated with Beneficient, possibly engaging in financial misconduct. Trustees working on behalf of investors in GWG Holdings, which filed for bankruptcy in 2022, pursued lawsuits to claw back millions of dollars drained from GWG Holdings. In March, Beneficient’s executives and officers settled claims with GWG Holdings for $50.5 million. In addition, GWG Holdings’ litigation led to settlements of $30 million with a law firm and $8.5 million with an accounting firm.
Sen. Stephen Owens, a Hesston Republican who relentlessly championed the public-private partnership with Beneficient, said at one point the state’s association with Beneficient would enable $1 billion in global investment to flow through Kansas within a decade.
Owens said it would be folly to withdraw Beneficient’s bank charter by repealing the TEFFI Act, which stands for Technology-Enabled Fiduciary Financial Institutions Act.
“I absolutely reject this notion,” he said. “I reject the idea that right now is the time to repeal the TEFFI Act.”
He said legislation giving the bank commissioner the power to revoke Beneficient’s charter should include an appeal process to the Legislature.
Owens said he was frustrated the Kansas bank commissioner hadn’t been more supportive of the Beneficient venture. He complained the commissioner declined to develop regulations that might have encouraged other financial companies to locate in Kansas.
“It is my opinion that the office of state bank commissioner is hostile towards this act as a whole,” Owens said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/4F5A0379jpg.jpg,,,2025-11-14 16:57:36.142633

The Republican governor, speaking to reporters, chastised the task force on Thursday for failing to put forward a map of new school districts, adding uncertainty to the upcoming legislative session.

Vermont Gov. Phil Scott had some strong words for the school redistricting task force after the group endorsed a proposal on Monday to incentivize voluntary mergers of the state’s 119 school districts. The task force members, he told reporters, “didn’t fulfill their obligation.”
“They didn’t redraw the lines, and they were supposed to put forward three maps for consideration, and they failed,” Scott said.
Asked by a reporter where that leaves the state, Scott said that “it would appear that those who didn’t fulfill their obligation are OK with the ever-increasing property taxes, cost of education, and they don’t want to see change, or at least not immediately.”

“So, I think it puts us in a tough position, but I think the majority of people — I’ll include the speaker and the pro tem — understand we need change,” he said. “We need to do something. So, they’re going to have to act as soon as they get back in.”
Scott’s comments Monday underscore a growing sense of uncertainty around efforts to reform Vermont’s public education system.
Debate around public education reform will feature prominently in the next legislative session, set to begin in January. And while Act 73, the state’s sweeping education reform law, was signed in July, launching that reform will depend on the Legislature agreeing to a new district map.
But on Monday, the 11-member task force voted 8-3 to endorse a proposal that defied a core directive of Act 73: that the group put forward at least one and no more than three new maps by Dec. 1 for the Vermont Legislature to consider in the upcoming session.
Task force members Rep. Beth Quimby, R-Lyndon; Sen. Scott Beck, R-Caledonia; and Dave Wolk, who is Scott’s appointee, voted no on the proposal.
The nearly 170-page proposal the group endorsed lays out a 10-year plan. Districts would be incentivized to merge to access state construction aid and to coordinate on developing regional high schools, while utilizing regional boards of cooperative educational services, or BOCES, to share the cost of services.
The only map contained within the proposal shows how the five regional cooperative service agencies proposed in the plan would layer over the state’s existing 119 school districts and 52 supervisory districts and supervisory unions.
Vermont Education Secretary Zoie Saunders said during the meeting Monday the proposal did not adhere to the intent of the law.
Sen. Martine Gulick, D-Chittenden Central, the co-chair of the task force, said in an interview that task force members did not “see evidence that there is cost savings and improvements to quality in merging districts.”
“As we peeled back the layers, as we dug deeper into the complexity of education in Vermont and the complexity of lowering costs and improving quality, we decided it would be irresponsible just to draw lines on a map,” Gulick said.
She continued that their proposal “could save money immediately” by allowing the state’s 119 school districts to share resources and create economies of scale through shared contracting.
“In three months to dig into this level of specificity, we did a great job given those parameters, and I’m really proud of the work that we did,” she said.
Senate Pro Tem Phil Baruth said in a text message that he was waiting for the task force to issue its final report before commenting.
Speaker of the House Jill Krowinski in an email said she was “focused on ensuring our kids have the best educational opportunities at a price Vermonters can afford.”
“That is my focus for the upcoming session, and it is the mission we have had since the beginning of our education transformation work,” she said. “We’ll continue to work with the education community, the Scott administration, and all Vermonters to consider the options before us and next steps to meet our education transformation goals.”
Another proposal considered by the task force, developed by Beck and Wolk, more closely adhered to those guidelines, and had Saunders’ apparent stamp of approval.
That proposal — now discontinued, at least as far as the task force is concerned — used career and technical education regions as an organizing principle to draw lines for 13 new school districts.
But the majority of task force members declined to support that proposal and raised concerns about the size of the map’s proposed district in Chittenden County. Nearly 22,000 students would be consolidated into a single district there under the plan.
Gulick in an interview said that map did not adhere to Act 73’s parameters that new districts have anywhere from 4,000 to 8,000 students.
“It’s supposed to be logistically feasible and create the least amount of disruption,” she said. “I just don’t think that that map did those things.”
The task force will meet for the last time on Nov. 20, where it will refine and finalize its final report due to the Legislature in December.
“I do hope the Legislature looks at what we’ve done. I hope they take our recommendations to heart,” Gulick said. “But there’s no guarantee that that will happen.”

Officials with the State Court Administrative Office and the legislatively-created Trial Court Funding Commission issued implementation recommendations last week to outline how the new model could work for the state, and the benefits of a new funding model both for the judiciary itself and the courts’ largest stakeholders – the people of Michigan.
The funding issues facing the trial courts now stem from the Michigan Supreme Court’s 2014 decision in People v. Cunningham, which found it was unconstitutional to assess defendants additional fees solely to fund court operations. The commission was formed as a way to find solutions to that problem.
The new model proposed by the commission would ask the Legislature to appropriate a larger share of state funding to the trial courts in order to equalize the amount and take pressure off local units of government to sustain trial court funding. Officials with the state court office and the commission call it a “maintenance of effort” requirement, which would ensure that local units of government contribute no more than that their historic average level of funding, with the state stepping in to appropriate additional funding as needed.

final-trial-court-funding-concept-paper-for-publication 
That would create a cost-sharing model between the state Legislature and the judiciary, especially when it concerns the cost of building new court facilities or making major renovations. The commission and the state court office are also proposing a court facility grant program to support that effort.
“For too long, local governments have borne the burden of funding Michigan’s trial courts, with the state contributing less than 15%,” Michael Bosanac, administrator and chief financial officer of Monroe County. “Having the state as a more balanced funding partner will reduce pressure on local governments as the primary funding source for trial courts.”
Bosanac said the model would provide local governments with financial predictability and reduce the need for local courts to assess excessive costs on court users to generate revenue.
“The plan strives to create better outcomes for all stakeholders – especially citizens of this state,” he added.
Additionally, the recommendations call for all court-generated revenue to be moved to a new fund managed not by the courts themselves but by the state’s Department of Treasury. The plan, if given the green light by the Legislature, would give the Treasury the duty to distribute court revenues to local governments solely for judiciary functions based on costs to run the courts. The local units of government, their courts and the state court office would develop and approve court budgets moving forward if the plan is enacted.
Although funding and sustainability are among some of the top reasons for the recommendations, a big piece of the change would alleviate the conflict of interest that exists between judges administering justice and the need to impose and collect court fees and fines as a way to generate revenue for the courts they serve.
In an interview with Michigan Advance, State Court Administrator Tom Boyd said stakeholder trust, and equal access to justice without the influence of revenue collection on a judge’s sentencing decisions, were top of mind for those devising the recommendations.
“Right now, we have profit motivated policing and profit motivated court systems,” he said. “Why do we need that tension between us and the community? The idea here is that the assessment of the court costs, we can figure out, not only the cost of the plaintiff and a speeding ticket, but the cost of the court in a criminal case, we can create formulas or have flat fees so that, again, there’s no incentive for the judge to inflate those numbers.”
Boyd and Bosanac presented the recommendations on Thursday to a joint session of the House Judiciary Committee and the Senate Civil Rights, Judiciary and Public Safety Committee.

State Sen. Ruth Johnson (R-Groveland Township) asked if the plan would address situations where there were too many staff in a given court system, particularly concerning quasi-judicial staffers.
Boyd said there wasn’t a set of recommendations for individual counties yet, but local control would still run the court.
“We’re just going to tell you how many people you need,” Boyd said. “So there is a possibility that a court or two has more people than they need.”
Johnson noted that although the state court office and the commission had support from some stakeholders, the Michigan Association of Counties voiced concerns. She wondered if the judiciary was ready to move forward with the plan given that there were some who were wary of the changes.
Boyd said the consternation centered around the shifting away from guaranteed court revenue to a possible reliance on legislative appropriations.
“Is there the level of comfort with the annual appropriations process that they have with just waiting for the people in black robes to bring the cash in? There isn’t that level of comfort. We all live in this environment. We all watch the annual appropriations process,” Boyd said. “Many of us are involved in it. We trust that process. The question becomes, is it comfortable? No, as Mike [Bosanac] said, there’s going to be concern, because we’re moving from a steady stream of revenue coming from the judicial branch to back to the legislative branch, to say it’s your responsibility and your authority that’s being exercised on an annual basis. There will be concern about that.”
State Rep. Sarah Lightner (R-Springport), chair of the House committee, said she had concerns about some of the recommendations, but saw this plan as a good first step. She wondered about the phase in period of the new fund and other aspects. If the part of the plan aimed to avoid another round of kicking the sunset date down the line, Lightner said the heavy lift of the request would require another legislative vote to extend the sunset.
“There’s going to be more robust conversation on the function of some of these because … assessments and stuff like that don’t even fall under the judiciary budget. It’s under the Department of Corrections or general government, or whatever it may be,” Lightner said. “And I’m just curious what the plan is to kind of back fill some of the assessments, because it does end up being a lot of money, especially when you talk about in the trial court fund that no monies will ever lapse.”
Lightner added that she did have a desire to make the plan work.
On Friday, state Rep. Jay DeBoyer (R-Clay Township), a member of the House committee, questioned the commission’s assessment that inadequate funding resulted in abuses of broad sentencing discretion and the imposition of fees to make up budget deficits.
DeBoyer said the proposed changes refuse to delve into root causes of poorly run county court systems and that well-run courts shouldn’t see their funding impacted.
“This would require good actors who do not run a budget deficit to continually subsidize irresponsible actors. There are a handful of counties in our state that struggle with their court operations costs due to a variety of factors, including rampant mismanagement, ineffective collection methods, and other things,” DeBoyer said in a statement. “Counties like ones I represent should not be forced to pay for other counties who do not have their acts together and aren’t operating effectively. Robbing Peter to pay Paul is not a plan, and it is a gateway to use this same approach with other funding shortfalls.”

(Photo: Greg Childress/NC Newsline)Siembra NC, a North Carolina immigrant rights group, has launched a digital map showing where federal immigration officials have been sighted across the state.The goal is to help immigrants make informed decisions about their routes to school and work.
The website, called Ojo Obrero (“Look out, workers”), compiles sightings of immigration enforcement activity into a single, statewide map. Organizers say the tool is meant to counter misinformation and give communities a better sense of where enforcement activity has taken place as federal operations continue to disrupt daily life.
“We want this to be a resource for people to get a clear picture and make decisions accordingly,” Emanuel Gomez Gonzalez, Siembra NC communications strategist, told reporters during a virtual press conference. 
The map includes only verified sightings of federal immigration operations. Each report must be backed by video or testimonial evidence reviewed by attorneys and volunteer networks. Organizers said most initial reports don’t meet that standard and are left out. 
The information is not updated in real time. It can take several days to verify whether an incident involved federal agents or whether it was just local law enforcement activity.
“This is a tool designed to provide a point of reference for how those patterns are actually taking place in our state,” Gonzalez said, “to allow people to continue to go about their day to day lives, even as we anticipate rumors and sightings of federal immigration agents to increase.”
The platform allows users to filter incidents by type, such as traffic stops, and by time of day, helping parents and workers plan travel routes, especially during early-morning hours when enforcement actions are more common.
The website offers several tools beyond the map, including a digital “red card” with know-your-rights guidance, a chatbot trained on ACLU materials, and translation features for interacting with law enforcement.
It also provides county-level data on traffic-related arrests that have led to ICE detention. Siembra NC said risks are higher in Gaston, Union, and Montgomery counties, as well as in counties that recently signed 287(g) agreements, which allow local law enforcement to work more closely with immigration authorities.
The group cautioned that the map is not comprehensive and often shows only where federal agents were present, not whether arrests occurred.
Recent incidents cited by the organization include traffic stops in Sampson County, where Newton Grove police pulled over at least eight workers last week, and an October arrest in the Catawba County town of Brookford, where a man stopped for driving without a license was later handed over to ICE under a new local-federal agreement.
“Everyone deserves to get to work, school and back home safely,” Siembra NC co-director Nikki Marín Baena said in the release. She added that many immigrant workers are legally barred from obtaining driver’s licenses, calling arrests that lead to ICE detention “cruelty” that harms the state’s economy.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Image-1-1024x863.jpeg,,,2025-11-14 15:58:38.563912

(Photo by U.S. Department of Agriculture).The Missouri Department of Social Services announced Thursday that it will continue to issue partial payments of federal food benefits for November, while updating its systems to resume paying full amounts.
The announcement comes after President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed legislation funding the federal government through the end of January and ending the shutdown he cited as the cause of delayed payments from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.
“With federal funding back in place, our team is moving swiftly to issue full November benefits,” said Jess Bax, director of the department, in a press release.
Baylee Watts, the department’s media director, said in an email that the department is working with its electronic benefits vendor to distribute full November benefits.
“As soon as we have confirmed the timing and what that will look like for different participants, we’ll be able to share more,” Watts said.
States across the country scrambled to comply with rapid-fire changes to federal guidance on whether and how to issue SNAP payments while Congress remained gridlocked on expiring healthcare tax credits.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture threatened on Saturday to impose financial penalties on states that had paid out full monthly benefits in keeping with a judge’s order on Nov. 6 that USDA fund the program. USDA had already changed its instructions on the amount of benefits states could include in partial payments.
Missouri began distributing partial benefits on Tuesday, with enrollees in the program receiving up to 65% of their normal monthly funds.
The intricacies of USDA directives on partial payments forced state agencies to make complex calculations under pressure, said Christine Woody, food security policy coordinator at Empower Missouri, a nonprofit that advocates for low-income residents.
“The (state) department did not cause this,” Woody said, “and they were working with what they had.”
Recipients qualifying for the maximum allowed for their household, according to USDA instructions, received 65% of their regular benefits. Households eligible for less than the maximum saw their payments reduced by a further 30% of their income. Initial guidance told states to reduce maximum allotments by 50%.
USDA “strongly encouraged” states in a policy memo Thursday to “begin the process of upgrading systems and updating state procedures” to make partial payments more quickly in the future. The memo noted that, even after Wednesday’s appropriations bill, there aren’t enough contingency funds to make full SNAP payments in November 2026 “in the event of a lapse of appropriations next year.”
Woody said Empower Missouri will advocate for more federal support in case SNAP runs out of funding in a future shutdown.
“I believe that there are things that the federal government could do,” Woody said, “to ensure that there’s more money in those contingency funds.”

Department of Corrections)COLUMBIA — A Sumter County man who killed three during a crime spree 21 years ago is set to die by firing squad at 6 p.m. Friday.
Barring a final, unlikely intervention, 44-year-old Stephen Bryant will become the fifth person executed in South Carolina this year and the seventh since the process resumed in September 2024. Bryant pleaded guilty in 2008 to fatally shooting three people during a string of burglaries.
Nationwide, 42 people have been executed this year, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.

Bryant’s attorneys made a single final appeal to attempt to halt his execution, arguing lower courts never heard evidence that he suffered from fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. The state Supreme Court rejected that argument, allowing his execution to go ahead.
As of Friday afternoon, Bryant’s attorneys had not appealed that decision to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Gov. Henry McMaster could choose to commute Bryant’s sentence to life in prison, though the former prosecutor has not done so for any of the other six inmates put to death during his time in office.
Bryant opted to die by firing squad instead of lethal injection or electrocution, the other two methods allowed in state law. He will become the third person in the state to die using that method, putting South Carolina on par for the highest number of executions using firing squad. Utah is the only other state to have used the method since the death penalty resumed nationwide in 1976.
The state’s protocols for firing squad came under scrutiny after attorneys for the most recent inmate executed using the method, Mikal Mahdi, claimed the bullets mostly missed his heart. An autopsy of Mahdi showed two bullet holes instead of the expected three, leading lawyers to claim one of the marksmen missed.
Department of Corrections officials maintain nothing went wrong. Two bullets struck Mahdi in the exact same place, spokeswoman Chrysti Shain has said.
The crimes
Bryant was still on probation following three years in prison for attempted burglary when his deadly crime spree started Oct. 5, 2004, with a Sumter County home robbery. His plans, however, began before that, attorneys argued during his 2008 sentencing hearing.
For several days, Bryant drove his blue-and-white pickup truck around rural Sumter County, approaching isolated homes and spinning tales to anyone who answered the door when he knocked.
On Oct. 4, Bryant came to the home of Tom Dennis, which sat on several hundred acres of property far back from the road. Bryant told Dennis his brother stole his pickup truck and he needed help getting it out of a ditch, Dennis testified in court.
Dennis helped Bryant out and thought little of the interaction. The next day, Bryant returned to rob the house after Dennis left to attend Clemson’s homecoming football game. When Dennis went out to his office in an adjoining building the next morning, he discovered someone had stolen his laptop, briefcase and bag of money.
Bryant repeated his method three days later with James Ammons, another rural homeowner. That time, Bryant took only Ammons’ .40-caliber semiautomatic rifle and the shells Ammons kept on the nightstand.
Over the following days, Bryant used that gun to shoot four people, killing three.
The first came later that same day. Bryant went out to a popular fishing spot along the Wateree River. He walked up and down the Richland County side of the river, where Clinton Brown was fishing.
After a brief conversation, Bryant walked away. A few moments later, Brown felt a shot in his back, he testified in court. When he turned around, Bryant was already gone, he said.
Brown drove himself to the hospital, where he stayed for nine days but survived the gunshot wound. Brown died in 2017, at the age of 69.
The next day, Bryant went to his friend Cliff Gainey’s house to smoke marijuana and drink some beers, Bryant said in a later statement to police. When the beers ran out, Bryant drove the two of them to a nearby convenience store, where security video showed Gainey entering the store, then returning to Bryant’s truck parked outside, according to court records.
Bryant drove around for a while, until Gainey asked him to pull over so he could “take a leak,” Bryant told police. In separate statements, Bryant told police he thought Gainey was taking a knife out of his waistband, then that he thought Gainey was making sexual advances toward him.
Regardless of what happened, Bryant shot Gainey three times, he said.
“I don’t know exactly why I shot Cliff,” Bryant later said in a statement to police. “Only thing I can (think) is his actions brought back a bad memory and I felt scared.”
Bryant remembered “sitting on my knees crying for him because he was a friend,” police testified Bryant told them. When a passerby pulled up, Bryant got back in his truck and fled, he later told police.
Bryant went back to Gainey’s house and took all the electronics from the living room, along with a fish tank from his bedroom. At some point, Bryant started a fire, in what he claimed was an accident but prosecutors said was an act of arson.
Two days later, on Oct. 11, Bryant killed 62-year-old Willard Tietjen, who friends and family called TJ.
Bryant had come to Tietjen’s house several days earlier, claiming he needed to see Tietjen’s phone book to try and track down a friend’s phone number. Tietjen helped, and Bryant left without incident, Tietjen’s wife, Millard Tietjen, testified.
When he returned, Bryant said he told Tietjen his truck had overheated. Tietjen invited him in and began to talk about religion before becoming hostile, Bryant told police. Bryant shot him nine times, an autopsy showed.
Bryant stayed in Tietjen’s house long after killing him. He smoked Tietjen’s cigarettes and used his computer. He took Tietjen’s Masonic ring off his finger and cleaned off the blood in the sink. He rearranged the furniture and lit candles over Tietjen’s body, police testified.
“He was there for hours, enjoying his work, admiring what he had done,” solicitor Kelly Jackson told the judge during his trial.
When Tietjen’s wife and daughter called to check on him, Bryant answered his cellphone, calling himself “the prowler” and telling the women he killed Tietjen, the victim’s relatives testified in court.
Bryant also burned Tietjen’s eyes with a lit cigarette, set his goatee on fire and used Tietjen’s blood to write messages on the wall for police, according to court documents.
“Victim number four in two weeks, catch me if you can,” Bryant wrote on one wall, some of the letters in blood. On another was the word “catch,” also in blood, police testified.
Bryant’s note seemed to suggest he already planned to kill again, prosecutors argued. Two days later, around 4 a.m., he picked up Chris Burgess at a gas station, loaded his bicycle into the back of his pickup truck and drove off.
A hunter found Burgess’ body on the side of the road, shot three times, in a similar manner to Gaines, investigators testified.
“It was over for me,” Bryant told police he was thinking at the time.
Police arrested Bryant later that day. After initially trying to blame someone else, he confessed to the police, according to court testimony.
During his time in jail, Bryant racked up more charges for threatening a detention officer and severely beating another. Bryant pleaded guilty to all the charges he faced.
Prosecutors sought the death penalty for Tietjen’s killing because Bryant’s theft of jewelry and other items from the house qualified as an aggravating offense, according to court records. He received life sentences for the other slayings.
The victims
Most mornings, Bob Summers stopped by his friend Tietjen’s house for coffee, he testified during Bryant’s sentencing hearing. The morning of Tietjen’s death, Summers called to tell Tietjen a joke, as he often did.
Tietjen liked jokes, and he told good ones, Summers said. Summers liked to give him gag gifts, and he planned to give Tietjen a tie that looked like a bottle of Tabasco hot sauce before his death, he said.
Tietjen worked for the Air Force for 23 years, maintaining radar systems, his wife of 39 years testified. After retiring in 1985, he worked at hardware and electronics stores before eventually going into the insurance business, she said.
Tietjen was active in the local Masonic Lodge, and he was a Shriner, including driving a buggy he kept in the basement every time a parade happened in the area, she said.
When asked if she understood that Bryant could be put to death for killing her husband, Millard Tietjen told defense attorneys she was OK with that.
“I can’t say it would make it any better, but I feel he deserves a punishment because he made the choice to do what he did,” she said during the 2008 hearing.
Chris Gainey was 14 when Bryant shot his dad, Cliff Gainey, to death by the side of a road. During the sentencing hearing, he recalled fishing with his dad and watching movies, though he added he didn’t remember much else about their time together.
“The only thing I really remember, he used to always comment on me being — just always said I look just like him,” Chris Gainey testified. “My mama still says the same thing.”
Chris Burgess’ family missed him every day, his mother, Christine Burgess, wrote in a letter read out loud in court.
“We all loved him dearly,” the letter said. “The pain and suffering of this family will never go away.”
Stephen Bryant
In the months leading up to the killings, Bryant tried to get help for his deteriorating mental state, his aunt and grandmother told a judge.
That August, two months before his crime spree, Bryant sat down with his grandmother and aunt to ask for help. At his grandmother’s home, he clenched his hands on her glass-top coffee table, causing the whole table to shake, she recalled during his 2008 trial.
Bryant told the two about how his grandfather, his uncle and his older half-brother sexually and physically abused him throughout his childhood.
“He looked like he was being tortured,” his aunt, Terry Lee Bryant Caulder, testified during his trial. “It’s like his soul was just laid wide open. In his eyes, you could see he was hurting and suffering and he was living the abuse over again as it was coming out, what he was telling us.”
His grandmother, Shirley Freeman, suggested Bryant call a sexual abuse hotline, she said. Caulder found the number and handed the phone off to Bryant, who spoke to the person on the other end for a while, she testified.
The hotline seemed to offer no resources. His probation officer referred him to a nearby counseling center, but Bryant couldn’t afford to pay for the services, so he left without getting help.
He couldn’t sleep on the nights he picked up his victims at gas stations. He told police he remembered only bits and pieces of each incident, which experts testified could have been a symptom of his post-traumatic stress disorder, according to court records.
Bryant grew up in a troubled home, his attorneys have argued to multiple courts. His parents met and conceived him in a rehabilitation facility, though neither got sober. His mother drank during her pregnancy with him, she told attorneys during his appeals process.
Starting at the age of 17, he spent much of his life in and out of jail, always for non-violent offenses, defense attorneys said during his sentencing hearing.
The trauma of his early life, combined with the developmental effects of his mother’s drinking during her pregnancy, caused Bryant to snap and act outside his normal frame of mind, his attorneys argued during his appeals.
During his 17 years on death row, Bryant received two disciplinary sanctions, one for fighting without a weapon in 2009, and one for possessing a weapon in 2023, according to prison records.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/execution.jpg,,,2025-11-14 15:58:38.563912

The Executive Committee of the Legislative Council, made up of party leaders in both chambers, approved a pilot program earlier this year for video streaming in five committee rooms. Previously, only audio was livestreamed and archived for committee hearings, making Colorado an outlier among state legislatures.
Since then, people accessed committee video livestreams over 15,000 times during 35 meetings between July 30 and Nov. 5, according to a report from Legislative Council Staff. About 60% of those views were related to the planning, proceedings and aftermath of the special legislative session in August. The most-viewed meeting was an economic forecast to the Joint Budget Committee on Sept. 22.

“A major change during the process of the pilot project was that users can now see live slide presentations,” LCS Director Natalie Castle told lawmakers on Friday morning. “That was one of the things we heard from people that they were really happy to be able to see.”
The video stream shows the same view as a committee participant on Zoom, with a fixed wide shot on the committee room dais, remote participants and any materials being presented.
The pilot program has been extended until the end of the year.
“Video can make it easier for people to follow committee testimony as well as statements made by committee members, especially when speakers aren’t identified,” reads a letter of support from the Colorado Freedom of Information Coalition and other organizations to Legislative Council. “Video provides context, allowing observers to see who is present and to gauge the emotions and reactions of lawmakers and others in the room.

The Colorado General Assembly is currently the only state legislature in the country that does not provide video of committee hearings, according to a document shared earlier this year by the CFOIC.
The executive committee will vote on whether to make video streaming permanent at their next meeting. It would cost $20,000 to set up and then $50,000 per year, primarily for storage costs.

Josh Stein speaks to reporters in Raleigh on Oct. 20, 2025. (Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)Governor Josh Stein is urging the public to not be provoked as U.S. Border Patrol agents arrive in Charlotte this weekend.
Stein said in a statement Friday that the agents arriving in Mecklenburg County should be focused on arresting violent criminals and drug traffickers.
“Unfortunately, that’s not always what we have seen with ICE and Border Patrol Agents in Chicago and elsewhere around the country,” said Stein. “The vast majority of people they have detained have no criminal convictions, and some are American citizens.”
Stein encouraged North Carolinians to remain peaceful and follow the law as they stand with their neighbors, and to document and report any problems with federal agents.
“When we see injustice, we bear witness. If you see any inappropriate behavior, use your phones to record and notify local law enforcement, who will continue to keep our communities safe long after these federal agents leave. That’s the North Carolina way.”
‘They need to stay home’
Congresswoman Alma Adams (NC-12) didn’t mince words Friday when asked about the Border Patrol arriving in her district in an ongoing aggressive immigration enforcement by the Trump administration.

“First of all, I think they need to stay home. We don’t need that kind of disruption,” said Adams. “We don’t need them coming in here antagonizing our citizens.”
The veteran Democratic congresswoman said she has heard from numerous constituents worried about how immigration enforcement will unfold in the Queen City.
“When I look at what has happened in other cities, how people have been treated, abused, even in physical ways, we don’t want that in Charlotte. We don’t need that in Charlotte,” Adams told reporters.
On Thursday, U.S. Rep. Tim Moore (NC-14), who also represents parts of Charlotte, said he supports bringing the Border Patrol into the city.
“I’m glad that they’re looking at doing that, and I’m glad at the way they’re approaching it,” said Moore in Raleigh.
U.S. Customs and Border Patrol does not comment on its plans, but Moore predicted the CBP would likely stay “for a while” and focus on organized crime.

Charlotte has been in the national spotlight since the killing of Ukrainian immigrant Iryna Zarutska on the city’s light rail system. The event prompted state lawmakers to pass an expansive crime bill this fall, which Gov. Stein signed.
Adams has said she prays for Zarutska’s family, but it is shameful for lawmakers to try to score cheap political points from the tragedy.
On Friday, Adams said the nation has watched immigration enforcement officials come into other cities only to have the situation quickly spiral out of control for the undocumented, the documented, and even local citizens.
“I just think that’s just unconscionable,” Adams lamented.
Like Stein, Adams is encouraging people who are planning to protest Border Patrol enforcement to do so peacefully.
“We certainly hope that these folks coming in here will just pass through and continue on their way,” said Adams.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_3910-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-14 15:58:38.563912

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)Following a long and occasionally contentious Water Quality Control Commission meeting on Thursday, commissioners voted 7-4 to vacate a controversial vote from last summer that would have advanced a petition from an oil-and-gas industry-aligned group to expand the use of treated oil and gas wastewater, known as produced water.
Earlier this year, the WQCC adopted rules to allow for oil and gas wastewater pilot projects, but no discharges into surface or groundwater, a decision seen as a victory for environmental groups.
In June, a new petition by the industry-backed Water, Access, Treatment and Reuse Alliance requested the 12-member WQCC  rewrite its May rule, and allow 13 counties to use “treated produced water” for uses such as watering livestock, “non-food crops,” construction and releases into the environment.
The WQCC subsequently, at a July 8 meeting, set a hearing on the WATR Alliance petition and, in its August meeting, amid strong opposition, rejected motions to quash the petition.
Several environmental groups in response filed motions for the board to vacate the July vote allowing the petition to proceed, and to disqualify seven of the WQCC’s members, saying their “impartiality and fairness” were “compromised by interference” from Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham. 
The latter allegation came in response to Santa Fe New Mexican reporting on an emailed exchange in July between staff at the governor’s office and cabinet heads appointed to the WQCC that encouraged them to attend the August meeting in-person and get the Water, Access, Treatment and Reuse (WATR) Alliances petition “over the finish line.” Those revelations also led to a protest outside the state environment department in September, with demonstrators calling for Environment Secretary James Kenney’s resignation.
Amid strong opposition, New Mexico water board lets plan for more oil and gas wastewater use proceed

The governor’s office has previously denied any wrongdoing. She has previously cited the state’s limited water supplies as a reason to explore expanded uses for oilfield wastewater. 
The governor’s Communications Director Michael Coleman, in response to Thursday’s vote, said, “while it’s disappointing that the WQCC vacated the hearing prior to considering extensive water reuse research conducted in recent years, the Lujan Grisham administration will continue to work with stakeholders to implement the 50-Year Water Action Plan. The governor is focused on adopting comprehensive, science-based water reuse rules that are legally required under the Produced Water Act and crucial to protecting and preserving our freshwater resources for generations.”
The WQCC decided the decision of disqualification became “moot” after it vacated its July 8 vote.
Representatives from numerous conservation groups praised Thursday’s vote, with New Energy Economy Executive Director Mariel Nanasi calling it in a statement, a “huge victory for the people” and the now-overturned vote “the product of bias, undue influence, and a predetermined outcome.”
Tannis Fox, senior attorney at the Western Environmental Law Center, also said in a statement that the commission had “done the right thing…by wiping the state clean and avoiding any appearance of impropriety.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Zain-and-Vittoria-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-14 15:58:38.563912

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma public schools won’t be able to adopt new social studies textbooks next year with academic standards for the subject still in flux. 
The State Textbook Committee voted Friday to suspend indefinitely the social studies textbook adoption cycle while the state Supreme Court and the Oklahoma State Department of Education consider what to do with the academic standards. 
A September Court order paused implementation of the new social studies standards, which became highly controversial for including Bible teachings and dubious claims about the 2020 presidential election and COVID-19. Public records show 12 textbook publishers chose not to return to Oklahoma after the new standards were approved.
Those 12 companies, including major publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, are currently on the state’s approved list but didn’t submit a bid this year for reapproval. Companies have withdrawn from Oklahoma before during a math adoption cycle in 2023.
Some of those companies informed the Education Department they had concerns about new content included in the social studies standards, said Sharon Morgan, program director for the agency’s Office of Standards and Learning.
“There were a few publishers that we’re familiar with that did reach out,” Morgan said. “They were concerned about a few of the objectives in the 2025 social studies standards, and they let us know that they would not be bidding.”
State Textbook Committee chairperson Sharon Morgan speaks during a meeting Friday at the Oklahoma State Department of Education in Oklahoma City. (Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)
Morgan said she doesn’t recall which publishers this entailed. She said the companies didn’t specify what new content was the source of their concerns, only that “they did not feel they could bid.”
The state received 12 bidders this year, including four not currently on the approved list.
In a typical cycle, the State Textbook Committee would have voted in November on final textbook adoption after considering review committees’ evaluations of each publisher. That vote would establish an approved list that schools could choose from when spending their textbook funds.
That vote couldn’t happen Friday with the social studies standards on hold, said Morgan, who was recently appointed as the committee’s chairperson.
“We’re hoping this is resolved by February and we know what our standards are,” she told the committee during Friday’s meeting.
In the meantime, public schools will continue using social studies standards and textbooks adopted in 2019.
New state Superintendent Lindel Fields said his administration intends to reexamine the 2025 standards. He told news reporters last month he expects “there will be some changes to them,” which would need agreement from the Oklahoma State Board of Education and the state Legislature.
Fields replaced former state Superintendent Ryan Walters in October. Walters, who resigned Sept. 30, led the development of the 2025 social studies standards.
Publishers would have another opportunity to bid once the standards are finalized, Morgan said. Having a final version of the standards by February would give companies time to decide whether to submit an intent to bid by April.
Delays in the current adoption cycle could force the textbook committee and its review teams to consider both social studies and science materials in 2026, Morgan said. It also could push three other subjects on the 2026 schedule — health, physical education and vocational education — to later years, she said.

(Screen capture by Kansas Reflector from MPSC meeting)TOPEKA — Missouri utility regulators on Thursday approved a tariff to ensure large power users on its system are responsible for paying their fair share of the effect their usage has on the power grid and other customers. 
The Missouri Public Service Commission approved a large-load tariff submitted by Evergy, which operates in Kansas and Missouri, and that was supported by most parties in the case. 
Unlike in Kansas, where a large-user tariff was unanimously agreed to by all intervenors, including business, environmental groups and a data service coalition, two groups did not support the Missouri order.
Missouri Public Service Commission staff and the Missouri Office of Public Counsel, an organization that advocates for small business and residential customers, did not support the order. 
In fact, the staff and OPC submitted a separate proposal that commission chairwoman Kayla Hahn said was too confusing and could cause large users to avoid locating in Missouri.
“Staff’s proposal requires upwards of 25 different charges that a large user could be subject to paying,” she said. “The evidence showed us the vast amount of charges and uncertainty make it unclear if a large user would be paying too much, too little or more likely if a large user would forgo locating in Missouri altogether as even a sophisticated user would be unable to predict what its ultimate bill responsibility would be.”
The tariff reflects broad stakeholder consensus and “contains strong safeguards to ensure that large new loads pay their fair share while enabling growth that benefits Missouri,” the commissioners said in the order.
Large-load users were defined in the order as those requiring 75 megawatts per month at peak times, a parallel to the Kansas order approved Nov. 6 by the Kansas Corporation Commission.
“I’m satisfied that this will result in the large-load customers bearing the financial responsibility for the costs that are incurred for infrastructure improvement, be they transmission or generation,” said commissioner John Mitchell. “I’m also satisfied that the agreement does establish reasonable protections both for the existing customers and for the large-load customers, and ensure that the large-load customers will pay their fair share.”
Evergy spokeswoman Gina Penzig said Missouri rates include similar protections to those put in place in Kansas for existing customers by ensuring that companies pay their fair share for access to the grid. The rate for these new large customers is higher than that paid by existing commercial and industrial customers. 
“This premium rate helps pay for modernization and maintenance of the power grid that is shared by all our customers,” she said. “In both Kansas and Missouri the commissions have recognized the value of attracting large energy users and the importance of making sure existing customers don’t foot the bill.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Hahn-at-mpsc-1024x565.png,,,2025-11-14 15:58:38.563912

The Mississippi Board of Education voted to take over the school district during a special called meeting Friday. District officials had reached out to the state education agency on Oct. 30 because the school system couldn’t make its November payroll. 
“This was a difficult but necessary decision to protect the educational interests of students in Okolona,” State Superintendent Lance Evans said in a statement. “The financial challenges facing this district have reached a point where state intervention is required to ensure students continue to receive the education they deserve.”
Over the past two weeks, Mississippi Department of Education officials have been meeting with district leaders to determine the financial state of Okolona schools. The district sent the agency some paperwork that show a budget shortfall of more than $100,000, but other financial documents, such as payments to vendors, were incomplete, according to information state education officials presented.
Education department officials discovered that the district hasn’t had a financial audit since 2021, and has been outspending since fiscal year 2023-24. 
“That’s part of the work … for our staff to perform, really, a forensic account and review of their finances,” said Kymberly Wiggins, the agency’s chief operating officer.
The state board determined today that the district’s situation was critical enough to warrant a takeover, citing ongoing insolvency and a pattern of financial mismanagement and accreditation violations. Effective immediately, John Ferrell, the agency’s chief of school and district transformation, will become Okolona’s interim superintendent. The district will get financial relief through the state’s school district emergency assistance fund. 
Without intervention, Okolona schools would continue to have “an inadequate and unstable educational environment, thereby denying the students of the district the opportunity to learn to excel and to obtain a free and appropriate public education,” said Matt Miller, president of the state board of education.
The state took over the district in 2010 for similar financial issues and accreditation violations. Okolona was also academically failing then. The state returned the district to local control in 2012.
“This is a total shock to me,” said Okolona Mayor Sherman Carouthers, a lifelong resident of the area. “We’ve seen so much improvement. You’ve really caught me off guard. This is something I’m going to have to process.”
Since 2017, the district’s academic rating has improved from a D to a B. 
“The educator part of the district has done quite well,” state board member Mary Werner said during the meeting. “But the leadership has failed miserably.” 
Barbara Carouthers, the Okolona school board chaplain and a distant relative of the mayor, would not answer questions when reached by Mississippi Today.

Indiana lawmakers were scheduled to meet starting Dec. 1 to consider drawing more Republican-leaning U.S. House districts ahead of next year’s midterm elections — following a months-long pressure campaign by Trump’s administration and his supporters.

Ten colleges from four nearby states have filed a brief in support of Middlebury College, arguing the case has broader implications on colleges' and nonprofits' obligations to donors who contribute gifts.

Former Vermont Gov. Jim Douglas has appealed his lawsuit against Middlebury College to the Vermont Supreme Court — the latest development in a years-long legal dispute over the naming of the college’s Middlebury Chapel.
Douglas’ lawsuit, first filed in 2023, sought to reverse a decision to remove former Gov. John A. Mead’s name from the college’s chapel. Mead’s descendents supported Douglas’ appointment as a special administrator of Mead’s estate before he filed suit.
Mead served as Vermont’s 53rd governor of Vermont from 1910 to 1912. Douglas, meanwhile, served as the state’s 80th governor from 2003 to 2011.

The building had for a century stood as the Mead Memorial Chapel, named after the former governor and longtime trustee of the college. But in 2021, the college, amid a statewide reckoning over Vermont’s history of eugenics, decided to rename the building, Middlebury Chapel.
Douglas argued this was a breach of contract and of good faith. Mead, who helped the college pay for the chapel’s construction, included in his offer that the chapel bear the Mead name in perpetuity, Douglas said in court documents.
Vermont Superior Court Robert Mello in April granted Middlebury College summary judgement, dismissing Douglas’ claims and resolving the case without a trial.
But Douglas, in his appeal to the Supreme Court, argues that the Superior Court erred when it concluded that there were no naming terms laid out in the contract between the college and Mead. The court, Douglas said in legal documents, instead “imposed its interpretation of a ‘reasonable time’ for the name to remain on the chapel — which it decreed was 100 years.”
The former governor is asking the court to remand the case back to Superior Court to consider whether there was a clear contract with an enforceable promise — that is, “whether the Mead name would remain on the chapel as a memorial, for as long as the building existed,” Douglas said in court filings.
“The structure that John Mead built was both a Memorial and a Chapel, and memorials have no end-date; they are always meant to be for as long as the memorial stands,” Douglas wrote in an email.
An attorney representing the college did not respond to a voicemail seeking comment, and a media relations employee with the college did not return a request for comment. The college previously argued in Superior Court that no clear request to keep the name in perpetuity can be found in available documents.
“John Abner Mead had the gratification of seeing his wishes for construction of a prominent chapel on Middlebury’s campus brought to fruition — and, indeed, that chapel bore his name in recognition of the gift for over a century thereafter,” the college wrote in a Superior Court filing. “But, as Mead did not expressly condition his gift on the use of his name, Middlebury was not legally bound to preserve the appellation ‘Mead Memorial Chapel’ name in perpetuity.”
The legal case serves as a reminder of Vermont’s history with eugenics in the early 20th century. In his appeal, Douglas makes the argument that Middlebury College itself was much more influential in that movement than Mead.
But the matter has also drawn the attention of other colleges and universities who argue the case has broader implications to consider regarding colleges’ and nonprofits’ obligations to donors who contribute gifts.
Ten colleges from four nearby states — including Tufts University, Amherst College and Wellesley College — have filed an amicus brief with the court in support of Middlebury College.
These types of institutions, lawyers wrote in legal documents, handle tens of thousands of donations, some made generations ago. The handling of these gifts are settled under common law, “which generally prohibit donor standing to pursue claims with respect to a completed gift,” they wrote.
A departure from that practice, the colleges argue, “would upend the current system,” they wrote in the brief. 
“It would result in significantly increased litigation for the courts as well as unnecessary administrative and legal costs for institutions like Middlebury and the colleges, requiring them to expend funds that would otherwise support their charitable purposes,” they wrote.
‘The altar of public relations’
The state Superior Court noted in its decision to dismiss the case that “no explicit reference to perpetuity” existed at the time. Douglas argues in his appeal that none was necessary.
“Why would anyone have foreseen the need to have a ‘perpetual clause’ dictating the behavior of a college whose leaders were his dear friends?” Douglas said in court documents. “Even the judge allowed for the fact that there could have been a contract — he just decided that if there was one, it had expired. We believe that a jury should make that determination.”
The Supreme Court has yet to schedule a hearing on the matter.
The college, in its removal of Mead’s name, pointed to a farewell speech that Mead made to Vermont’s General Assembly in 1912 where he espoused eugenicist ideas.
Mead told lawmakers in his speech that a “class of individuals in whose mental or nervous construction there is something lacking” were “increasing out of all proportion to the normal growth of the population.”
He continued that “most of the insane, the epileptics, the imbeciles, the idiots, the sexual perverts, together with many of the confirmed inebriates, prostitutes, tramps and criminals” in state’s jails, asylums and poor farms were “the results of these intermarriages or the natural offspring of defective parents.”
Mead encouraged lawmakers in Vermont to consider “how best to restrain this defective class and how best to restrict the propagation of defective children,” he said.
Douglas has said previously that Mead’s speech ultimately did not have a significant impact on Vermont’s eugenic sterilization policies, which were instituted after Mead’s death in 1920.
In his appeal, Douglas said that Mead, in his 1912 address, was “speaking as a physician,” that he “cautiously referenced vasectomy as a safer alternative to other sterilization practices,” and was “motivated by medical concern for women’s health rather than ideological adherence to eugenics.”
Douglas instead pointed to the college’s own history with eugenics, and wrote in his appeal that the college “sought to distance itself from Vermont’s eugenics history by scapegoating Mead while concealing its own extensive role.”
The college for more than 50 years, he said, “promoted eugenics through teaching, scholarship, and advocacy — even after the Holocaust revealed the catastrophic consequences of eugenic theory.”
Douglas in his appeal likened the college’s removal of the Mead name from the chapel to a “hypocritical public relations smear campaign to scapegoat” Mead.
The college “sacrificed Governor Mead on the altar of public relations,” Douglas wrote, and “used him as a subterfuge to conceal the fact that Middlebury College was literally, a Eugenicist Factory, for over 50 years.”
The college had courses in sociology, biology and zoology that emphasized race, heredity and biological problems, Douglas wrote, and the college was one of 44 institutions listed in the 1914 Journal Heredity as teaching eugenics.
In an email, Douglas said the institutions arguing in support of Middlebury College “want to maintain their aversion to allowing unpopular views on their campuses & to ensure the right to cancel their own generous alumni donors.”
“If I were to present a substantial gift to a college, I’d be concerned that, at some point in the future, its leaders would discover some obscure statement of mine that justifies the same shabby treatment that was visited on Gov. Mead,” he wrote.

Wintersteen spoke in front of the board about ISU’s accomplishments and efficiencies for the last time Thursday before her coming retirement in January. Members of the board, as well as University of Northern Iowa President Mark Nook and University of Iowa President Barbara Wilson, said Wintersteen will be missed.
“The Iowa Board of Regents expresses its deep gratitude to President Wintersteen for her expertise, dedication and extraordinary service to the board of regents, Iowa State University, its students and families and all Iowans,” Bates said.

The ISU president expressed her gratitude for the board as well, saying she sees “the countless hours, energy and effort that every regent provides for this voluntary service,” and every Iowan owes them a big thanks for their commitment.
While Wintersteen has been serving as ISU president — the first woman in the role, Bates said — for nine years, her tenure at the university spans nearly five decades. She was also one of the first women to work as an ISU Extension associate in integrated pest management, according to her online biography, and earned her doctorate in entomology before becoming a professor of the topic.
Wintersteen also held different administrative roles at ISU throughout her career, including dean of the college of agriculture and life sciences and director of the Iowa Agriculture and Home Economics Experiment Station, her biography stated. She officially became ISU’s president on Nov. 20, 2017.
“Under her leadership, Iowa State raised a record breaking $1.5242 billion for the Forever True for Iowa State campaign with $500 million dedicated for student support, including more than 50,000 donor funded scholarships,” Bates said.
The board selected North Dakota State University President David Cook to succeed Wintersteen as president, but with his contract beginning March 1 and Wintersteen’s ending at the beginning of January, an interim president was needed to fill the gap.
Bates announced at the board’s Thursday meeting that David Spalding, ISU vice president for economic development and industry relations, will serve as interim president starting Jan. 3. His annual salary was set at $600,000.

Three county commissions in Southeastern New Mexico have met so far this month to select nominees to replace Nicholas Paul in the state Senate. 
Paul, a Republican in Alamogordo, announced his resignation in mid-October due to health reasons after less than a year in the seat. Because Senate District 33 covers parts of three counties, commissions in Otero, Chaves and Lincoln Counties met to nominate potential replacements.
All three selected different names, one of the nominees and officials from the counties told Source New Mexico this week. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham will choose from that list a senator to serve the rest of Paul’s term, which ends in 2028.
The three nominees are current state Rep. John Block (R-Carlsbad), along with Lincoln County Commission Chair Mark Fischer and Rex Wilson, who was the Southern region director of Presbyterian Medical Services until 2024.

The governor is expected to choose Paul’s replacement before the 30-day legislative session begins Jan. 20, according to Brandon Harris, a Senate GOP spokesperson. 
The county commissions considered eight potential replacements, according to commission meeting minutes. Other candidates included Ruidoso Mayor Lynn Crawford, Otero County Attorney RB Nichols, former state Rep. Zachary Cook, business owner Benjamin Luna Jr., and Matthew Wade, a former 12th Judicial District deputy district attorney.
Otero County’s pick: Rep. John Block
In a cover letter, Block, who has represented House District 51 since 2023, said he should replace Paul in the Senate due to his record in the House, where he noted his “impeccable” attendance at interim legislative meetings and regular rankings as the most conservative state House member, where Republicans are in the minority.
Block wrote on Facebook on Nov. 8 that the County Commission selected him. Otero County officials did not respond to Source’s request for comment Friday. 
Former U.S. Rep. Yvette Herrell, a Republican, wrote a letter endorsing Block. So did Jerrett Perry, the executive director of the Alamogordo Chamber of Commerce, and Michelle Perry, a small business owner in the area who also runs a charter.

Lincoln County’s pick: Commission Chair Mark Fischer
Fischer touted his role leading the commission through recent wildfires and floods and advocating for the county’s interests at the Roundhouse. If chosen, he said he’d work to advance the county’s tourism and horse-racing industries while seeking to expand logging and agriculture. 
“Lincoln County as well as the whole state needs oil and gas, and I have always supported that,” he wrote.
Chaves County’s pick: Rex Wilson
Wilson, who also served two terms as a Lincoln County commissioner, wrote in a cover letter that his 18 years as a healthcare administrator and history as a multigenerational rancher in Lincoln County make him a good fit for the Senate seat. 
He also said he started Camp Sierra Blanca at Fort Stanton in Lincoln County, a “nationally recognized alternative education model” that gives troubled young people a “second chance through non-traditional pathways.”

He touted his work with young people there and at Presbyterian directing early childhood services as necessary experience for the Senate.

(Photo by HUD Office of Public Affairs)New federal rules issued last week constitute the “most devastating housing cuts in modern U.S. history,” according to Minnesota organizations that provide housing to people exiting homelessness. 
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development pays for a large portion of supportive housing services across the country — developments that house people with disabilities who are transitioning out of homelessness for free or at a deep discount. Supportive housing developments typically also offer on-site services like case management, mental health treatment and job training. 
More than 3,600 Minnesotans live in supportive housing, and last year Minnesota organizations received around $48 million in federal funding from Continuum of Care grants, the HUD program funding homelessness solutions.
The new rules will cut federal spending on permanent supportive housing by more than half, forcing the organizations that provide housing to find new funding sources and cut spending — likely by reducing the number of buildings they operate and people they serve.
The rules would effectively double chronic homelessness, according to a press release from a coalition of 185 Minnesota organizations opposed to the cuts.
Existing supportive housing developments can typically count on retaining around 90% of their base federal funding year-over-year. But the new rules drop that number to 30%, meaning some developments could face sudden, steep budget cuts. 
The press release says “these shifts could reduce funding for permanent housing by more than 85% and strip away both the scale and flexibility of the nation’s primary homelessness response system.”
The Reformer reported in September that HUD canceled Continuum of Care grants that it had awarded to Beacon Interfaith Housing Collaborative for the construction of two new supportive housing developments. 
When HUD reopened the grant application, it contained the priorities of President Donald Trump. 
To receive grants under the rewritten program, projects must be in a city, county and state that prohibit public camping, drug use and squatting and enforce those prohibitions; cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement; and follow certain standards for involuntary commitment. 
It also bars applicants who “deny the sex binary in humans or promote the notion that sex is a chosen or mutable characteristic” and those who “knowingly distribute drug paraphernalia…under the pretext of ‘harm reduction.’”
Minnesota doesn’t qualify under several of the provisions. For instance, Minnesota is a trans refuge state and many local law enforcement jurisdictions do not enforce federal immigration law, which is considered a federal, not a state or local responsibility.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/51668526145_e737307647_o-1024x621.jpg,,,2025-11-14 14:57:51.767846

Screenshot. After nearly three hours of public comment, the Michigan State Board of Education voted along party lines Thursday, 6-2, to pass updated health education and sex ed guidelines that include recommendations to teach students about LGBTQ+ identities. 
“I am proud of what we just did,” said Dr. Pamela Pugh, the board’s president. “We made safer spaces for students, all students.”
The debate generally boiled down to those in support of the new guidelines advocating for the inclusion of LGBTQ+ students in public school curricula, while those opposed cited questions of parental rights and religious freedoms. 
The state’s guidelines had not been updated since 2007, and the newly voted-in standards include guidance on coverage of sexual orientation, gender identity, consent and safe sex practices, which previously had not been a part of the curriculum. 
“We are not pushing anything,” said board member Tiffany Tilley. “We are doing our jobs, though, which is making sure that some very old standards and guidelines are being updated today.”SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Multiple current and former Michigan public school students, many themselves part of the LGBTQ+ community, spoke about how they felt excluded from school curricula, especially sex ed lessons, when people who shared their identities were not discussed. 
Over 100 residents attended the meeting to give public comment, leading the board to shorten each comment from three minutes to one. 
The standards maintained, in accordance with state law, requirements for parental notification and options to opt-out of sex ed courses, which staff members present from the Department of Education repeatedly emphasized. 
“I argue today we have found that many people believe that parental rights should be taken away,” said Nikki Snyder, one of the Republican members of the board who voted against the changes. 
“A lot of people talk about all parents have rights. Their children have rights. Not just the people who opposed the proposal. I am a parent. I’ve got rights,” said board member Marshall Bullock. “Because parental rights come with a responsibility.”

Snyder repeatedly called presenters from the Michigan Department of Education liars — which led interim superintendent Sue Carnell to interrupt her and call for her to respect the staff, though Snyder repeatedly interjected into questions from other board members. 
“There is a Board of Education massive overstep that is happening,” she said. 
“It is a true grooming going on,” said the other Republican on the board, Tom McMillin, utilizing an oft-used trope to falsely assert that members of the LGBTQ+ community and their allies are sexual predators.
“You said that people at this table were groomers and intentional groomers,” Pugh responded. “You need to retract that. Those are dangerous words and you need to be careful what you say at this table.”
Presenters from the Department of Education also noted that public comment outside of meetings was largely split between those in favor and those opposed to the guidelines. 
Of 1,388 formal surveys received, 924 opposed the update while 250 supported it. Outside of the actual formal survey system, the Department of Education received over 2,000 emails on the issue during the 30-day public comment period — 896 opposed and over 1,100 in favor. 
“This is not fringe, this is the mainstream of Michigan education,” Taryn Gal, executive director of the Michigan Organization on Adolescent Sexual Health, said during the meeting. “The people responsible for educating your students support the standards because they are grounded in evidence, aligned with national best practices and designed to meet the real needs of students today.”
“What about when the science is corrupted, right?” countered pastor Danny Soria, one of the nearly 50 pastors that signed a letter to the board opposing the new standards. “We find ourselves in biblical times at critical crossroads. We bear the profound responsibility to make wise and morally sound decisions. Those choices must be guided, not by a distorted or perverse moral compass, but by a biblical and constitutional perspective, one that holds the rule of law.”
“The only thing that matters is the parents,” said John Grossenbacher, who submitted a petition signed by over 1,600 parents in opposition to the standards. “They are against this.”
Three parent organizations submitted formal letters of support to the Board — The Michigan Parent Teacher Association, Parent Action for Healthy Kids and Red Wine & Blue Michigan.

Becky Jo Hadlock requested a trial to contest a misdemeanor charge accusing her of defying a legislative subpoena. 
The post Weston County clerk pleads not guilty in subpoena case appeared first on WyoFile .","An eastern Wyoming clerk under fire for her actions during the November 2024 election pleaded not guilty Friday to failing to appear at a legislative hearing where she had been subpoenaed to testify.
Weston County Clerk Becky Jo Hadlock entered her plea during a brief appearance in Natrona County Circuit Court. Her attorney, Ryan Semerad, told the court his client wanted a trial.
Hadlock faces a single misdemeanor charge accusing her of defying a legislative subpoena that required her to testify before a panel investigating her office in connection with errors that occurred during the November 2024 election. She faces up to six months in jail and a $100 fine if convicted.
Circuit Judge Cynthia K. Sweet set a $500 personal recognizance bond for Hadlock, meaning the defendant won’t have to put up any money to remain free as long as she makes future court appearances.

Court records show a handful of lawmakers spoke with authorities during the criminal investigation surrounding Hadlock. But a reporter did not see any legislators in attendance at Friday’s hearing.
The criminal case comes amid growing scrutiny of Wyoming’s elections system. Republican lawmakers filed 45 election bills during the last legislative session — a striking number for one topic in a single year. Hadlock’s actions have fueled calls for additional legislation, including to move Wyoming to a hand-count voting system.
Election errors
State lawmakers and other officials began to scrutinize Hadlock’s actions soon after errors in the November 2024 election resulted in a dramatic undercount of votes for Rep. Chip Neiman, R-Hulett, in last year’s general election. Neiman was the majority floor leader at the time and is now the House speaker.
Hadlock, it was later learned, had printed out three versions of the ballot because of errors on the first two. That itself wasn’t a problem — clerks sometimes reprint ballots to correct misprints and other errors. But the clerk’s office gave some voters the incorrect first and second versions, which resulted in tabulators miscounting votes for Neiman, who was running unopposed for House District 1, and a county commission race.  
The result showed Neiman initially receiving only 166 votes, with another 1,289 voters leaving that race blank — what’s known as an undervote.
Secretary of State Chuck Gray, Wyoming’s top elections official, noticed the error and tried to contact Hadlock on election night. When she didn’t answer, he sent sheriff’s deputies to her home.

Multiple investigations ensued. After his inquiry, Gray recommended Hadlock’s removal from office. Gov. Mark Godon came to a different conclusion. He decided that Hadlock made serious mistakes, but those errors did not amount to misconduct and malfeasance — the level needed to seek her removal from office. Gordon also stressed the serious nature of recommending the removal of a lawfully elected county official, writing that “the decision of who should fill a county office is best made by the people of Weston County in the next election just a little over a year away.” 
The Wyoming Legislature also launched its own examination, forming a subcommittee to do that work. The Weston County Clerk 2024 General Election Subcommittee met Sept. 29 in Casper to continue its investigation.
Hadlock had been served with the subpoena on Sept. 23, according to a sworn statement by a Natrona County sheriff’s investigator. She emailed lawmakers two days later, informing them she would not attend due to a scheduling conflict.

The clerk later told the sheriff’s investigator that while she did receive a subpoena, she had personal business in Gillette on the day of the hearing. Specifically, she and her mother both had doctors appointments scheduled for that date.
That decision contributed to a new inquiry by the governor’s office into Hadlock’s actions. Last month, Gordon announced he’d received two additional complaints against the embattled clerk. One accused her of filing a false post-election audit following the 2024 general election. A second referenced her refusal to testify despite the subpoena.
After that investigation is complete, Gordon will decide whether to recommend that a court remove Hadlock from office. The governor cannot unilaterally remove her.

The agency had previously begun issuing partial Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits earlier this week.
Most recipients should soon have access to their full benefits, the agency said in a press release.
“We are grateful for this resolution and for the ability to move quickly to restore full benefits,” said Sondra Shelby, director of adult and family services. “Our teams have worked tirelessly to prepare systems so that Oklahomans receive the full support available to them without delay.”
Recipients do not need to take any action as benefits will be issued automatically.
More than 680,000 Oklahomans receive the benefits, commonly known as food stamps.
Last month, the Contingency Review Board met and approved the distribution of $1 million per week to food banks for up to seven weeks, contingent on a lack of federal funds. The funding was to come from the state emergency fund.
Carrie Snodgrass, a DHS spokesperson, said that $1.5 million had been distributed. The distributions are ending because the federal dollars were made available, she said.

,Mississippi Today,2025-11-14 19:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,‘Can’t assume we can afford it’: Wingate stops water rate increase for now after city pushes back,Alex Rozier,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/14/wingate-pauses-water-rate-increase/,U.S. District Judge Henry Wigate halted for now a water rate increase for Jackson-area customers amid concerns over third-party manager's actions.,"A federal court Thursday halted, for now, a rate increase the manager of Jackson’s beleaguered water and sewer systems has for months said is necessary to keep the utility afloat. 
U.S. District Court Judge Henry Wingate said he needed more time to make a decision, adding he would have an update on the matter by the next hearing on Nov. 19. 
JXN Water also received news Wednesday that Congress approved to set aside $54 million for daily operations, Ted Henifin, the manager of the third-party utility, said. Lawmakers had already awarded the funds to the city, but initially did so only for capital projects. 
Since 2022, the utility has made relatively fast strides improving water pressure throughout Jackson as well as repairing burst sewer lines across the city. Moreover, for the first time in a decade, the water system is compliant with all federal drinking water regulations, Henifin said last week.

But without added revenue, JXN Water said it will continue to lose money and be unable to address sewer system repairs, including two major, ongoing overflows – one on Mill Street and another on I-55 near Home Depot.
Since the spring, Henifin has pleaded with the court for a rate increase after JXN Water ran out of its initial $150 million allocated for daily system upkeep. The hike would raise the average Jacksonian’s monthly bill – which includes costs for drinking water as well as garbage pickup and wastewater – by 12%, the utility says. 
City officials, including Mayor John Horhn as well as all of the Jackson City Council, have argued the utility shouldn’t be able to charge more until it collects payments from a broader swath of the city. 
Even if JXN Water had a 100% collections rate – it currently sits around 70%, far below the national average of over 90% – those bills wouldn’t yield enough revenue to keep the utility from losing money, Henifin has repeatedly told critics of his proposal. 
Jackson officials, attorneys for the ACLU, and Rep. Fabian Nelson, a Democrat whose district includes south Jackson, all spoke against the rate increase during a status conference in front of Wingate on Thursday. Wingate appointed Henifin to lead the city’s water recovery in 2022. 
Jackson City Attorney Drew Martin criticized JXN Water for not considering sooner its revenue needs. This increase would mark the second rate hike since Henifin took over. The manager previously has said it took a while to realize how much money the system needed to function. 
“What we hear from residents is ‘you can’t just spend money first and assume we can afford it,’” Martin said Thursday. 
In September, the utility ramped up its collection efforts, shutting off about 1,800 accounts. JXN Water has disconnected 4,403 total accounts since the start of 2025, adding it plans to continue disconnecting 500 to 1,000 accounts per week. It did not say how many accounts have since caught up or have been reconnected. The utility said it plans to have “worked” all accounts by mid-2026. 
In a court filing last week, Nelson submitted letters from constituents with thousands of dollars in water debt. After not receiving a bill for the first time in years, they couldn’t afford the down payment JXN Water requires to keep their taps on, the letters said. 
For others who wrote in, the utility told them they had high charges because of a leak at their home, although some claimed to have hired plumbers who told them the opposite. Some constituents complained of rude representatives from the JXN Water call center. 
Wingate himself said he called the center as an experiment and got conflicting answers from different operators. Henifin admitted Thursday the utility needs to better train its operators, which he said would begin around the new year.
A letter about billing issues a JXN Water customer sent to Rep. Fabian Nelson, a Democrat from Byram.
 “JXN Water has forgotten about the people and the citizens,” Nelson told the court while also praising the progress Henifin’s team has made so far.
The utility initially planned to send a notice of the rate increase to customers on Nov. 15 and for the change to take effect Dec. 15. In Wingate’s 2022 order that put Henifin in charge, the language doesn’t say the manager needs the court’s approval to implement a rate increase.
But at the eleventh hour of Thursday’s conference, Wingate enjoined, or stopped, Henifin from moving forward. JXN Water attorneys said they would need a decision by the end of November to enact the rate hike by the end of 2025, leading to the judge setting the next conference for Nov. 19. 
The two-day hearing, which began last week, looked in-depth at a number of issues, including both the city and JXN Water alleging the other owes it money.
A letter about billing issues a JXN Water customer sent to Rep. Fabian Nelson, a Democrat from Byram.
‘More than frustrating’
Henifin on Thursday discussed the city’s water debt, which as of October was $6.9 million. Most of that is from leaks at the Jackson Zoo, which should be fixed in the next two to three weeks, Jackson’s chief administrative officer Pieter Teeuwissen said.
But in the meantime, Henifin said, JXN Water has held “hostage” $6.3 million the utility owes the city in sanitation fees. Because residents pay for garbage pickup in the water bill, that money first goes to JXN Water. 
Wingate questioned the utility chief about withholding those funds. Henifin said JXN Water has spent the money to help keep its daily operations afloat. When the judge asked Henifin what authority allowed that power, he admitted he had “none.” The manager said the utility will pay back the city once Jackson pays its water debt. 
Teeuwissen and other city officials criticized JXN Water, saying not having sanitation revenue puts a strain on Jackson’s budget. Martin, the city attorney, said “it is more than frustrating” to hear Henifin withheld the funds without any authority.

JXN Water’s books and help from the Legislature
Horhn reaffirmed his stance Thursday against the proposed rate increase. The mayor is hopeful the state Legislature will work with him in the 2026 session to find other streams of revenue to invest into the water and sewer systems, and said it’s premature to raise rates before seeing what that may look like. 
Horhn offered several suggestions to lawmakers in October, such as raising the sales tax or diverting funds from the Capitol Complex Improvement District.
City officials also appealed to Wingate to allow access to JXN Water’s financial records, stating they couldn’t agree to a rate increase without having that information. 
While Henifin last week agreed to do so, he later asked to condition that access to prevent records from becoming public. Without context, he argued, it’d be easy for someone to misinterpret the numbers. The 2022 order gave Henifin the power to run the utility without being subject to public record laws. 
After initially pushing back on the conditions, the city said it would agree to a protection order preventing the records from becoming public without Henifin’s approval.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/06124621/Jackson-Water2-scaled.jpg,,,2025-11-14 14:57:51.767846

We’re all excited to move forward together and keep doing what Kentuckians expect of us: fighting for fairness, opportunity, and dignity for every person in this Commonwealth.”
The changes in the House Democrats’ leadership come as Stevenson is running a statewide campaign for U.S. Senate. 
Burke said in the press release that she is honored to have her new leadership position. 
“Our work is about helping people meet their everyday needs,” Burke said. “Families need affordable homes, quality education, accessible health care, and the ability to put food on the table without constant worry. Those are the issues Kentuckians are talking about with us every day.”
Watkins, who during a forum this week encouraged legislators to focus on addressing housing needs in the upcoming session, said in the press release that he is eager to serve in caucus leadership. 
“We have an opportunity to make life better for people who are too often overlooked,” Watkins said. “That means listening, learning, and doing the hard work to give everyone a fair shot at a better future.

(Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)Following budget crises at several of its schools, the University of Louisiana System is studying how to restructure to minimize costs and maximize oversight. 
The system’s governing board voted Thursday to create a task force made up of university administrators, faculty, students and athletics officials from each of its nine universities. The group will look at ways to create shared services across the universities, implement a cross-system course numbering system and create long-term financial stability for college athletics. 
University of Louisiana System President Rick Gallot said he has been considering this plan since he took the job in 2023. 
The restructure is intended to give the system more power to deal with financial problems at its schools. In the past two years, the University of New Orleans and the University of Louisiana at Lafayette have had to dig themselves out of budget shortfalls, totalling $30 million and $25, respectively, that led to faculty and staff furloughs and layoffs. 
The University of Louisiana at Monroe has also had to deal with a $12 million budget shortfall but chose not to furlough any of its employees. 
Every university in the UL System is running a deficit in athletics, which are contributing significantly to the budget crunch at some schools. 
These fiscal problems largely snuck up on the system and its board members. 
“UNO was my alma mater, and I was on the board of supervisors, and somehow we didn’t know all that had gone wrong at UNO,” UL board member Julie Stokes said. 
In response to the budget crisis at UNO, the state legislature approved moving the school back to the LSU System, which it had been a part of until 2011. The switch is expected to take place in July. 
“I would say the same thing is true here, that the system by which we are managing these schools is not providing us adequate ability to supervise what’s happening at these schools,” Stokes said of ULL, which hosted Thursday’s meeting. 
Though it’s not yet known what actions the board will end up taking after receiving the task force report, if it decides to streamline services, such as human resources, accounting and IT, it is possible some people will lose their jobs. 
But Gallot encouraged those affected by any restructuring to participate in the study phase. The system will hold town halls about the process at each system university and put up a website to receive feedback, he said. 
The LSU System also announced its intent to restructure this month, although its process is very different. 
While the UL System will be going through a public process, LSU announced a rough outline of its new structure on Nov. 4, when it also hired a new president and chancellor, and said it would vote to finalize the plan within 30 days, without getting input from the public.

,New Jersey Monitor,2025-11-14 18:05:51+00:00,New Jersey Monitor,Horizon to pay NJ $100M to resolve claims it overcharged the state,Nikita Biryukov,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/11/14/horizon-settlement-new-jersey/,The insurer entered a settlement with New Jersey to resolve claims it ignored a cost-saving provision in its contract with the state.,"Attorney General Matt Platkin said Horizon drove up the cost of health care for state workers by overcharging the state, a claim the company disputes. (Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield agreed to pay New Jersey $100 million as part of a settlement to resolve claims that it made false statements to win a contract managing the state’s public worker health plans and then ignored a contractual provision so it could overcharge the public plans, prosecutors announced Friday. 
State officials say Horizon, which administers public plans that insure more than 750,000 state and local government workers and retirees, had ignored a provision in the 2020 contract that required it to charge the state the amount billed by a health care provider or an amount negotiated between the provider and Horizon, whichever is less.
But the insurer knew it could not comply with the provision before it bid into the contract and concealed that fact from state procurement officials, the Office of the Attorney General alleged. Then it ignored the provisions, submitting more than 1,000 false claims to the state alongside fraudulent records to support them, according to state prosecutors.
“At a time when everyone is rightly concerned about the cost of their health care, it is simply unacceptable that an insurance company would seek to defraud our State and overcharge us while driving up the costs of health care for hundreds of thousands of dedicated public servants,” Attorney General Matt Platkin said in a statement Friday.
The state said Friday the settlement is the largest non-Medicaid false claims settlement amount in state history. Horizon denies any wrongdoing, and the settlement does not include an admission of guilt.
The lesser-of provision was a new addition to the 2020 third-party administrator contract meant to reduce costs for the state’s public worker health plans, which are distressed following successive premium hikes and departures by local governments and schools.
The provision required Horizon to charge the state the amount billed by a provider or the amount negotiated between the provider and Horizon ahead of time, whichever was less. For example, if a doctor charged $300 for a visit but had negotiated a $600 cost with the insurer, the provision would bar Horizon from charging the state more than $300.
But the insurer ignored the requirement and even sent plan members documents that misstated the amount it charged the state for their health care, providing lower provider charges even when higher negotiated amounts were paid, prosecutors said in their lawsuit.
Horizon received nearly $500 million across nearly five years under that contract, state officials said. Along with Aetna, the insurer was chosen to act as a third-party administrator for the state plans in contracts awarded last year.
The firm has since begun complying with the lesser-of provision and ceased providing false documents to members, according to the settlement agreement.
A spokesperson for Horizon said Platkin mischaracterized the facts.
“This has never been anything more than a straightforward contract dispute, one that Horizon tried to resolve in good faith more than four years ago in the same way it has resolved similar disagreements over the course of our long and fruitful partnership with the State: through a negotiated reimbursement,” said Thomas Wilson, the spokesperson.
Horizon resolved the underlying issues in 2023, he said, and the payments in question accounted for just 0.07% of claims and less than 0.5% of the amounts paid to health care providers.
“While Horizon’s interpretation of one aspect of the contract differed from the State’s, the settlement makes clear Horizon never retained any portion of monies charged to the State for health care provider claims,” Wilson said. “Horizon paid claims we processed for the State according to the contracts in place with the doctors and hospitals filing those claims.”
In the settlement, Horizon denies overbilling or submitting false documents to the state, positions not shared by New Jersey or private individuals who initially lodged the suit.
The suit against the insurer was initially brought by a group of private individuals, called relators, who sued on behalf of the state under the New Jersey False Claims Act. That law imposes civil penalties on individuals or firms who knowingly make false claims for payments from the state.
The law allows private citizens to sue on the government’s behalf and keep a portion of the proceeds if the suit succeeds.
Five of the six relators who brought the suit will split $12 million from the settlement. They are former State Policemen’s Benevolent Association Executive Director Kevin Lyons, former state PBA President Pat Colligan, former PBA Executive Vice President Marc Kovar, and Mark and Vince Flores, co-founders of the health benefits consulting firm AVYM.
A sixth relator, former state assistant director of health benefits Christin Deacon, will not receive a share of the proceeds because she administered the 2020 contract and became aware of the insurer’s alleged conduct in the course of her work before leaving her position.
“The Division has been, and continues to be, laser-focused on enforcing its contracts and ensuring that our health benefits plans and our members are protected,” state Treasurer Liz Muoio said in a statement.
Of the remaining proceeds, $10 million will go to the state’s false claims prosecution fund — state law requires 10% of proceeds from false claims settlements to be deposited there — and the remaining $78 million will return to the state pension and benefits division.
As part of the settlement agreement, Horizon will submit to additional reporting of its claims data and finances, including daily access to its claims, quarterly reviews, and more fulsome monthly reporting.
The insurer is required to make the $100 million payment by Dec. 2. It must also pay $1.25 million in attorney fees to the relators and unspecified amounts to the state for the enforcement of the agreement.

(Illustration by Eric Thomas/Kansas Reflector)I root for the underdog.
Maybe you’re like me, urging a touchdown from a winless team or hoping for a goal from a cash-strapped squad. Sure, FanDuel says they will lose by six touchdowns — and that’s exactly why I’m cheering for them. I’m a sucker for it all: “Hoosiers” and Leicester City and the Miracle on Ice. 
To identify the underdogs, we create power rankings for baseball seasons that are months away, coaches’ polls in college football and even national rankings in high school soccer. On betting apps, we find underdogs through point spreads and win probabilities. 
All of that energy highlights the folly of prediction — attempting to compare teams that will never be in the same state, let alone the same tournament. “Who would win a lacrosse match between these two undefeated high school teams: one from Virginia and one from Texas?”
Nevertheless, see me there on the couch, fixated on the national rankings, pulling for the underdog and begging for a fourth quarter interception so that a team designated No. 19 will beat No. 18. What an inspiring story.
High school sports fuel my upset fever. I have been on the sidelines for countless games, camera in hand as a photojournalist, when plucky rural schools have spooked state-ranked all-star squads. It’s electric. 
In search of Cinderella in Kansas high school sports, I scoured this fall’s online playoff results for the Kansas State High School Activities Association. After charting more than 100 games and more than a dozen brackets, I’m still looking. 
This fall has been a blockbuster season for the favorites in Kansas high school sports, so far. In the three fall sports where KSHSAA provides seedings — girls tennis, boys soccer and football — the top-ranked teams are dominating in 2025. 
Let’s start with football, because … well, America demands it. 
For football, KSHSAA organizes the state brackets into east and west. There are 16 teams in each bracket for Class 1A through 6A. With two rounds complete, that means there have been 96 games in those classes so far. (I didn’t tabulate eight-player and six-player formats, since they use different seeding systems.)
In the first round, the top eight football seeds had 81 victories and 15 losses, winning almost 85 percent of games. More than half of the wins by lower-seeded teams were by No. 9 seeds beating No. 8 seeds — not the dramatic upset I wanted.
In the second round of the football playoffs, seeds No. 1 through 8 won 44 games. The bottom eight seeds? They won just four times. 
All 12 football No. 1 seeds from 1A to 6A have survived the first two rounds. For us underdog fans, we must search to find the scattered low seeds. 
If you think you’ve found an underdog in the 4A football bracket — the No. 13 seed — you will need to look closer. This low seed, Bishop Miege High School, is a wolf in sheep’s clothing. They have mauled their first two opponents, 57-7 in round one and 30-6 in round two. 
How did they earn such a low seed? A team’s winning percentage is the basis for KSHSAA football seedings. For Bishop Miege, that stat is misleading, the result of a challenging schedule filled with match-ups against larger schools, both from Kansas and Missouri. Sure, they lost often, but against 6A Blue Valley North and Rockhurst High School, the fifth best team in Kansas City. 
This is not a typical 3-5 football team. 
Miege often plays the postseason spoiler, frequently in the state basketball playoffs. The school draws a low seed after a handful of regular-season losses, and then they tear through playoff opponents with better seeds. It’s particularly cruel when Miege is underrated and they pick off a No. 1 seed in an early round, never to be challenged again on their run to a state championship.
If football can’t provide an underdog story, then what about Kansas high school soccer? 
Alas, the top eight seeds in KSHSAA soccer this year won even more often than the favorites in football, an almost 88% winning rate in the first two rounds. 
Only two teams seeded in the bottom eight escaped the second round. Both of them — No. 9 St. Thomas Aquinas and No. 11 Kansas City’s Piper — mimicked the resume of Bishop Miege in football. They hug the state line with Missouri and played punishing regular seasons in the metro area — a record that sunk their seedings. In the playoffs, they started strong. 
While not a low seed, No. 5 Shawnee Mission East made an even deeper run to the state final in Class 6A soccer with a similar formula. 
It’s stunning that KSHSAA’s seeding would be so reliable in predicting winners, particularly soccer. Scoring is lower in soccer, with far fewer goals in the sport than touchdowns in football or baskets in basketball. That leads to less-predictable outcomes in most soccer leagues. But in the Kansas high school soccer playoffs, the favorites kept winning. 
That leaves us with tennis, but I’m warning you. Shield your eyes, my fellow underdog softies. 
In four classifications this year, KSHSAA awarded both a singles championship and a doubles championship. That’s eight total champions. The No. 1 seed won seven of the eight brackets. 
The only “upset” was in 3A doubles, where the No. 2 seed Reygan Coonrod and Inarie Rippert of Ellsworth beat the No. 1 seed. 
Even the tennis semifinals were parades for the top seeds. The No. 1, 2 and 3 seeds in all eight tournaments advanced to the semis. In fact, the lowest seed to advance to the semis was No. 5 seed — hardly an underdog in a bracket that contained 24 competitors. 
This is a good time to admit this: When I started my KSHSAA research, I thought I would be writing about how inefficient the seeding systems were. How they fed all kinds of upsets because they relied strictly on winning percentage, as in football and soccer. I had my ire poised for the keyboard. 
Instead, it’s kudos to you, KSHSAA. With only a few Kansas schools providing upsets, your seeding was nearly undefeated.

November 2020 | Ken Coleman photoLet’s be blunt: Michigan Republicans, like their counterparts nationally, are no longer merely questioning elections. They are actively seeking to undermine them. 
Their latest maneuvers, calling for federal intervention by baselessly smearing Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson’s ability to fairly oversee elections to cheering President Donald Trump’s pardons of the state’s alleged false electors, reveal a party more invested in manufacturing distrust than in protecting democracy.
Put together, these moves are not isolated issues. They form a strategy: cast doubt, sow suspicion, and demand federal oversight, all the while shifting focus from governance to grievance.
The “conflict of interest” gambit
On Thursday, GOP leaders in the Michigan Legislature demanded that the U.S. Department of Justice step in and monitor the state’s 2026 elections because Benson might have a personal political stake — she’s running for governor — and therefore cannot be trusted to run elections impartially. 
But those who know how our elections work also know Michigan has a deeply decentralized system administered across 1,600+ local jurisdictions and that electoral oversight is routinely conducted with bipartisan monitors and observers. 
What’s happening here is not about transparency, it’s about casting suspicion.

Rather than offering credible evidence of wrongdoing, these Republicans are demanding a federal takeover of state elections under the guise of “protecting fairness.” 
That is opposite the principle of local control and further erodes public confidence. 
The optics of a state handing over election control to Washington, D.C., are antithetical to stated conservative principles valuing states’ rights over those not explicitly delineated to the federal government. 
The pardons of false electors
Furthering this attempt to undermine elections were the October pardons by Trump of 16 Michigan Republicans who allegedly signed on as a false slate of electors in 2020 in an effort to overturn the certified election results in the state. 
The pardons, which were wholly unnecessary after the charges were dismissed, undercuts faith in the very system Republicans insist they are defending.
It is breathtakingly hypocritical. 
Keep in mind that the Republicans charged in the false elector case were not exonerated. After having sat through hours of testimony in the case, it was clear to me that the evidence showed an attempt to try and overturn Joe Biden’s Electoral College win. 
But a poorly handled investigation and an overreaching prosecution ultimately left the judge little choice but to reject the charges.
When you pardon those who seemingly tried to subvert the system and were already cleared of any consequences, how do you then credibly say you’re working to protect the system?

Why this matters
The integrity of elections is built by process, by transparency, and by predictable rules. In that regard, Michigan is among the best, having been ranked second in the nation for election administration in 2024 by the Elections Performance Index. 
Released by the MIT Election Data and Science Lab, the report scored Michigan at 88% on the index, second only to New Mexico, which also scored 88%. The report noted Michigan had shorter wait times for voters, far fewer registration and absentee ballot issues than the national average and a much lower rate of unreturned mail ballots. Michigan was also higher than the national average in both voter turnout (59.3% compared to 47.5% nationally) and voter registration (91% compared to 84% nationally). 
Yet now, Republicans lawmakers seem fixated not on improving how we vote but on how they can discredit how we vote.
When political actors sow doubt in elections without credible evidence, they are not engaging in oversight — they are delegitimizing democracy. 
When they then demand federal intervention in a state process because they don’t like the referee, they are undermining the system of state-run elections that the U.S. Constitution guarantees.
State Republicans’ relentless refusal to accept the basic legitimacy of our voting system aren’t signs of vigilance; they’re warnings. 
If we continue down a path where power matters more than truth and sabotage masquerades as oversight, then the greatest threat to Michigan’s elections won’t come from foreign actors or technical glitches — it will come from those who claim to defend democracy while dismantling it from within.

Kyle Walker listens during a 2025 committee hearing. (Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Republican state Sen. Kyle Walker has announced his opposition to redrawing Indiana’s congressional maps despite his close ties with a leader of a pro-redistricting group.
Walker’s statement, which he first released Thursday, makes him the eighth Senate Republican to publicly come out against the push initiated by President Donald Trump for redistricting in Indiana and other GOP-led states.
“I’ve spent the past several months listening closely to my constituents on mid-decade redistricting,” Walker said. “With 93 percent opposed, and as their voice in the Indiana Senate, I’ll be voting no.”
Thirteen Republican senators have come out in support, but 19 of the 40-member caucus haven’t made their stances known publicly.


The following GOP senators have come out in support of redistricting:
Sen. Scott AlexanderSen. Ron AltingSen. Scott BaldwinSen. Liz BrownSen. Justin BuschSen. Gary ByrneSen. Chris GartenSen. Mike GaskillSen. Tyler JohnsonSen. Eric KochSen. Randy MaxwellSen. Daryl SchmittSen. Andy Zay

Walker is up for reelection next year in one of the state’s few politically close state Senate districts, covering the northeastern corner of Indianapolis and the Fishers area in Hamilton County. He won the 2022 election with 55% of the vote.
Walker’s opposition is notable because he is a member of the 24-person Indiana Republican Party State Committee as the party’s 7th Congressional District vice chair.
He is also executive vice president of MO Strategies, a political consulting firm that is led by Marty Obst.
Obst is the chair of Fair Maps Indiana, a nonprofit group that says it has launched a six-figure advertising effort targeting undecided Republican senators pushing for their support of redistricting. The campaign includes texts, digital, television and mail advertising.
Obst served in senior leadership roles in Trump’s 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns and was a senior political adviser to former Vice President Mike Pence. 
Walker did not immediately reply Friday to a message from the Indiana Capital Chronicle seeking additional comment on his decision.
Indiana lawmakers are scheduled to meet starting Dec. 1 to consider drawing more Republican-leaning U.S. House districts ahead of next year’s midterm elections — following a months-long pressure campaign by Trump’s administration and his supporters.
Senate Republican leadership has said they do not yet have enough votes to pass a redistricting bill. Any new maps would need a majority of 26 senators or 25 with Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith breaking a tie in support.
Other Republican senators who’ve announced opposition to redistricting are: Eric Bassler, Vaneta Becker, Spencer Deery, Sue Glick, Jean Leising, Jim Tomes and Greg Walker. 
Enough House Republicans are believed to be supportive of a redistricting effort for it to win passage in that chamber.
Walker has, at times, broken with other Senate Republicans on prominent legislation.
For instance, he voted earlier this year against Senate Bill 289, which was signed into law prohibiting diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in state government and public schools. He also voted against the 2022 bill that established the state’s near-total abortion ban.

You can read more about the section here.

When legislators talk about “school choice” and diverting public dollars to private schools, they often package it as empowering parents. But often overlooked in the conversation is that after years of underfunding and unfair criticism, Mississippi’s public education is seeing measurable success.
According to the latest Kids Count Data Book, Mississippi was ranked 16th in the nation for K-12 education. Our fourth graders have led the nation in reading and math gains on the National Assessment of Educational Progress rankings, and graduation rates have reached historic highs.
There are so many wonderful things happening in Mississippi public education. Now is not the time to pull away from a shared system that is working. Vouchers and unaccountable “choice” schemes threaten the progress of the many in favor of a few.

The adage “it takes a village to raise a child” has never been truer. Educators are not seeking to replace parents but to partner with them. Schools consistently plead for parents to be active participants in the educational process.
Public schools are our community’s schools, run by local boards, funded by taxpayers and accountable to the public. Suggesting that only private schools or home options are legitimate undermines our collective investment that ensures every child, regardless of income or zip code, has access to quality education.
Mississippi’s recent gains were not driven by privatization. The state directs a very small percentage of kindergarten–12 funding to private programs. Our progress stems from intentional public investments in early literacy, Pre-K expansion, teacher support, accountability and local district innovations.
Yet, Mississippi has chronically underfunded its schools. Since the Mississippi Adequate Education Program was created in 1997, legislators only fully funded it twice, leaving a cumulative shortfall exceeding $3.3 billion.
Even in 2023, despite revenue surpluses, education was shorted by $161 million. The newly created 2024 Mississippi Student Funding Formula provided roughly $50 million less than full MAEP funding would have delivered.
We cannot afford to carve public money away from schools already asked to do more with less. Each diverted dollar reduces resources for classrooms, support staff, fine arts programs, counselors, nurses and special education.
Who truly benefits — and who loses — when vouchers enter the system? These programs primarily serve affluent families already able to afford private school tuition. They cluster benefits in urban areas, where private schools are more abundant, leaving rural Mississippians with fewer options and underfunded local schools.
When voucher programs win, public-school students and their teachers lose — facing larger class sizes, fewer resources and diminished support in the classrooms where most Mississippi children learn.
Public schools are accountable through testing, audits and transparency. Voucher-funded schools, however, are rarely held to the same standards. Many select their students, exclude those with disabilities or cloak financials in privacy.
Public dollars deserve public oversight. If a school takes tax money, it should be held to the same accountability expectations as every Mississippi public classroom. 
Other states offer clear warnings. In Tennessee, voucher students underperformed compared to their public school peers. In Arkansas, costs ballooned and private schools hiked tuition, excluding low-income families. Louisiana’s choice expansion deepened budget gaps.
Mississippi should learn from these examples: When states funnel public money into private schooling, inequality grows while outcomes stagnate.
Rather than dividing limited resources, Mississippi should double down on what works.
We should:

Fully fund the Mississippi Student Funding Formula so districts can operate reliably.
Expand early literacy and math intervention programs.
Support teacher recruitment, retention and development, particularly in rural areas.
Strengthen support for special education, fine arts education, counseling and technology.
Encourage innovation through magnet programs, dual enrollments and career tech centers within public systems.

Proponents of vouchers call “choice” freedom, but real freedom is not abandoning public responsibility. It is building a society where every child, regardless of income or geography, can attend a great public school.
Mississippi’s progress proves what collective investment can achieve. We should not dismantle progress with policies that favor the few. Public dollars belong in public schools.
The real choice before us is simple: a future where all children succeed, or one where some succeed at the expense of others. That’s a choice we must not accept and must do our due diligence to fight against.

Brown/Florida Phoenix)A Florida Republican has re-filed a measure to penalize local governments attempting to remove or destroy Confederate monuments and other historic memorials.
HB 496 by Sen. Stan McClain, an Ocala Republican, demands the state protect “each historic Florida monument or memorial from removal, damage, or destruction.” It’s the fourth time this bill has been introduced in successive legislative sessions as part of a broader conservative response to the nationwide movement to down or rename Confederate statues.
“The Legislature finds that an accurate and factual history belongs to all Floridians and future generations and that the state has an obligation to protect and preserve such history,” the bill reads.
Sen. Stan McClain via Florida House
Local government officials who try to take down the monuments would be fined up to $1,000, and could open themselves to lawsuits by either the group that helped maintain or erect the memorial or any Floridian who regularly uses it for “remembrance purposes.” A court could award the suing party damages up to $100,000.
The push to remove Confederate images emerged in 2015, after white supremacist Dylann Roof killed nine Black people in the Mother Emanuel AME Church a in Charleston, South Carolina. Roof had posed multiple times with a Confederate battle flag leading up to the mass shooting. From 2015 to 2018, roughly 110 Confederate memorials were removed nationwide. In addition, the state stopped flying the Confederate flag over the State House.
Hillsborough County was one of the first local governments in Florida to act following that incident, with the county commission voting later that summer to remove a Confederate flag that had hung in its county center, the Phoenix previously reported.
The Florida Legislature voted in 2016 to remove a statue of Confederate General Edmund Kirby Smith that represented Florida in the U.S. Capitol, and again in 2018 to replace it with a statue of Mary McLeod Bethune, known for starting a private college for African American students in Daytona Beach that would become Bethune-Cookman College.
The removal push was reinvigorated in 2020 after George Floyd, a Black man, was killed by a white police officer; nationally, 168 monuments were nixed that year alone, which eventually sparked the counter-movement to keep the statues seen in Florida.
In 2023, Florida Republicans first attempted to pass the measure to ban historic monuments being removed, damaged, or destroyed. Similar measures were introduced in the 2024 and 2025 sessions, but each failed before reaching either the House or Senate floors. As of 2024, Florida still had 73 of these monuments existing statewide.
Sen. McClain’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The 2026 session begins on Jan. 13.

(Photo by Lance Cheung/USDA)An Iowa Department of Natural Resources study on food waste in the state found that Iowans on average, throw away 200 pounds of food each year. 
The study identified a number of ways that households and businesses can reduce their food waste and in turn, help food insecure households, the environment and the economy. 
Preventing food waste by producing, buying and serving only what is needed is the best way, according to the study, to reduce food waste. 
Other methods it identified include donating or upcycling food before it goes bad, feeding it to animals and livestock, composting food scraps or putting them through an anaerobic digestion system and applying the product to the land. 
Some of these solutions, according to the report, can be implemented in the near future while others have a longer start-up time, or require changes in state and local policies.

The food waste problem 
DNR determined in a 2022 study of landfill materials that food waste, comprising unsold food from stores, table scraps, uneaten prepared food, kitchen trimmings and byproducts from food and beverage processing facilities, was the number one material in Iowa landfills. 
The same study found that 19% of landfill material in Iowa is loose or packaged food waste. Of the average 200 pounds of food per year per person that Iowans dispose of at home, 25% is still packaged. When including commercial food waste into the calculation, Iowans dispose of 300 pounds of food waste, per person, per year. 
The Iowa rate is lower than the average rate for the U.S., which the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates is between 492 to 1,032 pounds per person per year. 
EPA also estimates the average family throws away about $3,000 worth of food, or 11% of household food expenditures, annually. 
Further, the study said food waste emits air pollutants as it sits in solid waste landfills. 
Suggested solutions
The best way to reduce food waste that ends up in landfills is to manage the amount of waste in homes and businesses. 
The study suggests that at home, residents: eat their leftovers, keep track of the items in their refrigerators and pantries, plan meals, be creative with meals to use what is about to spoil, store food properly and purchase in quantities that can be consumed before they spoil. 
Restaurants can audit their waste streams and adjust their menus, wholesale orders and portion sizes to reduce food waste.

The study points out that while households and commercial businesses throw out food, 1 in 8 Iowans face food insecurity. 
Food banks and food pantries often receive donations from grocery stores or wholesalers of food that is about to pass its expiration date, which can be one way of  reducing food waste. 
The study surveyed six food-rescue organizations in Iowa, including Food Bank of Iowa, which accepted more 26 million pounds of rescue food in 2023 to be distributed across its 55-county region. 
The surveyed organizations identified that the majority of this food is able to be used and given out at food pantries, though the process presents some barriers. It’s difficult to always provide culturally relevant foods and some stores are reluctant to donate their food for fear of being held liable for accidentally donating spoiled food. 
Based on the information gleaned from the study, DNR recommends the state improve education and training strategies around food donation, establish requirements for certain businesses to donate food and increase tax credits available for donating food.  
Composting is another strategy for reducing food waste.
The study found that in 2024, approximately 2,925 tons of food waste were managed with composting in Iowa. 
This means, per the study, that most facilities are operating “well below” permitted limits and that the state’s composting capacity is “not being fully utilized.” 
Surveyed facilities cited permitting, contamination due to the inclusion of non-compostable items like glass or plastic, and cost as the major limiting factors to increasing compost capacity.
Solutions presented by the study include: legislative requirements to compost food for certain businesses, partnerships to purchase or rent composting equipment, grants and incentives to pre-process food waste. 
Once food scraps are composted, the study found that waste facilities generally do not have a hard time selling the compost to homeowners, businesses and farmers that want to apply the nutrient-rich product to their fields and gardens. 
Similar to composting, anaerobic digestion also breaks down food scraps into a usable product: biogas. 
According to the study, some Water Resource Recovery Facilities in Iowa pull organic material from wastewater streams and process it via anaerobic digestion. Of the nine sites surveyed by the study, four use the produced biogas onsite for things like heating boilers and electricity generation, while others sold the biogas. 
The study suggests greater development, marketing and procurement of the practice at facilities in the state to help manage food waste. 
The study points out that composting facilities and wastewater facilities with anaerobic digestion are concentrated to areas of higher population in the state, which means some regions don’t have access to these processes. There are only five composting facilities in Iowa and three water resource recovery facilities that accept food waste.
DNR noted that residents and businesses can add smaller compost or anaerobic digestion infrastructure on site or in their backyards to help reduce food waste that ends up in a landfill.
Another solution the study suggested is the implementation of a “sharing table” at schools. This practice has been implemented in other states and allows students to put their un-opened packaged food on a table in the cafeteria to be donated, rather than tossing it in the garbage.
The study also called for greater education in schools around food waste, and incentives to businesses that implement food reduction efforts. 
DNR said it plans to continue to measure food waste in Iowa to “to assess effectiveness of the State’s efforts to reduce food waste.”
The study was funded through an EPA Solid Waste Infrastructure for Recycling grant.

Drinking rates in the U.S. in 2025 are at their lowest point since 1958, according to a Gallup poll.
The report says that from 1997 to 2023, at least 60% of Americans reported drinking alcohol at least occasionally. That number is now 54%.
Pollsters say it coincides with research highlighting health risks with any level of drinking, in contrast with earlier studies that found health benefits with moderate drinking.
Gallup has been tracking Americans’ drinking habits annually since 1939, and the drinking rate has only been under 60% eight times.
This shift in drinking habits is mainly being seen among younger generations. In 2001, 72% of young adults aged 18 to 34 reported drinking alcohol. That number is now at 50%.
Other demographics that have shown the highest decline include: Republicans, households making less than $40,000 or more than $100,000, white adults and women.

(Photo by Getty Images)A third lawsuit has been filed against Iowa’s insurance commissioner over the legality of a new state law regulating pharmacy benefit managers.
A group of insurance companies argue Senate File 383, signed into law earlier this year, “upends the prescription-drug coverage that Iowans receive and prevents health-benefit plans from communicating cost-saving information about one pharmacy over another.” The lawsuit claims federal law preempts that sort of “interference,” and the First Amendment prohibits the law’s restrictions on free speech.
The lawsuit was filed Thursday in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa by OptumRx, a pharmacy benefit manager headquartered in Minnesota, and by several insurance providers or health plan administrators with which it contracts: United HealthCare Services, UMR Inc., UnitedHealthcare Insurance Company, UnitedHealthcare Plan of the River Valley, and Golden Rule Insurance Company.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Two previous lawsuits challenging the legality of Senate File 383 have already paused enforcement of parts of the law.
In July, Chief U.S. District Judge Stephanie Rose concluded that significant portions of the new law are most likely illegal and invalid and preliminarily enjoined the law’s enforcement against the plaintiffs in that particular case – the Iowa Association of Business and Industry.
In October, Rose blocked the law’s enforcement in a separate but similar case brought by Wellmark Blue Cross-Blue Shield, Iowa’s largest health insurer. In that case, Rose issued a temporary injunction pausing the imposition of a $10.68 dispensing fee for prescriptions filled at pharmacies in Iowa under Wellmark covered plans and policies.
The new law restricts PBMs’ ability to set certain cost-sharing rates and fees intended to incentivize a person to fill their prescription at a particular pharmacy. The law also requires independent pharmacies to be reimbursed at the average national acquisition cost of a drug plus a $10.68 dispensing fee.
The law is backed by the owners of many small and rural pharmacies, but is opposed by some business leaders and health insurance companies who argue that while it provides more money for small pharmacies it does so at the expense of Iowa consumers.

ABI has warned the measure could result in an additional $340 million in costs for private-sector health insurance plans, resulting in an increase of $169 for the average insured Iowans’ pharmaceutical costs each year.
Iowa’s insurance commissioner, Doug Ommen, has appealed the injunction issued in the ABI case to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, and ABI has filed a cross-appeal. Both appeals are still pending.
New lawsuit cites decision in ABI case
In the newly filed lawsuit brought by OptumRx and its business partners, the plaintiffs allege Senate File 383 adds “far-reaching, draconian and expensive new measures” to Iowa law, and they are seeking an injunction halting enforcement of the new law. They also argue the new law is preempted by the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.
Citing the district court’s reasoning in the ABI case, the plaintiffs in the new lawsuit argue that Ommen cannot legitimately enforce Senate File 383 against the many entities who aren’t parties to the ABI lawsuit.
They note that shortly after the injunction was issued in the ABI case, the commissioner opted to forgo enforcement of the new law against OptumRx, UHS, UMR, UHIC, UHC River Valley and Golden Rule. “But the situation has changed,” the lawsuit states, alleging that on Sept. 24, 2025, the commissioner issued a bulletin to all pharmacy benefit managers announcing his intent to enforce the law against all entities that were not part of ABI’s case, asserting he was “obligated” to do so.
“Senate File 383 financially harms not just the plaintiffs but also the Iowans that they serve,” the lawsuit claims. “Further, the commissioner’s enforcement of SF 383 wastes resources, carries potential monetary penalties, and risks plaintiffs’ licensure in the State of Iowa.”
The lawsuit seeks, “at a minimum,” the same injunctive relief already afforded to the parties in the ABI case.
The office of the insurance commissioner has yet to file a response to the lawsuit.

The board Thursday approved changes to requirements for directors in the Child Nutrition Program. (Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama State Board of Education Thursday approved changes to the requirements for hiring directors for the state’s Child Nutrition Program.
The changes would require candidates to have a high school diploma; three years of food service management experience, state approved training and a level four certificate from the School Nutrition Association.
Previously, a child nutrition program director had to have a bachelor’s degree in food and nutrition, food service management, or home economics; a minimum of 1,400 hours in compensated food management or an approved alternative, and 15 hours of professional development.
According to State Schools Superintendent Eric Mackey, the previous requirements were set by the federal government. That led to criticisms from state school districts, especially rural ones.
“For many years, going back before I was in this role, in my last role, we had complaints about the rules being so strict that we in many of our school districts, especially rural counties, could not find people who met the qualifications,” Mackey said. “Qualifications were set by the US Department of Agriculture, so we couldn’t do anything about that. But in 2025 the agriculture department really relaxed their rules and gave states more flexibility, and our board immediately picked that up.”
Mackey said the changes would “allow more people to be able to join our child nutrition management team.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_0243-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-11-14 12:57:07.875626

Credit: Related DigitalRyan Friedrichs, a vice president for the company pushing the controversial AI data center project in Saline Township, and the husband of Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, would recuse himself from any projects before the state if Benson is elected governor in 2026.
That said, the company stopped short of saying that Friedrichs would leave his post at the company, which is owned by one of Benson’s larger donors. Whether Friedrichs stepping down or stepping away from the company would resolve the conflict remains an open question for the state’s voters in the August 2026 primary, or the general election should Benson move on to the fall contest.
Questions about a potential conflict of interest between Friedrichs, Benson and Related Companies, the parent corporation of Related Digital, which is developing the data center, came to the fore after Michigan Advance and others reported that the secretary of state’s husband held a high-ranking position in the company and was involved in its past lobbying work.
Michigan’s Benson has familial, professional ties to company pushing data center project in Saline

Benson is one of the leading contenders in the gubernatorial race, and not just on the Democratic primary side. Friedrichs recently terminated his lobbying license as Benson geared up to run for governor.
Still, the connection raised concerns about whether Benson could be impartial and free from influence given that Related Digital has such a large business interest before the state. The matter not only concerned her husband, but also one of her billionaire donors and professional connections: Stephen Ross, the owner of Related Companies.
The Advance asked Related Companies on Wednesday whether Friedrichs would step down from his position in the company if Benson were to win the August 2026 primary, secure the Democratic Party nomination and eventually go on to win the general election in the fall.
A company spokesperson said that they would respond to the inquiry but did not do so on Wednesday evening.
Benson’s campaign indicated to the Advance on Thursday morning that Friedrichs would indeed step aside from any state business the company might have if the secretary of state ascended to the highest seat in Michigan government next year.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
On Thursday afternoon, Kathleen Anne Corless, vice president of Corporate Communications for Related Companies, confirmed that Friedrichs would do so if Benson was elected governor.
“This is the largest economic investment in Michigan’s history – Ryan has been a valued member of our team working on community and stakeholder engagement,” Corless said via email. “Our plan is to begin full construction at the end of this year, and regardless of who wins the governor’s race and is sworn in come January 2027, we are not aware of any aspects of the project that would then be before the new administration for consideration.”
Corless went on to say that Related Companies has “strict conflict of interest policies,” and “of course Ryan would then recuse himself from any projects before the state.”
The project is also prohibited from future expansion, making a conflict of interest less likely. But even with Friedrichs out of the picture, any future state business involving Ross’ Related Companies during a potential Benson governorship could still raise conflict of interest questions.

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)New Hampshire Republicans are again trying to eliminate a series of programs across state government they consider to be part of diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts.
During the last legislative session, lawmakers debated eliminating the state’s Office of Health Equity and the Department of Environmental Services’ civil rights and environmental justice programs, as well as forbidding the governor from ever re-creating the now-disbanded Governor’s Advisory Council on Diversity and Inclusion. That bill failed, but as a compromise lawmakers renamed the Office of Health Equity to the Office of Health Access in the budget legislation. Additionally, lawmakers enacted a ban on state agencies engaging in diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts.
2025’s bill was spearheaded by Republicans like Rep. Mike Belcher, who called diversity programs “evil” and said at the time they “ought to be considered unlawful and unconstitutional.” However, officials at the Department of Health and Human Services, where the Office of Health Access (then the Office of Health Equity) is housed, said the offices are merely meant to allow people with disabilities, people learning to speak English, or others to access state services they’re legally entitled to. Many Republicans argued this isn’t actually DEI, while Democrats said the work was important regardless of whether it was DEI.
In addition to helping blind, deaf, or English language learners obtain state services, the Office of Health Access operates the federally funded refugee resettlement program — which helps new Americans find employment, health care, and social services — and community engagement efforts to understand what health barriers exist in the state. The Department of Environmental Services’ civil rights and environmental justice programs work to ensure the department is in compliance with federal laws like the 1965 Civil Rights Act and the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act. The Governor’s Advisory Council on Diversity and Inclusion was disbanded during the transition from former Gov. Chris Sununu to current Gov. Kelly Ayotte after her November 2024 election victory. Ayotte told the Bulletin in February she had no plans to resurrect it.
Rep. Yury Polozov, a Hooksett Republican, introduced the same bill ahead of the 2026 session. Polozov said during Wednesday’s House Health and Human Services Committee meeting that the state’s ban on diversity, equity, and inclusion programs might make parts of the bill unnecessary, “but the underlying message and underlying intention of this bill is crucial for our state.” He said he believes there’s a group of legislators willing to work on floor amendments to adjust the bill.
Health and Human Services Associate Commissioner Ann Landry said if the bill went into effect as written, the department would simply move the functions of the eliminated offices to other offices because they’re required by federal law.
“All the functions have to remain for us to be successful at DHHS,” Landry said, “Either because we’re federally required or required by state law, or it’s a really important part of our engagement with the rural communities and actually all communities across the state.”
John Williams, director of legislative affairs for the department, told lawmakers that 2025’s bill was one in “a very small percent of bills” that the department “actually actively opposed.” He said it was similarly opposed to the bill passing in 2026.
Rep. Mark McLean, a Manchester Republican, called the bill “problematic” but said he was going to vote for it “out of respect” for Polozov. He said if it isn’t amended before a floor vote, he will vote against it there.
Rep. Lucy Weber, a Walpole Democrat, said, “It makes no sense to me to vote yes on a bill that we all agree is fundamentally flawed.”
“I would prefer an ITL (inexpedient to legislate) motion,” she said ahead of her no vote. “If somebody thinks they can fix the bill between now and the time we meet, the remedy would be to vote ITL on the bill as it stands, but bring an amendment that could be considered on the floor.”
The committee voted 9-8 to recommend the entire House pass the bill.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/healthaccess-1024x630.jpg,,,2025-11-14 11:58:51.002434

(Stock photo via Getty Images)In South Carolina, a nurse practitioner’s level of autonomy depends not on training or competence, but on where they work.
At the Veterans Affairs outpatient clinic where I practice, I can deliver autonomous care. Four years ago, when I worked in private practice, that same level of care required a written practice agreement with a collaborating physician.
The South Carolina Nurse Practice Act was amended in 2018 to replace the term “supervising” with “collaborating” physician, an important but limited step toward modernizing nurse practitioner regulation.
There were also changes to where nurse practitioners could practice in relation to the collaborating physicians and some changes in prescriptive authority. The state still requires formal practice agreements that restrict nurse practitioners from working to the full extent of their education and licensure.
In contrast, in 2016 the Veterans Health Administration granted full practice authority to nurse practitioners nationwide. This policy was designed to increase access to care, improve efficiency, and address provider shortages.
Within the Veterans Affairs system, I provide care independently while collaborating naturally with physicians, pharmacists, and mental health professionals as part of a multidisciplinary team.
Collaboration occurs because it benefits patients, not because it is required by regulation.
Nurse practitioners are not seeking to replace physicians but to complement them within the health care system. My own professional path included 16 years as a registered nurse before becoming a nurse practitioner.
While new graduates benefit from supervision and mentorship, long-term restrictions do not enhance safety. Instead, they create unnecessary administrative barriers and delay patient care.
According to the Commonwealth Fund’s 2023 State Health System Performance Scorecard, South Carolina ranked 37th nationally for overall health system performance, based on access, quality, and efficiency.
Research consistently shows that states granting full practice authority to nurse practitioners perform better on these same measures. Expanding practice authority allows for more efficient use of the health care workforce, particularly in rural and underserved communities.
Granting nurse practitioners full practice authority would not drastically change daily practice for most providers. It would simply streamline administrative requirements.
Removing the need for a collaborating physician’s name on nurse practitioner licenses and allowing independent prescribing of certain medications would save time for both nurse practitioners and physicians, allowing all providers to focus more on patient care.
South Carolina faces the same workforce and access challenges as many states, with growing health care demands and a shortage of primary care physicians.
Allowing nurse practitioners to practice to the full scope of their licensure is a proven strategy to expand access, maintain quality, and improve health outcomes.
Modernizing these regulations is not about changing who provides care, it’s about ensuring South Carolinians can receive the care they need, when and where they need it.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/nurse-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-14 11:58:51.002434

(Photo by Laura Paton/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island’s second attempt to grow its offshore wind portfolio is dead in the water.
Michael Dalo, a spokesperson for Rhode Island Energy, confirmed in an email to Rhode Island Current Friday morning that the company ended its negotiations with SouthCoast Wind to purchase power from the project. 
The news comes more than a year after Rhode Island officials unveiled a tentative contract with SouthCoast Wind developers to buy 200 megawatts of electricity from the project planned south of Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket. Negotiations finalizing the deal stalled multiple times due to a series of setbacks by the Trump administration, including revocation of a key federal permit for the project.
Dalo cited the federal uncertainty facing the offshore wind industry as reason for the cutoff of contract negotiations.
“After several [power purchase agreement] negotiation extensions and continued uncertainty in the offshore wind industry, we were unable to come to agreeable terms” Dalo said in his email. “We remain fully supportive of the offshore wind industry and look forward to future clean energy [sic] opportunities as the industry evolves.”
 He did not immediately respond to follow-up questions including when the deal was officially cast aside. The latest deadline, Nov. 1, came and went with no public acknowledgement from either party on the status of the talks.
SouthCoast Wind also did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment on Friday. 
The 149-turbine project, proposed 60 miles south of Rhode Island, was also under tentative contract with Massachusetts utility companies to buy the rest of the 1,200 megawatts of nameplate capacity. Massachusetts officials worked in concert with Rhode Island and Connecticut to leverage bulk buying power in a first-of-its-kind tri-state solicitation for projects — even scheduling their contract negotiations to coincide with Rhode Island’s timeline.
The Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources did not immediately respond to questions on the status of its contract negotiations Friday.
The deal, if finalized, would have been the second offshore wind project providing power to Rhode Island, providing enough electricity to power 125,000 homes if operating at full capacity. It follows the state’s contract for 400 megawatts of electricity from the Revolution Wind project, now nearing the end of construction in Rhode Island Sound. Environmental advocates and state energy leaders have touted the benefits of wind-powered electricity to stabilize the regional electric grid while helping meet Rhode Island’s decarbonization mandates, including the Act on Climate Law of 2021.
Gov. Dan McKee’s office did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment on Friday.
But the nascent offshore wind industry has faced headwinds under the Trump administration, which halted federal reviews on offshore wind projects on Trump’s first day in office. Setbacks mounted as federal regulators then set their sights on projects already past the federal approval stage, including Revolution Wind, which faced a monthlong pause in August that was later overturned by a federal judge’s order. 
Meanwhile, federal regulators sought to revoke key permits for other projects, including the construction and operations plan for SouthCoast Wind granted in the waning days of the Biden administration.
On the same day a federal judge in D.C. granted the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s request to pull back the permit for SouthCoast, Rhode Island energy regulators authorized the project developer’s request for a license to run underwater transmission lines up the Sakonnet River and out Mount Hope Bay. However, the Rhode Island Energy Facility Siting Board’s unanimous approval on Nov. 4 was conditioned upon the project receiving all federal and state approvals.

The Democratic share of Connecticut voters dropped almost 2 percentage points since 2020, the Republican portion increased 0.7 percentage points, and voters unaffiliated with any party increased by 1%. 
But Democratic candidates aren’t necessarily losing votes as the party loses registrants — made clear after Democrats flipped control of 28 towns and cities in the Nov. 4 election.
Across the nation, more voters are straying away from political parties. According to Gallup polls, a record 43% of people across the nation self-identified as independent in both 2023 and 2024. Since 2000, the number of self-identifying independents has only reached 43% one other time — in 2014.
But within the state, towns and cities are split on this change. Just under half of towns saw a decrease in the percentage of all voters who were unaffiliated, while a little more than half saw an increase.
For Republican and Democratic registration, though, this is not the case. Nearly every town in the state saw a decrease in registered Democrats 2024 to 2025, with many seeing percent changes of over 1% in just one year.
Republicans got a big bump in party registration — accounting for 0.8% more of all registered voters 2023 to 2025. More than 100 towns saw percent increases in registered Republicans 2024 to 2025, and cities like Hartford and New Haven saw the largest percent increases, following a larger state-wide trend.
More than 20 towns held municipal primaries in 2025, which can affect party registration trends.
Despite having closed primaries, Connecticut is one of ten states that has a higher percent of unaffiliated voters than Democrats or Republicans, as of August 2025 data from Ballotpedia.
While the Republican party is gaining registrants state-wide, only two towns have more registered Republicans than any other party. Most towns had a plurality of unaffiliated voters, but in many places, registered Democrats and unaffiliated voters are neck in neck.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/D4SC7-the-share-of-unaffiliated-ct-voters-has-been-growing--1024x672.png,,,2025-11-14 11:58:51.002434

(Photo courtesy of Northlands Rescue Mission)Most North Dakotans enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program could see their full November benefits restored as early as Monday, according to the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced Wednesday it would release the funding for most SNAP recipients within 24 hours of the federal government reopening.
The North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services in a Thursday evening announcement said it was working to get benefits out to residents as soon as possible, but that system updates were pending and it did not have a firm timeline. 
Households that received partial SNAP benefits last week will get the remaining amount, while households that have yet to receive any funding this month will get full benefits, the department said.
“We’re grateful for the full SNAP benefits that support nearly 56,000 North Dakotans,” Pat Traynor, the agency’s interim commissioner, said in the announcement. “The pause revealed the strength of our communities — neighbors, businesses, and organizations stepped up with compassion and resilience.”
Air travel, SNAP benefits, back pay at issue as federal government slowly reopens

The program started the month without funding due to the federal government shutdown, which ended Wednesday night after 43 days.
Partial benefits became available in North Dakota last week after the federal government released 65% of the funding under the order of a federal judge.
While that judge ultimately ordered the executive branch to administer full benefits, President Donald Trump’s administration was appealing the ruling at the time the federal government reopened.
North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong’s office earlier this month granted $915,000 in state funds to the Great Plains Food Bank to address food insecurity during the shutdown while funding for SNAP remained uncertain.
Great Plains Food Bank spokesperson Darby Njos said the nonprofit expects to distribute 3.5 million pounds of food in November and December — about a 60% increase in the amount of food it usually distributes to food pantries around the state.
She said even though SNAP will soon be restored, the food bank expects to see high demand for food assistance to continue.
“We’re seeing consistently strong turnouts at our mobile food pantries, at our pop-up pantries, and our partner food pantries have been reporting heavy, consistent usage,” Njos said.

(Photo by Lori Kersey/West Virginia Watch)More than a dozen people voiced their concerns over the latest proposed health insurance rate hikes for West Virginia state employees during a public hearing in Charleston, West Virginia, Thursday evening. 
Seventeen people spoke during a two-hour public hearing held by the Public Employees Insurance Agency finance board at the Culture Center.
Most called on state lawmakers to work with the PEIA board to find a solution for state employees’ rising health insurance costs. 
“I’m asking you: let’s have these conversations,” Joe White, executive director of the West Virginia School Service Personnel Association, told the PEIA finance board. “This can be fixed. That’s my ask. A simple ask. This is real numbers, this is real lives, this is real people.”
White read the PEIA finance board an example of a teacher taking home less pay than they did in previous years because of increases in health insurance costs and a lack of raises. 
“Our folks are working, some of them for free,” White said. “… I tried to Google today what job do you have where you make less money a year after 10 years. Google can’t even give me an answer. Folks are hurting.”
PEIA officials have proposed increasing premiums by 3% for state and non-state employees and employers, and for retirees during fiscal year 2027, which begins in July.
For state employees, a monthly spousal surcharge would increase by an average of $200 per month. The surcharge is for families that have a spouse who chose a PEIA plan despite having the option of a health insurance plan offered by their own employer. 
PEIA officials say they’re bound by the law to make the surcharge the actual cost of the plan. 
Non-state agencies would be required to have at least half of their employees enrolled in a PEIA health plan. 
The proposed rate hikes are not as steep as the increases that went into effect in July, when premiums went up by 14% for state employees, by 16% for local government workers and by 12% for retirees. Out-of-pocket and copay costs also went up. 
Jerry Throckmorton, a Kanawha County teacher for more than 30 years, called the PEIA rate hikes a crisis that could lead to people leaving the teaching profession. 
“If we don’t solve this problem with people retired making less money, people that see their paychecks and they’re making less than they did the year before, that’s going to cause a massive exodus of people,” he said. “We can barely find people to fill slots now.”
He said lawmakers, the governor and the PEIA board should work together to come up with solutions for the crisis. He worries that the younger generation of teachers will disappear.
“Those are the people that will provide the future of the state,” Throckmorton said. “And if we let those people move on to something else because of all these issues, then how will we make West Virginia better?” 
Kanawha County Commissioner Natalie Tennant said the majority of county workers are on a PEIA plan that would increase by 5% next year under the board’s proposal. She noted that according to the agency’s five-year plan, those workers will see a “worrisome” 14% increase in fiscal year 2028. 
Tennant said commissioners approved a 6% pay increase for county workers, the first in three years, that would be eaten if their PEIA rates increase by 5%. 
Increased health care costs affect employee household budgets and the county’s ability to recruit and retain employees, she said. 
“We all know how challenging it is to find and keep skilled public safety workers,” Tennant said. “When benefits become less affordable, good people leave, and when they leave, we just don’t lose employees. You know this — we lose experience. It takes six months to train somebody, right? So we’re behind in training and continuity of services that our citizens depend on.”
Chad Francis, a representative of the United Mine Workers of America, called the premium increases “punishments.”
“[They’re] penalties against the very people who keep West Virginia running: our teachers, our nurses, our highway workers, state troopers and every civil servant who shows up day after day to serve this state,” Francis said. “Let’s be clear about what’s being proposed, a 3% increase in premiums, on top of inflation, stagnant wages and the rising cost of living, a $200 hiking in the spousal penalty, because apparently, being married to someone with employer coverage is now a taxable offense.”
PEIA leaders have said that the rising cost of health care — particularly inflation on prescription GLP-1 drugs that treat obesity and diabetes — are a major driver of the rate increases.
Leaders have also pointed to a report from the firm BDO that indicated that the sharp rate increases that public workers have had in recent years had been caused in large part because between the years 2018-2022, rates had been frozen. Former Gov. Jim Justice had vowed not to increase the rates during his time as the state’s chief executive.
The series of public hearings will continue in Morgantown Monday and will conclude with a virtual public hearing via Google Meet at 6 p.m. Thursday, Nov. 20.
The PEIA finance board is expected to vote on the proposed increases at its next meeting, slated for Dec. 4.

If this Saturday’s Florida-Ole Miss football game were a bowl game, we all know what its name would be: The Lane Kiffin Bowl. That’s because the worst kept secret in college football is that Florida has zeroed in on Kiffin to be its next head coach.
And, in keeping with the corporate sponsorship of bowl games these days – as in the Allstate Sugar Bowl, Goodyear Cotton Bowl and the Rose Bowl presented by Prudential – I’ve got the perfect name for this one: The Lane Kiffin Bowl, presented by Jimmy Sexton.
Rick Cleveland
Sexton, of course, is Lane Kiffin’s agent. He also represents coaches named Nick Saban, Kirby Smart, Kalen DeBoer, Steve Sarkisian, Mike Norvell, James Franklin, Hugh Freeze and a host of others. He has negotiated hundreds upon hundreds of millions of dollars in contracts for both coaches and athletes so he could easily fund the bowl game sponsorship. He is the Babe Ruth of sports agents. And you know he is loving Saturday’s Lane Kiffin Bowl (6 p.m. kickoff, Vaught-Hemingway Stadium).
Sexton also loves the fact that coaching vacancies exist at LSU and Auburn. The more the merrier, you know. So get your calculators out, and let the bidding begin. You get college football blue bloods Florida and LSU involved in a bidding war and no telling how high the bids will go. 
The fact Ole Miss is a 16.5-point favorite over Florida on Saturday tells you all you need to know about why the demand for Kiffin’s services is so high. Florida has won three national championships and eight SEC Championships since 1990. Ole Miss hasn’t won so much as an SEC division championship in that same period.
Yet, in his six seasons at Ole Miss, the 50-year-old Kiffin has guided the Rebels to 53 victories against just 19 defeats. Perhaps more impressively, his Ole Miss teams are 13 games over .500 in the SEC. Compare that to Tommy Tuberville, who was 12 games below .500 in the SEC when he left Ole Miss in 1998 to take the Auburn job. (Sexton was Sen. Tuberville’s agent, too.)
Little wonder Florida wants Kiffin. Gator fans look at Kiffin and see Steve Spurrier 35 years ago. They see a brash, visor-wearing, offensive-minded coach whose wide receivers always seem to run wide open through opponents’ defenses. They see what Kiffin has done at Ole Miss and can only imagine what he might do at Florida.
Ole Miss enters Saturday’s game at 8-1 and No. 7 in the college football playoff rankings. This has the potential to be the greatest season in Rebel football history. But at a time when everyone who bleeds red and blue should be focused on beating Florida, many are instead worried sick about losing their coach. Keep in mind, they have been down this road before.
The Rebels were 8-1 and ranked No. 11 about this time in 2022. The Auburn job was open then and various news reports had Kiffin headed for the Plains. And you know what happened next. Ole Miss, a clearly distracted football team, lost four straight games.
Eventually, Kiffin stayed at Ole Miss. The Rebels have won 30 games in the nearly three seasons since. Ole Miss has given Kiffin everything he has asked for – beyond a salary of  about $9.5 million per year. Ole Miss supporters are bankrolling a football NIL budget of more than $20 million a year and an assistant coaches salary pool of more than $8 million a year.
We could debate forever which is the better job. Five years ago, I would have said Florida, hands down. But not now. The transfer portal and NIL have changed everything in college football. Ole Miss athletic director Keith Carter, NIL guru Walker Jones and, yes, Kiffin have been on the cutting edge in all that. 
Florida, with a bigger stadium, is located in a much larger state amid much more football talent. But with all that comes higher expectations. Remember, Dan Mullen won 60% of his games in nine seasons at Mississippi State and then took the Florida job. He won nearly 70% of his games in four seasons with the Gators – and got his butt fired.
Kiffin could end all that speculation and avoid a repeat of 2022, Instead, in a press conference earlier this week he added fuel to the fire. “There are still advantages for the traditional ‘blue bloods,’” Kiffin said. “Kids still care about stadium size, history, Heismans, national championships, and location to talent…”

The New Mexico Department of Workforce Solutions this week launched the Rural Education-Workforce Collaborative, an initiative connecting early education through 12th grade in rural school districts with career development opportunities in high-demand fields.
The $400,000 initiative is funded through the Community Benefit Fund, which falls under the Department of Workforce Solutions. The fund was created during the 2025 Legislative Session to support programs that reduce climate change impacts and create worker training programs for industries that address such programs.
“We created the Community Benefit Plan to spark exactly this type of creative partnership,” President Pro Tempore Sen. Mimi Stewart (D-Albuquerque) said in a statement. “This investment will give young people real skills and paths to stay in the rural communities they love while building our state’s capacity to face the challenges of a changing climate and economy.”
According to the Department of Workforce Solutions, the new model is a collaboration between the department, rural PreK-12 school districts, institutions of higher education and Collegiate Edu-Nation, a nonprofit organization that consults with rural school districts across the country to end education and income inequality. The program will “expand access for rural students by integrating education and workforce resources such as dual credit programs, free college tuition and work-based learning opportunities.”
The goal is to prepare rural, low-income, first-generation students and those with disabilities or from tribal communities to meet the state’s growing workforce needs. The Collegiate Edu-Nation initiative started in Texas and now includes New Mexico public school districts such as Corona Public Schools, Mosquero Municipal Schools and Loving Municipal Schools. 
“This workforce-school partnership tackles several challenges at once by connecting education to real world opportunities from the earliest stage, creating opportunities for rural youth and building our workforce in climate-ready and infrastructure careers,” Department of Workforce Solutions Secretary Sarita Nair said in a statement. “The collaborative will demonstrate how much we can accomplish when we join forces with innovative rural school districts and the local workforce development board to give students true options for their futures and strengthen New Mexico’s economy.”
According to Lee White, superintendent of Loving Municipal Schools, it is difficult to connect students in rural communities to “real world opportunities that align with regional industry trends.” 
I believe that we are on the cusp of effectively changing student outcomes through this model and partnership,” White said in a statement.
The Department of Workforce Solutions noted that a dashboard will be used to measure academic and workforce outcomes going forward.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Rural-Education-Workforce-01-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-14 10:00:17.957968

Peter J. Skandalakis, executive director of the Prosecuting Attorneys’ Council of Georgia, will take over the case from embattled Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, Skandalakis announced Friday.
Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee had tasked Skandalakis with finding a replacement for Willis by Friday or he would allow the case to be dismissed.
Skandalakis said he contacted “several” other prosecutors who declined to take up the case.
“The decision to assume responsibility for this matter was reached only after careful and deliberate consideration,” Skandalakis wrote. “While it would have been simple to allow Judge McAfee’s deadline to lapse or to inform the Court that no conflict prosecutor could be secured—thereby allowing the case to be dismissed for want of prosecution—I did not believe that to be the right course of action.”
Skandalakis said he recently received 101 banker boxes of documents related to the Trump investigation and an 8-terabyte hard drive containing the complete investigative file.
“Since receiving these materials, I have diligently worked to familiarize myself with the record and the status of the proceedings,” he said. “Additionally, I have attempted to review the evidence gathered and the hours of interviews and proffers of witnesses and former codefendants.  Unfortunately, I have not had sufficient time to complete my review. With Judge McAfee’s deadline now upon us and my review still ongoing, I have determined that the best course of action is to appoint myself to the case. This will allow me to complete a comprehensive review and make an informed decision regarding how best to proceed.”
A Fulton County grand jury  indicted Trump in 2023 when he was out of office along with 18 others who she alleged formed a conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election, which Trump narrowly lost to President Joe Biden.
Following the loss, Trump had famously called Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and asked him to “find” the missing votes he would have needed to win. The alleged scheme also involved plans to submit a bogus slate of electors to falsely certify that Trump had won the election, a harassment campaign against Fulton County poll workers and a voting systems breach in Coffee County.
Four of the alleged co-conspirators pleaded guilty and agreed to testify against Trump and the other defendants, who maintained their innocence.
But the beginning of the case’s end came when an attorney for defendant Michael Roman, a former Trump campaign aide, introduced evidence that Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis had been involved in a romantic relationship with Nathan Wade, a special prosecutor she hired for the case with a lucrative contract, creating a potential conflict of interest.
After dramatic testimony including descriptions of vacations and cruises the two had taken together, a judge ordered that either Wade or Willis’ office needed to step aside from the case.
Wade resigned from the case, but Willis was ultimately disqualified from pursuing the charges against Trump by the Georgia Court of Appeals because of the “significant appearance of impropriety” stemming from their relationship. The Georgia Supreme Court declined to hear Willis’ appeal in September, leaving the case officially in need of a new prosecutor.
Georgia’s case is the last criminal case still pending against Trump.
Prosecution against Trump himself may stall while he is serving as president, but the cases against other alleged co-conspirators could move forward. That could represent a stumbling block for the president after other legal developments have gone his way.
U.S. Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith dropped a federal election interference case as well as a case alleging Trump mishandled classified documents after Trump’s 2024 election victory because it would be illegal to continue prosecuting him after taking office.
A New York state appeals court overturned a nearly $500 million civil penalty Trump was ordered to pay in a case involving fraudulent loan applications, though the judges left the fraud finding in place.
Trump is appealing a New York conviction involving hush money payments to adult film star Storsmy Daniels, which gave him the status of being the only felon elected president, and he’s seeking Supreme Court intervention in a civil case over a claim that he sexually abused and defamed writer E. Jean Carroll.

The Catholic hospital owned by Trinity Health of New England cited persistent staffing constraints as the reason for the suspension. Providers will continue to offer prenatal and postnatal care at outpatient sites throughout Western Massachusetts, according to a press release, but babies will not be delivered at the hospital. The medical center reached an agreement with nearby Baystate Medical Center in Springfield to handle many of Mercy’s maternity patients. 
Mercy Medical Center spokesperson Mary Orr did not give an estimated timeline for how long delivery services may be suspended, but a statement from the hospital said it “will continue to pursue all options to resume continuous, safe, high-quality maternity care.”  
But Alan Sager, a Boston University School of Public Health professor, said there is reason to sound the alarm.  
“This is not pretty,” Sager said. “You lose the doctors who retire and relocate when the hospital closes or when the service shuts down, and then it’s very hard to attract doctors or nurses back into an underserved area.”  
Nearly 77 percent of Mercy’s patient revenue came from Medicaid and Medicare as of 2023, and “Medicaid is not a generous payer,” Sager noted.  
Since 2014, 11 hospitals in Massachusetts have closed or filed to close their maternity units, according to Health Policy Commission data. Holyoke Medical Center just north of Springfield permanently closed its maternity services unit in 2020 a few months after temporarily shuttering it, later citing the unit’s persistent annual financial losses as the reason for the closure. Many patients from Holyoke have since sought care at Mercy. 
“Given Mercy’s location in Springfield serving a fairly heavy mix of Latino patients … the closing of Mercy’s maternity care can dislocate patients who may find it hard to obtain care they’re equally comfortable with elsewhere,” Sager said. “Language-related differences matter to patients. They’re disadvantaged by the successive displacements of care.”  
The Massachusetts Nurses Association (MNA) has argued that the Department of Public Health should be acting more aggressively by treating the suspension like an essential service closure, which provides a mechanism for DPH to review a proposed closure or reduction in services. DPH did not respond to a request for comment.  
Jaime Hyatt, a registered nurse serving as co-chair of the MNA bargaining committee at Mercy where he has worked for nearly 25 years, says the staffing issues did not arise overnight.  
“Nurses have witnessed deliberate inaction on Trinity Health’s part to backfill vacant positions – especially on the provider side – as evidenced by job postings offering below-market wages,” Hyatt and bargaining co-chair Dee Doyle said in a statement. “This failure to adequately recruit and retain staff has led directly to the erosion of care we see today.”  
Mercy declined to answer questions about the maternity unit’s staffing levels and its efforts to recruit and retain employees.  
Just over 800 babies were delivered at Mercy in 2022, according to most recent DPH data. Cooley Dickinson Hospital in Northampton and Baystate in Springfield are the two nearest remaining options for patients from Holyoke, Springfield, Chicopee, Westfield, and other surrounding towns. Sager said hospitals are not “interchangeable parts,” and shuttering a service “rips apart the fabric of care” where patients once felt comfortable. 
“Springfield is the third largest city in the Commonwealth. How is it possible that there’s no choice of care?” Hyatt said. “It does not seem like the choice should be one hospital in Springfield.”  
The financial stability of Mercy Medical Center came into question this summer after reports surfaced that Baystate Health was in talks to acquire the hospital, which Hyatt and Doyle say left staff feeling “vulnerable and compelled to seek employment elsewhere.” In April, the Boston Globe reported on Mercy’s “exodus” of emergency room doctors and its hiring of a private, for-profit medical staffing agency that led to staff departures and pay cuts. In 2024, the hospital lost nearly $30 million and had the lowest profit margin among all independent health systems and hospitals in the state at –9.2 percent.  
Hyatt said he is worried the hospital will soon begin seeing births in its emergency department.   
“If they are far enough along, there’s not going to be time to send them down the street to Baystate,” he said. 
Pulling back services even temporarily in a region with already-limited options for maternal health care has nurses and providers like Hyatt concerned that Western Massachusetts could later become a maternity desert. 
“By letting this close, it shows that we are in contraction as opposed to expansion,” he said.",https://commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Hospital-1024x768.png,,,2025-11-14 10:00:17.957968

A week after Typhoon Halong passed through Japan in early October, its remnants crossed the Pacific and struck western Alaska. Nearly 50 Alaska Native communities across the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta near the Bering Sea were met with towering wind speeds, record storm surge, and widespread flooding. At least one person died, and 1,500 adults and children, who were mostly Yup’ik, were displaced from the villages. Initial estimates have reported that the storm decimated 90 percent of homes in the coastal village of Kipnuk and 35 percent in Kwigillingok, which has also experienced toxic chemicals spilling into its freshwater supply.
“It’s going to take years to recover from the disaster,” said Senator Lisa Murkowski at the Alaska Federation of Natives’ annual convention last month. “After the floodwaters recede, and after the damage to the homes and the fish camp is calculated, there’s so much work that remains and so much healing that is needed.”
State and federal resources are being mobilized to respond to the disaster. On October 22, alongside Governor Mike Dunleavy’s state emergency declaration and release of disaster relief funds, President Donald Trump authorized a federal emergency declaration and $25 million in funds for recovery and rebuilding efforts. State agencies such as the Alaska Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management have also begun moving evacuees into long-term housing.
“This declaration is a critical step toward recovery, but it must be the beginning of a broader, sustained response,” said Vivian Korthius, who is Yup’ik and the CEO of the Association of Village Council Presidents, in a statement.
Kipnuk and the other villages hit by the storm have been on the front lines of climate change for more than a decade. Rising temperatures have caused permafrost to melt, causing land subsidence and flooding throughout the delta. According to the Alaska Climate Research Center, Typhoon Halong also exhibited characteristics consistent with the effects of climate change. Rising temperatures have changed the nature of tropical cyclones, leading to heavier rainfall, hurricane-like winds, and taller waves. The storm surge that struck Kipnuk, for instance, broke a 25-year-old record.
Many of the Alaska Native villages affected by Typhoon Halong were established in coastal areas as a result of the colonial policies imposed by the United States government. When the Russian Empire arrived in Alaska during the early 19th century, fur traders sought to benefit from the industry’s boom along the coastline. After Russia sold the land to the United States in 1867, the federal government aimed not only to seize and occupy lands but to encourage assimilation through boarding and day schools operated by the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
The boarding school era played a crucial role in how villages were organized. Tribal communities sought to keep their children at home, given that boarding schools forced them to live away from their tribal cultures and were associated with abuse. As a result, Yu’pik communities chose to live near and send their children to village schools run by the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
“They were told, or at least it was implied, if not told, that you need to settle here to send your kids to school, or they may be sent away to boarding school,” said Sheryl Musgrove, the climate justice programs director at the Alaska Institute for Justice, who oversees climate adaptation, mitigation, and relocation with village partners in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta.
The historic passage of the 1971 Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, commonly known in the state as ANCSA, also reshaped where communities settled. The law abolished existing Native land claims in exchange for 44 million acres to be managed through private regional and village corporations. These for-profit entities, which operate in industries such as logging and oil, created jobs and encouraged settlement in centralized villages and regional hubs. As a result, settlements further solidified along the coast and near rivers.
Given that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has predicted that Alaska’s summer waters will be ice-free in the next decade, communities have been trying to relocate with the assistance of tribal corporations. But relocating an entire village is a tall order. Costs are high, and selecting a site to relocate to with assistance from the regional corporation can be challenging. For instance, 300 people from Newtok, a village north of the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, moved 9 miles away to a new village known as Metarvik late last year. But the infrastructure in Metarvik is already falling apart. Electricity is intermittent, running water is lacking, and residents have had to use 5-gallon buckets as toilets. The project, which was meant to serve as a model for other villages, received millions in federal grants but ultimately lacked federal guidance and fell short of meeting residents’ needs.
Despite a different legal terrain and colonial legacy, the federal government still has treaty responsibilities to uphold toward tribes in Alaska. In May, the Environmental Protection Agency canceled a $20 million flood protection grant awarded by the Biden administration last year. This landmark grant was expected to accelerate relocation for many villages. Rescinding funding was yet another example of the lack of federal investment, Musgrove said.
Due to the severity of the storm’s impact, Kwigillingok leaders have elected to proceed with relocation. It’s a decision that the Alaska Institute for Justice will assist with.
“No one knows what the future brings, and we need serious investments in these communities like Kwigillingok and Kipnuk to be able to rebuild or relocate — whichever they choose to,” said Musgrove. “So they can be safe from that next storm, whenever that next storm is in frame.”

People continue to die from drug overdoses in Los Angeles County jails — yet the county’s Department of Health Services has scaled back the accessibility of opioid addiction treatment for people behind bars, writes CalMatters’ Cayla Mihalovich.
In a Sept. 16 memo obtained by CalMatters, Chief Medical Officer Sean Henderson said that Correctional Health Services will take “a pause on primary care in ordering buprenorphine,” a medication that curbs cravings and prevents overdoses. The new guidance also directs prioritizing people who first enter the jail system for treatment, and placing everyone else who wants medication on a waitlist. As of Oct. 31, over 800 people were on the waitlist.
Injectable buprenorphine costs about $1,600 per shot, with nearly 40,000 doses of buprenorphine administered in L.A. County jails since July 2022. The county sets aside about $25 million a year for the treatment program. Its Department of Health Services said the new rules — which restrict access to buprenorphine — were made “to help maximize the reach of (the) program.” The statement did not say how making it harder or having patients wait longer to access buprenorphine would positively affect the reach of the program. 
Critics argue the policy shift is dangerous, and that delaying treatment can lead to more fatal overdoses. 

A physician from the Correctional Health Services who spoke with CalMatters on the condition of anonymity: “Patients are begging me for help. I’m on edge, waiting to see if someone is going to die.”

The change comes as the state is suing L.A. County over the poor conditions of its jails and the high rate of in-custody deaths. Overdoses have made up 28% of jail deaths this year, compared to 9% in 2016, according to a September memo from the director of the county’s correctional health services.

More people want to investigate State Farm

From CalMatters economy reporter Levi Sumagaysay:
As L.A.-area fire survivors complain about insurance-claim delays and denials, the county on Thursday launched an investigation into State Farm’s handling of its policyholders’ claims. It is the second government probe into the insurer this year in California.
The county told State Farm that if it is “engaging in any unlawful or unfair business practices,” it should stop, according to a letter from County Counsel Dawyn Harrison. The county also asked the insurer for detailed information, including about all claims filed related to the January fires, as well as its practices related to smoke damage and insurance adjusters.
State Farm said in a statement that this probe by the county “will be another distraction from our ongoing work in California to help our customers recover from this tragedy.” It said it has been cooperating with the earlier investigation launched by the state Insurance Department in June.
Fire survivors complain the state’s investigation is taking too long, and last week called on Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara to resign.



Senate Pro Tem eyes congressional seat

California’s leading state senator, Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire, is making a bid for Congress following the end of his 12-year term limit next year, writes CalMatters’ Maya C. Miller.
The Santa Rosa Democrat seeks to represent California’s 1st District — one of the districts that has been drastically redrawn under Proposition 50 to favor Democrats. 
During his time in the Legislature, McGuire focused on wildfire prevention after wildfires in Sonoma and Napa counties destroyed thousands of homes and claimed dozens of lives in 2017. In one of the state’s budget bills this year, he also secured the most “pork-barrel” earmarks for local projects in his district.
The 1st District has been comfortably held by Republican Rep. Doug LaMalfa, who has represented the northern part of the state in Congress since 2013. For his support of President Donald Trump’s recent budget bill, which guts Medicaid spending by more than $1.1 trillion over 10 years, constituents slammed LaMalfa in August over a move they said will harm rural hospitals and residents.

Three new pro-development appointees at the powerful Coastal Commission are trying to remedy its poor reputation among housing activists and Democratic leaders.


Bone-colored bluffs and jagged cliffs line the Monterey shoreline where chalky sand meets redwoods.
Its rugged coastline, including beloved destinations such as Big Sur, is well-known California iconography protected by the California Coastal Act for nearly 50 years.
In a push to address the state’s gripping housing crisis, the California Coastal Commission last week approved a rule change to make it easier to build affordable housing in Monterey and elsewhere along the hundreds of miles of the Pacific coast. 
It was the latest effort by the powerful state agency to combat its poor reputation among housing advocates and Democratic leaders who see it as an obstacle to drastic housing reform in California’s coveted coastal regions. While minor and uncontroversial, the amendment was one of a few shifts the commission has made in recent months in an effort to be viewed as playing a part in addressing the state’s crippling housing crisis.
It released a report for the first time in 2024 that showed local governments were responsible for approving the vast majority of permits in coastal regions, and this year the agency worked with housing activists to make it easier to build student housing in coastal cities. Nor did the coastal commission oppose the landmark housing reform law that excludes most new developments from environmental review.
“I think it’s going to have a real-life change,” Susan Jordan, a longtime conservation activist and founder of the California Coastal Protection Network, said of the regulatory amendment at the meeting.
Reputation rehab: Steps toward more housing
Twelve people — six local elected officials and six members of the public — vote on the independent, quasi-judicial state agency tasked with conserving more than 800 miles of the California coast and keeping it open to the public. Its authority spans about 1,000 yards inland from where the land meets the water at high tide.
The commission has faced relentless scrutiny in recent years for not permitting enough affordable housing in coastal cities, or doing so too slowly, as state lawmakers have stripped numerous housing regulations to make it easier to build more apartments.
Gov. Gavin Newsom, a critic of the commission, and other Democratic leaders have appointed three pro-development local officials this year to help get more housing and other developments approved along the Pacific coast.
In October, Newsom appointed wealthy real estate developer Jaime Lee to replace Effie Turnbull Sanders. An attorney appointed by former Gov. Jerry Brown, Sanders was lauded by environmentalists for heralding environmental justice policies to the agency.
Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas, a Salinas Democrat, named two pro-development appointees to the commission in May: Chris Lopez, a Monterey County supervisor, and Chula Vista councilmember Jose Preciado.
Ray Jackson, a Hermosa Beach councilmember, was appointed earlier this year by Democratic Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire of Santa Rosa, and is largely a skeptic of big developers.
In a unanimous vote last week, Peciado, Lopez and Jackson each approved changing the commission’s rules to give affordable housing projects in coastal areas more time to be built, from two to five years after permits are issued. Lee was not at the Nov. 6 meeting.
Staff and commissioners hailed the change as a step in the right direction for affordable housing developments that cannot be financed quickly enough under the previous two-year deadline.
“I think next year would be a good opportunity to roll out an education campaign in the Legislature to highlight some of the movements we made toward this,” Commissioner Linda Escalante said. “I don’t know if we can have a white paper that we can walk around with and figure out some of the reputation issues that we have.”
A history of protecting the coastline
Critics of the commission point to the exorbitant coastal housing prices, some of the highest in the country, and the disproportionate number of white residents, as exacerbating the housing shortage. To some, the commission’s priorities have not matched the urgency of lawmakers and local officials to help solve the cost problem.
Two-thirds of coastal residents are white, about twice as many as in the state as a whole, according to an analysis by Nicholas Depsky at the United Nations Development Programme. 
Fewer than 2.5% of California residents live in coastal cities, or “coastal zones,” which comprise less than 1% of land in the state but are home to some of the most valuable real estate in the world, from Malibu to Marin.

The Coastal Commission began as a 1972 ballot initiative in the shadow of the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill, one of the worst environmental disasters in the country at the time. Amid a broader national environmental movement, there was greater concern about how to protect California’s coveted shoreline in the midst of unregulated offshore drilling and fears of relentless development that would mirror Miami’s coastline. 
Four years later, the state Legislature made the commission permanent with the Coastal Act to protect its natural habitats and keep beaches open to the public.
Early tensions between then-Gov. Jerry Brown and the commission brewed when he slammed its members as “bureaucratic thugs” in 1978, just years after championing its creation. Brown would spend his final years in office, nearly 40 years later, roiled by criticism from environmentalists who accused him of appointing commissioners who were too pro-development. Those fears were heightened with the ousting of executive director Charles Lester in 2016, a strong advocate for coastal protection.
Scrutiny of the commission has accelerated in the Newsom administration, as the governor has publicly chided the agency for its broad powers. After the Los Angeles fires, he swiftly moved to suspend all of its authority over rebuilding efforts in the Pacific Palisades, which abut the coastline. 
Last year, the commission rejected billionaire Elon Musk’s proposal to increase the number of SpaceX rocket launches off the Santa Barbara coast while criticizing his support of President Donald Trump. Newsom said he was “with Elon” after the company filed a lawsuit for political discrimination. The case is still pending. 
Lee, the newest commissioner, hails from Los Angeles and has built a reputation as a prolific builder known for revitalizing Koreatown. Her real estate company, Jamison properties, has built 6,600 multifamily units and is one of the largest private landowners in Los Angeles, according to its website.
Lee did not return emails and phone calls seeking comment from CalMatters.
The new appointments have made many pro-housing advocates hopeful. “We now have three out of 12 voting members who are appointed to the commission in this period when many legislators and the governor want reform at the commission to design more affordable housing,” said Louis Mirante, a lobbyist with the business coalition Bay Area Council. “That tells me that these members will probably move that vision forward.”
Lopez, who has emphasized his support for affordable housing on the coast since joining the commission, said the optimism is warranted.
“I think that that excitement is well placed given where we’re sitting at right now and given the voice that the speaker and the governor are giving at this issue and wanting to see a remedy to it,” Lopez said. “And I do feel it’s the reason I was put here was to have that conversation at the forefront.”
Environmental advocates watch
Environmentalists have mostly been quiet about the new appointments. Instead, they are waiting to see how they vote before raising the alarm.
“While there have been concerns expressed within the environmental movement, at this point we have no idea how this commissioner (Lee) will be,” said Jennifer Savage, associate director of Surfrider Foundation, a coastal protection advocacy group. Lee was not an obvious choice for many, but Savage is optimistic that she’ll support coastal protection.
“It’s actually not that surprising that the governor would appoint someone with housing expertise,” given the political climate, she continued. 
A longtime local water authority official and current administrator at San Diego State University, Preciado said part of his pitch for the role to top Democratic leaders was that he wanted to see more of the coast developed to help create jobs and homes for working-class families.
“We have a keen interest in developing the California coast in such a way where underrepresented communities that live on the coast have more access,” Preciado said of himself and Lopez.
Wealthy coastal residents have long sparred with the commission over violations for blocking public access, such as Silicon Valley billionaire Vinod Khosla, who has been entangled in a slew of legal fights with regulators and coastal groups for years over access to Martins Beach near Half Moon Bay.

Many commissioners and staff view protecting public access and conservation as their primary purpose rather than housing policy. 
Conservationism is out of style, even among Democrats, which has led support for the commission to dramatically shift in recent years, according to legislative director Sarah Christie.
To some commissioners, lawmakers’ push to rip away more and more of its housing authority is a misguided attempt to simplify a complex issue. They point out that 80% of coastal cities and counties have their own coastal laws and are not subject to the commission.
“It’s creating a lot of chaos and dysfunction at the local level and is making it harder,” Christie said of the movement toward slashing housing regulations. “In the Legislature’s enthusiasm and zeal in order to effectuate housing more quickly, they’re kind of stepping on themselves.”
Jackson, a commissioner who represents the South Bay, said lawmakers need to focus more on affordable housing rather than increasing supply more broadly.
Special environmental considerations and its highly sought after nature are what make the coastal zone uniquely expensive, Preciado said. “I think that a broader view, a more objective view, is that developing on the coast is different than developing in urban areas.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/090324_Coastal-Erosion_AH_CM_04.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-14 08:56:13.985169

Education leaders, students and lawmakers will meet Nov. 17  to address a stark reality: The federal government is slashing support for higher education in unprecedented ways. 
They’ll attend the California Assembly Higher Education Committee to discuss how federal budget cuts, regulations and executive orders will affect millions of current and prospective college students across California.  
This isn’t business as usual. Given massive changes at the federal level, California will have to develop new strategies to ensure students can still afford to attend and complete college. 
Fortunately, with smart, deliberate policy our state can still unlock higher education for thousands more students — and deliver a major boost to the economy. The key is uplifting a little-discussed group of Californians: prospective students who come from low- or middle-income households and have little or no family wealth. 
These students, who we refer to as “dually-disadvantaged,” are often eager to attend college but don’t have sufficient funds or support. That’s largely because our financial aid system is designed to make income the primary factor determining state and federal aid. 
Certainly income is important. But family wealth — which includes such assets as savings, investments, real estate, and business revenue — also makes a huge difference in determining whether a student can realistically afford to attend and complete college.
Nationally, 52% of dually-disadvantaged students from low-income, low-wealth households are predicted to go to college, compared to 83% of students from low-income, high-wealth households. 
Among those who start college, only 20% of dually-disadvantaged students are expected to complete, compared to 59% of their similarly low-income, but higher-wealth peers.  
Here in California, nearly a quarter of FAFSA filers are both low-income and low-wealth, amounting to 41,730 first-time, in-state students a year. 
Wealth inequality in the state is even more extreme than income inequality, according to the Public Policy Institute of California. 
The wealthiest households have a net worth estimated at $1.3 million. That’s more than 100 times higher than those near the bottom, whose net worth is about $12,000. Latino and Black households disproportionately have low wealth.
Nevertheless, the Cal Grant program does little to adjust for wealth among eligible students. Two students with the same family income are treated equally, even if one has no wealth and the other has $200,000 in assets. 
California’s Middle Class Scholarship, a separate state financial aid program, has similar issues. It originally was designed to support families whose income is too high to qualify for other aid but who still need support to afford college without hefty student loans. 
Since then, the program has evolved to also support low-income students. In fact, the majority of recipients come from families that make no more than $50,000 annually. 
However, several aspects of the program’s latest design, including its high asset ceiling at  $234,000, limit the program’s ability to target recipients from families with little to no wealth.
Better ways to help the dually-disadvantaged
Fortunately, there are several ways to address the economic needs of California’s students. 
First, we can offer targeted support to dually-disadvantaged students. Following the model of the existing Students with Dependent Children Grant, the state can provide an “access award” for non-tuition costs to these students. 
New research confirms just how powerful such a supplemental grant could be. An October report simulated the possible costs and benefits if California awarded an additional $5,000 grant to students who are in the bottom third of income and have no wealth. The grant would result in about 4,590 more graduates in California per cohort and a boost in state gross domestic product of $966 million — a huge return on a cost of $208 million. 
Second, we can reform the middle class scholarship by better accounting for the full picture of a student’s financial resources. 
If the purpose of the program is to reduce borrowing among low- and middle-class families, then we should design it to better target students who lack the income and wealth to cover college without borrowing at high rates or working excessive hours. This revision would preserve and more equitably center the middle class scholarships, aligning them with statewide goals to support an affordable higher education.
Third, lawmakers can direct additional funding to colleges and universities that disproportionately serve students who are low-wealth and low- or middle-income. And education institutions should provide more holistic support, such as transportation or housing, or better funding for highly utilized on-campus services — such as basic needs centers or student success programs.
There’s no question that federal cuts will introduce a host of new challenges for California’s higher education system. But we can still create strategies that support the students who need it most.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/032725_UC-Merced_LV_CM_10.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-14 08:56:13.985169

Hundreds of people are on a waitlist for opioid addiction treatment in Los Angeles County jails as the state presses the system to reduce overdoses and in-custody deaths


Los Angeles County jails pared back access to life-saving opioid addiction treatment this fall during one of the system’s deadliest years on record, according to records obtained by CalMatters and interviews with staff. 
The policy change came one week after Attorney General Rob Bonta filed a lawsuit against the county over “inhumane” conditions across its jail system, citing a “shocking rate of deaths,” including overdoses. 
In interviews with CalMatters, two Correctional Health Services physicians expressed alarm over the reductions, saying that even the slightest delay in treatment is “wildly dangerous” and can lead to more fatal overdoses. 
“Patients are begging me for help,” said a physician who spoke with CalMatters on the condition of anonymity because of fear of professional retaliation. “I’m on edge, waiting to see if someone is going to die.”
The reduction in treatment also comes as the jails hold about 700 more people every day as a result of a tough-on-crime ballot measure voters approved last year. Proposition 36 increased sentences for certain drug and theft crimes, leading to a surge in jail populations and straining county resources, according to a Sept. 10 Correctional Health Services memo to the Board of Supervisors. 
Los Angeles County allocates roughly $25 million annually for the treatment program. County supervisors this year gave the program an additional $8 million from opioid lawsuit settlements. That sum ultimately did not increase funding for treatment because the department used the money for a different need, according to a statement from the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services.
“The overall (medication-assisted treatment) program funding remained the same” despite the extra money the department received, the statement reads.
In a Sept. 16 memo obtained by CalMatters, Chief Medical Officer Sean Henderson said Correctional Health Services “will be taking a pause on primary care in ordering buprenorphine.” The medication reduces cravings and prevents overdoses. 
The new mandate restricts how quickly and broadly Correctional Health Services physicians can prescribe the medication. Priority will be given to people when they first enter the jail system — the largest in California — which houses roughly 13,000 people across nine main facilities. Everyone else who wants medication will be placed on a waitlist. 
“It’s misleading because we just put people on this list and then they stay on the list,” said a physician.
That means that if someone does not accept treatment upon arrival, they won’t be able to access it during the remainder of their incarceration, even if they change their mind, said both physicians who spoke with CalMatters. 
Legal experts and physicians say there could be a myriad of reasons why people deny treatment when they’re first arrested and incarcerated. For example, a person could be unfit to make medical decisions if they are in active withdrawal.
Waitlist grew for opioid treatment
Between 2,350 and 2,650 incarcerated people in Los Angeles County receive medication-assisted treatment on any given day, said the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services in an email to CalMatters. 
As of Sept. 15 — just one day before the policy change went into effect — 363 people were on a waiting list for treatment, the department said.
But that number skyrocketed to 835 people as of Oct. 31. The total includes 471 newcomers who have never been on the program; the remainder are people who asked to re-enroll after dropping out. As of October, the average wait time is 25 days, the department said. The department declined to answer how long the person waiting the longest has been in line for treatment. 
In a statement to CalMatters, the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services said the policy change was intended “to help maximize the reach of (its) treatment program within the jails by leveraging the existing medical staff in the (Inmate Reception Center) where patient traffic is constant.”
The department maintained that medication-assisted treatment is “still available for all inmates, including those who may have declined treatment when they first arrived.”
“Length of incarceration varies for each inmate, from just a handful of days for some and many months for others; whether an individual will access (medication-assisted treatment) during their incarceration is based on their personal choice, unique case and the length of time they will remain incarcerated,” wrote the department.
Melissa Camacho, a senior staff attorney at ACLU of Southern California, said the reduction in treatment is “mind boggling” in a year where there are record-breaking deaths.
“I’d like to know how many people who died from overdose deaths were on the waiting list,” she said. “Having a waitlist doesn’t matter if the waitlist is too long to get treatment.”
More money for L.A. jail health care
Medication-assisted treatment combines counseling with FDA-approved medications, including buprenorphine, methadone and naltrexone to treat certain substance use disorders. A 2021 report from the National Commission on Correctional Health Care found that drug and alcohol overdoses constitute the third leading cause of death in jails, following illness and suicide. 
Los Angeles County was an early adopter of medication-assisted treatment in its jails. Since the program’s inception in 2021, roughly 25,000 incarcerated people have been treated with Suboxone, an oral form of buprenorphine administered daily by medical professionals. But reliance on Suboxone alone proved to be challenging because of staffing limitations, said the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services in an email to CalMatters. 
That’s why, according to Correctional Health Services physicians, the current regimen only allows someone to access Suboxone for 30 days when they first arrive in custody. After that, they can receive a long-acting injectable form of buprenorphine that’s administered once a month. 
Since July 2022, nearly 40,000 doses of injectable buprenorphine — which cost roughly $1,600 per shot — have been administered to incarcerated people, according to the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services. 
In a Sept. 10 memo to the Board of Supervisors, Correctional Health Services’ Director Christina Ghaly said overdose deaths constitute at least 28% of deaths this year. That’s a steep increase since 2016, when they accounted for 9% of in-custody deaths. 
“Of all the medical care that we offer in the jail, opioid use disorder treatment is by far and away the most life-saving measure we provide,” said a second physician who spoke with CalMatters on the condition of anonymity because of fear of professional retaliation. “It seems paramount to protect these services.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/103025-LA-Jail-AP-CC-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-14 08:56:13.985169

(Getty Images)Louisiana prohibits casino companies and executives from making state political contributions, but that same ban doesn’t apply to sports gambling operations. 
A sport betting company and its senior management can still make political donations, even if the business is a subsidiary of a larger gambling enterprise prohibited from doing so, according to the Louisiana Board of Ethics. 
The ethics board issued an advisory opinion last week to American Wagering Inc., saying the company, as well as its officers and directors, can legally give to political candidates. The political activity is allowed even though the mobile and retail sports betting company, which goes by the name Caesars Sportsbook Louisiana, is owned by the gambling conglomerate, Caesars Entertainment Inc. 

In addition to having a sportsbook, Caesars Entertainment Inc. owns three casinos in Louisiana — Caesars New Orleans, Horseshoe Lake Charles and Horseshoe Bossier City. A state law from 1996 prohibits those casinos, their parent company and the casinos’ executive managers from making political contributions.
But the ethics board concluded the campaign contribution restriction doesn’t apply to the sports betting company or its executives, unless they also hold senior positions with Caesars Entertainment Inc. or the company’s casinos. 
“There is no provision under which [the political contribution ban] applies to AWI directly,” ethics board attorney Charles Reeves wrote in the board’s opinion approved last week. 
The board’s decision is the latest strike against the state’s efforts to block the gambling industry’s influence from state politics. The campaign contribution ban was put in place to create some distance between the gambling industry and Louisiana politicians following the botched rollout of riverboat casinos in the early 1990s. 

The Louisiana Supreme Court first chipped away at the ban in 1996 by ruling it was unconstitutional for video poker operators that run operate in smaller venues like truck stops. However, the court’s decision did not apply to larger casinos, which are still subject to the prohibition today. 

Last week’s advisory opinion is the latest of three from the ethics board that indicate sports betting companies can make political donations. 

In 2022, the ethics board also told the Sports Betting Alliance, a trade association for online and retail sports betting companies, that it was allowed to make political contributions, even if one of its members was prohibited from doing so. 
In 2023, the board said Fanatics Betting and Gaming, an online betting company which is not affiliated with a casino  company, could also contribute to political campaigns. 
From July 2023 through June 2024, Louisiana’s riverboat casinos had $1.7 billion of adjusted gross revenue and the New Orleans casino brought in $240.5 million in gaming revenue. Video poker machines had net device revenue of $749.8 million. In-person sports betting produced net proceeds of $29.8 million and mobile sports betting produced net proceeds of $358.2 million.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Super-Bowl-betting-1024x636.jpg,,,2025-11-14 08:56:13.985169

A new report estimates the impacts,Alejandro Lazo,,,,,https://calmatters.org/environment/2025/11/data-center-environmental-report/,"A new report estimates that California’s data centers are driving increases in electricity use, water demand and pollution even as lawmakers stall on oversight.","In summary
A new report estimates that California’s data centers are driving increases in electricity use, water demand and pollution even as lawmakers stall on oversight.


California is a major hub for data centers — the facilities that store and transmit much of the internet. But just how much these power-hungry operations affect the state’s energy use, climate and public health remains an open question for researchers.
A new report released this week by the environmental think tank Next 10 and a UC Riverside researcher attempts to quantify that impact — but its authors say the report is only an estimate without harder data from the centers themselves.
“We are just making these reports pretty much in the dark — since there’s almost zero information,” said Shaolei Ren, an AI researcher at UC Riverside and co-author of the report. “We have extremely little information about data centers in California.”
Ren and his coauthors conclude that between 2019 and 2023, electricity use and carbon emissions by California data centers nearly doubled, while on-site water consumption slightly more than doubled. Much of the increases were attributable to the electricity required to run artificial intelligence computations. But many of the report’s estimates, including its health impacts, are based on limited data — a key issue researchers said they encountered repeatedly when crafting the report.
The report underscores a growing tension in the industry: advocates who support clean energy and experts who study energy demand agree the days of steady, flat energy use at data centers are over, but there’s far less consensus on just how sharply electricity demand will climb.
“In very simple terms, a lot of the uncertainty comes from: what is our life going to look like with AI in the next five years, 10 years, 20 years — how integrated is it going to become?” said Maia Leroy, a Sacramento-based advocate who focuses on clean energy and the grid.  “Are we reaching a point where the use is going to plateau, or is it going to continue?”
Experts say more transparency is essential to better understand what resources data centers demand in California.
Liang Min, who manages the Bits and Watts Initiative at Stanford University, says the state should improve its forecasts for energy demand to support clean energy goals. Min, who investigates AI’s growing strain on the electric grid, told CalMatters that demand at power centers rises in rapid, unpredictable phases and can shift quickly with each new generation of hardware.
The California Energy Commission, which plans for energy use and the growth in demand, “can play a pivotal role,” in understanding and adapting to the demands of AI.
As demand grows, policy responses lag
In Sacramento, efforts to add transparency and guardrails around data centers have struggled this year. California lawmakers shelved most consumer and environmental proposals aimed at data centers, even as they approved a plan to regionalize California’s power grid to help meet demand from the sector. They set aside two bills focused on curbing data centers’ energy use — one requiring operators to disclose their electricity use and another that offered clean power incentives.
Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a separate proposal that would have required data center operators to report their water use, even after the bill was weakened. In the end, Newsom — who has often highlighted California’s dominance in the artificial intelligence sector — signed only one measure, allowing regulators to determine whether data centers are driving up costs.
Mark Toney, who leads The Utility Reform Network and supported the transparency measure, has questioned whether data centers justify the costs they’re pushing onto ratepayers.
He warned of the centers’ “voracious consumption of energy and water, increased carbon emissions, and jacking up ratepayer bills.”
Hard facts about data centers are tough to find in California because most rent out power, cooling and floor space to other companies, said Ren, the UC Riverside researcher. Such colocation facilities don’t run their own servers or technology, so they report less information publicly than data centers built by major tech companies in other states.
While estimates vary, California has the third-most data centers in the country, after Texas and Virginia. DataCenterMap, a commercial directory that tracks data centers worldwide, lists 321 sites across the state. More in California are expected in coming years.
The centers operate around the clock and often rely on diesel backup generators to maintain service during power failures — a practice that adds both greenhouse gases and local air pollutants. They also consume energy and water depending on their cooling methods.
Rising data-center demand, and rising questions
F. Noel Perry, the businessman and philanthropist who founded Next 10, said his organization’s report shines light on what is fundamentally a black box. “To solve a problem, we have to understand what the problem is,” he said. 
“We’ve seen the proliferation of data centers in California, in the U.S. and across the world — and we also are seeing major implications for the environment,” Perry told CalMatters. “The real issue has to do with transparency — and the ability of elected officials and regulators to create some rules that will govern reductions in emissions, water consumption.”
The report estimated that data centers used 10.8 terawatt-hours of electricity in 2023, up from 5.5 terawatt-hours in 2019, accounting for 6% of the nation’s total data center energy use. Unless growth is curbed or better managed, the report’s authors project demand could rise to as high as 25 terawatt-hours by 2028, equal to the power use of roughly 2.4 million U.S. homes.
Carbon emissions from the sector nearly doubled during the same period, climbing from 1.2 million to 2.4 million tons, researchers estimated, while on site water use grew from 1,078 acre feet in 2019 to 2,302 acre feet in 2023. That’s enough to meet the annual water needs of almost seven thousand California households.
The report’s authors also estimated the public health costs from air pollution associated with data centers have potentially risen, from $45 million in 2019 to more than $155 million in 2023, with the burden expected to reach as high as $266 million by 2028.
Most of those costs stem from indirect pollution produced by fossil-fueled power plants that supply the grid. But authors pointed out that regions dense with data centers — particularly Santa Clara County, home to Silicon Valley — could face higher localized risks from diesel backup generators.
Dan Diorio, vice president of state policy for the Data Center Coalition, said the report exaggerates the impact of backup diesel generators, which are tightly regulated and rarely used in California, minimizing their contributions to air pollution. Data centers don’t control the water used in electricity generation, said Diorio. Since those water impacts don’t happen on site, it’s not fair to blame that on the centers themselves. 
“It paints a skewed picture of this critical 21st-century industry,” Diorio said in a statement.
Diorio said the report also overlooks how cooling technology varies by region and has become more efficient in recent years.
But the authors say their findings underscore the need for uniform reporting standards for data centers’ energy and water use. The report said California should establish ongoing local monitoring and review of data centers — and make the findings public.
Ren, the UC Riverside researcher, said that California’s cleaner grid and stricter pollution rules are helping blunt some environmental impacts of data centers already.
“California — versus the national average — is doing a better job due to the cleaner grid,” he said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/110625-Data-Center-San-Jose-BH-Reuters-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-14 08:56:13.985169

What will California’s next governor do about health care? Four Democrats in the race say answering the Trump Administration’s cuts and making care affordable is important. But they disagree about how to pay for that. 



Every day, Californians struggle to afford medications or wait weeks or months for mental health appointments. Thousands in the “sandwich generation” juggle caring for elderly parents with raising children. 
Those are top health care issues Californians want to see the next governor address, according to a recent poll. The candidates vying to succeed Gov. Gavin Newsom offered views on them – and addressed the Trump administration’s coming cuts to safety net programs – at a recent forum at UC Riverside organized by philanthropic foundations. 
“The reality is too many Californians face barriers to health and wellness in our state,” said Richard Tate, president and CEO of the California Wellness Foundation, one of the organizations sponsoring the event. He said the forum was planned to take place in the Inland Empire, where residents experience some of the largest disparities in health outcomes. 
Four candidates, all Democrats, took part in the forum. Former U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra, State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and former State Controller Betty Yee all agreed that state response to federal cuts will require them to push for efficiency in the health care system – and look for new sources of revenue. They disagreed on how to fund the state’s response.  
To better understand the health care issues in the nascent gubernatorial race, CalMatters also reached out to frontrunners not in attendance: former Congresswoman Katie Porter, Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco and former Fox News Host Steve Hilton. All three polled well in a recent California Wellness Foundation survey. None of them returned interview requests or answered questions about their health policy priorities or vision by the deadline. 
Becerra touts experience standing up to Trump
If elected, Becerra pledges to be the state’s “health care governor” — a title that Gov. Gavin Newsom also often embraced. 
Becerra, 67, touted his experience responding to a public health emergency and negotiating lower drug prices in President Biden’s cabinet. He did so for medications such as blood thinners, diabetes drugs and others as part of a Medicare drug negotiation program. And as a former state Attorney General, he sued the previous Trump administration 123 times. He positioned himself as a strong opponent to federal cutbacks to health. 
“We will not take a knee to what Donald Trump has done to health care,” Becerra said. “We will not go backwards.”
An estimated 3.4 million Californians will lose coverage as a result of the Trump administration’s cuts to the Medicaid program as approved in this year’s federal spending plan. And if Congress does not renew the enhanced premium subsidies for the Affordable Care Act by the end of year, another 400,000 who buy health plans through Covered California could be priced out. 
Filling those gaps is a tall order for the state, but he said it is worth reviewing the tax code to make sure billionaires are paying their fair share to help fund the safety net. 
“We can be rational when it comes to our tax book. But then let’s put the money where it should be on health care,” Becerra said. “I can tell you right now, there is too much money being misspent.” 
That’s because spending should be prioritized on preventive care and on keeping people well in the first place, he said.
“We need to provide for (people) at the front door, not in the emergency room.”
Thurmond floats single-payer system for California 
Among Thurmond’s boldest visions is that of creating a state-run single-payer system, where a public entity handles health care financing – acting as insurer, paying providers, and covering medical costs for all. That’s an idea once floated by Newsom, but abandoned because of its expense and complexity. 
Thurmond, 57, says his support of a single payer system stems from watching his brother die from a rare liver disease. His brother couldn’t afford health insurance, he said, and stopped going to the doctor even though he was sick. 
But a system like that would take years to set up, hundreds of billions of dollars and would also require federal approval. 
More immediately Thurmond said he’d seek legislation to expand requirements for employers to provide quality health care to their workers. “We have many employers in this state who require their employees to get health care through public assistance. And if you do that as an employer you’re going to be held to account,” Thurmond said. “On the flipside…If you’re doing the right thing we’ll reward you with tax credits.”
Like Becerra, Thurmond also supports the idea of taxing the wealthy to increase funding for health care. 
If elected, Thurmond pledged to work with Congress to restore the cuts to Medicaid and other safety net programs that the Trump administration made in its most recent federal spending plan.
Villaraigosa: ‘Focus on the basics’
Villaraigosa, 72, says he wants to go back to basics. In a state budget, that means prioritizing public safety, health care and education, in that order, he said. 
Villaraigosa pitches himself as more pragmatic than his opponents. He doesn’t support a single-payer system; he argues that it’s unrealistic because the state can’t afford the upfront costs and because the Trump administration, which would need to approve such plans, would reject it.

State response to a federal administration that is gutting the safety net, he said, will require innovative solutions and a health care system that is more efficient — what exactly that would look like is to be determined.
“I’m not going to sell you snake oil. It is going to be tough to provide that care, but I’m absolutely committed to it,” Villaraigosa said. 
Alone among forum participants, Villaraigosa was less interested in increasing taxes to create more revenue, sidestepping the question and only saying that he’d like to look for ways to “grow the pie.”
“We already have the highest taxes in the United States of America and the highest cost of living,” he said.
But like his opponents, Villaraigosa said he wants to grow the mental health workforce — to do so, you have to incentivize people with adequate pay, he said. “The issue is access because people can’t get a doctor to give them care when they get seven bucks for that visit,” he said.
Yee wants strict accountability
Betty Yee, a 68-year-old former State Controller, wants to be an accountability governor. 
Like her opponents, Yee listed improving mental health access as a high priority. Part of the reason Californians struggle to find appropriate care, she said, is because regulatory agencies aren’t robustly enforcing the state’s mental health parity law, which requires insurers to cover physical and mental health conditions equally.
“We are not looking at our health systems in terms of whether they are continuing to build a robust provider network to deal with mental health for our diverse populations,” Yee said. “So we actually need some better oversight with respect to what is currently the law here in California.” 
Yee is an advocate for growing what’s working. Anti-poverty programs, such as the earned income tax credit and the young child tax credit, have been successful in putting extra dollars in the pockets of low-income Californians, Yee says. She says she’d like to be “bolder” with these refundable tax credit programs and expand them to help alleviate some of the financial burden for caregivers, especially those in the sandwich generation.
Yee said California cannot replace federal cuts with borrowing alone; she supports raising taxes for the highest earners to fund the safety net.
“But before we do that,” Yee said, “I want to be sure we’re making the case that we’re making our health care system much more efficient, and that we really are going to have a much better shot at increasing access and affordability for Californians.”

The report card measures academic achievement, academic growth, graduation rate, progress in English learner proficiency, chronic absenteeism and college and career readiness. 
According to the state report card, academic achievement decreased slightly, from 97.13 in 2023-24 to 97.08 — out of a possible 100 points — in 2024-25. 
“I think the first report card we gave out was a low B, and so what it shows is that if you tell people what you need them to do and you give them the resources to do it, they’re going to come through,” Mackey said.
The percentage of students ranked proficient in English Language Arts increased from 52.8% in 2023-24 to 56.2% in 2024-25. Proficiency in math also increased, from 31.2% to 33.4%. Science proficiency fell slightly, from 39% to 38.9%.
The percentage of Black and Hispanic students showing ELA proficiency increased significantly. For Black students, ELA proficiency went from 36.6% in 2023-24 to 40.2% in 2024-25. For Hispanic students, proficiency went from 40.6% to 44.2%.
Marcus Vandiver, the accountability program coordinator for the Alabama State Department of Education, said scores across the state have improved.
“We’ve actually increased the number of A’s and B’s, and decreased C’s, D’s and F’s,” he said. “So not only is Dr. Mackey and his team doing a great job, but our staff and our sections are doing a great job with our schools and the systems,” he said to board members.
The state also saw chronic absenteeism decrease going from 14.84% during the 2023-24 school year to 12.05% for the 2024-25 school year.
Mackey also said the state has seen a “record number of third graders reading on grade level.”
In June, the State Department of Education saw 11.6% of students who took the ACAP fall below the benchmark during the 2024-25 school year, an improvement from the 13% of students who were below the “cut-off” score in the 2023-24 school year.
The percentage of economically disadvantaged students in state public schools fell from 64.7% in 2023-24 to 58.1% in 2024-25.
Graduation rates also increased slightly, from 90% in 2023-24 to 91.6% in 2024-25. The percentage of graduates deemed College and Career Ready also increased from 84.2% t0 87.9%.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_7543-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-11-14 08:56:13.985169
,California,2025-11-14 13:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,Newsom’s gas price crusade morphs into bid to keep refiners open,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/11/newsoms-gas-price-crusade-refiners/,"A study Gov. Gavin Newsom commissioned describes higher margins oil refiners receive for their products, which become gasoline.","Earlier this week, I pulled my 24-year-old SUV into a Sacramento gas station for its weekly — more or less—  fill-up. It was 14.5 gallons at $4.05, plus the ever-mysterious 9/10 of a cent, per gallon.
I could have gone to a nearby Chevron station, but it wanted $4.59 a gallon and would have cost me about 8 bucks more.
While California’s gas prices are among the nation’s highest, thanks largely to the state’s hefty taxes and regulatory costs, they vary widely from station to station, even among those under the same ownership.
This variance complicates the obsession that California’s motorists and politicians have with gas prices.
California’s nearly 30 million cars and light trucks travel 340 billion miles each year and burn more than 13 billion gallons of gas, costing $60.7 billion in 2024. That’s a big number, certainly, but not a huge factor compared to other costs of living in California, particularly for housing.
Gas prices get so much attention, one suspects, because filling the tank is a frequent ritual that requires drivers to stand there while the pump’s dial spins through gallonage and dollars.
Gov. Gavin Newsom spent much of 2023 and 2024 on a crusade against high gas prices, accusing refiners of gouging motorists. He called a special legislative session and signed legislation to create more oversight.
“They continue to lie, and they continue to manipulate,” Newsom said exactly one year ago. “They have been raking in unprecedented profits because they can.”
Last month, the newly created Division of Petroleum Market Oversight released its first annual report.
There weren’t any smoking guns. Mostly the report merely confirmed what was already known — that prices are much higher than those in other states, that most of the price differential is due to taxes and regulatory costs and that there’s a “mystery surcharge” that cannot be attributed to any quantifiable factor — a phenomenon first identified eight years ago by UC-Berkeley Professor Severin Borenstein.
The surcharge has averaged 41 cents a gallon in recent years, and the report declares that “the cumulative impact of this surcharge is substantial, costing California consumers over $59 billion in extra payments for gasoline between 2015 and 2024.”
It suggests that it represents extra profit for refiners but is not definitive. It also acknowledges that “certain refiners, however, may only be marginally profitable outside of price spikes. This is partly because refiners’ operating expenses in California and the West Coast, while generally stable since 2014, are higher than in the rest of the U.S, in part because of higher labor and energy costs.”
In other words the surcharge could just reflect that doing business in California is more expensive than in other states.
“This is validation that Californians have been getting hosed at the pump for decades because too few refiners make too much of our gasoline,” said Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog, which had backed Newsom’s crusade.
Having only a few refiners does contribute to the price picture, as does the state’s unique smog-fighting gasoline formula and the lack of pipelines to import fuel from other states.
In fact, after Newsom’s legislation passed, two refiners announced plans to shut down, leading to speculation that gas prices could hike to record levels due to shrinking supplies.
One might have expected that Newsom would jump upon the report as validation of his price-gouging accusations. But the report didn’t make that conclusion, and the governor has since changed his tune and is trying to stave off refinery closures.
Newsom also is drawing fire from Court, who complains that the “Newsom Administration took off the table valuable tools to combat this price gouging when it froze the price gouging penalty rules that it asked the legislature to create in 2023.”
That was then. This is now.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/082825-Gas-Prices-GETTY-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C687&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-14 08:56:13.985169

KC’s transit agency is concerned that if buses or the streetcar are overwhelmed with tourists, that could impact bus service for the city’s residents (Vaughn Wheat/The Beacon).The World Cup is just seven months away, and the Kansas City Area Transportation Authority faces the immense challenge of moving hundreds of thousands of fans around Kansas City next summer.
Now, the transit agency has decided to crack open its piggy bank.
For years, transit leaders have asked Kansas, Missouri and the federal government for financial support during the World Cup to manage massive crowds of fans who will travel to the region without cars.
But they have not received a dime for World Cup bus service. So the KCATA is planning to raid millions of dollars from a federal grant from 2018 intended to buy new buses. Instead, that money will be spent on 40 days of expanded service for fans and tourists.
Chuck Ferguson, the chief operations officer for the KCATA, asked the Mid-America Regional Council to approve the change at a committee meeting on Nov. 10.
“We — Johnson County, the Unified Government — have been pushing local, regional and the feds for some kind of dedicated funding for transit for the last few years to no avail,” Ferguson said. “So now we’re scrambling.”
The federal government created a $625 million grant program for safety and security in World Cup cities. But none of that money can be used by transit agencies.
Ferguson told The Beacon that Missouri also provided some support with an “ambassador” program, which will pay people to be “wayfinders” to help visitors find bus stops at World Cup events. But again, that money can’t be used to pay for additional bus routes or operators.
In the absence of additional support, the KCATA is being asked to manage unprecedented numbers of bus riders in Kansas City with a budget that’s already spread thin. And that exposes funding challenges that the KCATA was already facing before the World Cup was even announced.
 Kansas City’s Fan Fest problem

KC2026, the organizing committee formed to raise funds for and manage the World Cup, announced earlier this year that it plans to lease 200 buses to get visitors between the airport, downtown and the six matches planned to be hosted at Arrowhead Stadium.
“KC2026 is currently planning to fund and operate all transportation required to meet the Host City obligations, as well as additional services to facilitate movement in the region,” a spokesperson for KC2026 said in an email statement. “This includes the 200 buses we have leased, as well as any event-specific services that may be provided by partners.”
But transportation leaders are still staring down a problem — getting fans to and from the FIFA Fan Festival on the south lawn of the National World War I Museum and Memorial.
The World War I Museum sits along the newly extended streetcar line, which theoretically could move fans to and from the festival. But anyone who attended the recent Chappell Roan concerts or the NFL Draft in 2023 will remember long wait times to board the streetcar when tens of thousands of people left the venue at the end of the night.
Chappell Roan fans wait for the KC Streetcar following her Oct. 3 concert. The concert was attended by about 30,000 people, which roughly compares to the expected attendance of Fan Fest (Josh Merchant/The Beacon).
Transportation planners call that a “crush load” — when people are packed shoulder-to-shoulder in the train and a long line of passengers has to wait for the next ride.
“The big worry right now,” Ferguson said at the MARC committee meeting, “is between 25,000 and 35,000 people leaving that venue at one point in time and looking to go somewhere.”
The streetcar, he said, can only handle a fraction of that number — a few thousand per hour.
KC2026 is planning to host the Fan Fest for 18 nights next summer — on the day of every Kansas City or Team USA match. But if the public transit along Main Street is overwhelmed that frequently, transit leaders worry it could be catastrophic for public safety and for the city’s reputation during the World Cup.
So the plan is to repurpose about $2.1 million that the KCATA received in 2018 to purchase new energy efficient buses. Instead, the agency will spend it on operations during the World Cup to run some extra buses along the streetcar line to manage the flood of fans. Another $387,500 would come from the Prospect MAX grant.
That would fund overtime pay for bus operators and the extra fuel.
“It’s not going to be the massive amounts of service that people had originally envisioned,” Ferguson told the committee. “But it is one dedicated opportunity that we hope to put out there.”
Johnson County Transit made a similar request at the Nov. 10 meeting, except it would use $2.1 million to bolster bus lines to hotels like the Sheraton in Overland Park.
In both cases, if the extra buses are not needed, the money will not be spent and it will be returned to the fund, likely to pay for the new efficient buses as originally intended.
 KCATA is expected to do more with the same budget

Ultimately, the MARC transportation and emissions committee voted to recommend the change for approval by the entire board later this year.
But there were some dissenters, including Eric Rogers, the executive director and cofounder of BikeWalkKC. Rogers was one of three “no” votes.
He voted that way because he’s concerned about sacrificing long-term transit investments — like buses that could last for 25 years — for the sake of solving a short-term problem at the World Cup.
But he remains frustrated that the KCATA is expected to provide transit service for an unprecedented event in Kansas City without any funding from FIFA or from state or federal partners.
“We are putting our transit agencies in a tough position,” he said. “My question is, ‘Why isn’t the event that’s creating all of this demand doing more to provide the funding that’s needed for the transit agency to respond to the demand?’”
That concern was echoed by several other members of the committee during the meeting, including some who voted yes.
Bailey Waters, the chief mobility officer at Kansas City, asked Ferguson if FIFA was providing any support for the planned World Cup events.
“FIFA is not, never was going to sponsor anything,” Ferguson said in response. “FIFA requires things. But really all that FIFA provides is the happiness that we get to host the World Cup.”
Kansas City Councilmember Eric Bunch, who also serves on the KCATA Board of Commissioners, supports the move to repurpose the green bus funds for World Cup operations. But he said the frustration with FIFA is not lost on him.
“That is the problem with major events like the World Cup, like the Olympics, like the DNC or the RNC,” he said. “They’re pitching this as a positive economic impact. And in the end, it’s the local governments that pick up the bill often, and it’s the local residents who are impacted by it.”
 A fundamental funding challenge

Bunch said this most recent situation is emblematic of ongoing funding issues at the KCATA.
Not only is the transit agency underfunded in the Kansas City area, but its biggest financial constraints are around operating costs, rather than buying new buses.
In other words, the KCATA does not tend to have problems paying for new buses. The issue is finding money to pay the drivers and mechanics or buying fuel.
That’s because the federal government is willing to give grants for “capital” like new buses or streetcar tracks, but it is much rarer for the KCATA to get grants that can be used for “operations.”
(The Trump administration has deprioritized public transit as a whole compared to the Biden administration.)
“The federal government basically says, ‘All right, we’ll help you build your transit system, we’ll buy buses, we’ll build tracks for streetcars and light rail,’” Bunch said. “But once it’s up and running, that’s (the city’s) responsibility.”
About 72% of the KCATA’s operations — $61 million out of total $85 million — are paid for by Kansas City Hall.
So if the KCATA can find a way to use the federal grants to pay bus operators during the World Cup, Bunch said, that’s a far more appealing option than tapping an already strained operations budget.
Tristin Amezcua-Hogan, the chair of the Regional Transit Alliance, told The Beacon in an email statement that the KCATA is “trapped in a cycle of poverty right now that is perpetuated by a lack of stable regional funding.”
“This is just one of the many instances of the organization having to choose what gets the job done over the optimal decision that would come out of consistent funding,” he said.
Some members of the MARC committee, including Westwood City Administrator Leslie Herring, believe that the positive side of the World Cup is that some Kansas Citians are going to be taking public transit for the first time to get to the Fan Fest.
“It might be an opportunity to expand who all in Kansas City actually feels comfortable riding the buses,” Herring said at the committee meeting. “When Mission would take residents down to the Plaza, in Westport, to go bar hop during the holiday season, that was one of my first times on a bus. And I feel very comfortable on KCATA buses now.”
In theory, that kind of public support from new bus riders could pay off in the future if a regional transit sales tax is placed on the ballot.
A sales tax has some support in the Jackson County Courthouse, and four out of five of the Unified Government commissioners elected earlier this month told The Beacon that they would support putting a similar measure on the ballot in Wyandotte County.
Bunch said polling shows the majority of voters in Jackson, Johnson, Clay and Wyandotte counties already support raising taxes to fund public transit. And that could increase if the KCATA does a good job during the World Cup.
“That is the opportunity we have with the World Cup, and enhancing bus service during that time,” he said. “That more people are going to be willing to try it out. And I think that that’s a really good thing.”

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)First freeze dates across South Dakota are trending later in the year, which has lengthened the growing season while prolonging risks from weeds, pests and wildfires.
According to an October report on first freeze dates since 1970 from Climate Central, a nonprofit group of scientists and communicators focused on climate change, the first freeze is arriving 12 days later in Sioux Falls, 13 days later in Mitchell and seven days later in Rapid City. Statewide, the trend is 1.4 days later per decade based on county data, according to a Midwestern Regional Climate Center freeze date tool.
The trend is “obvious” in Sioux Falls, said National Weather Service meteorologist Jeff Chapman. Of the top 25 latest first freeze dates in Sioux Falls since 1893, 10 of them are within the last 17 years.
The changes are consistent with what 1990s climate models projected regarding the effects of rising human-caused atmospheric greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide and methane, said State Climatologist Laura Edwards. Those same models projected continued warming in the coming decades.
“When you look at fall, winter and spring, you’re seeing these accelerated warming temperatures,” Edwards said. “You don’t have to go as far north as Alaska to see the impact of warming temperatures.”


Changing climate extends South Dakota growing season
South Dakota’s growing season extended more than 18 days from the late 1800s through 2023, according to data from the Environmental Protection Agency. That’s a longer extension than Iowa and Nebraska, but a shorter extension than North Dakota and Minnesota, at 32 and 21 days, respectively.

South Dakota farmers are expected to harvest over 1 billion bushels of corn this year — the largest amount in state history — due in part to longer growing seasons, Edwards said.
Northeast and north-central South Dakota are warming faster than other parts of the state. Marshall County is reporting a trend in its first fall freeze of 2.9 days later per decade. Spink County reports 2.7 days later per decade, and Brown and Day counties 2.6 days later per decade.
Western South Dakota has drier conditions, which means the air heats and cools faster than more humid or moist air. Edwards said those conditions likely factor into slower trending first frost dates in northwestern counties compared to northeastern counties.
Edwards said the changing climate allows South Dakota farmers to rethink their planting strategy. If their crop insurance allows, they could plant earlier than normal. Farmers could also adopt hybrid corn crops that work well in Iowa and Nebraska, since South Dakota’s climate is becoming more like those two states, which are some of the top corn producers in the nation.
Wildfire risk, pests and weeds are trade-offs to longer growing season
Darren Clabo, state wildfire meteorologist and South Dakota Mines associate professor, said later first freezes delay the fall grassfire season into November. Winter and fall are typically the driest times of the year in the state.
When temperatures are above average and conditions are dry in the early fall and into the winter, Clabo said, there is an elevated risk of fire.
“If the grass isn’t covered by snow this time of year, we have to be extremely careful with our ignition sources and ensure we aren’t the cause of wildfires,” Clabo said.
Along with changes in wildfire risks, later frost dates contribute to increased nuisances like pests and weeds, Edwards said.
Insects such as grasshoppers require a “killing frost” to lessen their grip, Edwards said, and just a couple of extra weeks without a frost ushers in another generation of the short-lived insect.

Mosquito season is also extended, which can increase risks from West Nile virus and other diseases carried by the insect. Eric Jones, South Dakota State University Extension weed management specialist, said there are less diverse, more persistent weeds throughout the state due in part to herbicide use, but later first freeze dates “don’t do us any favors.” The later freeze allows weeds to last longer and produce more seeds to deal with next year. That increases input costs for farmers to control them.
“There might be only one weed left, but it’s got 100 seeds,” Jones said. “Your problem with just one weed became 100 for next year.”
A common fall allergy comes from ragweed pollen. Those ragweed allergies tend to stop as the plants die with frost.
But if the frost doesn’t come as early, the plant has a longer time to flower and pollinate, “extending the season of sniffles,” Jones said.

The first freeze is arriving 13 days later in Mitchell, 12 days later in Sioux Falls and seven days later in Rapid City, according to a report from Climate Central.

Nelson, 41, is advocating for a flat state income tax rate, which can only be done through a constitutional amendment. The current 2-5% rates, as well as the income thresholds for them, were set by a 1933 constitutional amendment. Nelson also wants all schools to have a resource officer on campus.
Nelson in an interview Monday cited her lifelong work in the district, including activity at Fairfax Methodist Church and involvement in multiple clubs and organizations in the community.
“It didn’t start just when I began to seek office,” Nelson said. “I just truly have a servant’s heart to be able to serve this district, give back to the people who have built me and raised me.”
Dixon, 34, said in an interview Wednesday that he wants to recruit “good paying” jobs to the district, improve infrastructure and support public schools. 
“We have to make sure that the next generation continues to have opportunities here, and if they don’t, they’ll find somewhere else to find those opportunities,” Dixon said. “That’s just the reality of it.”
Messer endorsed Dixon after the primary on social media. Nelson said the endorsement has not affected her campaign. However, she said it has been harder to get in front of Messer’s voters due to the physical distance between Lannett and Smiths Station. Lannett, where Nelson lives, is in the northern part of the district and Smiths Station, where Messer lives, is in the southern portion.
“That’s been a little difficult, just because it probably is the most rural portion of the district, and so not having huge community events and things to attend has been difficult,” Nelson said. 
Dixon said the endorsement has helped him reach new voters. He said voters should choose him because he is facing the same issues they are.
“I tell people that I’m just an average guy. My wife is a school teacher, I’m a farmer. I work every day in this district,” Dixon said. “I run up and down the same roads that we all agree need paving, and I know how expensive things are at the grocery store. All of these issues that we face in House District 38, I’m right there with them.”
The winner of the primary runoff will face Democratic candidate Hazel Floyd, 21, on Feb. 3. Floyd is campaigning on boosting business development beyond Valley city limits, strengthening public education funding and supporting farmers.

Campaign finances

According to campaign finance records, Dixon has raised more than $91,000 and spent almost $74,000. About two-thirds of Dixon’s donations came from Political Action Committees (PACs). He had almost $7,000 on-hand before the special election cycle began. Lt. Gov. Will Ainsworth donated $10,000 to Dixon’s campaign, according to records. 
Nelson has raised over $60,000 and spent almost $51,000 since the beginning of the special election in August. She had about $11,000 on-hand before the special election cycle began. Most of her cash donations came from individuals and businesses.

(Stock photo by Wichayada Suwanachun/Getty Images)COLUMBIA — Putting more medical care on wheels. Converting vacated buildings. Encouraging doctors and doctors-in-training to work in rural South Carolina.
Those are among the possibilities for up to $1 billion flowing to South Carolina over the next five years through the $50 billion federal Rural Health Transformation Program.
“It’s a massive amount of funding,” Eunice Medina, director of the state Department of Health and Human Services, told the SC Daily Gazette. “It’s truly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the state.”
Exactly how much will be available for health care in rural South Carolina won’t be known until late December, when the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will announce states’ awards. In the meantime, South Carolina health officials want providers to get their proposals ready.
“We want to stay on a schedule and get those grants awarded and money to flow into the system,” Medina said.
Her agency is hosting a webinar Tuesday to explain the state’s 60-page application to providers, advocates, and anyone else who’s interested. The state agency can keep a maximum of 10% of its total award for administration. The rest will be doled out as grants for initiatives that fall into five general categories — what Medina calls “buckets.”
All are about “creating more services, more providers, more overall access” with improvements that carry on once the federal money runs out, without putting state taxes on the hook, she said.
Prohibited uses of the one-time money include salaries. But grants can be used to pay signing bonuses or pay off student loans for doctors who move to or do their specialty training in rural areas.
“Once you’re there, we want you to fall in love and stay,” said Medina, who’s been visiting agency offices statewide since becoming director a year ago.
And while the money can’t construct a new building, it can pay to refurbish an abandoned space for patients. It can also buy mobile doctors’ offices.
“If you’re trying to expand mobile health units that go out to schools, and you just need the cost of the van and equipment — done,” Medina said. “Let’s do that, as long as they have a sustainability plan.”
South Carolina is seeking $1 billion total from the program created by Republicans’ “big, beautiful” law signed July 4 by President Donald Trump. Congress created it in response to concern about how the law would impact rural providers.
Every state is automatically eligible for $100 million annually through 2030 for applying by the Nov. 5 deadline — which every state did. Decisions on divvying up the other $25 billion will be based on states’ ruralness — South Carolina ranks 35th — their plans for the money, and their existing laws and policies.
For example, Medina said, South Carolina will get credit for the 2023 law repealing the Certificate of Need regulatory permission process for hospitals. And the state will score major points for aligning with the Trump administration’s “make America healthy again” initiative by banning the purchase of candy, sodas and other sugary drinks with federal food assistance. (With the federal government reopened, official approval of the state’s request, submitted in late September, could be imminent.)
Other policies in South Carolina’s favor include state support for telehealth and participation in regulatory agreements that allow nurses, emergency medical personnel, and psychologists to work across state lines, according to the health agency.
Rural challenges
The program could be a huge boon for poor, rural parts of South Carolina, health association leaders said.
While it is overseen by the state agency that runs Medicaid, which provides health coverage to more than 1 million poor South Carolinians, it is not Medicaid, Medina stressed. Rather, it’s supposed to improve access for rural South Carolinians whether they’re covered by Medicaid or not, she said.
Roughly a third of the state’s population lives in rural areas with limited access to health care.
In 2021, there were nine doctors for every 10,000 people in rural counties, compared to 28 doctors per 10,000 people in urban areas, according to the 2024 Health Professions Data Book, compiled by the South Carolina Area Health Education Consortium. It shows that more than two-thirds of all doctors statewide were concentrated in six of the state’s 46 counties: Charleston, Greenville, Richland, Horry, Spartanburg, and York.
Eight rural counties didn’t have a single pediatrician. Fifteen lacked an OB-GYN; 17 lacked a psychiatrist, according to the latest data book.
“This could be one of the greatest blessings the state has ever had,” said Terri Jowers, executive director of the state Community Health Workers Association.
Her group was among providers submitting more than 350 proposals that helped the state health agency craft its application. Providers will still need to officially apply for a grant, which will be a contract with the state. The webinar will include an explanation of the grant cycle.
Jowers’ group plans to ask for money to connect doctors with health workers who may go into people’s homes and live in their community. The workers can provide valuable insight to assist patients’ medical care and increase their likelihood of returning for check-ups.
“How can we weave these together to really take care of our patients and our communities and help everybody live healthier lives?” Jowers said.
Better coordination among health care providers could also help improve access to care, she said.
One of the category “buckets” for the money is using technology to create “connections to care.” That can include tying rural hospitals and other providers into an electronic health records system.
If doctors can go online to see patients’ medical history with other providers, treatment could become faster, easier and cheaper, Jowers said.
Rural hospitals’ requests include partnerships with the state’s technical colleges, as well as loan repayment and forgiveness programs, to grow the health care workforce, said Karlin Gill, spokesperson for the South Carolina Hospital Association.
Supporting small hospitals will be especially important as Medicaid rates decrease over the coming years. The program won’t fill all the gaps from that loss, she said.
“There are huge benefits” to the program, Gill said. “That amount is not a small amount. But I don’t think it will cover everything that will be affected as we see those reimbursement cuts year over year.”
In 2028, South Carolina will start losing its ability to pay hospitals for treating Medicaid patients at similar rates as private insurance through what’s known as the state directed payment program, which the law signed in July phases out. South Carolina has used it since 2023 to hike Medicaid payments to hospitals by a whopping 70% on average.
For the 60 general care hospitals in the Palmetto State, that collectively means a looming loss of roughly $150 million annually over 15 years, according to the hospital association.
South Carolina is among 10 states that never expanded Medicaid coverage to all adults up to 138% of the federal poverty level, as intended under the 2010 law commonly known as Obamacare. For that reason, other Medicaid changes in Republicans’ tax policy package don’t apply to the Palmetto State.
But the state also has a higher percentage of uninsured residents, giving hospitals much less wiggle room to absorb the impact of payment reductions.
And the number of uninsured will rise with the Dec. 31 expiration of enhanced federal subsidies for people buying private insurance through the online marketplace created by the 2010 law. The enhanced subsidies, initially approved by Congress during the pandemic, save South Carolinians between $500 and $700 monthly on premiums.
Losing that will make health insurance too expensive for many, which will also impact providers, said Maya Pack, director of the South Carolina Institute of Medicine and Public Health, a nonpartisan research organization.
“I don’t know that this fund will be able to offset all of the more negative outcomes that could be triggered by those things, but it will certainly help to mitigate that,” Pack said.
How much the program helps will depend on what the state health agency decides to fund, she said.
Another “bucket” for grants is called “leveling up,” which means expanding successful pilot programs.
“We have a lot of great programs in our state that meet the needs of rural residents as well as urban residents, but oftentimes, those programs or services are isolated to one community or one county,” Pack said.



Goals for SC’s award
South Carolina’s Rural Health Transformation plan consists of five general categories. Providers will apply for grants that fund the following initiatives:

Connections to care: Using technology to connect providers and patients. Examples include telehealth services and electronic health records.
Leveling up: Taking successful pilot projects statewide that focus on chronic disease management, improving children’s health and growing the workforce.
Wellness within reach: Bringing care directly to communities with mobile health units, crisis response teams and pop-up clinics.
Shoring up to sustainability: Investments that recruit, train and retain health care workers, and upgrade existing buildings.
Tech catalyst fund: Funding for innovative, startup health companies

Environmental stewardship and respect for Vermonters must go hand in hand.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Rural caucus leaders: Vermonters deserve notice and a fair voice in land-use decisions.","This commentary is by Rep. Laura Sibilia, I-Dover; Rep. Lisa Hango, R-Berkshire; Rep. Monique Priestley, D-Bradford; and Rep. Lucy Boyden, D-Cambridge.


Vermont is undergoing the most significant land-use regulation update in over 50 years. As Tier 2 and Tier 3 mapping and rulemaking under Act 181 of 2024 move forward, decisions are being made right now that will affect how Vermonters access their homes, and live on, build on and use their land. These decisions will shape our communities and our landscape for generations.
Yet many Vermonters who will be directly affected do not know what this will mean for their property. The only parcels not facing increased Act 250 jurisdiction compliance and financial pressure are those that are able to meet the Tier 1 requirements. This means most Vermont homeowners, landowners, and working land stewards will be touched by this process for designating automatic Act 250 jurisdiction.
We lead the rural caucus, a bipartisan coalition of legislators from different political parties and opposite corners of the state focused on policy impacts for Vermont’s rural spaces. We did not all agree on Act 181. But we do agree on this: when the government changes rules that affect use, access and value of your property, Vermonters deserve direct notice and a real chance to participate in an informed way before those changes take effect.
Most Vermonters live outside designated growth centers that qualify as Tier 1. Rural Vermonters have long been stewards of our forests, farms and waters — work that has benefited the entire state.
They own family land and want the next generation to have the same opportunity. They are small business owners, farmers and tradespeople. Vermont’s rural working lands communities already carry much of the responsibility for caring for our landscape. They deserve fairness and clarity as rules change.
We are introducing legislation to do four simple things (you can read a draft of the bill here):

Direct notice: Landowners mapped in Tier 2 and Tier 3 must receive mailed notice before Tier 3 rules are finalized. Vermonters should not find out after the fact that new regulations apply to their home or land.


Meaningful participation: People deserve a real opportunity to understand and comment before decisions affecting their property rights are finalized. Public trust depends on this.
Continued progress on housing: Housing exemptions in previously identified growth areas remain active while this rulemaking process is completed. Our small towns, villages and local employers cannot afford any more uncertainty around the availability of housing.


Fair property valuation: If new rules limit or change how land can reasonably be used, that reality must be considered in tax assessments. Not automatic tax cuts — just ensuring valuation is based on real development potential in light of these changes, beginning with the 2027 grand lists.

This bill does not undo Act 181 or weaken Act 250. It does not slow environmental progress or create loopholes. It makes sure Vermonters are notified and included before location-based rules take effect on their land and roads.
This is not a pause. It is a fairness fix.
Most Vermonters live outside Tier 1 areas and already do the work of caring for our forests, farms, and working lands. They deserve notice and a voice before rules change under their feet.
If you agree, please contact your legislators and ask them to support what we are calling the Rural Notice and Fair Implementation Act.
Environmental stewardship and respect for Vermonters must go hand in hand.

(Photo by Strekoza2/iStock Editorial/Getty Images Plus)The city of Spokane swung further left in the Nov. 4 election, with progressives capitalizing on apparent dissatisfaction with President Donald Trump to sweep three City Council races.
This gives progressives a 6-1 advantage on the council, whose seats are officially non-partisan. It will also further cement Spokane’s status as an oasis of blue in eastern Washington, a region where the vast majority of elected officials are conservatives. The city is Washington’s second largest, with about 230,000 residents. 
“After the longest week of our lives, today’s count confirmed that we won!” progressive Sarah Dixit, who trailed on election night, wrote on Instagram this week. “I am honored to be your next council member.”
Dixit, on Monday, finally edged out incumbent Jonathan Bingle, who was aligned with the business community. Dixit won by the slimmest of margins, barely surpassing the need for a mandatory recount. 
A pro-choice advocate, Dixit attributed her victory to “divisions happening because of the Trump administration.”
Bingle said he would not challenge the results.
“Life goes on,” he told reporters.
In the other two Spokane City Council races, incumbent Zack Zappone and newcomer Kate Telis won by much larger margins. In a race for an open seat, voters chose Telis over businessman Alejandro Barrientos, who focused on the issues of downtown crime and homelessness.
The city already has a Democratic mayor in Lisa Brown, the former state Senate majority leader.
Dealing with homelessness in the downtown core has consumed Spokane politics for several years, and Brown believes a big reason she beat incumbent Mayor Nadine Woodward in late 2023 was by focusing on other issues.
While acknowledging that homelessness remains a problem, “I want to highlight that all neighborhoods matter,” Brown said.
Cornell Clayton, director of the Thomas S. Foley Institute at Washington State University in Pullman, pointed to two major causes for the progressive sweep of the City Council races.
One is that Democrats are outraged by the actions of Trump and motivated to vote. The other is a nationwide sorting that sees many urban areas turning bluer while rural areas become more conservative.
“The GOP base is somewhat disappointed in Trump,” Clayton said. “The Democrat base is being energized.
“It’s more of a turnout issue,” Clayton said, as opposed to people changing their individual political stripes.
Clayton said Trump’s actions have provoked “existential angst” among Democrats.
At the same time, there is a growing “degree divide” in the country, with more Democrats having college degrees and moving to larger cities in pursuit of better-paying jobs, Clayton said.
“You see this everywhere,” Clayton said. “Even in red states, the urban centers have gone blue.”
Voters also favored more liberal candidates in key local races in Seattle this year, including the election of Katie Wilson, a self-described socialist, as mayor over incumbent Bruce Harrell.
Spokane County, which has about 556,000 residents, contains this urban-rural divide within its own borders. In offices that represent both urban and rural areas, three of the five county commissioners are Republicans, as are six of the nine state legislators.
Shasti Conrad, chair of the state Democratic Party, said numerous other cities in Washington elected progressive candidates, including Longview, Sunnyside and Camas.
“People don’t want the chaos of the Trump administration,” Conrad said.
In Spokane, Dixit beat incumbent Bingle by just 156 votes, with 50.6% of the vote. A recount would occur if the margin shrank to less than a half percentage point.
Dixit, former organizing director for Pro-Choice Washington, called her victory “surreal.” It was the first run for public office for the 2018 graduate of Spokane’s Whitworth University.
“I think it’s really emblematic of how people are responding to what’s happening federally,” Dixit said. “We’re seeing people’s basic rights taken away, healthcare taken away, insurance premiums going up. I think people are doing whatever they can to have local and state governments stand up against the decisions of the Trump administration.”
Dixit’s win left Michael Cathcart as the lone conservative on the seven-member council. Cathcart did not return a message seeking comment.
Bingle said he will keep “lifting up [Cathcart] in my prayers.”
Meanwhile, some people are wondering if Spokane’s leftward shift will undermine the re-election chances of U.S. Rep. Michael Baumgartner, who hails from the city and represents eastern Washington in Congress. Baumgartner easily won his first term in 2024.
“He is out of touch,” said Brown, who ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 2017 and lost to incumbent Republican Cathy McMorris Rodgers.
Clayton said Baumgartner’s prospects for re-election are tied more to short-term factors like the economy and Trump’s popularity.
“If Trump’s popularity continues to wane, and especially if the economy takes a more dramatic turn down next year (as many economists expect), that could have a substantial impact on partisan turnout, with the potential for creating a ‘Blue Wave,’” Clayton wrote in an email. “I think that is the only realistic threat to a Baumgartner re-election.”
The 5th Congressional District, which includes Spokane, has not sent a Democrat to Congress since George Nethercutt defeated House Speaker Tom Foley in a shocking 1994 upset.
Baumgartner defeated Democratic candidate Carmela Conroy last year, winning about 60% of the vote.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/spokane-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-14 07:56:42.453273

(Getty Images)Indiana’s Commission for Higher Education voted Thursday to keep Frank O’Bannon scholarship awards flat for the 2026-27 academic year, holding the state-funded financial aid program at about $168 million annually.
The decision means roughly 37,000 Hoosier college students who receive the need-based grant each year will see the same maximum and minimum award amounts as in the current cycle.
Commission staff said the flat-line was driven by uncertainty around federal student aid changes and the need to preserve the program’s appropriation without generating unplanned spending overages.
“We’re prioritizing predictability so students can count on the award and we don’t exceed the appropriation,” said Cody Robison, CHE’s deputy chief financial officer.
Changes to scholarship spending
The flat schedule follows years of funding shifts.
In 2022, the commission raised award amounts by 35% to restore pre-Great Recession levels after years of underspending. But subsequent federal changes to the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, FAFSA, and the Student Aid Index unexpectedly drove up eligibility and spending.
Story continues below.
251113_PRESENTATION_COMMISSION-OBannon-AY-2026-2027
 
Robison said that forced the commission to trim award levels in 2024 to stay within the program’s state appropriation.
In the latest state budget approved by the General Assembly earlier this year, about $77.5 million in accumulated reserves from prior years was reverted to the state’s general fund, leaving the program without a carryover cushion going forward.
State funding for higher education also took a roughly 5% hit in the latest budget cycle, triggered by a grim revenue forecast that projected about $2 billion less in revenues over the biennium. Across the board, state agencies were hit with similar funding reductions.
Previously, CHE was spending about $130 million per year out of the roughly $168 million appropriation for the Frank O’Bannon Grant, with the remainder accumulating in reserves.
New data sheds light on Indiana schools likely most affected by impending cuts to financial aid

But in 2024, the number of Indiana students who qualified for state financial aid jumped after significant changes were made to the federal formula that determines aid eligibility. Commission members kept the awards at the same amount, leading to an unexpected increase to Indiana’s projected spend for the 2025 fiscal year.
That forced CHE to dip into its reserves to cover the inflated costs. Commission staff reported $173 million in Frank O’Bannon awards dispersed in the 2024 fiscal year; $215 million the 2025 fiscal year; and $160 million in the current fiscal year.
Projected scholarship disbursements in the 2027 fiscal year are currently estimated at $157 million. Robison told commissioners that CHE is projecting about 37,000 awards to be issued for 2026-27 academic year, the same as in the current year.
Unused Frank O’Bannon dollars are no longer allowed to rollover into future budget cycles, but any remaining balance at the year’s end can now be transferred to the 21st Century Scholars or Adult Student Grant funds.
Robison said the goal moving forward is to spend “as close as possible” to the Frank O’Bannon program’s full allocation, however.
“We’ll aim to use the full appropriation while not building a hidden reserve,” Robison said.
Award amounts to stay the same
Created in 1969 and later renamed for former Gov. Frank O’Bannon, the grant is Indiana’s primary need-based scholarship for in-state students attending in-state colleges.
It combines two long-running programs: the Higher Education Award, which covers public and proprietary institutions, and the Freedom of Choice Grant for students at private colleges.
Students must be full-time Indiana residents, maintain satisfactory academic progress, and file the FAFSA by April 15 each year to qualify. Those completing at least 24 credit hours earn a full-time award; 30 hours or more qualifies them for the higher “on-time” award.
Together, the Frank O’Bannon programs account for more than 40% of all state-funded student aid, according to the commission.

Award amounts under the 2025-26 schedule ranged widely depending on institution type and student need.
For students at public four-year institutions with the highest demonstrated need and at least 30 credit hours completed, the “on-time” award currently tops at $5,300. Students in their first award year also receive the on-time award amount.
For similar students at private colleges, the top scholarship levels reach $10,600, according to CHE.
At Ivy Tech Community College and smaller proprietary institutions, the top award for the current academic year is about $4,050.
Students receiving the “full-time award” — for completing 24 to 29 credits, rather than 30 or more — the ceiling for the public-institution award falls to about $3,850, while the private institution award is about $7,700 for the 2025-26 schedule.
With the award amounts held flat for the upcoming 2026-27 school year, eligible students will continue to receive financial support in roughly that range, assuming their institution type and credit-completion category remain unchanged.
Commissioner pushes for a stronger message to students
Katie Jenner, who presided Thursday over her first full CHE meeting as both Indiana’s Secretary of Education and the newly-selected CHE commissioner, said the agency will also publish the grant’s funding methodology publicly for the first time in January. The plan, she said, is to invite input from colleges, financial-aid groups and other stakeholders.
“When we put something out transparently, it always ends up better,” Jenner said, adding that the goal is to “make sure we’re spending that money as prudently as possible.”
“We’ll be very transparent about what’s working, what’s not, and make sure every dollar supports the students who need it most,” she continued.
Robison noted that — alongside the 21st Century Scholars Program — the Frank O’Bannon Grant remains a key pillar of the state’s goal to make higher education “accessible and affordable” to all Hoosiers.

Still, Commissioner Dennis Bland said he’d like to see the program’s communications stress that the scholarship represents “an investment,” not a “handout.” He emphasized the “human” impact of the grant and the importance of students understanding the state’s investment in them.
“When people understand that someone has invested in their life and future, they’re more inclined to steward that investment,” Bland said, suggesting the commission or colleges could send students a message reflecting that theme.
He further linked the scholarship to student motivation and retention.
“Investments are being made in your life and the future of your family so that you can grow, develop your skills, return contribution to your family, return contribution to the community,” Bland added. “You’re an outstanding citizen for this state — for the nation. … These are really investments.”
The approved schedule now goes to the State Budget Committee for review in December, as required by state law. After that, the commission will communicate the final award amounts to Indiana’s colleges and universities so financial-aid packages can be prepared early next year.

(Photo by Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)When you have covered the Statehouse since 1999, it sometimes feels like being stuck in a time loop. Some issues come back over and over, with no substantive changes in the discussion.
One of my favorites of these arose again last week when key lawmakers came out in support of reducing the number of state boards and commissions. Others though include constant tinkering with “workforce development.” And let’s not forget the endless fight over township government.
But first – back to boards and commissions. Everyone seems to agree we have too many of these ubiquitous government panels — more than 250. These entities cost the state at least $700,000, mostly in per diem, travel and staff costs.
But as soon as you start picking and choosing which ones have to go, people who care about the topic go into fight mode.
When the discussion arose during interim study committees this summer and fall, memories of when then-Gov. Mitch Daniels pitched the same thing in 2006 came flooding back.
“Legislators eager to demonstrate their enthusiasm for some cause or interest group find creating these entities an easy and generally low-cost way to do so,” Daniels said then. “And while these boards and commissions take up only a minute chunk of Indiana’s budget, they devour time, money, and energy far beyond any real contribution they make.”
Some legislators want to slash from Indiana’s 250-plus boards and commissions

He asked legislators to overhaul 300-plus state boards and commissions. Initially he wanted to put a sunset date on every panel so that lawmakers would consider the value of each one in terms of allowing it to continue.
But it took years to make any progress.
Daniels wrote about the effort in a 2012 Atlantic article:
“Progress is not impossible. After years of trying, we have euthanized over 70 of these boards and commissions. My favorite method is to not appoint board or commission members and see if anyone notices. I took a more direct approach in proposing and signing a recent ‘spring cleaning’ bill which took out over 20 entities, including a water shortage task force, a library automation council, and numerous other innocuous-sounding government bodies that rarely meet and whose minimal responsibilities frequently overlap.”
Last year, Rep. Steve Bartels, R-Eckerty, introduced a bill that would have eliminated or repealed several boards and commissions. Among them were the Department of Natural Resources’ Advisory Council, the Lewis and Clark Bicentennial Commission, the Indiana Standardbred Advisory Board, the Certification Appeal Board, the Indiana Commission for Arts and Humanities Education, the Law Enforcement Academy Building Commission.
The bill didn’t even get a hearing. And the irony is that the same legislation would have created the Indiana Historical Records Advisory Board.
Bartels and Sen. Chris Garten, R-Charlestown, say they will be back at it again in 2026 though they don’t have a specific list of boards and commissions quite yet.
But there are other topics besides boards and commissions that always come back around.
Workforce woes
I don’t think there has been a single year where lawmakers haven’t passed workforce legislation, and I count at least two major overhauls of the workforce development system during my tenure.
And yet we never seem to make improvements. After decades of programs and state spending, businesses still say finding qualified workers is their biggest struggle.
Not enough Hoosiers are going to college or receiving other training or certifications. And Indiana had 135,000 job openings in June 2025. Newer numbers have been delayed by the federal government shutdown.
Township toils
Another issue I have seen cycle through the Legislature numerous times are attempts to eliminate township government. Indiana has 1,008 townships with boards and trustees.
In 2008, about 950 township assessors were abolished after a report on local government reform headed by former Gov. Joe Kernan and then-Chief Justice Randall Shepard rocked the state. It was titled “Streamlining local government. We’ve got to stop governing like this.”
But lawmakers — many of whom came up through local government — have resisted eliminating the level of government closest to the people. The Indianapolis Star recently reported on township spending, and suggested Gov. Mike Braun might support another push against the township structure in 2026.
“All told, Indiana taxpayers spent nearly $20 million on township trustee and board member pay alone in 2024, according to an IndyStar analysis of government salary data, almost as much as the $25 million they doled out in poor relief assistance to residents, which advocates for township government say is the most important thing they do.”
So, it looks like I’ll get to cover another round of debate on township reform right alongside a new effort to purge boards and commissions. It remains to be seen if reporters 20 years from now will get to do it all over again.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)A multistate health system is pausing changes to compensation but continuing to ask Duluth physicians to sign a heavily amended contract that includes a noncompete clause barring them from seeking work elsewhere.
Aspirus St. Luke’s push for physicians to sign the amended contract comes even as Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison is investigating the noncompete clause, which were banned in Minnesota for contracts after 2023.
An email from Aspirus St. Luke’s, forwarded by two physicians who were granted anonymity due to fear of retaliation, acknowledged the attorney general’s investigation into “proposed amendments to physician contracts and how the amendment might, or might not, impact an underlying non-compete commitment in our employment agreement.”
Aspirus is now pausing changes to compensation and its performance incentive program. Even amid the investigation, however, the company is still asking physicians to sign the amended contract in December — a month after an initial deadline — according to an email sent to physicians from Kim Terhaar, the vice president of ambulatory care.
Physicians previously told the Reformer that they were told that refusal to sign the amendments — which include significant changes to sections on compensation, duties and terminations — would be taken as a resignation.
An author of Minnesota’s 2023 ban on noncompete agreements said the amended contract likely violates the law; although the noncompete ban does not apply to contracts signed before 2023, renewed and amended contracts are considered new contracts.
Still, labor law experts said that it’s unclear how a court might rule. Ellison’s office provided no updates on the investigation.
The amendments are not the first time Aspirus physicians have raised issues with their noncompetes. In October, a family physician sued Aspirus St. Luke’s to be released from the noncompete clause in her contract, arguing that the enforcement of the noncompete would inhibit patient access to primary care in Duluth.
That physician, according to the lawsuit, told Aspirus that she intended to open a direct primary care practice in which patients pay a flat fee for primary care instead of paying through insurance. In response, Aspirus threatened to use her contract’s noncompete to sue her if she proceeded, according to the lawsuit.
Aspirus denied all allegations from the lawsuit and filed a memorandum defending the noncompete. The lawsuit is ongoing.
Aspirus St. Luke’s is also currently being sued by a Duluth physician in a class-action suit alleging wage theft.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/NN251025_1021-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-14 07:56:42.453273

The beneficiaries of President Donald Trump’s mercy in his second term have mostly been people with access to the president or his inner circle. Those who have followed the rules set out by the Department of Justice, meanwhile, are still waiting.
Trump has granted clemency to allies, donors and culture-war figures — as well as felons who, like him, were convicted of financial wrongdoing. On Friday, he granted pardons to 77 people, including Rudy Giuliani and other allies tied to efforts to overturn the 2020 election, though they are mostly symbolic because federal pardons do not apply to ongoing or possible state prosecutions, which many of the grantees face.
Those clemencies came on top of the commutation awarded last month to George Santos, the disgraced former New York congressman found guilty of defrauding donors and lying to the House of Representatives. Trump cut short Santos’ seven-year sentence after less than three months.
For those who followed the standard protocol set out by the Department of Justice, the sense is growing that the process no longer matters; they’ve watched the public database of applicants swell with thousands of pending cases, while Trump grants pardons to people who never entered the system at all.
In just over nine months back in office, roughly 10,000 people have filed petitions for pardons or commutations, about two-thirds the total of the 14,867 applications submitted during the entire Biden presidency.
Under Justice Department standards and requirements, people seeking pardons generally must wait five years after their release from incarceration, demonstrate good conduct and remorse, and file petitions through the Office of the Pardon Attorney. But Trump’s actions in his second term show he has largely abandoned that process.
Those who have followed the rules are still waiting. They include small-business owners with decades-old fraud cases, veterans seeking to regain the gun rights that were stripped away with their convictions and people working jobs far below their experience because of the stigma of a criminal record.
“It’s unfair to the little guy,” said Margaret Love, who served as pardon attorney from 1990 to 1997 under Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton and now represents people in clemency cases. “I tell people, ‘Sorry, you don’t have a chance.’”
The pattern began in Trump’s first term, when fewer than half of his clemency recipients had applied through the Office of the Pardon Attorney. By one estimate, only 1 in 10 had been recommended by career officials in that office.
In his second term, the break from the formal process has only widened: Only 10 of the roughly 1,600 people granted pardons had filed petitions to the Office of the Pardon Attorney, and even within that small group, some did not appear to meet the Justice Department’s standards and requirements.
A huge chunk of the pardons, roughly 1,500, were people convicted for their roles in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol. The rest have come largely through back channels. In some of the more striking cases, Trump’s pardons erased not only criminal convictions for defendants tied to large-scale corruption and financial crimes but the restitution judges had ordered or that defendants had agreed to pay.
The Justice Department did not respond to questions about why many recent pardons appear to have come outside the traditional review process or why the president has tended to use his clemency power to help political allies and people convicted of financial crimes or public corruption.
A spokesperson for the department said in an email that the Office of the Pardon Attorney is processing clemency applications. “The Department,” the spokesperson said, “is committed to timely and carefully reviewing all applications and making recommendations to the President that are consistent, unbiased, and uphold the rule of law.”
Last month, Trump pardoned Changpeng Zhao, the billionaire founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Binance, who had served four months in prison after pleading guilty in 2023 to charges of enabling money laundering. The Wall Street Journal reported that Binance had hired a lobbyist to pursue the pardon. The company has also supported Trump’s family’s crypto ventures. In a “60 Minutes” interview, Trump said that “a lot of people asked me” to pardon Zhao and that he “didn’t know him personally.”
White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said last week that there was a “whole team of qualified lawyers who look at every single pardon request” and that Trump was the final decision-maker.
She said he was “very clear when he came into office that he was most interested in looking at pardoning individuals who were abused and used by the Biden Department of Justice and were overprosecuted by a weaponized DOJ.”
A House Judiciary Committee report written by Democratic staffers — which Republicans on the panel did not respond to — found that Trump’s second-term pardons had wiped out more than $1.3 billion in restitution and fines owed to victims and to the public. The White House called the report “pointless.”
Last month, the Securities and Exchange Commission, now led by Trump appointees, dropped parallel civil cases that could have forced several defendants who were granted clemency by Trump to return hundreds of millions of dollars more, leaving victims with little recourse beyond private lawsuits.
But it’s not as if Trump broke a system that was working. A president’s pardon powers are considered absolute. For years, the clemency process has been criticized as slow, opaque and riddled with conflicts of interest — with Department of Justice attorneys helping to decide the fate of the very people they once sought to imprison. Presidents were usually faulted for using the power too sparingly to right wrongs.
Trump had a rare opportunity to fix the system. Instead, experts said, he has exploited it.
“If you’re a donor or political supporter, you move to the front of the line,” said Jim Hux, a lawyer representing a Missouri man seeking a pardon for tax crimes he committed two decades ago. He said his client has “led a model life” since finishing his sentence and fits the other criteria the Justice Department says it looks for.
“He’d love to take his grandson hunting and can’t do that because he can’t possess a firearm,” Hux said. He asked that his client not be named.
But after months of watching Trump issue clemency to people who didn’t meet the criteria — and who never went through the Office of the Pardon Attorney — Hux said that he was discouraged.
“If you’re just an average citizen, you can’t even get in the line,” Hux said. “I told my guy he’d probably be better off if he broke into the Capitol or made a major donation to Trump’s inauguration.”

In the fall of 2018, Jared Kushner convened a meeting in the Roosevelt Room of the White House. In attendance were his wife, Ivanka Trump, conservative legal activist Leonard Leo, former Obama adviser Van Jones and Kevin Sharp, a former federal judge who had resigned from the bench in protest over mandatory sentencing laws and had become an advocate for clemency reforms.
Also in the room was Kim Kardashian, the reality television star who had reinvented herself as a criminal justice advocate. She had already successfully lobbied Trump to commute the life sentence for Alice Marie Johnson, a grandmother from Tennessee who had served more than two decades for cocaine trafficking and who became a national symbol of the harsh mandatory sentences imposed on nonviolent drug offenders. (During the Republican National Convention two years later, Trump would go on to grant Johnson a full pardon.)
Johnson’s release helped pave the way for the conversation. Kushner brought in legal scholars to talk about reform, inviting Mark Osler of the University of St. Thomas in Minnesota and Rachel Barkow of New York University to explain how the clemency system worked, why it failed most applicants and what it would take to fix it.
Many observers of the presidential clemency system agreed it needed fixing. Strong cases languished in bureaucratic limbo while families of applicants pleaded in vain.
Then, Trump had an opportunity to repair it. His feud with his own Justice Department during the investigation into election interference by Russia gave him space to rethink the process, to pull clemency away from the bureaucracy.
Kushner had a strong interest in mercy and second chances. His father, Charles Kushner, had been charged with tax and campaign-finance crimes. Prosecutors said he had arranged for a prostitute to lure his brother-in-law into a videotaped encounter and sent the tape to his sister before she was due to testify against him. Kushner pleaded guilty and went to prison.
Jared Kushner would later write in Time magazine that he had spent time with families of people in prison and “knew from that experience how much those people would benefit from having someone in my office who cared about this issue.”
Standing at opposite ends of a conference table, the law professors proposed an independent board to review petitions quickly and fairly, free from prosecutorial bias. It would be similar to President Gerald Ford’s post-Vietnam War clemency commission, which reviewed petitions from draft resisters and evaders, recommended pardons or alternative service for them and reported directly to the president.
According to Osler, a leading expert on clemency, the participants had questions after the presentation, but there was no obvious dissent. The participants, he said, seemed to agree that his and Barkow’s proposal was the best path forward. Barkow declined to comment.
Sharp recalled that, after the meeting, he met again with Kushner and a few others.
“Jared, in our post-meeting, seemed to agree with all of that,” Sharp said. “The question was, what would it look like? We sat back there and kind of mapped out scenarios of what one of these commissions would look like, how potential clemency applications funnel through and who would look at them before sending those recommendations to the president.”
Sharp said the commission “would have people with experience from the prosecution side of the justice system, people with experience on the defense side of the system, citizens who worked in these areas and were familiar with the issues.”
“And then,” Sharp said, “it just withered on the vine.”
Kushner did not respond to requests for comment.
Trump did advance significant criminal justice reform when he signed the First Step Act in December 2018. The bipartisan measure eased certain federal sentences by addressing disparities in drug penalties and giving judges added flexibility in sentencing nonviolent offenders.
While not a pardon, some legal experts have described the law as a structural act of clemency because it reduced mandatory sentences and allowed earlier release for thousands of prisoners.
Trump handed out pardons on his own terms, though. Many of his first-term pardons came after he had lost the 2020 election, including to campaign aides and four of the six associates who were convicted in the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
Among the people granted pardons: Charles Kushner, whom Trump in his second term named U.S. ambassador to France and Monaco.

Rather than rely on the Justice Department’s traditional review system, Trump in his second term has built a parallel network of mercy led by political allies and media figures who can reach him directly.
He appointed Ed Martin, a longtime Missouri political operative and early Trump backer, as pardon attorney and the head of a new Weaponization Working Group at the Justice Department after Martin’s nomination for U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia was withdrawn when Republican senators pulled their support.
Martin’s dual role was a sign that pardons had become more overt political weapons. He pledged to scrutinize Biden-era pardons and review what he described as a “weaponized” justice system. After Trump pardoned Scott Jenkins, a sheriff in Virginia and a longtime supporter convicted of taking bribes for political favors, Martin posted on X, “No MAGA left behind.”
Martin did not respond to requests for comment.
A recent NBC News report described pardons being overseen by a tight circle led by Chief of Staff Susie Wiles and White House Counsel David Warrington. Johnson, the drug offender whom Kardashian had convinced Trump to free, advises on drug cases as Trump’s “pardon czar.”
Johnson’s position is new. She has said she helps find people serving or who have served long prison sentences for nonviolent crimes and have been rehabilitated and can safely reenter their communities. She also seeks out people she believes were targeted for political reasons and submits their names to Trump.
But it’s not clear how people without connections are supposed to reach her or what standards she uses to decide which names make it to the president. Johnson has no public contact information and did not respond to messages seeking comment sent to the White House and to her personal email account and Facebook page. Warrington and Wiles, as well as the White House, also did not respond.
Some lawyers said Johnson’s influence has been minimal. One clemency attorney who represents multiple clients, and who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect the chances of his clients receiving clemency, told ProPublica that, in Trump’s second term, he does not necessarily file cases with the Office of the Pardon Attorney.
The most effective route, he said, is a direct line to the Office of the White House Counsel.
Osler said he doesn’t know how to reach Johnson or anyone else on Trump’s pardon team. He runs a law-school clinic where students file clemency petitions for people they believe deserve a second chance but said, “We don’t know what the process is.”
“It’s not Alice’s fault, but this is not what we proposed,” he said, referring to the reform plan he and Barkow presented to Trump’s team in the president’s first term.
“Clemency is not meant to be a function that operates within a closed circle,” he said. “It’s something the Constitution establishes to give hope to the many — including those who don’t have the resources, the fame or the connections to navigate the current system.”

Liliana Trafficante is one of the thousands hoping for clemency. Like many of the people who have received pardons or commutations, she was convicted of a financial crime. But, unlike Charles Kushner, she had no family tie to the president’s inner circle. And unlike Santos, she had never been to Mar-a-Lago. She filed her petition for a pardon on her own.
Trafficante, who lives in the Bronx, pleaded guilty in 2010 to conspiracy to commit wire fraud in a multiyear scheme in which she collected more than $1 million in investments for a water park for foster children that she never built.
She served just over three years in federal prison and was ordered to pay $750,000 restitution to her victims. She said in an interview that she makes monthly payments but at times has been unable to keep up. She said in an interview that she feels remorse and accepts that what she did was wrong, though she maintains she was not the mastermind of the scheme.
Trafficante said that she now works as a chaplain who ministers to people in shelters and on the streets. This year, she announced on Instagram that she was running for the New York City Council. But under a 2021 city law, she could not legally take office even if voters elected her — unless Trump pardoned her. She registered a campaign committee but ultimately didn’t enter the race.
Trump’s return to office inspired her to seek a pardon. “I mean, he was going through his own criminal court case and yet he’s the president,” she said. “I was like, ‘OK, this is my guy.’”
Tony Gene Broxton, a former fire department bookkeeper from the Florida Panhandle, was indicted in 2013 on federal charges of theft of public money and making false statements. Prosecutors said he stole more than $200,000 in government benefits from the Social Security Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs over several years while working for his local fire district. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to five years of probation and a year of house arrest. He made restitution for the full amount, court records show.
As a convicted felon, Broxton lost his right to possess a gun. He applied for a pardon during the first Trump presidency, but it was finally denied by the Biden administration in 2023. After Trump returned to office, he applied again.
“I can’t go hunting with my rifles,” he said. “I can’t go target shooting with my wife. All my guns are in storage, locked up. I don’t even have access to them.”
He thought it was a good sign when, on his first day back in office, Trump pardoned the roughly 1,500 Jan. 6 defendants. He believed that Trump would have an attorney review petitions and start approving some of them.
He checks the status of his case every day.
“But,” he said, “every time I go online it just says, still pending.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/donaldtrumpfeb112025_1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-14 07:56:42.453273

Without resources for enforcement, the author argues, tenant protections like rent conrol are too often moot. (Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer)A 4-3 St. Paul City Council vote in September offers a cautionary tale for cities nationwide: Rights without enforcement create systems where even well-intentioned officials struggle to make protections work.
When tenants on Ashland Avenue faced 28.5% rent increases despite living with water leaks, mold, deteriorating foundations and wobbly staircases, they spent months fighting for protections the city should have provided automatically. The narrow majority (Councilmembers Cheniqua Johnson, Hwa Jeong Kim, Rebecca Noecker and Nelsie Yang) sided with tenants, limiting increases to 3%. That’s the good news. But dissenting council members Molly Coleman, Anika Bowie, and Saura Jost revealed how enforcement gaps force impossible choices for tenants and city government alike.
Cities nationwide have embraced tenant protection policies — rent control, just-cause eviction, habitability standards — but then they don’t fund enforcement. The result is “paper rights” — tenants cannot access these protections unless they have enormous resources to take on landlords, public officials and bureaucratic inertia. 
This case illustrates St. Paul’s approach to tenant issues: create elaborate protections on paper, provide minimal enforcement, then blame tenants for the resulting dysfunction.
The city’s rent stabilization ordinance caps annual increases at 3% but allows exceptions, including for landlords who can demonstrate need for “reasonable return on investment.” As it stands, tenants can appeal these increases. Since 2022, just 29 tenant appeals have made it to the City Council with roughly 7-in-10 cases denied prior to this September’s case. What happened on Ashland Avenue shows how this entire process actually works: City staff approved a 28.5% increase after reviewing financial documents, apparently without adequately assessing whether the units met basic maintenance standards, with the hearing officer suggesting the council do the same through denial of tenant appeals against such an increase.
Only when tenants organized and appealed did problems come to light.  Instead of ensuring standards were met before approving rent increases, the city required tenants to prove their units were substandard. 
In other words: Here’s your rights — good luck enforcing them on your own.
When enforcement fails, officials often choose landlords
When council members voted against limiting the rent increase, their reasoning revealed how enforcement gaps force impossible choices — and whose interests get prioritized.
Coleman and Jost deferred to systems that had already failed. Coleman argued habitability questions “should be determined through city inspections or in housing court” — even though the Department of Safety and Inspections had failed to assess conditions before approving increases. Both said: Trust the process, even when the process just failed.
Bowie opposed the tenants’ appeal to protect “naturally occurring affordable housing.” Despite acknowledging unsafe stairways and deterioration, she proposed allowing a 20% increase because landlords would be “operating at a net zero while complying with city code.” For other Ashland units: “These rents are below market rate… This isn’t a situation of a landlord trying to jack up the rent.”
This asks tenants to absorb substandard conditions and major rent increases to preserve landlord viability. Tenants living with mold and unsafe conditions are already subsidizing the landlord’s operation with their health.
The dissenting votes weren’t from incomplete information — the council had extensive documentation from a HUD-certified inspector and tenant testimony. These were value choices about whose interests matter most when enforcement fails.
The 4-3 vote shows why enforcement gaps are corrosive: They burden tenants while forcing officials into impossible choices. Without adequate enforcement, city leaders default to preserving the status quo. The result: tenants lose.
The broader lesson
Tenant protections fail without three components:
Proactive enforcement: Cities must verify compliance before approving harmful actions. Complaint-driven enforcement burdens vulnerable tenants and forces officials to decide with incomplete information. Landlords with significant property violations should no longer hide on a city council consent agenda when their license comes up for renewal or when they self-certify their rent increases, but be subject to investigation and discussion before the public who sanctions their business in the first place.
Adequate resources: St. Paul budgeted less than $500,000 for rent stabilization in 2025 to oversee thousands of units. It was insufficient this year, and as half of our city rents, it will continue to be without significantly more money. This budget gap forces officials to make judgment calls without verification infrastructure, and leaves city staff forced to cut corners when they would rather do the right thing by their neighbors.
Clear authority: The dissenting members’ uncertainty about considering habitability reflects unclear authority allowing failures to continue. Cities must define enforcement standards clearly, and do so in a way that provides clarity to decisionmakers and to those seeking remediation.
Without these, tenant protections exhaust tenants while leaving officials navigating claims without support.
The 4-3 vote went right, but three dissenting votes revealed how enforcement failures create impossible situations. In cities implementing tenant protections, the lesson is that rights without enforcement don’t just fail tenants — they create systems where even well-intentioned officials lack tools to make protections work.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/P1116559-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-14 07:56:42.453273

(Photo: Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)The proposed Summerlin movie studio bill now under consideration by lawmakers in a special legislative session could force the state to cut expenses or increase revenue to accommodate the bill’s massive expansion of transferable tax credits.
Assembly Bill 5, the resurrected Assembly Bill 238 from the 2025 Legislative Session earlier this year, proposes expanding Nevada’s film tax credit program from $10 million per year to $120 per year, beginning in 2029. Most of the tax credits would be associated with productions at Summerlin Studios, a proposed movie studio in Las Vegas backed by Howard Hughes Corporation, Sony Entertainment and Warner Brothers Discovery.
Legislative Counsel Bureau fiscal analyst Sarah Coffman told lawmakers Thursday that their analysis found that the sixteenfold expansion of transferable tax credits would result in the state’s ending fund balance dipping below the statutorily required 5% in 2030. That would force lawmakers to either cut tens of millions of dollars in state spending or increase revenue by that amount to maintain a balanced budget.
The analysis, discussed during a hearing of the special session’s Assembly Committee on Jobs, served as a counterpoint to film studio supporters who have for years argued that the tax credits have no fiscal downside because they are only awarded after qualified spending has occurred.
Transferable tax credits must be accounted for during the state budgeting process. One state fiscal analyst previously described it as “negative revenue.”
Revenue generated by the projects associated with the transferable film tax credits is supposed to offset the credits, but the return on investment is hotly debated across the nation.
A fiscal analysis commissioned by supporters of the Summerlin Studios bill found that for the proposed $1.65 billion in transferable tax credits over 15 years, the state would receive $384.4 million back in direct revenue. That translates to Nevada receiving back 23 cents for every $1 of transferable tax credits handed out.
“So, for every dollar, we’d lose 77 cents,” said Assemblymember Greg Hafen, a Republican from Pahrump whose questions in the hearing prompted a closer look at the impact to the state budget.
If locally generated taxes are considered, the return on investment rises to 53 cents for every $1, according to Guy Hobbs, who led the analysis.
The true benefit to the state, Hobbs and others argued, comes with the indirect and induced revenue generated. With that, supporters project the return on investment to balloon to $32 per $1. That would include a required minimum $300 million spent on qualified expenses like labor, set design, catering, and other elements that involve money going from business to business.
“The economic report does not reflect the fiscal returns on those,” said Matt Walker, the Howard Hughes lobbyist who presented the bill.
AB4 is largely unchanged from its previously considered iteration. The implementation date for the availability of transferable film tax credits was moved back to 2029.
The special session bill also includes provisions that would allow the state to suspend the acceptance of transferable tax credits during economic downturns. Walker likened it to the mining industry prepaying their taxes, a maneuver the state has turned to more than once to address budget shortfalls.
Assemblymember Howard Watts, a Democrat from Las Vegas, questioned bill presenters about AB4’s diversity and inclusion targets. The bill sets five standards, two of which must be met in order for a production to qualify for film tax credits.
Watts said that it appeared a film production could meet the requirements by having just six people into key roles.
Walker didn’t dispute Watts’ reading of the diversity requirements, but he defended the bill as “a serious commitment to thinking outside the box” and creating targets that could be reached by productions that might not be able to meet percentage requirements.
“This is not intended to water it down and create some kind of alternative minimum,” Walker added.
Supporters are describing the film bill as “a jobs bill” that will bring 19,000 construction jobs to the state, something labor unions say is desperately needed. Two labor groups are leading the charge in support of the film bill.
AB4 is also being pitched as an education bill that will provide dedicated funding for expanding pre-K seats in Clark County. The bill would create a special tax district around Summerlin Studios and funnel some of the generated revenue into a standalone fund to support the expansion of full-day early education within the Clark County School District.
Clark County Education Association, the union representing CCSD teachers, is backing the bill.
So too are the University of Nevada Las Vegas and the University of Nevada Reno, which have signed memorandums of understanding with Warner Brothers and Sony, respectively, to develop job training and other opportunities for their students.
The Assembly Committee on Jobs took no action on the bill on Thursday.
Studio bill escapes premature death
Thursday’s policy debate over the film tax credit bill almost didn’t happen after one Assembly member attempted to kill the bill early in the special session.
Assemblymember Selena La Rue Hatch, a Democrat from Reno, requested the full Assembly vote to immediately reject AB5. Immediately rejecting a bill as it’s being introduced into the Legislature is an option listed in the procedural rules, though it is rarely, if ever, used.
The attempt to kill the film bill might have succeeded, with 21 of the 41 Assembly members physically present in the chambers voting to reject the bill. However, after La Rue Hatch moved for the vote, Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager immediately recessed the chamber. When the body reconvened, Assemblymember Sandra Jauregui, who serves as the chamber’s majority leader and is the sponsor of the film bill, announced Assemblymember Teresa Brown May would be participating remotely.
Brown May, a Democrat from Las Vegas who voted for a previous iteration of the film bill when it was considered, voted against rejecting the bill, resulting in a 21-21 tie on La Rue Hatch’s attempt to kill the bill. Motions need a majority to pass, so a tie is equivalent to a failure.
Assemblymember Cecelia Gonzalez, a Las Vegas Democrat who supported rejecting the film bill, asked Yeager to explain why Brown May was authorized to vote remotely. Legislative procedural rules state that remote votes are only acceptable for “exceptional circumstances,” Gonzalez noted.
Yeager said that Brown May had “personal matters to attend to” and that it would “not be appropriate” for him to publicly disclose them.
“I have determined, in consultation with legal counsel, that remote participation is appropriate in this circumstance,” he added.
The Assembly earlier this year, during the regular legislative session, narrowly passed a version of the film bill — 22 yays, 20 nays.
Several Assembly members who voted to pass a film bill in June voted to reject it Thursday. The opposite was also true.

(Photo: Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)The Nevada Resort Association on Thursday defended the provisions of Gov. Joe Lombardo’s crime bill that would allow courts to ban certain criminal offenders from the resort corridor for up to a year.
Provisions of Assembly Bill 4 mirror the functions of the now-dissolved Resort Corridor Court, which was created to deal with low-level crimes on the Strip, often by barring offenders from entering the tourist district for months at a time.
The short-lived specialty court, established by the Clark County Justice Court in 2023, was disbanded the next year after questions about its legality arose. 
Matt Griffin, a lobbyist for the Nevada Resort Association, told lawmakers on the special session’s Assembly Committee on Public Safety and Security that those questions were resolved in April after a Clark County District Court Judge affirmed the county had the authority to enact criminal ordinances on the resort corridor. The court ruled it was not a violation of the First Amendment to bar individuals from the corridor once they were charged or convicted of a crime in the corridor.
Critics of the court argued ordinances on the resort corridor violated free speech laws by targeting street performers and vendors with low-level offences. 
While the bill includes language giving the Justice Court the authority to re-establish a Resort Corridor Court, the bill itself does not revive the controversial court, said Griffin.
“I think there’s been some misunderstanding about what’s being proposed today,” Griffin told lawmakers. “We are not seeking for this body to enact a corridor court. That is a decision for the Justice Court to make and the Justice Court to make alone.”
The bill proposes establishing order-out corridors for individuals convicted of crimes within these areas, with discretionary penalties for first offenses and mandatory one-year bans for subsequent offenses made within two years. 
Virginia Valentine, the president and CEO of the Nevada Resort Association, told lawmakers repeat offenders were undeterred by current penalties.
“Recidivism continues to be a significant issue in our tourism areas,” Valentine said.
Provisions pushed by the Nevada Resort Association would also elevate certain crimes against hospitality workers to higher felony categories by categorizing them as a protected class, similar to utility workers and school teachers.
The Nevada Resort Association also proposed an amendment to the bill that would require the court to submit an annual report that includes the number of people barred from the corridor, their crime, and the rate of successful completion of their sentence. No public data was available on the previous court’s operation.
Several gaming companies spoke in support of the crime bill, including Red Rock Resorts, Caesars Entertainment, Boyd Gaming Corporation, MGM Resorts International, and Wynn Resorts. 
Provision surrounding the resort corridor attracted a slew of testimony in opposition. Athar Haseebullah, the executive director of the ACLU of Nevada, argued the bill would privatize part of the judicial system. While it does not directly reestablish a corridor court, Haseebullah said it opens the door to build one again.
“This is an optical, performative bill that basically sells out the interests of our community for what the resorts want. When the corridor court was created it targeted people, largely who are unhoused and street performers. It targeted very few, if any, folks who engaged in violence, because it was a Justice Court initiative, if there were violent offenses that would have been bound over to District Court,” Haseebullah said.
“It’s a banishment court so they could continue to try to privatize Las Vegas Boulevard, despite the fact that locals are the ones who pay the bill for that,” he said.
The gaming industry’s asks are just one component of AB4, a sweeping bill that covers several areas of criminal law. The bill would also: 

expand the definition of stalking to include dating relationships and cyberstalking via social media; 
add kidnapping and attempted domestic violence to the list of felony domestic violence offenses;
mandate firearm surrender compliance within 2-5 business days post-conviction;
increase penalties for DUI-related offenses and establish an alternative correctional program;
Child pornography possession would be charged per image; 
eliminate automatic sealing of records for offenses against children or the elderly;
prioritize restitution to victims; and 
addresses violence against school employees.

It’s mid-November in Montana, but the temperatures across the nation’s fourth largest state are all in the high 60s.  There’s two weeks left in hunting season, but there’s no tracking snow except at the highest elevations.  And it’s been dry for a long time as summer’s drought continues unabated.  As for the ski areas, even those with the ability to make snow can’t do so if it doesn’t fall well below freezing at night. 
Put it all together and it’s pretty clear the Big Sky State has hit the wall on how much water it can continue to give away, especially for wells being drilled for new developments that are exempt from the standard water appropriation process. 
How bad is it?  
Well, it’s a very, very, very rare case when you see environmental and conservation organizations such as the Montana Environmental Information Center, the Clark Fork Coalition, and Trout Unlimited on the same side of a water rights lawsuit as the Montana Farm Bureau Federation, the Montana League of Cities and Towns and the Association of Gallatin Agricultural Irrigators.  
But that’s what just happened this week when they were all co-Plaintiffs in the lawsuit filed against the State of Montana and the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation. 
So why would such strange bedfellows all have the same complaint with the exempt wells law?  It’s because the state continues to allow more exempt wells for new, rural subdivisions to draw groundwater, including in basins that are closed to further appropriation permits — and the drawdown is affecting existing water rights and use in every one of those sectors. 
The simplest example is a milkshake.  If you only have one straw in a milkshake it will last a lot longer than if you have many straws which very quickly results in everyone sucking air because the milkshake is gone.  Like a milkshake, Montana’s water resources are a finite quantity and cannot “meet the demand” for ever more withdrawals.  
Moreover, wells don’t just suck water straight up the straw — they create a “cone of depression” that draws in water from an area far larger than the well location.  That cone then affects other water users as experienced in August when the City of Boulder decided to sell water to the Crazy Mountain Ranch to water its golf course, drying up springs and existing water sources.  When an existing water rights holder filed a complaint with the Department of Natural Resources and Conservation, the city was told to halt its withdrawals, that the agency considered the well illegal, and then fined the Crazy Mountain Ranch $8,000 — the maximum allowed by law — for violating the Montana Water Use Act.  The issue is now in court as the ranch disputes the fine.
Nor are private water uses the only problem with the exempt well law.  When wells drawdown groundwater or aquifers it impacts the complex hydrogeological systems that affect the water table for rivers and streams, wetlands, lakes, and other public resources the state holds in trust for its citizens.
It’s likely the exempt well law will go down due to the “unintended consequences” of allowing more water withdrawal than there is water especially with our warmer, drier climate.  
If the question is whether the state should give priority to existing residents’ needs instead of allowing new wells for people who don’t even live here yet the simple answer is “yes” — existing residents should absolutely have priority in the allocation of our finite but critical water resources before we all go dry.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/P1090687-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-14 06:58:00.148091

“Back to the drawing board,” its director said of a 15-year push to renovate or replace a pre-Civil War era facility.

RUTLAND — At first glance, the plan for a new Rutland Free Library looked promising: Replace its pre-Civil War-era brick building with nearby downtown space in hopes of cutting construction costs in half and corralling a host of other local government services into a “civic center.”
If only an architect hadn’t crunched the numbers and calculated a $18 million price tag that’s four times higher than originally estimated.
“That’s not a savings,” library director Randal Smathers said this month. “That’s about what it would cost to redo the building.”

Rutland — Vermont’s most populous municipality outside of Chittenden County — recently green-lit a new tax increment financing district to support a seven-story hotel and apartment block and other downtown improvements. But after 15 years of attempted upgrades, its public library has hit another roadblock on the path toward renovating or replacing its aging facility.
“Back to the drawing board,” Smathers said.
The 76,000-book library has a long history of struggling with space. Since its founding in 1886, the institution has moved from various downtown storefronts, the since-demolished Memorial Hall and the old Longfellow School to its current site — an 1858 Renaissance Revival structure at the corner of Court and Center streets that, up until 1935, housed the city’s post office, courthouse and jail.
“In location and style, this influential building reflects the changes occurring in the city as a result of its initial railroad boom,” the national Society of Architectural Historians has noted. “The site was a compromise, partway down the hill between the original village center on Main Street and the new commercial focus developing in the vicinity of the railroad depot.” 
Residents approved two additions in the 1960s and 1980s, only to see the original building’s ceilings sag and foundation crumble. The library unveiled plans to move to space at nearby Center and Wales streets in 2009 and the former College of St. Joseph campus on the city’s outskirts in 2020, only to be tripped up by costs and criticism.
“Top architects told us the public will compare whatever design we put forward to an idealized library they remember when they were children, and that’s absolutely true,” Smathers told VTDigger last winter during the latest round of meetings. “People start their input with, ‘When I was a kid …’ They form emotional attachments. They love this building. It’s beautiful — and also terrible for a modern library.”
Staying put isn’t any cheaper. The library had banked $1.5 million for capital repairs a year ago when it learned estimates to renovate the current building had risen to nearly 10 times that much. Rutland Mayor Mike Doenges then suggested the library join City Hall in studying the possibility of relocating together in the downtown’s three-decade-old Asa Bloomer state office building on Merchants Row.
‘Libraries have unique challenges’
Leaders hoped the proposed “civic center” — similar to South Burlington’s shared library and city office building that opened in 2021 — would join a list of more than 30 other Vermont library building projects approved since 2010.

But while Rutland residents have acknowledged the library’s problems, they weren’t sold on the proposed solution. At public hearings earlier this year, they voiced reservations about finding parking and feeling safe downtown.
Moving on to develop blueprints and a budget, the library learned its initial civic center project estimate of $4.5 million would actually be closer to $18 million.
“Libraries have unique challenges, the first one being that books are really, really heavy,” Smathers said this past week of a list of complications shared by an architect. “We started looking at the work to upgrade to the standards we would need and the savings went away.”
Back at square one, the library recently received two major private donations, raising its building fund to $4.3 million.
“The library is ready, willing and able to invest that somewhere in downtown Rutland,” Smathers said.
But the exact location remains up in the air. Smathers noted the local Walmart is projected to leave its 76,000-square-foot Rutland Plaza anchor space in 2027 for a new “supercenter” at the former Diamond Run Mall property in neighboring Rutland Town.
“If Walmart does move out, Rutland is going to need reasons for people to go downtown, and a beautiful new library that pays for a third of its own cost upfront seems to me to be the kind of investment that makes a lot of sense,” Smathers said. “If that possibility or another plot of land is available, we need to take a serious look at it.”
In a statement, the Brixmor Property Group, the Rutland Plaza’s operator, said it was “working on strategies to backfill the space” with the expectation Walmart would remain for two more years.
“Our goal is to bring in retailers that are relevant to the communities we serve and we’re happy to work with the city to achieve that,” Brixmor spokesperson Maria Pace said.
Whatever the future holds, Smathers said it can’t be the status quo.
“The problems in this building are not going away,” he said. “At some point, likely in the next five years, something is going to break and we’re not going to be able to open for the public. If somebody is looking for a tax write-off and wants to donate a 25,000-square-foot building, I’m the guy to call.”

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel met with migrant advocates in Grand Rapids at a Thursday roundtable to discuss the impacts of federal policy under the Trump administration on their ability to do their work, especially around concerns of immigration detention and deportation. 
Migrant Legal Aid, which hosted the roundtable, as well as Puertas Abiertas, a Grand Rapids-based organization focused on helping Latinx victims of domestic violence and human trafficking, described situations where federal enforcement had in the past been helpful or necessary to help victims of trafficking or exploitation, but now came with a high risk of detention or deportation for those very victims. 
“When we’re talking about the people who are being exploited, who’s exploited more, of course, than the undocumented?” Nessel said. SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
For example, explained Teresa Hendricks, the Executive Director of Migrant Legal Aid, when they are working to investigate farms for potential labor trafficking violations, they would normally turn to the Department of Labor for help with assessing those violations. 
“In fact, it’s been the opposite, to the point where, in Michigan, if a grower is being investigated by us, they will call DOL to get an inspection, which is basically a whitewash, to say, look, they can’t find anything,” Hendricks said. 
That’s also a question of an ability to engender trust in workers regardless of immigration status, Hendricks said, which called the organization’s “secret little superpower.”
Meanwhile, Alejandra Garces Pozo, a farmworker outreach specialist with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, explained that she has had many people reach out to her to cancel their benefits, including Medicaid or food assistance, because of fears that the Department of Homeland Security could be accessing their data.  
“We’re seeing the struggles and the changes in our programs, in our departments, like with helping people apply for state benefits, like whether it’s Medicaid or food assistance or childcare or state emergency relief,” Pozo said. “I’ve had a lot of clients call me so stressed to the point where by the time I’m like, ‘What is it that you want me to do?’ She’s like, ‘I want you to take my benefits away. I don’t want benefits anymore’.”

Those data sharing concerns have been the target of a number of suits joined by Nessel’s office, as she noted in the roundtable, including injunctions on data sharing with Homeland Security regarding SNAP food assistance benefits and Medicaid. 
“I know why people are scared and don’t feel safe and don’t want to participate in programs that they are eligible under law to participate in need and need and badly need,” Nessel responded. 
She added that her own concerns about data privacy under the Trump administration, especially tax return data from the IRS, led her to actually stop hosting trainings with senior citizens on protecting their personal information. 










They’re just terrified. They don’t want to call 911. They don’t trust them.


– Elizabeth Centeno, a bilingual youth group facilitator with Puertas Abiertas


“How am I now trying to tell people how to protect their Social Security number when I don’t even know who has their Social Security number?” she said. 
That lack of ability to work with federal agencies has also impacted Nessel’s own work, she explained. Her office will work on a case involving something as serious as sex trafficking, but when the FBI or Homeland Security get involved, they often instead detain and try to deport the victims.  
“It’s very, very difficult to be a state attorney general, working with the locals, working with the county, working with MSP (Michigan State Police). We just have a really difficult time doing this work when we don’t have the federal agencies involved,” Nessel said, adding that some powers, like granting visas to victims, are outside of her power. “The trust is not there that they’ll treat people who are victims like victims instead of like criminals.”

“Our clients are in so much fear of even calling law enforcement just because of the situation that is going on with Homeland Security,” added Elizabeth Centeno, a bilingual youth group facilitator with Puertas Abiertas. “They’re just terrified. They don’t want to call 911. They don’t trust them.”
Claudia Annoni, the executive director of Puertas Abiertas, also noted that threats of immigration enforcement are often weaponized against victims of domestic violence or trafficking. 
“It adds also to the level of intimidation, because if the perpetrator is a legal citizen here in the United States and you’re not, that is an easy one,” she said. “You say something, and I’ll call immigration on you.”
Nessel responded to Centeno to note that that hesitancy makes it harder to identify victims or witnesses to crimes. She also added that masked and unmarked law enforcement vehicles or uniforms make it hard for people to tell if they’re being stopped by actual police or immigration agents, as opposed to people posing as them.
“It’s really damaging for all of law enforcement,” she said. “It’s creating that confusion in the communities.”
Another concern raised at the roundtable was the availability of grant funding, and how challenging new rules regarding diverse or inclusive language have created new challenges for groups like Puertas Abiertas to even function.  
“The reality is … we serve this community. And when you’re applying for a grant or you’re applying to a foundation, you aren’t gonna lie, ‘Well, we serve people.’ We serve the Latinx community,” Annoni said. “Who do we trust that we can send a letter, a proposal to receive funding.”
Molly Spaak, deputy director and attorney at Migrant Legal Aid, said that their organization had gone through a thesaurus to find different language to use when their $300,000 federal grant was cut — over half of their annual budget. 
The burden on groups like Migrant Legal Aid has increased exponentially — Hendricks noted that they get calls nearly every day asking for help with questions about emergency estate planning, managing mortgages and custody of children when someone is being deported imminently. That falls outside of their normal scope of work, and means that they often have to direct people to outside, private lawyers — who are often very expensive. 
“I think a key takeaway is that all of this happens so quickly and it’s so confusing, and our clients are usually terrified by this whole experience,” Spaak said.

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)A business lobbyist Thursday sought to salvage a new unemployment insurance bill that has sparked opposition from some Democrats and advocates for people with disabilities.
The bill came from the joint labor-management Unemployment Insurance Advisory Council. The council is historically a source of consensus legislation to update Wisconsin’s laws on jobless pay, but its 2025 proposal includes provisions Democrats have strongly opposed.
The senior Democrat on the Assembly’s labor committee has disavowed the bill because it includes a financial penalty for people who receive federal disability pay if they apply for unemployment insurance when they’re laid off from a job.
The council bill also contains several other changes that Democratic lawmakers have unanimously opposed and Gov. Tony Evers has vetoed in the past.

At a public hearing Thursday on the legislation, AB 652, Scott Manley of Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce emphasized that the measure had the unanimous support of both the management and labor members of the advisory council.
Manley chairs the council’s management caucus. Representatives from the council’s labor caucus did not take part in the hearing.
“There’s a reason we have a council,” Manley told the Assembly Committee on Workforce Development, Labor and Integrated Employment. “It’s a process we believe in. We think it’s a process that works. And we would ask everybody in the community to respect that process.”
WMC and other business groups have repeatedly backed Republican legislators’ bills to change the state’s unemployment laws when they bypassed the joint advisory council.  Evers has regularly vetoed such bills.
Manley said that it would be unprecedented for an advisory council bill to split the Legislature on party lines, however.
“My fear is that if the Legislature decides to turn this into a partisan issue, despite the fact that it was unanimously supported by labor and management, that Gov. Evers would consider vetoing the bill,” Manley said.
If that happens, he said, the bill’s $25 bump in the state’s maximum weekly jobless pay — the first increase in more than a decade — would likely be put off until 2027.
Victor Forberger, a lawyer who specializes in unemployment law, said even that increase, bringing the maximum benefit to $395 a week, was inadequate compared with surrounding states.
Minnesota tops out at $914 a week, Forberger testified. Iowa’s maximum is $602 and Michigan’s is $446, with an increase to $530 in 2026.
“We’re not keeping pace with the states around us,” Forberger told the committee. “We’re not even coming close to that
The disability-jobless pay conflict
The advisory council bill’s highest-profile point of contention applies to people who receive Social Security Disability Income.
Since 2013, Wisconsin law has automatically disqualified SSDI recipients from collecting jobless pay, even if they get laid off from a job and otherwise meet the requirements for unemployment compensation.
A federal judge ruled in 2024 that the SSDI jobless pay ban violated federal law. After an additional court order this summer, the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development is now reviewing the cases of people denied unemployment compensation in the last 10 years due to the SSDI ban, and is issuing payments to those who qualify.
The joint advisory council unemployment bill repeals the ban on unemployment insurance for SSDI recipients. But it would also cut their jobless pay by 50% of their SSDI pay.
That provision led Rep. Christine Sinicki (D-Milwaukee), the ranking Democrat on the labor committee, to keep her name off the list of sponsors for the advisory council bill.
“I simply cannot support taking benefits from those who are disabled,” Sinicki said when she, along with the committee’s other two Democrats, voted against the bill’s formal introduction Thursday. “They receive very little money to begin with. And now to reduce their benefits to me is unconscionable.”
Manley defended the 2013 law that excluded SSDI recipients from the unemployment insurance program.
“SSDI is intended to compensate somebody for their loss of earning capacity based on a disability,” he said. “And unemployment is supposed to compensate somebody through the loss of their earnings because they were laid off or their job was eliminated or some other reason that’s no fault of their own. So, that’s why the policy decision was made in the first place that we wouldn’t allow people to have both benefits.”
While the court ruled against a blanket exclusion from unemployment compensation for people getting SSDI, Manley argued that offsetting their jobless pay by a portion of their disability income is comparable to existing provisions that offset unemployment benefits based on other wage income.

But SSDI is not like a wage, said Forberger, whose lawsuit overturned Wisconsin’s SSDI jobless pay ban.
“SSDI is essentially getting your Social Security benefits early,” Forberger testified. While Social Security payments are based on lifetime earnings at retirement age, he said, unemployment is based on a recent job loss, and unemployment benefits are based on earnings in the last year and a half.
The average SSDI benefit in Wisconsin as of December 2023 was about $1,400 per month, he said. SSDI recipients take part-time jobs because their disability income “is not enough to support themselves,” Forberger said. “They need additional money to make ends meet.”
The federal Social Security Administration, which administers the disability program, encourages recipients to work so they might make a transition back to the workforce and no longer need benefits. “Essentially, what Wisconsin is saying to disabled folks here is . . . ‘We don’t want you working anymore,’” Forberger said.
Other provisions
Several other items in the advisory council bill previously were part of Republican bills that Evers vetoed in the past when they reached his desk.
One would require DWD to establish a website where employers could report unemployment compensation recipients who “ghosted” job interviews or didn’t show up for the first day on the job after an offer.
Another would require audits of 50% of all work searches by people collecting jobless pay. In 41% of work search audits that DWD conducted, “claimants failed to fulfill weekly work search requirements,” said Brian Dake of Wisconsin Independent Businesses. “We believe this data justifies the need for more audits.”
 A third provision stipulates specific checks that DWD should make to ensure that a person who makes an unemployment claim isn’t stealing another person’s identity or engaged in some other fraudulent activity.
The bill also would mandate electronic filing of payroll information for business owners with fewer than 25 employees.
Forberger, in his testimony, rejected all those provisions as ineffectual or unnecessary.
“Ghosting interviews is already illegal in this state,” he said, with stiffer penalties than outlined in the bill. Employers, he added, are unlikely to go to the trouble of filing a report and take the time for the hearings that would follow.
Forberger observed that the department already consults a wide range of databases in checking out claims. And he said small employers have sought his help after making mistakes and getting in trouble with the department in filing required payroll documentation.
“To mandate online-only filing is just going to make it that much harder for these employers,” Forberger said.
(According to DWD communications director Haley McCoy, in 2024 about 97% of taxable employers with fewer than 25 employees submitted their wage reports electronically. “Fewer and fewer employers file on paper every quarter with current figures showing less than 3% filing by paper,” McCoy told the Wisconsin Examiner.)
Forberger said the bill’s work search audit requirement was redundant, because DWD already conducts work search audits of every person filing a claim. He said he’s heard from many people who don’t understand what constitutes a work search and how to report it.
“When they’re getting audited, they’re getting disqualified,” Forberger said. “If you really want to improve the system, DWD needs to start doing some training and helping people how to navigate the system.”

(Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana leaders gathered Thursday to consider how the state could mine its ample coal waste for the rare earth elements key to modern technology — in a bid to boost domestic production and break China’s dominance.
“I want all these liabilities that we’ve got to turn into resources,” Kit Turpin, director of the state’s Abandoned Mine Land Program, told the Indiana Rare Earth Recovery Council at its first meeting.
Gov. Mike Braun created the group in an April executive order. He directed its 13 members to help develop a coal waste-based rare earths industry.
The 17 metallic elements are critical to defense, health care, power generation, transportation and other industries. They’re also in widely used consumer products, like iPhones and LED lights.

Despite their name, the elements aren’t actually rare — they’re just typically “finely dispersed,” rarely found concentrated enough to easily extract.
Major deposits are found in China — the world’s leading rare earths producer — as well as Brazil, Russia, and elsewhere, said Maria Mastalerz, a research geologist for the Indiana Geological and Water Survey.
Federal estimates place the U.S. at just 1 million metric tons of reserves, compared to global reserves of about 120 million metric tons.
“Indiana does not have traditional sources” of rare earths, Mastalerz said.
But coal and its production byproducts — gob, slurry, spent substrate, acid drainage and sludge, and more — could be “unconventional” sources.
Tapping coal
“Every point” of mining, processing and using coal presents “special” opportunities to recover rare earths, according to Mastalerz.
However, these materials are “low-grade,” with lower concentrations of rare earths, she repeatedly cautioned.
That makes extraction more difficult and expensive.
Mastalerz — who specializes in coal geology, organic petrology and geochemistry — is testing ways to find rare earth “sweet spots” and “optimize” their recovery.
The materials are plentiful, though.

Turpin, whose Department of Natural Resources program rehabilitates abandoned mine lands, said Indiana has more than 1,900 sites. The program has almost $80 million worth of projects in the pipeline, but there’s an estimated $400 million worth of unfunded inventory, he said.
“The economics don’t look good” for rare earths recovery, he said, “but if you already have a problem (in abandoned mine lands) that needs addressed, maybe you can find efficiencies.”
The program tested a gob pile and found dozens of elements, including rare earths and other critical minerals, per Turpin.
“Every cubic yard of coal refuse out there contains about 10 grams of yttrium — what’s in your hand there,” Turpin said, as council members passed around a small case with chunks of lustrous metal.
“The problem with it is … you’re talking about processing a ton of this material for that 10 grams,” he told them.

The gob pile has an estimated $10 billion worth of rubidium in it, he added, but it’s stuck in 2 million yards of material.
The program must use its largely federal funding on mine land reclamation, however. Rare earths recovery has to be “incidental” — another challenge.
‘Your test state’
Federal officials called in from Washington, D.C., to praise Indiana.
“The things that you’re doing are the same things that we would like to do,” said Lanny Erdos, director of the U.S. Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement.
“We really are with you in your efforts here,” said Ned Mamula, director of the U.S. Geological Survey. “… We want to change our thinking about this. Pile of waste? No. … There’s products in there. We’ve got to find a way to get them out.”
Indiana Secretary of Energy and Natural Resources Suzanne Jaworowski thanked the pair, telling them, “Keep in mind, we’d like to be your test state — a beta — and definitely your partner here. So we’ll keep you updated on our activities.”

Braun’s order includes several directives for the council: advance a coal site cleanup program, collaborate with industry on extraction and processing technology, establish Indiana-based supply and refinery operations, and work with educational institutions to create an extraction and processing workforce program.
The group has to provide annual updates to the governor, and a final report is due before the end of 2026.
The next meeting date hasn’t yet been set. Council members suggested bringing in industry representatives, like those interested in processing rare earths out of coal waste or those who’d use the elements in their products.

Others recommended calling on more academics, since the technology might not be advanced enough for industry, and to consider recovering the elements from recycled technology.
Indiana has an estimated 57 billion tons of unmined coal but only 17 billion tons are recoverable using current technology, said Tommy Sutton, vice president of surface operations at Hallador Energy’s Sunrise Coal.
Of that recoverable amount, 88% would require underground mining and just 12% could be extracted via surface mining.
“I think we’ve got several years,” Sutton said of the industry, but companies are “competing for the same coal reserves.” He said coal companies are turning to byproducts like methane, sulphur and possibly rare earths.
“What was refuse at one point is now something you can actually use,” he told the council.

Parcel 0712 is part of a complex of oil and gas leases in ecologically valuable sagebrush-steppe that the Bureau of Land Management has proposed for auction in June. 
The post Drilling lease slated 2 miles from world’s largest sage grouse lek, center punching planet’s longest mule deer migration appeared first on WyoFile .","The rolling, rockpile-strewn sagebrush that unfurls along more than 3 square miles of the Golden Triangle region appeared mostly devoid of life during a recent mid-November afternoon walk.
But brown, chalky spheres and cylinders of scat littering the landscape offered evidence of winged and hooved animals that call this ground home seasonally and throughout the year. 
A mile or so southwest of the Lander Cutoff Road, this 2,194-acre Bureau of Land Management parcel is proposed for inclusion in an oil and gas lease sale set for June. 
Wildlife biologists know the tract, labeled Parcel 0712 in the lease sale, as among the most biologically rich reaches of the sagebrush-steppe biome remaining anywhere on Earth. 
Evidence of the claim is illustrated by the area’s abundance of greater sage grouse.

Just two miles from the boundary of Parcel 0712 is the sprawling Divide Lek, which retired Wyoming sage grouse coordinator Tom Christiansen frequents in the spring. He’s there to count male birds strutting to court mates, and there are a ton of them. 
“It’s the largest lek on the planet, at least that I’m aware of,” Christiansen said. “The highest [count] was over 300. I don’t remember the exact number, but this last year [the count] was over 200.” 
Parcel 0712’s proximity to the largest-known congregation of sage grouse, a struggling species, isn’t the only superlative descriptor of its wildlife value. This parcel amid the sagebrush sea also completely overlaps the main thread of the longest mule deer migration corridor known to Wyoming and the world. 
Discovered by biologist Hall Sawyer relatively recently in 2011, the route is used by thousands of mule deer headed to summer in the Hoback Basin, with the record setters even venturing as far as eastern Idaho. Come winter, the animals are found in the Red Desert and lower reaches of the Green River Basin. To get to and from their seasonal ranges, these ungulates travel a 100-plus miles, passing through the Prospect Mountains along the foot of the Wind River Range and right through the middle of Parcel 0712.

Discussion is brewing in conservation circles about BLM’s proposed leasing of not just Parcel 0712, but tens of thousands of acres spread across five dozen parcels that intersect with Wyoming’s first three protected mule deer migration corridors. The lease auction set for June also could include tracts overlapping Wyoming’s first protected pronghorn corridor — a route that’s passed muster with state wildlife officials, but awaits a group of stakeholders and Gov. Mark Gordon’s approval. 
All of the oil and gas leases slated for a June 2026 auction are in the early stages of the BLM’s vetting and approval process. Currently, they’re being “scoped,” subjected to public scrutiny and could still be pulled and never offered. Comments on the proposed parcels can be submitted online and are due by Monday. If they do get leased, an entirely separate environmental review process would await before approval is granted to actually drill. 
Still, wildlife advocacy groups are questioning the wisdom of leasing the most vital sage grouse habitat remaining and areas in the middle of big game migration routes. 
“Are we really okay with potentially sacrificing some of our most important wildlife habitat?” asked Alec Underwood, conservation director for the Wyoming Outdoor Council. “What kind of message does that send to all those who value wildlife and future generations?”

But oil and gas companies that have fueled Wyoming’s economy and enabled the state to save and invest an extraordinary amount of money have a starkly different interpretation. 
“There’s no place that I’m going to say is a place that shouldn’t be leased,” said Steve Degenfelder, a land manager for Kirkwood Oil and Gas, which is the primary company expressing interest in drilling the Golden Triangle region. 
Degenfelder anticipates leases in the Golden Triangle will come with “extensive surface occupancy stipulations.” Those restrictions combined with modern drilling technology, he said, can help ensure that nesting sage grouse, migrating mule deer and other wildlife aren’t extensively harmed. 
“I’m confident that the BLM land managers and Game and Fish can work with the operator, whoever that is, to mitigate [wildlife impacts],” Degenfelder said.
Another well-known Wyomingite whose ranch is right across the Lander Cutoff from Parcel 0712 said he’d need to learn more before passing judgement on the prospects of leasing and drilling an area that others consider ecologically sacred. 
“Would I be supportive of anything they decided to do? Certainly not,” said Jim Magagna, a longtime livestock lobbyist. “But on the other hand, I’m very open minded about getting a better understanding of the development potential. What would it look like?”

Without digging into his files, Degenfelder wasn’t sure if Kirkwood specifically nominated Parcel 0712. But the Casper-based company has long shown an interest in Golden Triangle-area parcels and it’s one of the outfits that has been leasing ground there for years over the objections of conservation groups. The nearly 20,000 Golden Triangle acres slated for auction in June were nominated in 2021, Degenfelder said. The parcels were initially going to be offered in June 2022, but then a consortium of environmental groups led by The Wilderness Society sued and were successful.  
BLM’s proposal to lease the area again in 2025 is especially controversial because the standing federal land-use plan — the Biden-era Rock Springs Resource Management Plan — explicitly doesn’t allow it. Officials with the federal agency’s Wyoming office, who’ve been furloughed for weeks during the government shutdown, have been unreachable to explain the discrepancy, though notably, they’ve started the process of revising the current plan. 
Degenfelder, meanwhile, points to President Donald Trump’s “national energy emergency” declaration as an explanation for BLM proposing to lease an area designated as off limits.
“It was similar to a War Powers Act,” he said of the declaration. “That could very well be the reason why.”
Others remain skeptical of leasing in the Golden Triangle. Christiansen, the former Game and Fish sage grouse corridor, said he’ll be watching to see how his old employer, the state of Wyoming, responds to BLM’s proposal. 
“If the state chooses to support the lease sale, it puts public trust in state policies like the [sage grouse] executive order at risk, because they’re supporting an illegal action,” Christiansen said. “If we support actively disregarding the rule of law at the state level, the public can’t support or can’t trust state policy, either.” 
During the 2019 debate over oil and gas leasing in the Golden Triangle, state wildlife officials did not advocate for “no surface occupancy” stipulations, pointing toward the state’s grouse policy, which they deemed adequate. Likewise, Wyoming’s ungulate migration policy also doesn’t call for no-disturbance stipulations outside of “bottlenecks” — and there are none in that portion of the designated Sublette Mule Deer Migration and proposed Sublette Pronghorn Migration.

Although sage grouse were nowhere to be seen during WyoFile’s recent visit to Parcel 0712, that’s likely because the chicken-sized birds have reached the time of year when they are less dispersed, and instead concentrated in flocks that can number in the hundreds. 
“They’re gathering now in their winter flocks,” Christiansen said. “It’s harder to find a group, but when you find a group, it’s going to be a lot larger.”
They’ll stay in the area of Parcel 0712, the adjacent record-setting Divide Lek and in the surrounding reaches of the best sagebrush habitat left on Earth, which are all part of a “broad winter complex,” the biologist said. Then come next spring — a month or two before the BLM’s planned lease sale — they’ll start strutting.

As a powerful solar storm painted brilliant hues across Wyoming skies, people went searching for the perfect backdrop to catch the epic light show. Even backyards, streets and alleyways offered stunning views of the northern lights.
The post Intense aurora borealis streaked Wyoming’s night sky red appeared first on WyoFile .","The glowworm of headlights snaked toward Grand Teton National Park and the National Elk Refuge on Tuesday as people searched for the perfect backdrop to enjoy the epic light show above Jackson Hole. Even backyards, streets and alleyways offered stunning views of the northern lights, giving people a show from wherever they were standing. 
Astronomer and Wyoming Stargazing Executive Director Samuel Singer told WyoFile that the geomagnetic storm was forecast to be most active Wednesday evening, but nearly 100% cloud cover obscured the aurora. In contrast, Tuesday evening’s cloudless skies “surprisingly” rolled out the brilliant hues. The storm’s geomagnetic activity reached a planetary K-index (kp) of 8, with the scale running from 1 (calm) to 9 (most extreme), according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Space Weather Prediction Center.

Singer noted that while auroras peak around midnight, “when most people are in bed,” this celestial event peaked between 6 to 7 p.m. The early show, with more vivid colors than expected, prompted a rapid exchange of texts and phone calls, he said. 
“There were a ton of people just getting home from work and having dinner,” Singer said. “They looked outside and said, ‘Oh my God, look at that color.’”
Dubois resident Christina Botkin and her family watched the aurora from the comfort of their home. 
“Our neighborhood is at about 8,000 feet, and there’s hardly any light pollution, so we had an amazing view,” Botkin said. “It was the first time our kids had seen the northern lights, and they’ve been talking about it ever since.”
Wilson resident Kim Havel described her neighbors’ almost primal response to the cosmic scene, with people “howling like wolves around the neighborhood.” Kyle Haynam, a longtime Moose resident, said the park had almost as many headlights as northern lights. 
“I felt transported to Burning Man for a moment,” Haynam said. “There was a couple parked in our driveway, having what looked like a nice date with a bottle of wine as they enjoyed the show.”

Wilson resident Annabelle Reber headed out to Antelope Flats in Grand Teton National Park to get the ideal shot. She used the slow shutter feature on her cellphone to capture the colorful show over the Tetons. Awestruck aurora watchers crowded the pullouts along the highway, creating roadway conditions similar to bear jams. Reber even had to swerve around a man who suddenly ran across the road in front of her car, she told WyoFile. 
Jackson resident Ike Faust and his family joined the convoy of cars headed north, eventually finding a more remote location near Jackson Hole Golf and Tennis Club.
“In Wyoming, it was the biggest northern lights show that I’ve ever seen,” Faust said. “Even in Alaska, I have never seen that red.”
On the eastern edge of Teton Park in the tiny town of Kelly, Wendell Field described the experience as his first time standing under a red aurora borealis.

“Usually, there’s more green,” Field said. “Sometimes the colors dance like a curtain or like seaweed in the ocean, but the reds had more of a pulsating effect.”  
Singer explained how cosmic rays of red and green become visible to the naked eye. He said that when big explosions occur in the outer atmosphere of the sun, solar particles collide with Earth’s atmosphere. When the solar particles funnel toward the highest concentration of magnetism at the southern and northern poles, bands of colors sweep across the skies. 
Red auroras, according to NASA, are created when stronger solar storms push the interaction between oxygen atoms and solar particles to higher altitudes, typically above 150 miles. Green, which is more commonly seen, results from the geomagnetic exchange occurring at lower altitudes, approximately 62 to 186 miles. Other colors, including pink, blue, purple, orange and yellow can also streak the sky when various molecules react at different elevations.
Over the past couple of days, photos of the colors dancing above Wyoming have flooded social media channels. Jackson Hole filmmaker and writer Charlie Craighead said the lights were bright enough to illuminate the foreground, creating optimal photography conditions.   
“The auroras I’ve seen in the Arctic were really intense and focused, but here the colors seem to wash over the sky in big swaths that light up the whole landscape,” Craighead said. 
While photographs of the aurora can be breathtaking, Singer said nothing compares to being there during one of the “most miraculous wonders of nature.” 
“The difference between seeing a photograph of the northern lights and standing under the phenomenon is like the difference between seeing a photograph of the ocean and actually standing barefoot on a beach with the water hitting your ankles as you dig your toes into the sand,” Singer said.
With Tuesday’s cloudless skies, the northern lights could be seen over the Center for the Arts in downtown Jackson. (Karissa Akin)

Critics call it a crisis.,"Michelle Stroud, a family child care provider in Toms River, talks about a $30 million budget shortfall in the state child care assistance program during a news conference on Nov. 13, 2025, at the Statehouse in Trenton. (Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)Advocates are urging New Jersey lawmakers to cover a $30 million budget gap in a state-funded child care program for low-income working parents, saying the shortfall has had “devastating consequences” for families and providers alike.
The state’s child care assistance program quit accepting new applicants on Aug. 1 and raised copays for already-enrolled families after lawmakers in June passed a $58.8 billion budget that did not include enough money to cover the program’s total operating costs.
Those program changes forced some parents to quit their jobs or reduce their work hours because they couldn’t get assistance or afford the higher copays, and that, in turn, drove some providers to cut their hours or consider closing as their enrollment fell, according to a coalition of about 30 social justice advocates and labor unions.
The advocates sent a letter to Gov. Phil Murphy, Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill, and legislative leaders and gathered at the Statehouse Thursday to call on policymakers both to pony up the $30 million and to find a long-term funding solution that ensures child care is affordable and available for all who need it.
“New Jersey can’t claim to be the state that values working families if it’s willing to balance the budget on the backs of working families,” said Jason Ajiake, political director of labor union SEIU United Healthcare Workers East.
Michelle Stroud, a family child care provider in Toms River, said she has not passed the higher copays on to families whose children are in her care. Under the program, parents pay their share directly to the provider, while the program pays the provider for the rest of the cost of care. Both the copay and the subsidy rate are based on several factors, including a family’s size and income and the kind of care.
“I know how hard it is, so I take the hit instead of my parents,” Stroud said. “No one can afford this. Parents can’t afford the out-of-pocket cost. We can’t afford to give these discounts. Nobody wins.”
Murphy’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment.
The program serves about 70,000 children from infancy to age 13 (or up to 19, for special-needs children) across the state, according to the state Department of Human Services. Families with incomes up to 200% of the federal poverty level qualify for assistance; for a family of three, that’s about $53,000 a year.
“For many of our most vulnerable families, this program is the only path to affordable child care,” said Winifred Smith-Jenkins, director of early learning policy and advocacy of Advocates for Children of New Jersey.
The program got almost $80 million in additional funding in this year’s budget. But Sarah Adelman, the human services commissioner, testified during a May budget hearing that the allocation still would leave a $25 to $30 million budget gap, due to climbing enrollment and unfunded federal policy changes, such as a measure requiring the state to make enrollment-based payments before service is provided. She warned then that the department would have to freeze new applications and hike copays if the budget gap was not closed.
In their letter, advocates described the budget shortfall as a crisis that “demands a fundamental shift in how we value child care.”
“Child care is not a luxury; it is the workforce behind the workforce. It is critical public infrastructure, as essential to a functioning economy as roads and bridges. It is time to treat it and fund it as such,” they wrote.
Advocates noted that the rising costs of housing, health care, utilities, and groceries have dominated headlines this year, but child care costs have created “another affordability crisis.” A September brief by the Rutgers Child Care Research Collaborative found that 76% of New Jersey children under 5 are in non-parental care, with half of those families spending more than 7% of their annual income on child care (that’s the affordability threshold under federal guidelines).
The budget shortfall and program cuts it caused worsen inequities, because women of color are disproportionately represented among both parents and providers who rely on the program, advocates said.
“This is a worker issue, it’s a woman’s issue, it is a social justice issue, a racial justice issue,” said Trina Scordo, executive director of New Jersey Communities United.
Scordo applauded states that have “figured this out,” including New Mexico, which became the first state in the nation to offer free, universal child care this month.
“We’re a blue state. We are a wealthy state. That means we have the resources to figure this out,” Scordo said. “We can do this. It is not impossible. But it takes morality and courage.”
Two state legislators joined advocates at the Statehouse Thursday to cheer the cause. Sens. Teresa Ruiz (D-Essex) and Angela McKnight (D-Hudson) both have introduced bills to address sagging child care funding.

McKnight’s bill, which she introduced last month with Sen. Britnee Timberlake (D-Essex), would allocate $28 million to cover the program’s gap. It has no Assembly companion and awaits a committee hearing in the Senate.
Ruiz, who’s both a working mother and a former preschool teacher, called child care “a cornerstone of my policy agenda since before I got elected.” She has seven pending bills that would bolster child care in New Jersey, including one that would expand the income eligibility for child care assistance. That does have an Assembly companion, but neither chamber has yet advanced the bill.

A proposal to prohibit using SNAP to purchase sugar, spices and condiments reveals the far right's appetite for cruelty, writes guest columnist Lindsey Hanlon.
The post Meat loves salt, but does the Freedom Caucus love Wyoming? appeared first on WyoFile .","Let me tell you a story. There is an English fairy tale called Cap O’ Rushes that is strangely relevant to the most recent Freedom Caucus attempt to raise the bar on cruelty. In the tale, a wealthy man asks his three daughters how much they love him. The oldest two are extravagant in their praise, saying they love him more than life and more than all the world. The youngest tells him that she loves him “as meat loves salt.” Feeling insulted by the simplicity of her answer, the father kicks her out. 

Opinion

The usual fairytale hijinks follow, and in the climax, the daughter marries the prince and invites her father to the wedding without revealing her identity. For the wedding banquet, the new princess orders every dish made without salt. When they get to the meat course, it is so tasteless and disgusting that the guests can’t eat it. The father bursts out crying, realizing that “as meat loves salt” was a perfect encapsulation of his daughter’s love. Meat without salt is hard to eat, let alone enjoy. It needs salt to be a complete meal, just as the daughter needed her father to feel complete. (It all ends happily, don’t worry.) 
I thought about this fairytale as I read that Rep. Rachel Rodriguez-Williams and the majority of the Joint Labor, Health, and Social Services Committee are willing to spend up to $3.1 million to prohibit Supplementary Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, from covering a variety of foods — among them, salt. 
Salt, and many of the other items proposed to be off limits, like sugar, spices and condiments, are not “accessory foods,” as they were described in the meeting. They are what make food palatable. No human is a perfect automaton, able to persist forever on bland, perfectly balanced meals. We need a little seasoning. Food needs to nourish our souls as well as our bodies.
And what if we (as the Freedom Caucus folks so frequently encourage us to do while clutching their pearls) think of the children? After all, as we learned when Republicans froze SNAP benefits — in the month of Thanksgiving despite a $6 billion emergency fund — 44% of Wyoming’s SNAP beneficiaries are children. I’ve never met a child who didn’t go through at least one phase where a condiment was a major food group. You know the one where every essential food crucial to nutrition — vegetables, protein, even fruits and carbs — has to swim in an ocean of ranch or ketchup before the child even thinks about eating it. Rep. Rodriguez-Williams might think she is saying, let them eat carrots, but what she is really saying is that she doesn’t think enough about how people eat at all.
The Supplementary Nutrition Assistance Program is, as its name suggests, meant to be supplementary. It’s possible that these legislators are picturing SNAP beneficiaries being able to use the money to “splurge” on things that would otherwise be beyond their means, like fruit, vegetables, and, of course, meat. But the reality is that for many beneficiaries, SNAP isn’t supplemental — it IS their food budget. With everything costing more, from medical care to housing and utilities, many families find themselves without a spot in their budget for food. There is no other pool of money for folks to use to get truly scandalous items, like mustard. Or, God forbid, the occasional candy bar. And with the Trump administration ballooning inflation at a rapid pace, the money provided by SNAP is already covering less and less, and folks are already being forced to make hard decisions about what to get. Why do we need to suck all the joy out of eating on top of these hardships? 
Meat loving salt is not just a fairytale or a metaphor. It is a physical reality of the meat of our bodies. A lack of sodium can lead to a condition called “hyponatremia,” which is a really good word to play in Hangman that means the body can’t regulate water well. Cells, including brain cells, start to swell. In mild cases, this leads to nausea, headaches and confusion. In “moderate” cases, muscles stop functioning correctly — they become weak, they spasm or they seize up in agonizing cramps. In more serious cases, it can lead to seizures or a coma. In the most serious cases, it results in death.
And if that isn’t a perfect reflection of the Freedom Caucus operating strategy, I don’t know what is. It’s members’ MO to cut Wyomingites off from vital resources that the Freedom Caucus considers “luxuries” and not realize their mistake until it results in pain or death for the people they claim to represent. Or worse, the Freedom Caucus members know those consequences will come and they cut off the resource anyway. 
Rachel Rodriguez-Williams and the Freedom Caucus do not love the people of Wyoming as meat loves salt, and it shows. With them in power, we will never get our happily ever after.

The projected deficit has increased from a month ago, when the state budget was projected to end the fiscal year with a $56.6 million deficit, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
Overall, state revenues have come in below forecasts in three out of the first four months of the current fiscal year, state records show. 
According to the November edition of the General Fund Budget Monitor report published by the nonpartisan Idaho Legislative Services Office on Wednesday, total state revenue collections have come in $103.1 million, or 5.8%, less than the revised forecast issued by the Idaho Division of Financial Management. In addition to revenues coming in below budget projections, cumulative revenues have also come in $59.5 million, or 3.4%, below the actual revenue collections compared to the same time period last year, according to the General Fund Budget Monitor. 
When it comes to the bottom line, the state general fund is projected to end the current fiscal year 2026 on June 30 with a budget deficit of $58.3 million.
In interviews Thursday, two prominent legislators from two different political parties presented two very different assessments of the budget situation.

“It keeps me up at night,” said House Minority Leader Ilana Rubel, D-Boise. “I cannot underscore enough how dire the situation we are facing is.”
Rubel said 3% budget cuts ordered by Gov. Brad Little this summer are already causing harm to Idaho’s elderly, disabled and low income families. She predicted more cuts will be forthcoming, calling it “a catastrophe.”
 Idaho budget committee co-chair says Idaho won’t see a budget deficit

On the other hand, Rep. Wendy Horman, an Idaho Falls Republican who co-chairs the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, said the latest monthly budget reports show Idaho’s economy is healthy. She pointed out the state has record levels of savings accounts and cash reserves and said the largest tax cuts in state history are going to provide real benefits to Idahoans.
“We’re coming off the largest tax cut in state history and individual income tax collections are still up,” Horman said. 
“I am looking at the trends now, and we have one month up and three months under revenue forecasts, but the numbers are small. They are not off by hundreds of millions. By no stretch is revenue in a free fall – it isn’t.”

Horman said one revenue source – corporate income tax collections – are down by $58.3 million. That number is identical to the projected deficit of $58.3 million. 
“You can explain the entire variance simply with corporate income tax numbers,” Horman said. 
 Idaho legislators are required to pass a balanced budget

The Idaho Constitution requires the state to have a balanced budget and prohibits the state from spending more money than the amount of revenue that is collected.
In simple terms, revenue is the amount of money the state takes in. Idaho’s largest sources of revenue are taxes, specifically individual income taxes, sales taxes and corporate income taxes.
The latest revenue report covers the first four months of the 2026 fiscal year.
“We will set a balanced budget,” Horman told the Sun on Thursday.  “The constitution requires it. I am personally committed to it. And I anticipate we will leave as large of a cash balance as we can to carry over into next year to guard against unforeseen circumstances. It was a wise decision to do it last year. And it will be a wise decision to do it again next year while still maintaining the core functions of government.”
 Projected budget deficit does not include impact of President Trump’s tax cuts

The projected budget deficit does not include the cost of paying for more than $100 million in supplemental funding requests the Idaho Legislature will consider in 2026. The projected deficit also does not include the cost of conforming to tax changes included in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that President Donald Trump signed into law this summer.

The nonprofit Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy released a report Nov. 6 estimating that conforming to the personal and corporate tax changes in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act could reduce Idaho revenue by an additional $284.4 million.
“Idaho’s lawmakers should ensure that our state revenue is protected to provide the public services that Idahoans rely on — like our education system, roads, and public safety,” said May Roberts, policy analyst for the Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy. “Idaho’s budget should not take a hit to fund corporate tax breaks that primarily benefit businesses in other states.”
 Big budget decisions await Idaho Legislature in 2026

During meetings this month at the Idaho State Capitol, leaders of the Idaho Legislature’s Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, or JFAC, vowed that the Legislature will intervene to ensure the state ends the fiscal year with a balanced budget. 
JFAC is a powerful legislative committee that sets all of the budgets for every state agency and department. 
Horman emphasized that Idaho is not now in a budget deficit, and the deficit is a projected forecast. What matters, she said, is where the budget actually stands when the 2026 fiscal year ends. 
Idaho runs on a fiscal year calendar that begins July 1 and ends June 30. That means that the current fiscal year 2026 ends June 30. 
The latest budget documents released by the state cover the months of July through October, representing one-third of the full fiscal year. 
The state’s projected revenue shortfalls are not limited to the current fiscal year. The gap between revenue projections and requested budget expenditures is projected to widen during the upcoming 2027 and 2028 fiscal years, according to budget documents presented to the Legislature’s budget committee earlier this month.  
One budget scenario that state staffers presented to JFAC last week showed an estimated budget deficit of $555.2 million – more than half of a billion dollars – for fiscal year 2027. 
Horman said that $555 million figure is just a projection and said the Idaho Legislature has never agreed to fund everything that the state agencies requested. 
The revenue shortfall is occurring after the Republican-controlled Legislature reduced state revenues by more than $450 million during the 2025 legislative session to pay for tax cuts and a new education tax credit that reimburses families for nonpublic school education expenses, including tuition at private, religious schools.
“Prior budget crises we have faced were due to the housing crisis in 2008 that we had to react to,” Senate Minority Leader Melissa Wintrow, D-Boise, said in a text message to the Idaho Capital Sun last week. “This one is a direct result of the Legislature setting a questionable revenue projection in order to do tax cuts.”
Gov. Little sounded public warnings during the 2025 legislative session about the impact of revenue reductions on the budget. 
During a Feb. 25 breakfast with reporters, Little said he was not very happy about the reductions in state revenue.
“If I would have thought we could do $450 (million), I would have proposed $450 (million),” Little told reporters Feb. 25.
In contrast to the $450 million worth of revenue reductions, Little proposed $100 in tax cuts and another $50 million for private school education initiatives in his January 2025 State of the State address. 
Despite his concern with the revenue reductions, Little did sign each of the tax cuts and the new private school education tax credit into law earlier this year. 
The 2025 legislative session begins Jan. 12 at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)The two top lawmakers in Tennessee’s House and Senate disagree with President Donald Trump’s decision to pardon former House Speaker Glen Casada and his ex-chief of staff on political corruption convictions.
Lt. Gov. Randy McNally, who serves as Senate speaker, said Thursday if he had been advising the president, he would have told him not to issue the pardons for Casada and staffer Cade Cothren.
“I just feel it was not correct,” McNally said.
Sexton reportedly told WBIR-TV in Knoxville the pair shouldn’t have been pardoned after being found guilty on multiple charges.
Despite some claims the case was pushed by the Biden administration, Sexton said the FBI started investigating Casada and Cothren during Trump’s first administration and then the Justice Department decided to go to trial this spring after Trump’s second term began. 
“That was their decision based on the evidence,” Sexton told WBIR-TV. “And then you had a Trump judge who presided over the case in Nashville.”
U.S. District Court Judge Eli Richardson, a former FBI agent and assistant U.S. attorney, adjudicated the case and sentenced Casada to 36 months in prison and ordered him to pay a $30,000 fine for his role in a fraud and kickback scheme. Richardson sentenced Cothren to 30 months and ordered him to pay a $25,000 fine.
Trump pardons former Tennessee Speaker Casada, ex-chief of staff

Both escaped punishment after Trump signed pardons late last week.
Despite the potential for presidential pardons, Sexton told WBIR his office will keep trying to get rid of corruption.
“We’re not going to turn a blind eye to it,” Sexton said.
Casada and Cothren were convicted of setting up a secret company called Phoenix Solutions that tapped into the state’s postage and printing program that provides House members $3,000 a year for constituent mailers. Casada and former Rep. Robin Smith, who pleaded guilty and testified against the pair, steered lawmakers’ business to Phoenix Solutions, which was secretly run by Cothren with the front name of “Matthew Phoenix.”
Smith was recently sentenced to eight months for her role in the scheme. She is seeking a presidential pardon according to the Chattanooga Times Free Press.
Casada and Smith concealed Cothren’s identity in the scheme because they felt lawmakers wouldn’t do business with their company if they knew the former chief of staff was involved. He resigned his post amid a racist and sexist texting scandal that also engulfed Casada.
The whole deal involved only about $52,000, but the company also tapped the House Republican Party for work exceeding $100,000.

The protest was one of over 1,000 planned across the country. (Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)Colorado should aim to add 40,000 “attainable” owner-occupied homes and decrease costs for 100,000 renters by 2035, Attorney General Phil Weiser said Thursday, as his campaign for governor rolled out a housing platform he said would cater to the needs of all Coloradans.
“I want Coloradans to know that I am confronting this challenge with a sense of urgency, seriousness, and creativity, bringing bold leadership that will focus on this problem,” Weiser told Newsline an interview. “Whoever you are, a renter, you own your own home, you live in the urban areas, rural areas, our platform is comprehensive and addresses across the board. I’m the only candidate who can say that.”
Weiser’s proposed policies to increase housing stock and affordability in Colorado include speeding up construction permitting processes, streamlining government housing programs, supporting first-time home buyers and preserving existing affordable housing units for renters.

“When I talk to Coloradans, affordability, particularly with regard to housing, is often the first topic on their minds,” Weiser said. “It’s particularly a concern for key professionals, like teachers, law enforcement officers, and nurses who are having a harder time affording to live in communities where they work.”
If elected, Weiser would appoint a cabinet-level chief housing officer and create a state housing innovation team that would coordinate all state housing efforts. Currently, multiple state agencies work on housing policy, which Weiser said makes it “not always as coordinated or as focused.” For a large priority like housing, Weiser said it’s important to have a point person to lead and “help drive the sorts of outcomes we want.”
A housing innovation team would look for solutions that have worked in other cities and states and determine if any could work in Colorado. An example of that work could include looking at buildings school districts no longer use as an opportunity for employee housing. He also said that legislation to lower permitting fees for affordable housing projects, which are currently the same as fees for multi-million dollar homes, could incentivize more affordable construction.
He also wants to work against corporate landlord abuses, including junk fees and rent-setting algorithms, which he challenged as attorney general. The Colorado Legislature passed a bill banning the practice, but Colorado Gov. Jared Polis vetoed it. Weiser said he would have signed the bill into law, adding that his track record and expertise as attorney general show a “demonstrated commitment to standing up for consumers,” and he’d aim to continue that work as governor in collaboration with the next attorney general.
Weiser is running against U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet for the Democratic nomination for Colorado governor. Bennet announced his housing platform in September. Whoever wins the Democratic primary in June 2026 will likely be favored to win the general election. Colorado hasn’t had a Republican governor since Gov. Bill Owens left office after the 2006 election. 
Most of the state’s housing funds come from Proposition 123, a measure Colorado voters approved in 2022 that dedicates an additional $300 million annually to the state’s affordable housing efforts. It protects the additional revenue by exempting the funds from the annual limits set by the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights, the 1992 state constitutional amendment that places restrictions on Colorado’s tax and spending levels.
The Colorado Legislature in recent years has passed several laws reforming land use policies in the state to encourage additional housing construction. That includes laws to streamline modular and manufactured housing, expand the parts of the state where accessory dwelling units are universally allowed, incentivize denser housing around transit hubs, and reduce litigation risks for construction defect claims. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis has made “More Housing Now” a key goal throughout his second term as governor.  
Demographers estimate Colorado needs about 100,000 more units to meet the housing demand in the state.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Backing for Republican favorite Matt Van Epps and Democratic nominee Rep. Aftyn Behn is kicking into high gear in the special election for Tennessee’s 7th Congressional District seat as the Cook Political Report sees a shift in the political landscape.
The independent, nonpartisan group moved the district to “lean Republican” from “solid Republican” this week, mainly because of an 75% decrease in GOP turnout. Democrats, in contrast, are motivated to cast ballots in early voting, according to the report.
Van Epps is trying to counter by holding a tele-town hall Thursday with President Donald Trump, whose endorsement pushed him to victory in the Republican primary.
As voters started heading to the polls this week, a Florida-based political action committee called Engage, Y’all also spent more than $64,000 supporting Behn with Facebook posts, one about the importance of the race in changing the politics in Washington, D.C., where Republicans control Congress and the White House. 

In another post, the group accused Van Epps of supporting a law that increases health insurance and grocery costs while endangering nursing homes and causing more than 200,000 people to lose their health insurance.
The Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Votes Action PAC spent nearly $12,500 canvassing for Behn and putting out literature.
Van Epps, in contrast, has gotten only one independent expenditure in his favor, $31,000 from Special Operations for America, since he won the Republican primary in early October.
It could be that outside groups aren’t overly concerned yet about Van Epps, former General Services commissioner for Gov. Bill Lee, losing to Behn in a gerrymandered red district.
Yet former U.S. Rep. Mark Green, whose seat they are vying to fill, complained about the rejiggered 7th District because even though it stretches from the Alabama line to Clarksville, it takes in western Davidson County — a reliably blue area — which could come back to haunt Republicans.
Van Epps, a former Army helicopter pilot, last week released his first ad of the general election campaign, saying he didn’t risk his life for America “just to watch career politicians wreck it.” In the new spot, he said his next “mission” is to lower prices, reduce health-care costs and bring in jobs. 

It’s a far cry from the negative ad he directed at Behn when she bragged about going after ICE agents during a sweep for immigrants in South Nashville this year.
After casting an early vote Wednesday morning in Nashville, Van Epps spoke briefly to reporters, telling them he supports House Speaker Mike Johnson’s approach on handling the Epstein files, more or less slow-walking them through Congress.
Behn also unveiled her first campaign ad last week with a man riding a mechanical bull in slow motion and saying Washington’s system is “rigged” to help the rich with tax breaks and to bury the Epstein files. As the bull speeds up, she says regular folks get a “rough ride” because of tariffs and rising health insurance costs.
The East Nashville political organizer was supposed to have a big shindig last week with firebrand U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas. Crockett canceled at the last minute due to what her office called scheduling issues, but Behn carried on with state Sen. Charlane Oliver and Crockett dialing in.
Behn is enjoying a bit of a bounce caused by Democrats’ election wins in Virginia, New York and New Jersey a week ago. Democratic National Committee chair Ken Martin canvassed with her last weekend.

The question is whether those can translate to Tennessee, where Van Epps has a built-in advantage. He got the endorsement of Tennessee Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson, who put out a Facebook call for support.
It remains to be seen whether he will need independent expenditures from the School Freedom Fund, which backed him in the primary with more than $62,600 as he handily defeated a cast of Republicans.
One interesting note is that U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, who refused to mention her last opponent, state Rep. Gloria Johnson of Knoxville, is blasting Behn constantly. Blackburn said in posts on X, formerly Twitter, that Behn and New York mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, a Democratic socialist and Muslim, are “cut from the same cloth” and want to return to Soviet-era policies. She also called Behn the “AOC of Tennessee,” saying she was dressing up on Halloween as U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat constantly targeted by Republicans for liberal stances.
Typically, it’s bad form to mention an opponent’s name because it lends credibility to their candidacy. In Tennessee it would typically take a lot of mentions, but some folks are starting to sweat.
Staying in the saddle?
Lt. Gov. Randy McNally, despite a series of foot surgeries and maladies, sounds like he’s gearing up for another campaign to serve in the District 5 Senate seat representing Anderson, Knox and Loudon counties.
McNally said Thursday, “I’ll probably make that decision a little later, but I fully planned on it.”
The Oak Ridge Republican is Tennessee’s longest-serving lawmaker. He won election to the House in 1978 and served four terms before capturing the Senate seat in 1986. He succeeded Ron Ramsey as Senate speaker and lieutenant governor in January 2017.

Amid talk that he might step away from the legislature, some senators have been jockeying for position to win the speakership for two years, especially after revelations that McNally posted comments next to risque photos on young gay men’s Instagram sites. He retained the speakership in a secret 19-7 vote in March 2023.
In the hunt early
Retired Tennessee Highway Patrol Capt. Mark Proctor is running as a Democrat for the 59th District House seat to be vacated by Rep. Caleb Hemmer.
Proctor worked for more than 25 years in the department, leading divisions on public safety, research and planning and training, in addition to protecting four governors.
“Serving and protecting is in my DNA,” Proctor said in a release. “After 25 years in law enforcement, my mission turned even more to raising my two daughters, volunteering in their schools, and running a small business. Now, I’m ready to serve and protect again — this time in the state legislature.”
He said he will concentrate on creating safer, stronger communities, giving families a boost and ensuring access to good schools, affordable health care and economic opportunities.
The district includes South Nashville, Forest Hills, Oak Hill and Brentwood.
Eviction ruling
Republican state Sen. Kerry Roberts is being forced out of a historic Springfield home after a judge ruled in favor of a bank that called in a $4.5 million note, the Tennessee Journal reported.
Sumner County Judge Kee Bryant-McCormick made the ruling in October, despite saying she felt Knoxville-based Apex Bank took advantage of Roberts and his wife after they borrowed the money to transform the 1860s-era home into a wedding venue with pools and gardens. They used the home and Airbnb parcels for collateral.
The dispute appears to center on the maturity date of the loan, which was originally to be October 2027. Apex moved it to January 2024, then extended it to March and May.
The senator, who is represented by state Rep. Gino Bulso, contended sluggish release of funds by the bank led to construction delays and his requests for extensions. But just as the project was nearing completion and he started to schedule weddings, he received a default notice, according to the report, and after foreclosing on the property, Apex sold it to another party for $5 million.
Roberts, who filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in federal court last year, accused the bank of “predatory lending” and said he and his wife, Dianne, were heartbroken.
“It’s the place where I wanted to be buried,” he told the publication.
The bank denied the allegation and accused Roberts of trying to use his position as a senator to “intimidate judicial officials and spread misinformation.”
Roberts said he plans to appeal the ruling and file a lawsuit in Circuit Court.
No debating this one
Rutherford County Mayor Joe Carr was hospitalized this week at Vanderbilt trauma center with multiple injuries sustained while he and his son were training horses at his Lascassas farm in Rutherford County.
He sustained nine broken ribs, a lacerated liver and semi-collapsed lung in the incident. He was taken to a hospital in Murfreesboro (where he probably had to wait forever) before being transferred to Vanderbilt.

“This is the first time that I have spent the night in the hospital in 65 years,” Carr said. “I’m glad it was from something I love.”
A press release said both horses they were training are fine.
What I’m trying to figure out is how he got this far without spending one night in a hospital. I recall sitting up all night in the Stones River Hospital emergency room in Murfreesboro when my mother got sick. Getting old is tough, mayor.

Seeds of hope are taking root in East Kinston, one of North Carolina’s poorest zip codes.
Kinston Teens, a youth-led nonprofit organization founded in 2014, has launched an ambitious plan to resurrect a community wracked by crime, generational poverty, sparse public investment and nearly decades-old natural disasters from which it has yet to fully recover.

Chris Suggs, 25, an East Kinston native and city councilman, founded the nonprofit when he was 14.  He said he was driven to do so by gun violence involving youth and gangs that had Kinston residents living in fear of being caught in the crossfire.
The gun violence sparked conversations and outrage among adults, but no one talked to the youth most affected by it, Suggs said. He was a ninth grader at Kinston High School at the time.
“All throughout the year [2014], we were having these issues of gun violence involving young people,” Suggs said, “our peers in school either shooting someone or getting shot.”
 A report released around that time by the UNC Center for Civil Rights, The State of Exclusion: Lenoir County, N.C.: An In-depth Analysis of the Legacy of Segregated Communities, was eye-opening, Suggs said. 
“The data showed us that the East Kinston neighborhood where so many of our volunteers and the young people impacted by gun violence lived had been ranked the No. 1 most economically distressed census tract in the entire state of North Carolina,” he said.
Three years after he launched Kinston Teens, Suggs, who graduated high school a year early, headed west to UNC Chapel Hill where he earned a political science degree. He served as senior class president and also started a nonprofit on campus.
Despite being advised by his parents and other relatives to move on from Kinston and make a better life elsewhere, Suggs returned home shortly after graduating from UNC Chapel Hill in 2021, and was elected to the Kinston City Council, hoping to make a difference. At the time, Suggs was the youngest elected official in the state.  
“I was born and raised in the most economically distressed neighborhood in our state, and then spent four years in Orange County, one of the wealthiest zip codes in North Carolina,” Suggs said. “I got to see the glaring disparity in what’s possible when you have a city and county government in Chapel Hill and Orange County that will lead the way, that put those catalytic public investments into housing and affordability and additional assets in food and public health.”
Suggs, who’s been a vocal critic of the lack of public investment in East Kinston, did not seek reelection, and his term on the city council will end next month. He believes his time is better spent focusing on the neighborhood he believes has been overlooked. 
“We [Kinston Teens] have been leading this work as an organization for 11 years, but particularly with a focus on East Kinston for almost seven years now,” Suggs said, “and there still hasn’t been a significant investment in either attention or money from local government officials here in Kinston.”
To avoid conflicts of interest, Suggs said, he’s been reluctant to ask for funding or support from colleagues, but expects that to change after he leaves the city council. His organization runs on grants and private donations.
Betting on the future
At the center of the fledgling renewal in East Kinston is the old abandoned and decaying Lewis School, which the nonprofit recently purchased for just under $17,000.

Suggs said there are no plans yet for the aging school building, but future uses could include housing, office space and community meeting space..
“We’ve started having some conversations about the possibilities for using the space,” Suggs said. “The classrooms, I think, are perfect sizes to be potentially reimagined as apartment homes and there’s such a need for housing and affordable housing here in Kinston.”
It’s not the first empty building he’s bought. When he was 17, Suggs used $850 in donations to buy an abandoned house that he transformed into the East Kinston Neighborhood Hub. It now provides community members with emergency resources, digital access, food support and civic programming. He’s also bought and refurbished a former church across the street from that house that serves as meeting space and is used for other activities such as game night.   
Buying the school, Suggs explained, was a strategic move that gives the neighborhood a say in what happens in East Kinston.

“We don’t want our property swallowed up by gentrification or outside investments,” Suggs said. “We want people right here in the neighborhood, in the local community, to be able to have our hands on those properties to stop displacement,” Suggs said, “and to make sure any development that happens in East Kinston works for us and not against us.”
While the community is “open and receptive” to talking to potential investors and developers, they must be willing to work with the community, Suggs said.
“When the opportunity presents itself for us to develop housing or an outside investor to come in and want to develop housing, we could say these are the terms and conditions that our neighborhood wants to see met,” Suggs said. “This is the percentage of housing, for example, that we want to be below the median income level for people who are families with young kids or for ill members of our community or people struggling to get back onto their feet.”

Lenoir County Commissioner Preston Harris, a retired educator who taught at Lewis School in the 1990s, said Suggs could use the building to house Kinston Teens’ current initiatives and to provide housing. 
“Two of our existing schools from the past have been transformed into senior apartments, and the other one is pretty much a section eight [apartment complex],” Harris explained, making it clear that he was speaking as a private citizen. “So those are possibilities.”
Harris said Kinston Teens is eligible for county grant opportunities to help fund improvement initiatives in East Kinston, although the nonprofit would have to compete with others for funding.
“We know that he’s [Suggs] doing great work with Kinston Teens,” Harris said. “They currently have renovated a couple of houses in that immediate community that have been dilapidated and some places that have been abandoned. We do see some private people coming into those houses and doing some work with them and getting them to the point where people want to move back into that area.”
Kinston is one of the poorest cities in the state. According to the U.S. Census data, 28.9% of the population live below the poverty line, which is more than double the 12.5% who live below the poverty line across the state, and the 12.4% who do nationally. 
In 2023, Kinston’s median household income was $35,250, while North Carolina’s was approximately $70,800. That means Kinston’s median household income is about half of the state median.

Theon Hardy, 89, a retired educator has lived in East Kinston all but about five years of her life, while she taught school in Henderson, N.C., after graduating from Johnson C. Smith University in Charlotte in 1958.
Hardy said she was determined not to return home after graduating, but eventually did to care for aging parents. She still lives in the family home her father bought in the 1940s. She is proud of the single-story cottage-style home with its manicured yard that immediately stands out in a community where there is much blight.  
Hardy remembers when the streets of East Kinston were unpaved and when her family lived across the street from the city’s first Black policeman.
“I was going to get married and move out of the neighborhood and all, but I stayed here and kept making repairs to the roof and windows, and added on the den and stuff like that,” Hardy said. “So, why move, you know, unless I could find somebody to come and take me away, and that never happened.”
Hardy is excited about the current effort to revitalize East Kinston.
“Anybody my age that has seen teens gravitate to the good and not so good sometimes, I just feel proud to see somebody who shares interests in them and helps them to appreciate the neighborhood that they live in,” Hardy said. “It brings a smile and my jaws are rather tired, not from talking but from smiling.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSCN0851-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-11-14 06:58:00.148091

Many of the arrests made since the Memphis Safe Task Force began its work have been for traffic violations and drug charges, despite its stated focus on violent crime, according to new data shared with MLK50: Justice Through Journalism.
“This is supposed to be a ‘Make Memphis Safe Task Force,’ and really what it is, is a ‘Make Memphis Drive the Speed Limit Task Force,’” said General Sessions Court Clerk Tami Sawyer, whose office will make the data public through a new dashboard on Thursday.
So far, there hasn’t been an influx of new cases involving violent crimes, said Jonathan Bennett, associate director of the University of Memphis’ Center for Community Research and Evaluation. Bennett worked on the dashboard with Vishant Shah, chief data and analytics officer at the clerk’s office.
“The data shows there is an increase in traffic stop-related and narcotics arrests. Felony and misdemeanor arrests remain about 50/50,” Bennett said.
Currently, the dashboard only includes arrests leading to new cases, although the clerk’s office plans to add warrant data in the near future. Arrests stemming from pre-existing warrants are “likely a key focus of the task force’s efforts with respect to violent offenders,” Bennett said. The task force said Sunday that more than 1,000 of its 2,342 arrests were on preexisting warrants, but how many of those are for violent crimes remains unclear.










This is supposed to be a ‘Make Memphis Safe Task Force,’ and really what it is, is a ‘Make Memphis Drive the Speed Limit Task Force.


– Shelby County General Sessions Court Clerk Tami Sawyer


The Shelby County General Sessions Court’s new dashboard will live on shelbygeneralsessions.com, and will be updated weekly. The dashboard reflects what’s happening in Shelby County’s criminal justice system, including jail and court operations, amid the surge in policing from President Donald Trump’s Memphis Safe Task Force.
Sawyer said publishing the dashboard is a part of her office’s goal to be more transparent — especially since the U.S. Marshal’s Office, which oversees the task force, stopped reporting some information.
The data indicates that the county’s jails are being crowded with people arrested for narcotics- or traffic-related charges, Sawyer said. The two charges are often interconnected. For example, a highway patrol officer may pull someone over for speeding but also charge them with a drug-related offense if the officer finds marijuana in the vehicle.
“We already know the jail can’t hold the amount of people that are being detained,” she said. “We know intake can’t hold the amount of people that are being brought in every day. And while some of those arrest numbers have tapered off a bit, we can breathe today, (but) this weekend anything could change.”

According to the September jail report card, the downtown jail is overcapacity, holding 2,804 men. The report card showed 324 women in Jail East, which is near capacity.
The dashboard also shows misdemeanor citations, which officers can choose to issue instead of arresting people who they charge with misdemeanors. However, Shelby County is currently 70 to 80 days behind on digitizing Tennessee Highway Patrol tickets, so the data is incomplete, Sawyer said. As a result, there is currently no way to gauge how the task force is affecting those citations.
Because the highway patrol issues paper tickets to Memphis drivers and delivers hard copies of those tickets to the court, staff must enter each citation line-by-line into the county’s online system. Sometimes, the citations are difficult to read, causing additional delays, Sawyer said. People can’t pay their fines until the tickets have been entered into the system, she said.
“There’s no standard of how (citations are) written. Some of them are on printouts. Some are handwritten. If it got wet, if it’s been torn (or) crumpled up, that’s how they’re coming to us,” Sawyer said.
Sawyer’s staff had been reading and manually processing 1,500 citations per week since the highway patrol began its surge of enforcement in Memphis in June, she said. That pace has slowed since her office depleted its overtime budget trying to decrease the backlog, Sawyer said.
Right now, Shelby County is the only county in the state that inputs highway patrol citations manually, a process that predates Sawyer’s tenure as clerk. Other counties use the Tennessee Integrated Traffic Analysis Network, called TITAN for short, a statewide database of all traffic-related reports submitted by law enforcement agencies across the state, including the highway patrol. With this system, citations are uploaded online and available within the same day, she said.
Sawyer said Shelby County will begin using TITAN in mid-December, with no additional cost to the county or taxpayers because the system is free to use, Sawyer said. “TITAN should have been in play before I was elected,” she said. The database launched in 2008.
Once TITAN is implemented, the county will explore how artificial intelligence can be used to quickly input handwritten and printed citations online in order to clear the backlog, Sawyer said.
“Technology was not a priority for this office in previous generations,” she said. “I’m trying to update this office from 1975.”
The arrest data dashboard was originally created for the “Inter-Agency Justice and Operations Work Group,” composed of Shelby County government officials. The group first convened in September, when the criminal justice system saw “chaos” and disruption from the expected influx of task force activity, Sawyer said. The group’s goal is to coordinate and streamline criminal justice system operations.
Members of the group include county judges, representatives from the district attorney’s office, staff from the public defender’s office, the Shelby County Sheriff’s Office, judicial commissioners and a county commissioner. Some City of Memphis officials were invited but declined to participate, Sawyer said.
“One of the biggest detriments to people’s civil rights and safety is the fact that we have this slog in operations that’s due to us operating in silos and not working together to advance technology,” Sawyer said. “The surge doesn’t help. (It) has really escalated the inefficiencies.”",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/251028-FletcherCreek-0066-scaled.jpg-1024x683.webp,,,2025-11-14 06:58:00.148091

(Hayley Harding / Votebeat)This article was originally published by Votebeat, a nonprofit news organization covering local election administration and voting access. Sign up for Votebeat Michigan’s free newsletter here.
Sometime in the hours after last week’s election in Hamtramck, officials who weren’t involved in elections walked into the city clerk’s office, a space that’s supposed to be a secure place to keep ballots.
That revelation has thrown the outcome of the Michigan city’s entire election into doubt, including an exceedingly close mayoral race.
A total of 37 absentee ballots were initially unaccounted for on election night but were later discovered in the clerk’s office, opened but not yet tabulated. But since those ballots were not secured and could have been accessed by others, it’s currently up in the air whether they will be included in the election’s final totals.
The fate of the 37 ballots now rests with the Wayne County Board of Canvassers, which deadlocked on the decision Thursday and put off a resolution until Friday. City officials’ breach of the ballots’ chain of custody — a core safeguard in election law — has cast new doubt on the city’s election system, which is already under scrutiny amid ongoing criminal investigations and unusually high numbers of corrected absentee ballots.
How the canvassers rule on the 37 ballots could affect who wins the open-seat mayoral election in Hamtramck, a city of about 28,000 that borders Detroit. According to unofficial results, engineer Adam Alharbi currently leads City Council member Muhith Mahmood by only 11 votes.
 Ballots discovered after the election

City Clerk Rana Faraj told the board of canvassers on Thursday that her records showed a 37-ballot discrepancy on election night but that no one knew where the ballots were. They were found the next day in the clerk’s office, opened but still in their envelopes. When the discovery was made, the clerk immediately sealed the ballots in a secure envelope and brought them to the county, Faraj said.
The city clerk’s office is normally a secure space, so the discovery did not immediately raise questions about the ballots’ validity. However, Faraj said, her staff later realized several city officials, including interim City Manager Alex Lagrou, had entered the office while the ballots were there.
It’s unusual for non-election officials to go into a clerk’s office around an election, and it is not clear why they did so. Lagrou could not immediately be reached for comment Thursday.
“This is an issue of election law,” said Lisa A. Capatina, the chair of the canvassers board. Capatina and Toni Sellars, the Republicans on the board, voted against tabulating the ballots, while Democrats Richard Preuss and Edward Keelean voted in favor.
The canvassers ultimately tabled the decision on the advice of Becki Carmargo, corporation counsel for Wayne County. They will reconvene on Friday afternoon. The state deadline for canvassing is Tuesday.
Preuss said he would love to hear from residents before making a decision.
“There seems to be a robust amount of people here at this meeting today that would like to have a chance to speak,” he said.
Those who spoke during public comment at Thursday’s board meeting were split. A number of self-identified Hamtramck residents said it would be wrong to disenfranchise those 37 voters, while others felt those ballots should no longer be considered after the chain of custody was broken.
 Investigations into Hamtramck elections

The revelation is yet another blow to election confidence in a city that has been racked by scandal. Several members of the City Council are being investigated for alleged election crimes, and one person who was also under investigation won election to the council last week. There have been accusations of ballot stuffing, intimidation, fraud, and more, including felony charges against council members.
Meanwhile, Faraj confirmed she has been on paid leave since Monday, which she told Votebeat on Thursday during the meeting was “for her safety.” She did not expand on what that meant.
Even if the 37 ballots are eventually counted, the election isn’t over. The city also has 120 “cured” ballots left to include in the final totals, Greg Mahar, the director of Wayne County elections, told the canvassers. That’s a significant number for a city of around 28,000 residents; Detroit, in comparison, had only 72 for a city of nearly 650,000.
Cured ballots are absentee ballots that weren’t counted originally because either the signature on the envelope was missing or it did not match the signature on file. In these cases, the clerk’s office reaches out to the voter and gives them until the Friday after the election to correct it, so their ballot can be counted.
It’s unclear why there were so many cured ballots in Hamtramck. Mahar attributed it largely to the open-seat race for mayor, but Detroit — which also had an open mayoral race — did not see the same spike.
“It is a bit unusual,” he told the canvassers.

Martha Layne Collins told political writer Bob Johnson “I have never been a pushy broad.” (Shelby County Historical Society)Martha Layne Collins, who died Nov. 1 and was interred Monday, was a good governor. She grew in office, advanced a state that greatly needed advancement, and provided important lessons for women in politics — as the state’s first female governor, one who allowed her husband to peddle influence.
Collins started out as a teacher, and as governor she set the state on the road to education reform. The progress in her 1983-87 term was aided by the national school-reform movement and paled in comparison to the 1990 Kentucky Education Reform Act, but the Prichard Committee for Academic Excellence said the lawsuit that led to that landmark legislation was filed in “the education-focused atmosphere” that she helped create.
Her greatest legacy is making Kentucky a major automobile-manufacturing state, through recruitment of the Toyota plant to Georgetown. Yes, Toyota might have come if she hadn’t been elected — and if it hadn’t, some other Japanese automaker probably would have, if for no other reason than to get two more friendly U.S. senators. But speculation aside, Collins deserves credit for her leadership and salesmanship.
Martha Layne Collins, Kentucky’s only woman governor, dies at 88   

Larry Hayes, her Cabinet secretary, said in his eulogy of Collins that after Toyota initially passed up Kentucky in its search for a U.S. plant site, she called the company’s American sales chief, who got her a meeting with its top brass. They wanted “1,500 acres of free, flat land,” which the state didn’t have, but obtained with the help of Norfolk Southern Corp., whose railroad serves the plant, Hayes said. 
“She was really the one, with her personality and her ability to connect with some people . . . and her courage in taking the step” of giving land to a corporation, which the state constitution explicitly banned. State lawyers noted that, but “We kind of had to not listen to that part of it because she said ‘We’ve got to do this.’  She saw that,” Hayes said, adding later, “she truly cared about making things better for people.” A sharply divided state Supreme Court approved the deal a few months before Collins left office, and the state’s incentives to Toyota have long been accepted as a good investment in the state’s economic future.
The greatest blemish on Collins’ record was her husband’s 1993 conviction for extorting state bond underwriters, which sent him to prison and ended her political career. If she didn’t know what he was up to, as she averred, she should have known.
Bill Collins was part of a campaign team of old-school political operators and others who didn’t fit in the Democratic primary campaigns of Louisville Mayor Harvey Sloane and former human-resources secretary Grady Stumbo. Though she became only the third American woman elected governor in her own right, Collins was the most traditional of the three Kentucky candidates. She relied on local politicians, personal connections and quiet but crucial help from Democratic U.S. Sen. Wendell Ford, in whose campaigns she had worked.
She was an adept, attractive and energetic campaigner, and as the first Kentucky woman with the chance to become governor, something of a curiosity. Women brought husbands to see her, and she won some over. A 1983 poll found that most people who said they voted for Collins also said they had met her — amazing at a time when the previous election seemed determined by television.
That election had been won by businessman John Y. Brown Jr., who loved national politics but seemed to think that local Democratic events were beneath him. Collins, as lieutenant governor, was the next option for most organizers. She turned many of them into supporters, and made enough people think she actually could be governor that she edged out Sloane by 4,532 votes. (She was accustomed to close elections; she won the 1979 lieutenant governor primary by 3,338 votes over favorite Bill Cox.)
Though Brown’s style helped Collins win friends, he left her with a legislature that was charting its own course after decades of domination by governors. Under Collins, it became all the more a broker of special interests, albeit with extra focus on issues she deemed important, such as education and workers’ compensation. She disliked the confrontation that forges compromise, but she and her associates said “her political style is too subtle to be measured by traditional standards,” as reported by Courier-Journal Political Writer Bob Johnson as she left office. She told him, “I have never been a pushy broad.”
Collins’ other important legacy remains unfulfilled. When she was governor, women held four of the seven statewide elective offices, and the age of women in Kentucky politics seemed to have arrived. But that majority hasn’t been repeated, and no other woman has been governor, or even nominated for the job. Bill Collins’ case may have had something to do with that, but I think it stems more from our state’s deeply traditional culture, which resurged in politics when Republican social issues drove the state rightward after the Collins years. The state was never more Democratic in voter registration than it was in the year she was elected.

Collins’ mentor Wendell Ford was elected governor in 1971 over Tom Emberton, who died in 2022 after serving as chief judge of the Court of Appeals. The day after Collins died, an Amanda Matthews bronze statue of Emberton was unveiled at the Metcalfe County Courthouse named for him. It was a friendly, bipartisan event, something all too rare these days — a tribute to Emberton, one of the nicest people ever in Kentucky politics. Former state Chief Justice Larry Van Meter said Emberton “had a magical way of bringing consensus.” We need more of that, too.

“We shouldn’t be scared to walk around our own city without a gun,” said a 25-year-old Charlottesville resident interviewed as part of the research, which was released Thursday. 
That person was one of several minors and adults from around the state researchers interviewed to glean insights about what inspires people to carry guns and what might make their communities feel safer instead. 
The study builds on other research, like a 2024 study that revealed how teens exposed to neighborhood gun violence were more likely to begin carrying their own guns. For the UVA research, authors explored different hotspots around the state where homicide rates were higher. 
Lynchburg-area resident James Watkins, a longtime violence reduction and youth outreach strategist, conducted interviews with youth for part of the qualitative research and is one of the authors. 
At times in his own childhood, Watkins lived in high-violence areas before he found a sense of community and earned a scholarship to Virginia Military Institute where he eventually earned a psychology degree. His mentorship background and own lived experience, he believes, helped make the interviewees, whose identities the report kept anonymous, more comfortable. 
After the young people opened up and shared their experiences with him, Watkins said his takeaway is that adults should listen to minor’s perspectives when it comes to gun violence – from causes to engagement to reasons someone might have a gun in the first place. 
“If you don’t feel comfortable going to law enforcement or an adult (to resolve an issue), a kid is going to pick up a gun, because they’re accessible,” Watkins said. “They’re going to pick up a gun to protect themselves.”

The research points to several recommendations for actions that state and local governments can take to help drive down violence. 
As interviewees shared their insights living in areas where violence has been prevalent, they also shared how they think police could more meaningfully listen and engage with communities. A Hampton-area resident suggested officers seek local residents’ feedback for solutions in hotspot areas to help inform certain actions. 
Aside from law enforcement, the report also noted instances where civilians are stepping in to prevent conflicts from escalating to a need to call cops in the first place. 
The study’s authors also suggest local governments set memorandums of understanding with “organizations that employ people with lived experience.” 
One such organization is the Central Virginia Violence Interrupters, a nonprofit based in Charlottesville. The group, established by people with past criminal histories, seeks to help reduce violence and prevent crime through conflict mitigation and deescalation tactics. 
The idea is that people with the lived experience of doing time for crimes are well-suited to intervene to assist people on the verge of it. The once-volunteer cohort has been supported in recent years to treat their work as a part time job as they devote hours of time putting themselves in risky situations to benefit the overall community. 
City Council has appropriated funding to the organization in recent years and it had obtained federal grants, but the numbers have dropped this year as President Donald Trump’s administration cancelled grants or awarded them in other areas of the country. Additionally, Charlottesville has budgeted less for the group. The researchers suggest localities should continue to  support groups like the Violence Interrupters. 
“When we traditionally talk about safety, we’re thinking about potential victims. But we want potential offenders to feel safe too. That will make it less likely that they act in ways we all regret and they will regret,” said Andrew Block, one of the report’s authors and director of UVa’s State and Local Government Law Clinic. 
The research also points to successful state and local actions that can be continued. For instance, Hampton, Newport News and Norfolk have established interagency steering committees that share data on which areas of their towns are gun violence hot spots where intervention and public safety resources can be prioritized. 
As assistance to the research, an organization called Virginia First Cities Coalition hosted a virtual and in-person conference this past September with law enforcement leaders and violence interruption groups to share insights.
“Everybody has to play a role,” said Kelly Harris-Braxton, director of Virginia First Cities. “We’re all in this together.”
Law enforcement leaders discussed how they’d started devoting “the same level of investigatory resources to non-fatal shootings as they did homicides.” The approach led to quicker arrests and prevented retaliatory violence, the report stated, and was another recommendation for law enforcement around Virginia to implement. 
Harris-Braxton called it “refreshing” to see how energized the police chiefs in attendance at the conference were about reducing violence. 
Likewise, outgoing Attorney General Jason Miyares’ Ceasefire Virginia program was noted as a success. The program, which invests in gang prevention and targets repeat offenders, has also distributed grant funding to violence intervention and youth mentoring groups around the state. 
When celebrating the program’s work last year with Virginia Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, Miyares said “you can’t just prosecute your way out” of violent crime. 
Continued funding for violence intervention programs and groups is a paramount recommendation from the UVA study for state government. The authors also suggest expanding the funding where possible and ensuring the funding is flexible as localities tap into grants. 
Authors also noted that Newport News-based Democratic Del. Cia Price’s effort to create the Virginia Center for Firearm Intervention and Prevention has previously passed the legislature but was blocked by Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s veto pen. With Democratic Governor-elect Abigail Spanberger set to take the helm of the state next year, she could potentially sign it into law. 
The state’s gun storage safety laws could be bolstered, researchers said, some of which have been successful over the years, and others which have been vetoed. 
At local levels, the authors noted some holistic approaches that may help reduce gun violence in hotspot areas, such as investing in community centers and enabling school districts to address absenteeism. 
Both Harris-Braxton and Watkins emphasized that school or afterschool programs are places minors can find mentorship and friendship. 
“Some kids don’t have a stable family,” Watkins said. “There’s a void so they go searching for gangs for belonging but then they get sucked into the lifestyle.”
When speaking about the idea of community centers in an interview for the study, a Richmond-based young adult said that youth “are looking at their environment” and if violence and crime is what they see, they’re more likely to engage in it. A third space to connect with others and supportive environments can be nurturing, they said. 
“You don’t have to keep getting into this cycle of getting into these crimes, ending up in the jail cells, then not being able to find a job and then again, back to crime and falling into jail,” they said. 
By exploring ways to prevent gun violence in the first place and how to address it when it arises, Block explained that state and local actions can achieve  synergy and progress. 
“If we think about this mass problem of youth gun violence on a more local level and almost micro level, it becomes a much more solvable problem,” Block said.

(Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)Virginia will delay raising its academic benchmarks in reading and math until the following school year — a pause that gives teachers and school divisions a brief breather before higher proficiency standards take effect. 
On Thursday, the Virginia Board of Education endorsed a four-year phased plan to raise expectations set by Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration. The goal is to better align the state’s benchmarks, or cut scores, with the rigor of the National Assessment of Educational Progress  and help students improve their thinking problem-solving skills.
Critics have said for months that while they understand the need for higher expectations, they worry shifting cut scores could lower graduation rates, increase teacher burnout and worsen inequitable access to education. Others, however, spoke in support at Thursday’s meeting.
Youngkin’s education board moves to toughen proficiency standards

“When standards stay low, the least advantaged children lose the most as they depend the most on the public school system for their education,” said parent Todd Truitt.

He added that “many of these least advantaged kids in Virginia graduate believing they are prepared, only to find out later that the world expected more of them.”
This school year will serve as a preparation year, with the proficient cut score staying at 400 before rising to 446 by the 2028-2029 school year. Virginia will begin gradually increasing cut scores starting in 2026-2027.
Under the board’s plan, students retaking an SOL assessment must meet the passing score that was required when they first took the test.
Students who have already demonstrated proficiency on high school end-of-course assessments — whether in middle or high school — will not be required to retake the test or the course. The board also directed the Virginia Department of Education to release updated student assessment reports next spring for parents and school divisions, intended to help meet the board’s goals for higher expectations.
Groups including the Virginia Association of School Superintendent had asked the board to extend the existing proficiency and graduation requirements for all high school students, not just seniors. But the board took no action, with staff saying they are following the precedent of modifying cut scores without altering graduation requirements. 
Board Member Ida Outlaw McPherson emphasized the need to support disadvantaged students as they prepare for college, sharing that she herself had not been ready in certain subjects — something she said might have derailed her plans to pursue a political science degree. 
“Fortunately, I was able to overcome it, but that’s why it’s very important to me that we raise the level as quickly as possible so the students never have to face that,” McPherson said.
Since September, VDOE has met with school leaders to discuss concerns over how the proposed cut scores would affect their divisions, providing modeling and impact analyses.
Scott Brabrand, VASS executive director, said members “strongly appreciated” and “support your total four-year phase-in approach to intentional transition planning,” which will allow for additional modeling by VDOE and school divisions.
The vote caps a years-long process that drew heightened attention in the spring, when a standards-setting committee of teachers and instructional personnel began developing recommendations.
Virginia Explained: The debate over student expectations

On Oct. 24, Youngkin asked the board to raise achievement expectations and cut scores — particularly for grades 3-8 reading and math SOLs — following the release of 2022 NAEP results that showed declines in Virginia across both subjects between 2019 and 2022, and continuous drops in fourth-grader proficiency dating back to 2017.
The administration asked the board to reverse cut scores lowered by a previous board, which “inflated the perception of proficiency and ultimately led to some of the worst learning losses in the country,” according to the agency’s presentation.

Mim Luangraj, a resident in Arlington, said parents — including those from working families and those who speak English as a second language — likely do not know where standards should be set for college and career readiness.
“As a product of that community and on behalf of those that can’t advocate for their own children, I’m here today to say it’s crucial that their children receive an education at schools with high academic expectations and real opportunity — because for many of them, that’s the only place they’ll get it,” Luangraj said.
Board Vice Chair Bill Hansen was absent from the 8-0 vote by the Youngkin-appointed board.

(Photo by Alan MacRae/New Hampshire Bulletin)This is the third in a three-part series on New Hampshire’s intellectual and developmental disability care system. You can read Part I here, and Part II here.
IN 1956, A DOCUMENTARY titled “Help Wanted” placed viewers inside the Laconia State School, which from its founding in 1903 as the New Hampshire School for the Feeble-Minded to its closure in 1991 housed people with disabilities.
So disturbing were the visuals that the Portsmouth Herald compared the institution to images of the concentration camps of Nazi Germany.
Overcrowding plagued the New Hampshire facility, with over 1,000 residents by 1942, according to a historical account from the Laconia Daily Sun. There was no privacy or personal space in the group bedrooms — and in one building a single toilet was shared among 80 people. Many residents were forcibly sterilized, and beatings were routinely given as punishment for bad behavior.
For nearly a century, the institution served as the state’s response to the needs of people with disabilities. It took a class-action lawsuit — and its articulated horrors — to shutter the place for good and usher in a new system for state-administered care more than three decades ago.
But as a monthslong Bulletin investigation into New Hampshire’s modern disability care network has revealed, systemic problems of abuse and neglect haven’t gone away. Tragic story after tragic story — many of them reported this week for the first time — provide the evidence.
A caretaker’s violence
Sterling Jordan was drunk, police would later confirm, when he sexually assaulted a man with autism and cognitive disabilities who had been placed in his care. 
Sterling Jordan
After the November 2017 assault, the 26-year-old victim — who remained anonymous in the court filings, press reports, and other materials describing the crime — was bleeding, had vomited, and called his mother from the bathroom to tell her he’d been raped. She told officers her son had the mental capacity of a 15-year-old.
Jordan is currently serving a 10-year sentence at the New Hampshire State Prison for Men in Concord, according to the Department of Corrections website.
Jordan and the victim lived in a Manchester home operated by Community Integrated Services, which was overseen by the Moore Center, a Manchester area agency designated by the state to coordinate care for people with disabilities. 
A lawsuit filed in October 2019 by the victim’s family alleges that neither Community Integrated Services nor the Moore Center did a background check on Jordan before hiring him to live with and care for the young man. In 2014, Jordan was convicted of driving while intoxicated, which is legally disqualifying to serve as a caretaker for people with disabilities, and charged with unlawful possession of a weapon. The lawsuit claims Community Integrated Services and the Moore Center were made aware of the charges by the home’s landlord, who had discovered them during a background check. 

DO YOU HAVE information or experience with New Hampshire’s intellectual and developmental disability system you’d like to share?
The Bulletin would like to speak with you. Please email wskipworth@newhampshirebulletin.com or send an encrypted message via Signal to WillSkipworth.80.

Still, neither agency fired Jordan nor removed the young man from his care.
In the weeks leading up to the assault, the victim’s mother reportedly witnessed Jordan belligerently intoxicated, per the lawsuit, but Community Integrated Services denied he was drunk, arguing he was on medication that prevented him from drinking alcohol. The mother reportedly asked them to install a video camera in the apartment to monitor Jordan and was told it was “in the works,” the lawsuit alleged.
Community Integrated Services and the Moore Center didn’t respond to the Bulletin’s requests for comment or an interview.
Jordan’s crime played out publicly in court and was widely reported in the state’s press. However, a Bulletin investigation found that Jordan’s assault was not an isolated incident within New Hampshire’s intellectual and developmental disability care system — that acts of violence, negligence, and exploitation are common. Many never make it to court or are settled behind closed doors with parties unable to speak of the outcomes. Others take years for the state to fully investigate.
In New Hampshire, people with intellectual and developmental disabilities are entitled to services. The state designates 10 area agencies, including the Moore Center, to either provide this care or subcontract with another vendor agency, such as Community Integrated Services, to do so. The area agency system, established in the wake of the Laconia State School, is overseen by the state’s Department of Health and Human Services’ Bureau of Developmental Services and is paid for by Medicaid and other state and federal dollars.
Gov. Kelly Ayotte, shown here talking to reporters on Oct. 15, told the Bulletin on Nov. 12 she’s been in communication with the commissioner of the Department of Health and Human Services and attorney general about systemic issues raised in the Bulletin’s reporting. She said she will “continue to make sure that these are investigated, that we follow through with any changes that need to be made to the system.” (Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)
Gov. Kelly Ayotte told the Bulletin on Wednesday that after the first two parts of this series were published, she reached out to DHHS Commissioner Lori Weaver and Attorney General John Formella to discuss the issues raised.
“These are very serious allegations,” Ayotte said. “They need to be examined, and we need to make sure that the system is serving the people that have disabilities in our communities, and also any of the contractors, the area agencies that contract with the state to serve people with disabilities, make sure that they are performing and that they are treating people well, so I take this very seriously.”
She said she will “continue to make sure that these are investigated, that we follow through with any changes that need to be made to the system.”
New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services Commissioner Lori Weaver, shown here during an Oct. 15, 2025, Executive Council meeting, declined the Bulletin’s requests for an interview. Bureau of Developmental Services Chief Jessica Gorton and Director of Long Term Supports and Services Melissa Hardy also declined. (Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)
The Bulletin repeatedly requested interviews with Weaver, Bureau of Developmental Services Chief Jessica Gorton, and Director of Long Term Supports and Services Melissa Hardy to discuss issues within New Hampshire’s disability system. The three declined. Jake Leon, director of communications for DHHS, instead provided a statement.
“While we are unable to comment on individual cases, DHHS has a process in place to review and investigate complaints made against providers and vendors licensed or certified through the Department,” he wrote. “We take these allegations seriously and will continue working to ensure Granite Staters with disabilities are protected and that allegations are thoroughly investigated.”
Rampant abuse and neglect
State records obtained by the Bulletin show New Hampshire investigated 1,405 reports of abuse, neglect, and exploitation committed against people with disabilities in the state’s intellectual and developmental disability system from January 2023 through the first six months of 2025. 
Those reports include allegations of physical attacks, sexual abuse and assault, and verbal attacks committed by staff against people with disabilities in their care. Of the reports, 467 were deemed credible after a state investigation, according to the records, while 18 of the complaints were withdrawn before the investigations were complete and 28 complaints were ongoing when the records were produced.
State records also show 119 people died in New Hampshire’s disability system from 2023 through June 2025. Of those deaths, 79 were deemed “anticipated” by the state (state officials refused to define “anticipated” for the purposes of these records) and at least 22 were categorized under “unknown” cause of death. The causes of death in the records include “intracranial hemorrhage” (brain bleed), complications from a “right femur fracture,” and “probable bacterial infection, and malnutrition.” 
BDSMortalityReportSept2022throughJune2025
 This mortality report, obtained by the Bulletin through an open records request, details deaths within New Hampshire’s intellectual and developmental disability care system. The state declined to provide more documentation to add context to the nature of the deaths.
No further information is included in the records that would provide more context, and the state declined to provide the Bulletin with further documentation on the deaths even with personally identifying information redacted, citing state statutes.
News reports from other states — including Missouri, West Virginia, and California — suggest New Hampshire is not entirely unique, as abuse and neglect have been reported elsewhere. Additionally, the Bulletin collected data from neighboring states on their developmental disability systems through a series of open records requests. However, differences in how data is categorized and reported — as well as population variations — make comparisons with bordering states challenging.
In Vermont, 92 people died within the state’s intellectual and developmental disability system in 2023 and 2024, according to state records. In Massachusetts’ system, 730 people died in 2023 and 2024. Massachusetts categorized the deaths even further: 18 were determined to be accidental, one cause was undetermined, and 21 were still pending investigation earlier this year when the records were produced. The remaining were attributed to natural causes. In Maine’s system, 112 people died in 2023 and 2024, per state records. Of those deaths, three were accidental and 56 were attributed to “unknown causes.”
As for abuse and neglect, Vermont saw 680 instances of “alleged abuse, neglect, and prohibitive practices” and 254 “criminal acts” in 2023 and 2024, per state records. In Massachusetts, records show 11,652 complaints of abuse and neglect in 2023 and 2024. And in Maine, there were 370 complaints of abuse and neglect in 2023 and 2024. 
Looking forward
Jim Piet, who has cerebral palsy and serves as vice chair of the New Hampshire Council on Developmental Disabilities, said he’s “not surprised” to hear of abuse within the care system and has experienced yelling and threats from caregivers himself.

The Council on Developmental Disabilities is a federally funded agency independent of state government that advocates for people with developmental disabilities. Piet said DHHS provides so little data and information that it makes it impossible for his council to meaningfully offer recommendations or identify issues.
Piet said the market to hire caretakers is so difficult that some people with disabilities or agencies put up with abusive or neglectful behavior because they’re afraid of not being able to find a replacement. He said low wages, minimal benefits, and little opportunity for career advancement for these employees sometimes leads to lower quality employees.
“Abuse can look like lots of different things,” Piet said.
State Sen. David Rochefort, a Littleton Republican and chair of the Senate Health and Human Services Committee, said he was unaware of the abuse and neglect cases before hearing about them from the Bulletin. That’s “unsettling to hear,” he said.
David Rochefort
“As someone who lived through the clergy abuse of 20 years ago,” he said, “there’s been past instances where things like this have been covered up, and this can’t be covered up. It has to be brought out into the open and people need to have the justice that they deserve. Everybody deserves justice, but this is such a vulnerable community that are so dependent on others. I would certainly support anything that would protect them.”
He said it’s important for lawmakers to look for breakdowns in the system.
“My first initial thought is, how did these cases get to this point,” he said. If there were breakdowns, he said, “then we can dig into that a little bit and find out what in the process failed these people, and look to make adjustments there.”
He said in other interactions he’s had with the area agency system, he’s wondered if there needs to be more oversight on area and vendor agencies.
“We want people to get the best care that’s available, especially a very at-risk population,” Rochefort said. “But we want it done right, and we want it done safely, and if there’s areas that need to be addressed, hopefully we can address them, but the proliferation of these private vendors just makes you wonder, are we doing enough to vet these these places and are they providing the best care that’s possible?”

 How did the Bulletin report this story?

	
Over the course of months, the Bulletin sifted through thousands of pages of state records, court filings, and law enforcement documents, and interviewed dozens of family members, advocates, attorneys, and others. To see a selection of the most noteworthy documents click here.

Stephanie Patrick is the executive director of the Disability Rights Center-NH. This federally designated agency is tasked with investigating suspected abuse and neglect in New Hampshire; pursuing litigation on behalf of the state’s disability community; assisting people trying to receive services for their disabilities; advocating for people with disabilities; and working with lawmakers on solutions to problems facing the disability community.
“It doesn’t seem clear that there’s a path forward,” Patrick said. “I think there’s potential to make systems better. People do that all the time. We, the state of New Hampshire, are hopefully constantly looking at how to make systems work better to meet the needs of the people that they are supposed to serve. But I don’t know how you do that if you don’t want to talk about it.”
Patrick said nothing will change until state leaders are willing to be frank about what’s going on and commit to changes. She called it “unacceptable” for the state to delegate responsibility for abuse and neglect to private agencies.
She said high-level elected officials need to call for evaluations of the Department of Health and Human Services’ licensing and certification officials, its investigations teams, and adult protective services. Those groups need to “work together to address systemic failures instead of operating in silos or blaming one another.”
Patrick also said lawmakers need to devote more funding to ensure quality services and staff to monitor the conditions of residential programs.
“It is challenging because there are not enough providers,” Patrick said. “But to me, it’s worse to have poor quality providers than to not have as many as you want. A healthy system involves setting real true expectations for the kind of care that people get and holding providers accountable.”
Patrick said the state needs a full investigation conducted by an independent agency separate from the state.
“Civil lawsuits for damages provide resources for the abused person with disabilities and bring some solace to families,” she said. “Criminal charges can hold the perpetrators accountable. But neither actually forces the state and its Medicaid providers to actually examine the systems that led to these failures.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/lakesfacilityvetting-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-14 05:56:17.542565

(Photo from Google Maps.)As it was in the midst of financing a $61 million bribery scheme, Akron-based FirstEnergy also improperly claimed millions in construction expenses, according to a new report. 
The company classified lobbying and donations as construction expenses at the same time that it funded the bribery scandal, although it’s not clear if any of that money was paid in bribes.
Now that $108 million in such errors have been found, the utility is asking Ohio regulators for permission to charge its customers for them. 
Otherwise, they’ll be billed to FirstEnergy shareholders — which prominently include the company’s own executives.
Corruption surcharge
Ohioans are already frustrated with skyrocketing utility costs. 
Due in part to AI-driven demand for data centers, monthly utility bills were up $32 on average this summer compared to 10 years ago, Signal Cleveland reported.
But Ohio customers also have faced a sizable surcharge for corruption over the past decade. 
In 2023, former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder, R-Glenford, was sentenced to 20 years in federal prison for his role in a conspiracy in which FirstEnergy paid $61 million in bribes to get a $1.3 billion ratepayer bailout. 
Former FirstEnergy CEO Chuck Jones and Vice President Michael Dowling face felony charges in the same scandal.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Most of the bailout money was intended to prop up money-losing nuclear plants owned by FirstEnergy. It was repealed after the FBI made its first arrests. 
But it wasn’t until five years later that the Republican-led legislature repealed a coal bailout benefitting a group of Ohio utilities that was part of the same 2019 legislation. 
By that time, ratepayers had already been forced to pay more than $500 million that won’t be refunded.
That’s all in addition to $1.5 billion that electric utilities have been allowed to collect since 2009 in charges that the Ohio Supreme Court later deemed to be illegal. 
But because the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio greenlit the charges without creating a refund mechanism, customers won’t get that back either.
Underwriting incompetence
Now a new report by the Energy & Policy Institute has flagged another way FirstEnergy might be trying to profit improperly. 
A FirstEnergy spokeswoman didn’t respond to calls and emails requesting comment for this story. 
As revealed in court documents and testimony in the fallout from the scandal, by 2016, company leaders’ poor business decisions had made them desperate. 
They were heavily invested in aging coal and nuclear plants, fracking had made gas-fired electricity generation much cheaper, and they couldn’t compete. 
So they went looking for a way to force customers to bail them out.
FirstEnergy started courting Householder at the World Series in Cleveland that October, and by flying him on the corporate jet to Donald Trump’s first inauguration the following January. 
Using FirstEnergy money, Householder and his allies were elected, he became Ohio House speaker at the start of 2019, and he shepherded the bailout through the legislature later that year.
The FBI arrested Householder and four others in July 2020. Two of his codefendants later died by suicide.
Construction? Or lobbying?
Auditors later found that concurrent with the scheme, FirstEnergy had engaged in another practice that — regardless of whether it was intentional — worked to the company’s financial advantage.
A 2022 audit by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission found that from 2015 to 2021, FirstEnergy incorrectly classified millions spent on things like lobbying, advertising, and political donations as construction costs. 
That’s important, the Energy and Policy Institute Report said, because utilities are allowed to collect a profit from ratepayers on their construction investments. 
They’re not allowed to collect such profits for money they spend on lobbying and political donations.
“Utilities are supposed to fund lobbying and donations with shareholder money because these expenditures primarily benefit shareholders and do not benefit ratepayers,” the report said. 
However, the federal audit found lots of claimed construction expenses that had almost nothing to do with actual construction.
“For example, audit staff found that some employees spent 5% or less of their time performing work that supported the FirstEnergy subsidiaries’ construction operations, but had more than 90% of their labor and related costs capitalized as a cost of construction,” the audit said.

Construction? Or bribes?
Some of those misclassified dollars might have been used in the bribery scandal. 
The Energy and Policy Institute report cited a 2024 utilities commission audit. It said that FirstEnergy claimed as a construction expense $2.5 million that was part of a $4.3 million bribe paid to Sam Randazzo.
Randazzo played a pivotal role in the bribery scandal, starting shortly after the Nov. 6, 2018 elections.
On Dec. 18, 2018, FirstEnergy execs Jones and Dowling met with Gov.-elect Mike DeWine and Lt. Gov.-elect (and now-U.S. Sen.) Jon Husted at the Columbus Athletic Club. 
They discussed whether the executives wanted Randazzo to regulate their massive electric utility, according to a state indictment. 
Jones and Dowling then drove about a mile to Randazzo’s German Village condo and negotiated the $4.3 million bribe, the indictment said.
DeWine appointed Randazzo to the state’s top regulatory spot a few weeks later. 
It was a perch from which Randazzo helped write the corrupt energy bill that FirstEnergy paid huge bribes for.
The $2.5 million part of the bribe for the future regulatory chief was itself part of $6.45 million that FirstEnergy paid to a group controlled by Randazzo. 
The company then classified the money as a construction expense, the Energy and Policy Institute Report said. 
After being arrested, Randazzo died by suicide in April 2024.
Dunning ratepayers, not stockholders
As a consequence of the federal audit’s findings, FirstEnergy reclassified $108 million in claimed construction expenses as “miscellaneous deferred debits.”  
Now, even though some of the funds were apparently used to improperly profit from ratepayers, FirstEnergy is asking to bill those same customers for the whole shebang. 
It’s part of a request to the utility commission to pass on $190 million in additional costs to ratepayers.
In its annual 2024 10-K report to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, FirstEnergy said it “has accepted” the findings of the 2022 federal audit. But it added that it hopes the company’s owners won’t have to shoulder them.
If the Public Utilities Commission doesn’t allow it to bill ratepayers for charges that the audit said were improperly accounted for, it would “have an adverse impact on FirstEnergy’s financial condition,” the filing said.
In other words, shareholders instead of customers would be left holding the bag. And that would cost the FirstEnergy brass, as opposed to their ratepayers, who have no choice about whether to use the company’s distribution system.

For example, total compensation for FirstEnergy CEO Brian X. Tierney was $26.5 million in 2023, Axios reported. 
To give an idea just how much that is, assume Tierney works 70 hours a week. That would mean he was paid $7,280 an hour, or 219 times the average hourly wage of his Ohio customers.
And a huge portion of Tierney’s 2023 pay — more than $22 million — was in the form of company stock, which would take a hit if something “had an adverse impact on FirstEnergy’s financial condition.” 
The state’s official consumer advocate, the Office of Consumers Counsel is urging the public utilities commission to make FirstEnergy’s owners pay for errors made by the people they pick to run the company.
“Consumers shouldn’t pay for FirstEnergy’s mistakes. Both the independent auditor and OCC’s expert agree that FirstEnergy’s $108 million ‘fix’ for its own error was improper,” the agency’s head, Maureen Willis, said in an email. 
“FirstEnergy caused the problem — now it’s trying to make consumers clean it up. The record points the other way: FirstEnergy consumers deserve a rate cut, not another hike.
Willis added, “The PUCO should stand with consumers, not FirstEnergy.”",https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Firstenergy-mug-1024x524.jpg,,,2025-11-14 05:56:17.542565

Sears/Maryland Matters)Though Congress ended the record-setting federal government shutdown, many questions remain for states that were already wading through seismic federal changes.
One major uncertainty: whether and how states will be reimbursed for the costs they incurred, as they have been in previous shutdowns. And for the longer term, the shutdown offered a glimpse into the funding challenges facing states. They’ll have to rely more on their own money and staff to keep federal programs going even at a time when many face their own budget problems.
That’s a top concern for the federal food stamp program, known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. Amid conflicting federal guidance during the shutdown, states reacted in different ways: Some issued partial benefit payments, others sent aid to food banks to keep people from going hungry.
But even after the government reopening restores SNAP aid, other challenges loom. The major tax and spending law enacted this summer tied SNAP funding to state error rates, which measure the accuracy of benefit payments. Advocates fear the shutdown will increase error rates because of conflicting federal guidance.
Air travel, SNAP benefits, back pay at issue as federal government slowly reopens

“States are really worried,” said Crystal FitzSimons, president of the Food Research & Action Center, a nonprofit working to address poverty-related hunger.
And states have been rushing to inform rural residents, veterans and older adults that they will soon be forced to meet work requirements or lose SNAP benefits. It’s just the first in a wave of cutbacks to the nation’s largest food assistance program required under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that President Donald Trump signed in July.
FitzSimons said the shutdown highlighted the importance of SNAP and how “untenable” many of the upcoming changes will prove for states. For now, states are working to get benefits to people immediately, and then will focus more on questions of reimbursement and ongoing changes to SNAP.
“The hope is that states will be able to move quickly and then turn their attention to all the changes,” she said.
While public attention has centered on the shutdown chaos in recent weeks, more fundamental changes are occurring outside the spotlight, said Eric Schnurer, founder and president of Public Works, a consulting firm specializing in government performance and efficiency.
“The ground is shifting under their [states’] feet even as this goes on,” he said. “Even if the Trump administration and his policies were to pass on in another three years, there are serious structural changes in the relationship between state and federal government.”
Since taking office, the Trump administration has stripped states and cities of billions of dollars that Congress approved for education, infrastructure and energy projects. And the president’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act mandates deep cuts to social service programs, including Medicaid and food stamps.
Under the law, states will be required to pay a greater share of administering SNAP in the coming years. That requirement, along with eligibility changes, could result in millions of Americans losing benefits.
“I think the public in general got a taste of what that might look like over the past month,” Schnurer said, referencing the shutdown’s first-ever disruption to SNAP benefits.
State-federal strain
The legislation to reopen the government approved by Congress and signed by the president this week says that states shall be reimbursed for expenses “that would have been paid” by the federal government during the shutdown.
“So that sounds promising for states,” said Marcia Howard, executive director of Federal Funds Information for States, which analyzes how federal policymaking impacts states.
But it’s unclear how that language will be interpreted. For example, states that sent money to food banks for emergency food assistance are less likely to be made whole compared with states that sent funds through existing federal programs like SNAP, she said.
Veterans, rural residents, older adults may lose food stamps due to Trump work requirements

California dedicated $80 million in state funds and deployed the National Guard to food banks across the state. But Virginia launched a temporary state-level version of the federal food stamp program.
Previous administrations have been more flexible with federal funds, making it easier for states to receive funding or reimbursement, Howard said.
“This administration is really more holding states’ feet to the fire perhaps than other administrations have. So I think they’ll be less permissive in who and how they reimburse,” she said.
It could take weeks or months before states know the full fallout from the shutdown, especially with food assistance.
“[States] did such different things, and I think there’s going to be a fair bit of back-and-forth: should this be covered? Should this not be covered?” Howard said.
The shutdown and its aftermath underscore the ongoing strain between state and federal governments, said Lisa Parshall, a professor of political science at Daemen University in New York.
Federal uncertainty can cause state leaders to be more cautious about their own budgets — similar to how an economic downturn can decrease consumer spending, she said.










In some ways, even though the shutdown is over, things are not going to go back to ‘normal.’


– Lisa Parshall, a professor of political science at Daemen University


“There’s a delay of services, there’s a diminishment of capacity and partnership, and those things might be harder to quantify when you’re talking about what is the cost of the shutdown,” she said. “But I think those are real costs.”
And the end of the shutdown does not extinguish those tensions.
“In some ways, even though the shutdown is over, things are not going to go back to ‘normal,’” she said.
More changes coming
Aside from spending cuts and new administrative costs, Trump’s July law made major tax code changes poised to cost many states, said William Glasgall, public finance adviser at the Volcker Alliance, a nonprofit that supports public sector workers.
Most states use the federal tax code as a basis for their own income tax structures, so changes at the federal level can trickle down to state tax systems or states can choose a different structure to avoid those changes.
Last month, a Massachusetts budget official said federal tax changes would cost the state $650 million in revenue this budget year.
So even with the government back open, states have to plan for some level of unpredictability, Glasgall said. And the future of entire agencies like the Department of Education remain up in the air, he noted.
“So there’s still a lot of uncertainty, even with this bill,” he said.
‘This shutdown feels different.’ States might not get repaid when government reopens.

On Wednesday, state budget analysts briefed Maryland lawmakers on the $1.4 billion budget gap they could face as they head into the 2026 legislative session.
That figure does not include the fallout from the federal government shutdown, which may not be known for months, according to Maryland Matters.
In late October, Democratic Gov. Wes Moore declared an emergency and directed $10 million in state funds toward food banks and pantries. Earlier this month, he announced $62 million in state funds would be deployed directly to SNAP recipients.
Rhyan Lake, a Moore spokesperson, told Stateline that Maryland expects the federal government to reimburse the state for its SNAP expenditures during the shutdown.
But lawmakers are still gearing up for a hit from major federal changes.
In addition to cuts from Trump’s domestic tax and spending law, Maryland has lost about 15,000 federal jobs, budget officials said. But many federal workers who took buyouts were paid through September. And the shutdown caused a pause in federal employment data, potentially concealing the true impact.
State Sen. James Rosapepe, Democratic chair of the joint Spending Affordability Committee, said he’s worried the state has only seen the beginning of its federally induced fiscal challenges. He also noted that this week’s shutdown-ending legislation only assures the government remains open through January, meaning another shutdown could be just a couple months away.
“We’re less than a year into the administration, and the effects of things they’ve already done don’t seem to have flowed through yet to the data that we have, which leads me to believe that the worst is yet to come,” he said.

,Mississippi Today,2025-11-14 10:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,"In a brutal Mississippi jail, inmates say they were enlisted as enforcers","Brian Howey, Mukta Joshi and Nate Rosenfield",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/14/mississippi-jail-inmates-enlisted-as-enforcers/,"High-ranking inmates in the Rankin County jail known as trusties were ordered to do guards’ bidding, former inmates and guards said, and the culture of violence in the jail went straight to the top.","Brian Howey, Mukta Joshi and Nate Rosenfield are reporters for Mississippi Today. They examined the power of sheriffs’ offices as part of The New York Times’s Local Investigations Fellowship. This story was reported in collaboration with Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting.
For years, guards in a jail outside Jackson terrorized those in their care, according to dozens of people who say they endured, witnessed or participated in violent assaults.
Guards dragged inmates into blind corners, where cameras couldn’t capture acts of violence. They beat people behind closed doors. And they encouraged favored inmates to join in on the brutality.
Former inmates and guards said the violence at the Rankin County jail created a culture of fear and was widely accepted by officials as a way of keeping order, an investigation by Mississippi Today and The New York Times has found.
More than a dozen former inmates recounted being beaten for nonviolent infractions, like talking back to guards or getting caught with contraband. Many said a special group of inmates, known as trusties, helped guards beat troublemakers, lending fists whenever needed. Sometimes, the jail’s highest-ranking officials instigated the punishments or handed them down themselves, according to former guards and inmates.
The Rankin County Sheriff’s Department, which runs the jail, has a documented history of brazen violence. Last year, the Justice Department began investigating the agency for potential civil rights violations after Mississippi Today and The Times revealed that a group of detectives and patrol deputies, some of whom called themselves the “Goon Squad,” had been torturing suspected drug users for nearly 20 years.
This portrait of life inside the Rankin County jail is drawn from interviews with more than 70 former inmates. Many of their descriptions of widespread violence are supported by medical records and photographs, as well as incident reports written by guards and a video that shows guards shocking a man with an electrified vest.

Four former guards, three of whom asked to remain anonymous, also said they had witnessed unjustified beatings by other guards and trusties. Most described the violence as a weekly occurrence.
In a statement, the department’s attorney, Jason Dare, called the reporting “baseless.” The Rankin County jail, he wrote, “is one of the cleanest and best-run jails in Mississippi, with jailers never having been found to use excessive force in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.”
After reviewing the findings, Sean Tindell, the commissioner of the Mississippi Department of Public Safety, said on Wednesday that agents from the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation had been assigned to investigate the allegations.
Since 2013, at least 11 inmates from the jail have sued the department, alleging they had been assaulted by guards or trusties. The vast majority represented themselves and most of the lawsuits were dismissed because of missed deadlines and court fees, or other technicalities.
The attacks, described in the lawsuits and in interviews with former guards and inmates, ranged in severity from slaps and whippings to brutal beatings that left inmates with bloody wounds and broken bones. Three guards and nearly two dozen former inmates said that trusties and guards would purposefully drag inmates into areas with no surveillance cameras before beating them.
Morgan Curtis, a former trusty who has been in and out of the jail since 2015, said the way guards would order trusties to attack inmates was “like a command to a pack of dogs.”
In interviews, nine former trusties, most of whom requested anonymity because they feared retaliation, admitted to helping guards beat inmates. They said the highest-ranking trusties were expected to back up guards during volatile situations or attack inmates so that guards would not have to do so themselves.
This group of trusties, recognizable by their blue jumpsuits, earned a nickname: the Blue Wave.
One former trusty described an incident from 2020. He said that on the orders of guards, he beat an inmate who had flooded his cell, kicking him repeatedly.
The following year, the jail’s top administrator, Barry Vaughn, confronted an inmate who had failed a drug test. Vaughn punched him so hard, the inmate said, that it broke his nose and knocked out two dental crowns.

Christian Dedmon, one of five former Rankin County deputies who was sentenced to federal prison for torturing two Black men in 2024, said that while he was working at the department he had watched Vaughn beat inmates in his office. A former guard described seeing several similar beatings. Vaughn declined to comment on the allegations.
In 2019, a man who briefly escaped the jail was lifted into the air by his throat and choked by a sheriff’s deputy, several inmates and a guard said. Bryan Bailey, the sheriff of the department, later bragged about the incident, according to Dedmon.
Dedmon has sent hundreds of emails from a federal prison in New Jersey, describing how his willingness to partake in violence helped him rise through the ranks. He has said that he wanted it known that the brutalities he committed were part of a deeply ingrained culture at the department.
He previously shared information about the use of taxpayer-funded equipment at Sheriff Bailey’s family farm, allegations that led to an investigation by the state auditor.
“They made me powerful and respected, made me actually feel like somebody, like I had done a good job,” Dedmon wrote. “It’s OK to beat drug addicts, it’s OK to take from the taxpayer, so why would I not mirror them?”
Beatings behind closed doors
The Rankin County Adult Detention Center is tucked behind the courthouse on the main drag of Brandon, a town of about 25,000 people with one of the lowest crime rates in the state.
Several hundred inmates, many of them accused of drug crimes and other nonviolent offenses, live in rows of beige cells stacked two stories high. Many have not been convicted of a crime and are awaiting their day in court.
Over 10 months, reporters examined 69 alleged incidents of violence against inmates at the jail that occurred from 2012 to 2024.
They included 21 encounters in which guards documented that they had used force against inmates, and why, in incident reports. These reports are routinely filed whenever guards encounter issues. Their descriptions of violence differed greatly from what inmates said had happened.
But in a number of cases, reporters were able to interview eyewitnesses who supported the accounts of the victims. In several cases, medical records corroborated the injuries that inmates described.

In the case of Larry Buckhalter, the violence was filmed — by a guard.
In 2018, Buckhalter began a one-year sentence for possessing a small amount of cocaine. He was intellectually disabled, his family said, and people often took advantage of him.
According to three former guards who spoke on the condition of anonymity, Buckhalter was nicknamed “Crying Larry” by guards and other inmates because he had a habit of pestering jail staff with small requests.
One day, he asked for a Coca-Cola. A cellphone video obtained by Mississippi Today and The Times shows Buckhalter sitting quietly in a chair, strapped into a stun vest that is typically used to control violent inmates during court hearings.
Off camera, a man jokes that Buckhalter is going to bite off his tongue. A woman, who is also off camera, tells Buckhalter to give his consent.
Buckhalter takes a deep breath. “My name Larry and I volunteer to this,” he says.
The vest is activated. Buckhalter screams as his body convulses.
“Now you get a Coke,” the woman says. “It’s all over! I’m so proud of you, Larry!”
In his statement, Dare, the department attorney, did not address the guards’ actions. He criticized the reporting as “alleged rumors by unnamed sources who have no personal, first-hand knowledge of events,” and pointed out that reporters had not spoken to Buckhalter, who died in 2021.
Tindell, Mississippi’s public safety commissioner, called the video “appalling and utterly unacceptable.”
David Fathi, the director of the National Prison Project at the American Civil Liberties Union, said that using force can be justified in certain circumstances, like if an inmate poses a threat; but doing so without cause or as punishment, he said, is “categorically inappropriate.” Corporal punishment in U.S. jails and prisons was deemed unconstitutional in the 1960s.
Fathi reviewed several incident reports filed by guards. He said the reasons they cited for using force were so vague they should have raised red flags to supervisors, and that the justifications fell far short of the typical threshold followed by jails and prisons.
In one such report, a guard wrote that he had struck an inmate, Dustin Rives, in the face because Rives had verbally threatened another guard. The blow broke Rives’ jaw, medical records show. Another report stated that guards struck Carvis Johnson and threw him to the floor in 2020 because he yelled threats and turned toward them after being ordered to face a wall.

For years, the man in charge of monitoring the jail was Vaughn, a captain who was recently promoted to undersheriff, making him second-in-command of the sheriff’s department.
According to a former deputy, a former guard and 14 former inmates, Vaughn often beat inmates who broke the rules, slapping and whipping them during interrogations in his office.
“ When you walked through his door, he had a shelf. And on the side of the shelf, he had like a wooden stick, a wooden baseball bat, two or three antennas,” said Cameron Kennedy, a former inmate who said Vaughn had questioned him on several occasions.
In June 2021, Vaughn called Kennedy and several other trusties who had failed drug tests into his office, one by one.
When Kennedy refused to explain where they had gotten the drugs, he said, Vaughn slapped him hard enough to give him a black eye.
Three of the other men who had failed drug tests said Vaughn had punched or whipped them with a car antenna. One of the men was Woodrow Lamont Lewis, the trusty who said Vaughn had knocked out his dental crowns that day. The men said they also saw other inmates return bloodied and bruised from Vaughn’s office.
A few months after the failed drug test, Kennedy was caught with a cellphone, an incident report shows. Vaughn handcuffed him to a chair and struck his shins and thighs with a car antenna, he said.
“He never did stop,” Kennedy said. “I’m talking about, like, 10 or 15 minutes, rapping me with it.”
Dedmon, the former deputy who is in prison, wrote in an email that he once saw Vaughn repeatedly punch an inmate who had smuggled drugs into the jail.
Vaughn directed reporters to speak with the department’s attorney, who denied the allegations.
Cigarettes and ‘free world’ chicken
Some of the country’s first trusty programs began in the early 1900s in Mississippi prisons.
Places like Parchman, a notorious prison in the Mississippi Delta, were known to select trusties from among their most violent inmates. The trusties, armed with guns and whips, were tasked with disciplining other inmates or forcing them to perform backbreaking work in cotton fields.
A federal court ruling in 1972 deemed trusty-on-prisoner violence unconstitutional, leading to the widespread dismantling of the programs in prisons across the nation.
Today, modern versions of trusty programs are common in county jails, though participants are generally banned from using physical force. These programs put nonviolent offenders to work, helping them learn job skills.
In Rankin County, many former trusties spoke glowingly about the program, crediting it with turning their lives around.
“It was the biggest blessing in my life,” said Cameron McKenzie, a former trusty. “I’ve been out now 20 months. I’m married, got full custody of both my kids, just bought a house, good job, you name it.”
Many inmates in the county jail are there only for short periods, while they await sentencing, but trusties usually serve their entire sentence in the facility, rising through the ranks over months or even years.
The most senior trusties — those who earn blue suits — have far better living conditions than other inmates. Former trusties said they slept in their own cellblock, in unlocked cells, and sometimes got passes to visit their families.
Many could roam the facility freely, play video games and work outside the jail. One former trusty, Cameron McCaskill, said he was allowed to keep a pet dog and order pizza.

“A blue suit is unrestricted,” Sheriff Bailey said during a 2020 interview with a Mississippi lobbying group. “Once they get a blue suit status, that is almost like being an employee here.”
Dare said trusties were not allowed to use force.
“ I do not believe that is specifically spelled out in a policy,” he said in an interview. “I do know it is a practice that trusties do not go hands-on.”
But several former guards and participants of the program said that the jail staff expected some trusties to provide extra muscle in exchange for their privileges.
“ If something is going on with the officer and they need assistance, you need to be there,” said Lewis, the former trusty. “If you ain’t there to help them, whether they are winning or losing, then you already know you’re next.”
Three others said trusties were rewarded, sometimes with “free world” food, for joining the violence.
“People would do just about anything for a cigarette, or a box of Church’s chicken with a honey biscuit,” said Phillip Smith, a former trusty. “That was the motivation of the Blue Wave.”
Dozens of former inmates, including many who participated in the program, said they had witnessed trusties hitting or kicking other inmates, or holding them down while guards beat them.
Of the 11 inmates who have sued the sheriff’s department since 2013, five said in their lawsuits that trusties attacked them with guards. All but one had their lawsuits dismissed.
Carvis Johnson, an inmate who had a long history of disciplinary infractions, claimed in a 2020 lawsuit that he had been beaten by guards and trusties. Court records show that Mr. Johnson settled his lawsuit, but the department declined to provide further details about the settlement.
Incident reports show that a confrontation began after Mr. Johnson shoved feces under his cell door and broke a sprinkler, flooding his cell. Trusties were brought in to clean up the mess. Guards led Mr. Johnson out of his cell and knocked him to the floor after he verbally threatened them, the reports show.
In an interview, Brock Reed, a former trusty, said a guard told a group of trusties to give Johnson “a sample” and that they should beat him because they would be the ones stuck cleaning up his mess.
Reed said the guards led Johnson to a corner widely known for being a camera blind spot. A supervisor’s routine review of the incident confirmed there was no security camera footage of what happened, in part because “hallway camera does not show where inmate was in the hall.”
When Johnson hit the floor, Reed kicked him in the hip and lower back, he said.
“I wasn’t going to be the one trusty to tell the police, ‘No, I’m not doing this,’” he said. “I know how they look at you for that.”

Christopher Mack, a former inmate, sued the department last year, claiming trusties and guards beat him in 2021. When he made bail and left the jail with twin black eyes the next day, Mack said, Sheriff Bailey approached him and asked who had caused his injuries.
“ I looked at him and said, ‘Mr. Bailey, you know who did this to me, your officers and trusties did this to me,’” Mack said.
The sheriff cursed under his breath, Mack said, and stormed off.
A battered escapee and a bragging sheriff
In September 2019, William Keith Richards found out what could happen to trusties who took advantage of their freedom.
Richards, a blue-suit, had nearly completed his sentence when he walked out of the jail one Friday. Officials did not notice he was gone until he missed church that Sunday, an incident report shows.
When Richards was caught, other blue-suit trusties were ordered to gather at a garage entrance of the jail, where Bailey berated them for not informing guards of the escape, four former trusties said in interviews.
Bailey told the trusties they should take a good look at Richards, because he was the reason they were about to lose their special privileges, two of them said.
Richards was escorted back to the jail by Deputy Wes Shivers, a 6-foot-8 former U.F.C. fighter. After they arrived, Shivers lifted the inmate into the air by his throat and choked him, said two former trusties and a former guard. In an interview, Shivers confirmed that he had returned Richards to the jail but denied choking him.

It is unclear whether Bailey saw the incident or when he left the room. Shivers said he could not recall whether the sheriff was nearby when he arrived with Richards.
A group of guards and trusties dragged Richards into the jail’s dressing room, which was known to not have cameras, and beat him, according to four former inmates familiar with the incident.
They saw Richards in the days following, and said his face was swollen and his neck was ringed with bruises.
“They did a number on him,” Reed said.
Richards declined to comment for this article, citing fears for his safety. Bailey declined a request to comment, deferring to the department’s attorney. In a statement, Dare, who called the reporting “baseless,” did not address whether Bailey was present during the incident.
The department did not produce reports detailing Richards’s capture despite repeated requests.
During email exchanges with reporters, Dedmon recounted the sheriff bragging to him and others about how Shivers had choked an inmate who had escaped.
“Bailey used to talk about it,” Dedmon wrote. “I can just remember Bailey saying, ‘Wes held him up against the wall with one hand.’”
A ‘satisfactory response’
Mississippi Today and The Times obtained formal grievance documents from lawyers who sued the department, providing a rare window into how jail officials handled inmate complaints. From 2018 to 2022, eight inmates filed grievances that described assaults by guards or trusties.
In 2022, Rives, the inmate whose jaw was broken by a guard, filed a grievance. Jail incident reports show that after Rives was struck, guards strapped him into a restraint chair overnight and then locked him in an isolation cell for 25 days. It was there where he filed his grievance, saying he had not been taken to the hospital. His jaw was infected by the time he was hospitalized and required surgery, according to medical records.
“ It never healed,” he said. “ If I take a bite out of a hamburger, it’ll lock up and pop and grind like you wouldn’t believe.”

A report from Rives’s grievance file shows that a supervisor closed his complaint three days after it had been filed, saying the department had documented the incident and provided a “satisfactory response,” which included scheduling a hospital visit for Rives and informing him that he could not press criminal charges against the guard while incarcerated.
Rives said the department did not contact him again.
The report does not indicate whether the guard who broke Rives’s jaw, Jordan McQueary, was disciplined or questioned about the incident. Rives is among at least nine inmates who have filed complaints or federal lawsuits claiming they were assaulted by McQueary, who still works at the department.
Last year, the department honored McQueary for his “outstanding” work.
He did not respond to requests for comment.
At least six other grievances were closed under similar circumstances, with no indication that the guards or trusties accused of violence were interviewed or disciplined.
Supervisors also listed “satisfactory response” as the reason for closing three other complaints. The forms do not define the term, and department representatives did not respond to requests for clarification.
Defending the trusty program
Two former trusties who spoke to Mississippi Today and The Times about their experiences said they have since been confronted by jail officials about their interviews.
John Phillips, a former trusty who said he witnessed and participated in violence between 2017 and 2021, was brought back to the Rankin County jail in August to face new criminal charges.
While there, he was taken to Vaughn’s office, where Vaughn and Dare questioned him about what he had told the publications.
Phillips then wrote and signed a statement contradicting the comments he had made to reporters. His lawyer was not present during the meeting, Phillips and Dare said.
“I never seen anything that the news reporters are talking about when spoken about inmates on inmates or the Blue Wave,” the statement reads, according to a copy provided by Dare. “There is no wrong doing at the Rankin jail or in the program.”
In a later interview, Phillips stressed that his statements to reporters had been true, and that he had felt pressured by the officials to write the letter. Dare said he had not pressured Phillips. He provided a recording of a portion of the August interaction in which Phillips says he is giving his statement voluntarily.
Dare said that he had collected similar statements from several other former trusties, but he declined to share their names.
“I sit down and try to meet with folks, figure out what they know,” he said in an interview last month. “I’m trying to defend the trusty program, that’s all.”

Ned Lamont has events planned Friday to define himself as central to continuing a fiscal recovery brought to life on his watch.,"On his first day as a formally declared candidate for reelection to a third term, Gov. Ned Lamont has events planned Friday in each of Connecticut’s five congressional districts, all in the service of defining himself as central to continuing a fiscal recovery brought to life on his watch.
“I think we’ve earned the right to actually do some bold initiatives. You know, eight years ago — $2 billion deficits, and everybody leaving the state. Then you had COVID, now you got Trump,” he said Thursday. “We’ve had a lot of stuff thrown at us over the last seven years, but we’ve also righted the ship, got our fiscal house in order.”
He begins the campaign with the advantages of wealth, incumbency and a home in a Democratic Party that dominates Connecticut politics, even if it struggles for a unifying message — or a consensus about a governor who scores well in the polls while frustrating progressives over his frugal habits.
“Yeah, the progressive wing in the legislature is obviously much more inclined to compromise on the guardrails and spend more than me or the general population,” he said. “I am in a position to point out that when I got here, state employees hadn’t gotten a raise in three years. They gotten seven in a row. The not-for-profits hadn’t seen a raise in three years. We’ve been able to keep up.”
Expect Lamont to self-fund his reelection and opt out of the state’s voluntary Citizens’ Election Program, which imposes spending limits in return for public financing: $3.2 million for a primary and $15.4 million for the general election. Lamont spent $15.1 million on his 2018 campaign and $25.7 million on his 2022 reelection.
“I just find there’s so much outside money pouring in all these races,” Lamont said. “I’m not looking outspend anybody. I’m looking to compete, but I want to make sure I’m able to compete.”
Sen. Ryan Fazio of Greenwich and former New Britain Mayor Erin Stewart, the two Republicans competing for the GOP nomination, are expected to seek public financing.
The run-up to the campaign has focused on promoting his record of the past seven years, most notably the state’s fiscal stability, as well as an early childhood trust fund that is perhaps his biggest deviation from a credo of avoiding major new expenses. The fund began with a deposit of $300 million and will bring down the costs of day care, raise salaries for providers and increase the number of available slots.
Lamont said a desire to see the fund thrive is one of the reasons he’s seeking a third term.
“I want to bring that to fruition. I don’t want that to get derailed,” he said.
On Thursday morning, he and Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz announced the state was adding up to 1,000 new spaces in January. At the press conference, Lamont said, “People do a lot of promising in this business. I also like to deliver.”
But when asked later to say what about Lamont and his record would best inform voters about what to expect in a third term, he pointed to an attitude, not an accomplishment.
“I think optimism, making people believe in this state again,” he said. “You know, we were down on ourselves. Nobody believed in the state. And that’s infectious. I’d like to think optimism is infectious as well. I think you see that reflected in people believing in the state. More people wanting to be in the state, more businesses starting in the state. And if I could say the one thing I’m proudest of — it’s a little amorphous. I can tell you about balanced budgets — but I think people believe in the state. I think people say, ‘God, there’s a real reason for me to be here in Connecticut.’”
Lamont, 71, is the first Connecticut governor to seek a third term since Republican John G. Rowland in 2002 and the oldest to seek reelection since the 76-year-old Wilbur Cross, a Democrat, lost a bid for a fifth term in 1938, when gubernatorial terms were two years.
Lamont and Bysiewicz will begin their campaign in Bridgeport with a roundtable talk on workforce development, followed by a walking tour of downtown New Haven with Mayor Justin Elicker and Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, D-3rd District. 
In Groton, they will talk about energy policy and fighting the White House over its suspension of an off-shore wind project. Then they go to Hartford for an event on rising healthcare costs, finishing the day with a campaign launch party at a brewery in Waterbury.
The campaign’s launch comes the day after a two-day special session of the General Assembly that addressed two sources of friction with some in his party: His unexpected veto in June of an omnibus housing bill and his defense of the so-called guardrails that direct a gusher of surplus dollars into a rainy day fund and an underfunded pension fund.
A revised version of the housing bill is headed to his desk, this time assured of his signature. And he agreed to at least temporarily relax the guardrails, diverting $500 million that had been bound for the pension fund into the budget reserve — a hedge against further federal shutdowns and cuts coming from President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill.”
No one says the special session resolves all those tensions, and it’s not hard to find Democratic lawmakers who question whether he ever will use what essentially is a Trump contingency fund.
“We’re empowering the governor. We’re giving him the resources to respond to [Trump’s bill] and all of the artificial crises the federal government has created,” said Sen. Matt Lesser, D-Middletown. “What he chooses to do with those resources, I think we still have a lot of questions.”
In an interview with the Connecticut Mirror, Lamont acknowledged, “Look, I’m not racing to spend $500 million.”
But he noted his willingness to spend state dollars to maintain the availability of food and heating assistance when the shutdown interrupted federal funding of SNAP and WIC food assistance and LIHEAP heating aid.
“I was ready to step up and do SNAP and WIC and LIHEAP and all the things related to the shutdown. I was ready to do that because people were desperate and they needed some security that I was going to be there, even if Donald Trump was changing his mind every two days,” Lamont said. “I am more careful when people say, ‘Let’s use these one time funds for long term expenses.’ And that will probably be a debate.”
Those “long-term expenses” are references to the possible end of tax credits that subsidize health care premiums for policies purchased on the exchanges established by the Affordable Care Act. In Connecticut alone, replacing those subsidies would be an annual cost of $350 million.
“I’ve tried to lead the conversation by saying I’m going to protect the most vulnerable,” Lamont said. “You can count upon that, and you and I may have a different definition, whether how big a commitment we’re making, but I think as a governor, that’s my obligation to make sure the most vulnerable are protected. That’s not just shut down, but that’s going forward.”
Sen. Gary Winfield, D-New Haven, who counts himself among the Democrats who wish Lamont was more aggressive in his use of surplus funds, said any tensions that Democratic lawmakers have with Lamont speak well of the party and the governor.
“I think that tension is what makes us have to negotiate and put out a better product. So I would be upset if there were no tensions,” Winfield said.
It is a contrast, he said, to the congressional Republicans in Washington who are intimidated by the president.
Lamont said he shares the anger of his party’s liberals over Trump forcing spending cuts to the federal safety net to partly finance tax cuts for some of the nation’s highest earners. 
“If I was in Washington, D.C., I never would have given a tax cut to that Mar-a-Lago crowd and pay for it by cutting the hell out of health care, SNAP benefits,” he said. But he resists imposing higher taxes on the wealthy in Connecticut, saying it would make the state less competitive.
Lamont said he is sensitive to the vast inequality in wealth in Connecticut and the U.S.
“It’s exacerbated now, because the rich are getting richer, and the middle class is not keeping up. You have a debate in our party about that, which is ‘take from the rich and give to the poor,’ and it’s all a matter how you divvy up the pie,” Lamont said. “For me, I’m always emphasizing opportunity, chance to start your own business, chance to get a raise because you get more skills, chance to own your own home. Nothing builds wealth like owning your own home, cutting taxes for the middle class, not the big shot. So, two different ways of trying to go in the same direction.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025_1002_SR_LamontPortrait_047-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-14 05:56:17.542565

Insurance rates are expected to increase by double-digit percentages as tax credits on Affordable Care Act premiums are set to expire at the end of the year.
The tax credits had been a sticking point in the shutdown fight, but the deal reached this week did not extend the credits.
Open enrollment for the Affordable Care Act began Nov. 1.
The lack of action on health insurance seems to open the door for changes experts and advocates have been fearing for months, a new health care landscape that includes increased insurance costs and much less governmental support for individuals who may not qualify for Medicaid, but still need help to afford health coverage.
“As Ohioans begin to consider coverage for 2026, they can expect to pay substantially more for their premiums on the federal marketplace,” the Health Policy Institute of Ohio said in a policy brief released this month.
An analysis by health research nonprofit KFF showed that since the introduction of the enhanced premium tax credits, enrollment in marketplace plans has “more than doubled” to more than 24 million people nationally.
Without the tax credits, KFF said annual premium payments in 2024 would have been more than 75% higher than they were.
“Enrollees with incomes about 400% of the (federal poverty line) will be subject to large increases in premium payments if enhanced premium tax credits expire,” according to KFF research.

With an annual premium increase of 18%, a 60-year-old couple making $85,000 would see annual premiums rise by an average of more than $22,000 in 2026, the KFF found.
The Health Policy Institute of Ohio said that states that run their own health marketplace expect to see premium increases of 17%, but individuals in states like Ohio, who use the federal marketplace directly, should expect to see an average jump of 30%.
The institute said the rates are the largest changes requested by insurers since 2018.
“Because those previously enrolled in marketplace coverage will likely be ineligible for Medicaid coverage because of their income level and usually do not have insurance coverage offered through their job, most will likely become uninsured,” the policy brief stated.

A recent study by the Urban Institute estimated an additional 140,000 Ohioans could be uninsured because of the tax credit expiration, pushing the uninsured rate in the state up 29%.
Those who stick with the Affordable Care Act would could see thousands of dollars in increases without the tax credits.
A 27-year-old Ohioan with a $35,000 annual income could see their premiums jump from $1,033 to $2,615.
A 35-year-old couple who makes $30,000 per year would go from paying nothing with the credit, to paying more than $1,100, according to the institute analysis, citing KFF data.
The insurance cost increases are attributed not only to a fear that with increased premiums, younger Americans will drop coverage, but also to rising hospital costs, bigger demand for “expensive pharmaceuticals” and “economic forces such as potential tariffs on medical supplies, inflation and labor shortages.”
Medicaid has already seen its share of cuts, including a ban on funding directed toward Planned Parenthood health clinics.
The cuts have caused Ohio-area affiliates to reduce staff in clinics that provide preventive care along with reproductive health access.
Planned Parenthood Southwest Ohio Region has even closed facilities due to the loss of Medicaid patients, which make up about 40% of their client population.
The changes to the Affordable Care Act credits would come despite vast public support for the renewal of the tax credits.

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)One of us first started volunteering with the New Hampshire Food Bank and its partners nearly 20 years ago.
Dan can remember busy Saturdays in the midst of the Great Recession, when we would hand out food to well over 100 people in downtown Manchester. But that was nothing like this past Saturday, when Dan and our kids helped serve an estimated 300 hungry people in Manchester, many of them children and teens. The organizers we spoke with said it was a record turnout. From the faces of people coming through the line, we sensed it was an emergency.
The word “emergency” sticks in our minds because that is what the Trump administration claimed last Friday when it urgently appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court concerning the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). As Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote on social media, the administration filed an “emergency stay application in the Supreme Court requesting immediate relief.”
Immediate relief from what? As winter was approaching and 42 million Americans in poverty were facing their first full month without food assistance, the “emergency” facing the administration was simple: a U.S. District Court’s ruling requiring it to fund SNAP benefits, consistent with an another court order the week before. The district court judge had told the administration it was “simply unacceptable” to wait any longer to fund the program “for political reasons.” He added, “Without SNAP funding for the month of November, 16 million children are immediately at risk of going hungry. This should never happen in America.”
It happened in America, the richest and most powerful nation on earth.
Even as the government reopens this week after the record-long shutdown, tens of millions of Americans — including family and friends of ours — have already experienced substantial harm due to the administration’s actions. Roughly 1 out of every 8 Americans did not receive food assistance as scheduled at the beginning of November, including some 76,000 Granite Staters. More than 41% of them are children. Many work in low-wage jobs or at home caring for children or elderly relatives. Many are veterans, homeless, living with disabilities, and no longer exempted from work requirements. Although countless nonprofits like the New Hampshire Food Bank and churches like our own are doing their level best to meet the need, they simply can’t keep up.
The question was never if the administration could fund SNAP in the midst of the government shutdown. By its own admission, executive agencies like the Department of Agriculture which administers SNAP had access to tens of billions of dollars in leftover funds, which the courts had ordered it to use to stave off widespread hunger. In fact, the administration had effectively reworked other parts of the federal budget to sustain top priorities during the shutdown like paying ICE officers to continue mass deportations, which government data show primarily target people without any criminal record.
In “emergency” times like these, people of faith like our family often turn to scripture with a greater sense of urgency. The president and many of his top officials tell us they are Christian. In fact, his recent threat to launch a “vicious” military attack on Nigeria over targeted persecution of Christians (a claim strongly rejected by Nigeria’s democratic government) appears calculated to burnish his image with conservative evangelicals.
It was the latest in a series of actions toward the African continent — including restricting refugees in favor of white Afrikaners who perpetrated apartheid in Sindiso’s native South Africa — which violate Christian notions of humanity or the African philosophy of ubuntu. Such actions, from blocking food aid for hungry Americans to threatening war against African nations that pose no threat to the United States, are the definition of inhumaneness and the opposite of Jesus’ life and teaching.
As we try, and often fail, to show our kids, following Jesus begins with loving God and other people, especially those who are hungry and in need. In fact, shortly before sacrificing his life out of love for us, Jesus taught his disciples that to follow him we must serve the poor, the foreigner, the sick, and the imprisoned.
“For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.” When the righteous people in Jesus’ parable ask, “Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?” Jesus answers simply, “Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.” (Matthew 25:31-46 NIV)
Whatever your faith, or lack thereof, we as Americans can all agree that no child should go hungry. If only our leaders saw the true emergency and responded humanely.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/foodassist-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-14 05:56:17.542565

(Getty Images.)An Ohio Senate measure updating the state’s orphan well program is getting pushback from environmentalists, counties, and farmers.
The proposal, Ohio Senate Bill 219, aims to balance money for plugging up old wells with provisions making it easier to drill new ones.
Critics argue that the balance is off — giving drillers new perks without doing enough to promote the orphan well program.
“While S.B. 219 appears to elevate and improve laws governing oil and gas operations in Ohio,” Southeast Ohio resident Roxanne Groff testified Wednesday, “the bill does just the opposite.”
But those critiques don’t appear to be landing with the bill’s sponsor, state Sen. Al Landis, R-Dover, or committee chairman, state Sen. Brian Chavez, R-Marietta.
“This whole thing has been misconstrued,” Chavez said after the hearing. “People are looking for the bad in it, and there’s no nefarious piece of this.”
The environmental critiques
The bill aims to secure funding for plugging orphan wells by creating new fund with strict limits on how and when money can be transferred out.
In particular, the bill prohibits state officials from moving dollars from the orphan well fund to the general revenue fund.
Although Groff agreed that funding “should not be ‘raided’ to make up budget deficits,” she worried the bill could tie the hands of the person heading up the oil and gas division.
“Interest funds can only be dispersed by the director, with the advice of the Technical Advisory Committee for Oil and Gas,” Groff noted.
Six members of that eight-member panel come from oil and gas companies.
Groff noted the governor vetoed a similar provision in last summer’s budget.
“I can only hope that he vetoes this bill also,” she said.
Groff called another provision “excessive” which allows drillers to demand expedited review of their applications 10 times in a calendar year.
As recently as 2022, she said, agency officials wrote new rules to increase public participation for injection wells used to dispose of drilling waste.
“This bill would seem to eliminate that if a company requested an expedited permit,” Gross said.
Ohio state senator proposes dedicated well-plugging fund, other regulatory changes

In an earlier hearing, Cathy Cowan Becker from Save Ohio Parks noted the bill shortens the timeline for reviewing nominations and bids to frack beneath state land.
Instead of 180 days to review a nomination the commission has 90.
Rather than putting the parcel out for bid the following quarter, the commission would have to post it immediately and choose a winner in 60 days.
After that, state officials would have just 30 days to complete lease.
Becker said that turnaround is “unreasonably short.”
“The people have 45 days to submit comments about fracking nominations,” she said, “However, we are often not informed of such nominations until days, even weeks, after they have been received.”
County and farmer pushback
Meanwhile, the County Commissioners Association of Ohio and the Ohio Farm Bureau had pushed lawmakers to remove a provision making road-use agreements voluntary.
The commissioners association explained that local governments maintain 83% of Ohio’s road miles.
“These local roads are not designed for the constant movement of heavy industrial traffic associated with horizontal drilling operations — vehicles hauling water, sand, equipment, and production waste,” the group testified.
“Even limited activity of this nature can cause substantial degradation of rural roads.”
Evan Callicoat from the Ohio Farm Bureau on Wednesday thanked lawmakers for restoring road use agreements in the latest version of the bill. But he raised two other quibbles as well.
The measure reduces the statute of limitations for terminating an oil and gas lease.
The current 21-year statute of limitations gives homeowners a significant stretch of time to claim a lease has expired due to lack of production.
The bill would reduce that term to three years which the Farm Bureau opposes.
Another provision tweaks a driller’s responsibilities when dealing with several landowners ‘unitized’ into one drilling lease.
Callicoat said it looks like lawmakers want to ensure agreements with individual landowners can’t violate an order from state regulators, “which we totally understand and support.”
But as written, he worries it would allow drillers to disregard agreements so long as they comply with regulatory orders.
“If a well owner agrees to certain terms with specific landowners in a given pool, they should be required to follow those provisions,” Callicoat said.
‘Misnomers and misinformation’
Speaking after the hearing, Chavez and Landis defended the legislation and noted some of the changes were recommendations from the chief of the state’s division of oil and gas.
Chavez explained that previously companies could ask for an unlimited number of expedited permits, “and there were some companies that were abusing that system.”
“(That) clogs it up,” Landis chimed in.
To avoid the logjam, Chavez went on, the division stopped offering any expedited permits.
To him, 10 expedited permits a year feels like a reasonable compromise.
“But it doesn’t circumvent — and that was a misnomer in the testimony there — it doesn’t circumvent anything in the process. It just says it goes to the front of the line,” he said. “It still has to comply with everything in that permitting process and approval process.”
“There’s a lot of misnomers and misinformation on the testimonies,” Chavez claimed. “And our job is not to correct them up here — we’re to listen.”
What they’re hearing is making some difference, at least at the margins.
An amendment adopted Wednesday gives priority to plugging orphan wells near injection wells.
Are those wells more dangerous or less stable?
“In my opinion, no,” Chavez said, but some stakeholders had expressed that concern.
Orphan wells are often old and relatively shallow, he said, while injection wells are relatively deep.
“There’s multiple layers of separation,” he said. “But you know, if there are concerns, we’re just saying, hey, add that to your priority list. Instead of plugging wells out in the middle of the woods, let’s make sure we plug around here to allay any fears that there may be.”

When news happens, which it does all day every day, they gird themselves to report and write a story. If they finish an in-depth project or especially artful investigation, they are allowed to luxuriate in their achievement for a few minutes before an editor inquires: “What do you have for me today?”
I’m not asking for anyone’s pity. Journalists either enjoy or grudgingly accept this reality, depending on temperament. But it’s also why the induction of Kansas Reflector senior reporter Tim Carpenter into the Kansas Press Association’s Newspaper Hall of Fame on Thursday was so deeply jarring. You see, I don’t think of Tim as a Hall of Famer. I don’t think of him as a portrait on a wall alongside other Kansas journalism greats like William Allen White, Rolla Clymer, and four generations of Scotts and Lynns at The Iola Register.
I think of Tim as a damn fine reporter who’s going to uncover something today. And tomorrow, if we’re lucky. He’s rock solid. He’s tenacious.
And he never stops writing stories.
Tim lives and works in the present. I don’t want to think of him as a relic of the past. Just this week, the same week that he was inducted into the Hall of Fame, Tim has written five stories. He covered the response of Kansas senators and representatives in Washington, D.C., to the end of the longest shutdown on record. He followed up on fallout from former Beneficient CEO Brad Heppner’s indictment. Just to top things off, he covered multiple sets of findings  from state auditors.

This is not a man who rests on his laurels. This is a man who doesn’t know what laurels are.
Let’s talk numbers for a second. This column counts as my 484th piece since beginning at the Reflector in August 2021. That sounds impressive enough, and I occasionally share my tally to impress others. But Tim, who has been present since the Reflector’s founding in July 2020, has written an astonishing 2,248 stories.
All of this has only been the latest act of a distinguished career. Here’s where the history comes in, the looking back, which I’m sure makes him feel a bit uncomfortable. Tim attended Kansas State  University, then worked at United Press International. He followed up with stints at the Lawrence Journal-World and The Topeka Capital-Journal, where Reflector editor Sherman Smith and I both came to know him.
What’s Tim Carpenter like? He’s just “Carp,” to use the nickname that so many have employed over the years.
He’s the kind of dedicated professional you would hope. He carries a healthy skepticism of editors, no doubt forged from decades of battling them to protect his reporting. He has a dry sense of humor, a library of extraordinary anecdotes (seriously, ask him about the voodoo priestess) and an uneasy relationship with technology that hasn’t prevented him from prolifically posting TikTok videos.
Most of all, though, Tim cares.
He cares about the art and craft of journalism. He cares about his family. He cares about the state of Kansas.
While I have known many gifted writers and reporters, none have matched Tim’s ferocious caring. When Sherman Smith takes an all-too-rare vacation from his duties as editor, I fill in as best I can. When I call Tim to ask what he’s working on, I know he will share an array of potential stories with an excitement and energy that puts colleagues 40 years his junior to shame. Sorry, kids, that’s just the truth,
As he said to the crowd gathered in Topeka: “Almost everything that I treasure in life came from journalism. My family, a career, a path. When I looked at the people in the hall of fame, I saw a bunch of names I recognized. I worked with, competed against, learned from about two dozen of those people, and I’m just really honored to be part of the group.”
Over my career, I’ve come to recognize that a precious few people are born to be journalists. They are born to be reporters. They are born to do this work.
Tim Carpenter is one of those people.
Kansas is lucky to have him. Kansas Reflector readers are lucky to have him. Congratulations to the Kansas Newspaper Hall of Fame’s latest, most deserving member.

“Time flies,” “time waits for no one,” “as time goes on”: The way we speak about time tends to strongly imply that the passage of time is some sort of real process that happens out there in the world. We inhabit the present moment and move through time, even as events come and go, fading into the past.
But go ahead and try to actually verbalize just what is meant by the flow or passage of time. A flow of what? Rivers flow because water is in motion. What does it mean to say that time flows?
Events are more like happenings than things, yet we talk as though they have ever-changing locations in the future, present or past. But if some events are future, and moving toward you, and some past, moving away, then where are they? The future and past don’t seem to have any physical location.
Human beings have been thinking about time for as long as we have records of humans thinking about anything at all. The concept of time inescapably permeates every single thought you have about yourself and the world around you. That’s why, as a philosopher, philosophical and scientific developments in our understanding of time have always seemed especially important to me.
 Ancient philosophers on time


Ancient philosophers were very suspicious about the whole idea of time and change. Parmenides of Elea was a Greek philosopher of the sixth to fifth centuries BCE. Parmenides wondered, if the future is not yet and the past is not anymore, how could events pass from future to present to past?
He reasoned that, if the future is real, then it is real now; and, if what is real now is only what is present, the future is not real. So, if the future is not real, then the occurrence of any present event is a case of something inexplicably coming from nothing.
Parmenides wasn’t the only skeptic about time. Similar reasoning regarding contradictions inherent in the way we talk about time appears in Aristotle, in the ancient Hindu school known as the Advaita Vedanta and in the work of Augustine of Hippo, also known as St. Augustine, just to name a few.
 Einstein and relativity

The early modern physicist Isaac Newton had presumed an unperceived yet real flow of time. To Newton, time is a dynamic physical phenomenon that exists in the background, a regular, ticking universe-clock in terms of which one can objectively describe all motions and accelerations.
Then, Albert Einstein came along.
In 1905 and 1915, Einstein proposed his special and general theories of relativity, respectively. These theories validated all those long-running suspicions about the very concept of time and change.
Relativity rejects Newton’s notion about time as a universal physical phenomenon.
By Einstein’s era, researchers had shown that the speed of light is a constant, regardless of the velocity of the source. To take this fact seriously, he argued, is to take all object velocities to be relative.
Nothing is ever really at rest or really in motion; it all depends on your “frame of reference.” A frame of reference determines the spatial and temporal coordinates a given observer will assign to objects and events, on the assumption that he or she is at rest relative to everything else.
Someone floating in space sees a spaceship going by to the right. But the universe itself is completely neutral on whether the observer is at rest and the ship is moving to the right, or if the ship is at rest with the observer moving to the left.
This notion affects our understanding of what clocks actually do. Because the speed of light is a constant, two observers moving relative to each other will assign different times to different events.
In a famous example, two equidistant lightning strikes occur simultaneously for an observer at a train station who can see both at once. An observer on the train, moving toward one lightning strike and away from the other, will assign different times to the strikes. This is because one observer is moving away from the light coming from one strike and toward the light coming from the other. The other observer is stationary relative to the lightning strikes, so the respective light from each reaches him at the same time. Neither is right or wrong.
How much time elapses between events, and what time something happens, depends on the observer’s frame of reference. Observers moving relative to each other will, at any given moment, disagree on what events are happening now; events that are happening now according to one observer’s reckoning at any given moment will lie in the future for another observer, and so on.
Under relativity, all times are equally real. Everything that has ever happened or ever will happen is happening now for a hypothetical observer. There are no events that are either merely potential or a mere memory. There is no single, absolute, universal present, and thus there is no flow of time as events supposedly “become” present.
Change just means that the situation is different at different times. At any moment, I remember certain things. At later moments, I remember more. That’s all there is to the passage of time. This doctrine, widely accepted today among both physicists and philosophers, is known as “eternalism”.
This brings us to a pivotal question: If there is no such thing as the passage of time, why does everyone seem to think that there is?
 Time as a psychological projection

One common option has been to suggest that the passage of time is an “illusion” – exactly as Einstein famously described it at one point.
Calling the passage of time “illusory” misleadingly suggests that our belief in the passage of time is a result of misperception, as though it were some sort of optical illusion. But I think it’s more accurate to think of this belief as resulting from misconception.
As I propose in my book “A Brief History of the Philosophy of Time,” our sense of the passage of time is an example of psychological projection – a type of cognitive error that involves misconceiving the nature of your own experience.
The classic example is color. A red rose is not really red, per se. Rather, the rose reflects light at a certain wavelength, and a visual experience of this wavelength may give rise to a feeling of redness. My point is that the rose is neither really red nor does it convey the illusion of redness.
The red visual experience is just a matter of how we process objectively true facts about the rose. It’s not a mistake to identify a rose by its redness; the rose enthusiast isn’t making a deep claim about the nature of color itself.
Similarly, my research suggests that the passage of time is neither real nor an illusion: It’s a projection based on how people make sense of the world. I can’t really describe the world without the passage of time any more than I can describe my visual experience of the world without referencing the color of objects.
I can say that my GPS “thinks” I took a wrong turn without really committing myself to my GPS being a conscious, thinking being. My GPS has no mind, and thus no mental map of the world, yet I am not wrong in understanding its output as a valid representation of my location and my destination.
Similarly, even though physics leaves no room for the dynamic passage of time, time is effectively dynamic to me as far as my experience of the world is concerned.
The passage of time is inextricably bound up with how humans represent our own experiences. Our picture of the world is inseparable from the conditions under which we, as perceivers and thinkers, experience and understand the world. Any description of reality we come up with will unavoidably be infused with our perspective. The error lies in confusing our perspective on reality with reality itself.

Adrian Smith and Mike Flood at St. Teresa Catholic School in Lincoln on Sep. 29, 2025. (Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)This year, Congress enacted a law that allows American taxpayers in participating states to take up to $1,700 a year in federal tax credits for donating to organizations providing scholarships for students to attend private and religious K-12 schools.
Before Nebraska taxpayers would be allowed to claim this federal tax credit, the federal law required that governors approve of state participation, and Nebraska’s did. Gov. Jim Pillen’s decision to do so has resulted in some criticism.
However, the critics missed something vital.
In my opinion, most Nebraskans would rather keep their federal tax dollars in Nebraska, where they could help employ Nebraska private school teachers and administrators and provide income to businesses that sell equipment and services to schools.
Some, including Nebraska Examiner columnist George Ayoub, argue that last November’s vote against a state-funded school voucher law means that a majority of Nebraskans oppose state taxpayers taking advantage of this new federal tax credit.
But the fact that a majority of Nebraskans voted against state-funded scholarships for K-12 students says nothing about how they feel about the federal tax credit program, which involves no expenditures from state income, sales or property taxes.
Under the federal tax credit program, Nebraskans who owe federal income taxes can either send $1,700 to the federal government, or they can donate that $1,700 to a qualified scholarship granting organization right here in Nebraska.
That money flowing to private schools will also flow through to the employees and businesses that help the schools do their work, people who pay Nebraska state income taxes, and they will increase Nebraska tax revenues.
As those employees and businesses spend that money on food, housing, healthcare and so forth, it will generate more economic activity and more sales and income tax revenue that can then be used to support public K-12 schools.
In addition, every K-12 student in a private school is one less student whose education must be provided at the expense of payers of Nebraska property, income and sales taxes, thus saving Nebraska taxpayers money.
Federal tax dollars are already used to provide scholarships to college students at private and religious schools, including Pell grants. So it is difficult to understand the objection to using what would otherwise become federal tax dollars to provide scholarships for K-12 students at private and religious schools.
Perhaps opponents of the governor’s decision to allow Nebraskans to benefit from the federal tax credit could bring an initiative petition to overturn Pillen’s decision.
If so, the question for Nebraskans will be, “Do you want to send more tax dollars to Washington or keep those tax dollars here in Nebraska, where they will strengthen our economy, increase state tax revenues and further support K-12 public schools?”",https://nebraskaexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_1096-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-14 04:58:01.515352
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-14 06:21:11+00:00,CT Mirror,Housing bill gets final approval from CT Senate in special session,Ginny Monk,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/14/ct-senate-final-approval-housing-bill/,Housing has long been a politically charged issue in Connecticut and one of the issues that most divides Republicans and Democrats.,"Even as the Senate gave final passage to a new version of a wide-ranging housing bill Friday, political tensions simmered in Hartford over the two-day special session.
The Senate approved the measure early Friday morning on a 24-10 vote. All four Democrats who voted against a former version switched their votes, and no Republicans voted for the bill. The measure, which the House of Representatives approved on Wednesday, next heads to Lamont’s desk. The governor is expected to sign it.
Housing has long been a politically charged issue in Connecticut and one of the issues that most divides Republicans and Democrats.
Lamont’s veto of House Bill 5002, a sweeping housing bill passed by Democrats during the regular session, damaged his relationship with many lawmakers from his own party. The governor said he wanted to get towns on board, and called for a special session to pass a negotiated version of the bill.
While some said they’re glad to see the finished compromise bill and thankful that the governor stuck with negotiations, for other senators, that relationship remains strained.
House Bill 8002 requires towns to create housing growth plans, changes minimum off-street parking requirements, expands fair rent commissions and incentivizes towns to take steps to allow more housing, among other measures.
“We’re on the verge of passing a major housing bill that will impact the lives of the people of Connecticut in a very positive way,” said Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, noting that other states have passed major housing reform legislation over the past few years. “Our goal is to join with them, understanding this crisis and the nature of this crisis and working to be more proactive and not just reactive.”
Lamont has touted the new housing bill as a compromise. His administration has also put millions in bonding money into building more housing. Lamont pointed to the mayors who ultimately endorsed the revised bill.
“I think we got a pretty good balance. Like I said, ‘Towns take the lead, give these mayors the incentives.’ They stood up, Republicans and Democrats said, ‘We have the incentives we need.’”
But Republicans in the House and Senate objected to both the content of the housing bill and the process — running it in special session, with less time for debate and outside of the normal political process. The bill produced moments of heated debate between the parties over the last two days.
In the House, one Republican was chastised over what Speaker of the House Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said were personal attacks.
While the rest of the bill saw little or no changes, many of the most substantive pieces around zoning were changed in the compromised version, particularly the portions that drew objections from local leaders. Members of the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities and Council of Small Towns spoke at a press conference last week in support of the new bill.
The bill requires that towns, either by themselves or with their regional councils of government, create housing growth plans that include a number of units set as a goal to plan and zone for. 
By complying with this section of the law, towns have access to new state money and get increased reimbursement rates for school construction projects. They can also access those benefits by following certain parameters to increase housing density near public transit or by joining the Connecticut Municipal Development Authority to allow more housing in downtowns and near transit.
It also includes parameters to allow conversion of commercial properties to residential without special hearings before planning and zoning commissions, although towns can require that the first floor stay commercial.
It eliminates minimum off-street parking requirements for new apartments of up to 16 units, although towns can require parking assessments and additional parking in two zones of the town not amounting to more than 8% of the land.
And it establishes the Department of Housing as a housing authority that can develop affordable housing on state land and work with towns to build. 
Debate began Thursday evening and ended early Friday morning.
“The bottom line is we have a moral obligation to create more housing,” said Planning and Development Committee co-chair Sen. MD Rahman, D-Manchester. “We have a moral obligation to bring people inside from cold weather.”
Republicans criticized the use of a special session as well as the contents of the bill, saying it dilutes local control.
“I truly believe that this is going to be a bill that we look back upon as a monumental step in the implementation of statewide zoning efforts,” said Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield.
Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, said housing is such an important issue as a matter of statewide policy “that it has to be regarded as something that, in many cases, would vault above and supersede local authority.”
Housing Committee ranking member Rob Sampson, R-Wolcott, questioned whether the state actually has a lack of affordable housing. Numerous studies have shown the state has an acute shortage of housing units.
“Is there something you can show me that says that we actually have a substantial shortage of housing?” Sampson asked Duff during debate. Sampson said he had found over 2,000 rental units available online.
“We’re just going to disagree, and that’s OK. You can keep asking me the same question and I’ll give you the same answer,” Duff replied, and pointed to a study released by an outside consultant earlier this year that showed that Connecticut had the most constrained housing market in the nation.
Duff said he thinks the bill will help get more housing built in the state.
Housing Committee co-chair Sen. Martha Marx, D-New London, said in an interview that she worries that the new bill doesn’t have the “urgency” that the old bill did. She liked that it gave towns numbers, a goal to work for, and fears that delays before housing growth plans are due will leave Connecticut residents suffering.
“The fact that we’re waiting years now to get these housing growth plans, that worries me,” Marx said. “I just want affordable housing to be built. I want people to have roofs over their heads.”
She added that she doesn’t think the bill has repaired her relationship with Lamont.
“I still haven’t quite gotten over the fact that the governor vetoed it,” she said.
Sen. Saud Anwar, D-South Windsor, said after the housing veto and discussions over spending in the wake of federal cuts, he wonders whether Lamont “is even in touch with the reality of what the people in the state of Connecticut are experiencing.
“I think the number of people who are experiencing unhoused status and homelessness is increasing in our state. For a state which is one of the richest per capita in the United States and also of the richest country in the world, to allow that to happen and not have an intervention, and despite multiple advocates, community members, reaching out to the governor, and his unwillingness to address this in a meaningful manner is painful to me,” Anwar said Thursday, of the veto.
The governor did not directly answer when asked if the passage of the housing bill would ease tensions with the lawmakers who were furious at his unexpected veto.
“I think we have a pretty good working relationship, I really do,” he said. “[Chief of staff Matthew] Brokman helps by the way. Everybody knows him, trusts him.”
Rob Blanchard, a spokesman for the governor, said in a statement that “the status quo is unsustainable and no solution is possible without local leaders stepping up.” Lamont has met over the past several months with municipal leaders, bipartisan lawmakers and nonprofits to “craft a plan that gives communities the tools to build housing on their own terms,” Blanchard added.
“While some lawmakers would rather legislate in the press or put more energy into floor theatrics than actual solutions, the Governor is grateful to those who showed up ready to work,” Blanchard said. “By strengthening this bill, he’s listening to residents who want lower rents, families who need a home they can afford, and businesses need to house their employees.”
Sen. Gary Winfield, D-New Haven, said while there may be frustrations at the governor about the veto, that tension is healthy. He pointed to the federal government, where legislative Republicans are broadly in lock-step with the president.
“The legislature is trying to express the will of the people as they see it, and the governor is doing what he sees as the right thing,” Winfield said. “And that tension brings us to a place where, if we get it right, and I’m not always saying we do, but if we get it right, we got it right because of the tension.”
Duff said he was focused on the end result.
“There’s always going to be tensions between legislative and executive to get something done, but we’re getting it done today, and I think that’s the most important thing, the end product,” Duff said.
The 2026 gubernatorial election has also cast a shadow over the housing bill debate. While Lamont said he vetoed the original bill because he wanted to get towns and cities on board, his emails and text messages show the two-term governor got advice about the political implications of signing a bill that many opposed.
Sen. Ryan Fazio, R-Greenwich, who has already announced his campaign for governor, said the new housing bill doesn’t address problems with 8-30g, a decades-old state housing law that offers developers court remedies when their affordable housing proposals are denied. He also criticized the process of passing the bill and said there might have been portions he could support if there had been more time for debate.
“Regardless of the merits, this is no way to lead a state government. There is no justification for it,” said Fazio.
Housing, and particularly 8-30g, was a major issue during the last gubernatorial campaign, and has been ranked by Connecticut residents in a recent poll as one of the most important issues facing the state.
During Wednesday’s House debate on the bill, Housing Committee ranking member Rep. Tony Scott, R-Monroe, was reprimanded by Ritter for what Ritter said were personal comments about other lawmakers.
“I don’t know how somebody could put their head on the pillow at the end of the night and say ‘We did a good job,’” Scott said. “It’s shady, it’s not transparent, it’s not being a leader.”
He also called out a lawmaker who he said “went behind the scenes” and said “stuff that is not what they vote,” referring to Rep. Jennifer Leeper, D-Fairfield. Leeper voted no on the first housing bill, then texted Lamont urging him to sign it. She said later that she wanted him to sign it, then use a special session to make changes.
Scott called on Lamont to veto the new bill.
“Let’s see if the governor listens to the people again,” Scott said. “Let’s see what kind of backbone he actually does have. We all know he flip flops on a lot of things. It goes based on the wind, who’s talking to him last.”
Senators had a similar exchange early in the debate when Sampson suggested that Democrats wanted to run the bill after the party did well in municipal elections last week.
“There was a positive result for the majority in the most recent election, and they feel like now is the time to move this overreaching piece of government-growing legislation that will have zero positive impact on the renters in the state of Connecticut but will benefit certain parties for sure,” Sampson said.
“I take exception to questioning my motives and the motives of the majority when it comes to doing this bill and how the election came out on Nov. 4, and I would ask that we not question our motives during this debate,” Duff responded.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-14 05:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Why biodegradable plastic should be on the menu!,Shuresh Ghimire,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/14/why-biodegradable-plastic-should-be-on-the-menu/,"Surely the richest food system on earth should be able to trade a plastic that lasts 300 years for one that quickly returns to the soil,","Do you want to hear about a strange journey of a single plastic film, as I have witnessed it, first as a child in rural Nepal, and now as a vegetable specialist in the United States?
I grew up where a plastic grocery bag was a treasure. When my mother found one, she folded it like fine linen and used it at least three times: rice today, lentils next week, and mustard greens the following month, until the handles finally gave up or there was a big hole. At the end of its life, a man on a bicycle would ride through our village, trading the torn plastic bag and other scraps for potatoes for a head of cauliflower. Nothing was “single-use.” It was resourcefulness by necessity.
Fast-forward to American supermarkets in 2025: the average plastic grocery bag is used for about 12 minutes, just long enough to move from the store to your kitchen counter, then it becomes trash destined to persist for up to 300 years in landfills or as wind-blown litter.
Then came the “reusable” fix: ban the thinnest bags, sell shoppers thicker plastic bags that, in theory, can be reused and recycled. But who really reuses them? Be honest: how often do you remember to bring your plastic bags back to the store? Most of us don’t, including myself, despite the pile of bags at my garage door. The outcome is poor: total plastic used per checkout has increased because the replacement bags are three to four times thicker than the single-use bags, and they end up as trash without being reused. 
The lesson is plain: if the fix relies only on wishful consumer behavior, it’s unlikely to be very effective. So who benefits and who loses? Manufacturers benefit from selling heavier bags; the public pays for waste fees, and microplastics persist in soil and water for up to 300 years.
There is, however, one plastic story that gives me hope because it is grounded in horticulture, my specialty: soil-biodegradable mulch (BDM). 
For those who don’t farm, plastic mulch is a thin film laid across beds to warm soil, conserve moisture, and suppress weeds. The conventional mulch version, polyethylene (PE), works perfectly for horticultural benefits but creates headaches environmentally. It must be pulled, removed, and landfilled (or worse, burned in some places or stockpiled) at season’s end. By contrast, BDMs are engineered to deliver the same horticultural benefits and then be tilled in and broken down by microbes in the soil over time. Research across many regions shows that BDMs match PE in yield and weed control performance, occasionally outperforming it and, at worst, coming close behind.


Indeed, a roll of BDM costs more upfront, but that’s not the full picture. What really matters is the total system cost. When you count the labor to pull PE, machinery time, and trucking and tipping fees, BDM comes closer to the cost of PE use. Recent extension economics from Washington State University lay out exactly how the savings from not removing and landfilling PE can offset the higher purchase price of BDM. Case studies in Tennessee and Washington show scenarios with similar or even improved net returns.
What about soil health and decomposition? Long-term research teams from UConn, Washington State University, University of Tennessee, and beyond have tracked what happens when BDM fragments are tilled in year after year. The emerging picture is reassuring that the degradation proceeds under field conditions, with recovery of only few residual fragments a couple of years after incorporation, and soil health indicators are mostly driven by climate and site, not by whether mulch was PE or BDM. Is decomposition instantaneous? No, and it depends on climate, soil microbes, and the specific polymer blend of the BDM.
Over the last decade, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has invested many millions of dollars to study BDM, from lab tests to field trials to farm budgets. That is great news, and we should be funding this kind of practical, science-based work. But policy has not kept up with the evidence. In organic farming, the rules say biodegradable mulch is allowed only if the film is fully bio-based. No mulch can meet that standard, and in practice, that rule acts like a ban even though BDMs on the market today meet the biodegradability standards. The result is that organic growers, who could benefit most from better weed control with less plastic waste, have fewer choices.
I hear another argument: “compostable” bags tear and are made from petroleum-derived components, and so aren’t they just as bad or even worse? Some biodegradable polymers are fossil-derived (e.g., PBAT), and some are biobased (e.g., PLA, PHA). The relevant comparison is not biobased versus petrochemicals, it’s whether the film biodegrades in the intended environment without accumulating as plastic pollution. If a plastic polymer blend that is 20% biobased and 80% fossil-derived meets the biodegradability standard, this beats a 100% fossil PE film for persistence, microplastic generation, labor, and landfill use.
From Nepal to the Pacific Northwest to New England, I’ve seen plastics used frugally, used wastefully, and used wisely. I think BDMs are “wise use”: they deliver horticultural benefits and cut the ugliest part of plastic’s end-of-life. The USDA helped prove that through research. The USDA could now take the important next step of aligning organic standards with the science and growers’ feedback.
Third-party standards already exist to ensure mulch films truly biodegrade in soil and meet soil-safety (toxicity) limits, and we can get into those details next time. For now, my recommendation to USDA is that the “fully biobased” standard for organic use should be revised to reflect what is feasible now or in the near future, while ensuring transparency through accurate labeling, including third-party certification.
If we could trade a torn grocery bag for potatoes in a village without paved roads, surely the richest food system on earth should be able to trade a plastic that lasts 300 years for one that quickly returns to the soil, or at least give consumers the choice to do so. The choice is not between perfect and nothing; it’s about giving the earth, consumers, and our children a better choice.

Sears/Maryland Matters)Republicans in the General Assembly said they will propose legislation to limit partisan redistricting, by creating a new independent redistricting commission and by codifying part of a 2022 court ruling that called for compact districts with commonsense boundaries.
The legislation, which would also prohibit mid-decade redistricting, was previewed by minority party leaders Thursday, one day after a special Governor’s Redistricting Advisory Commission met to begin the process of a possible mid-decade partisan redistricting.
“We believe that there’s a more fair and principled way to do this than what the governor is proposing,” said House Minority Leader Del. Jason C. Buckel (R-Allegany). “That’s why we’ll intend to be offering again, either at a special session or in the beginning of the 2026 session, the Fair Districts for Maryland Act.”
Buckel unveiled highlights of the plan with Senate Minority Leader Stephen S. Hershey Jr (R-Upper Shore) and Del. Jesse T. Pippy (R-Frederick) and Sen. Justin Ready (R-Frederick and Carroll), the minority whips in the House and Senate, respectively.
The Republican news conference followed Wednesday’s organizational meeting of the Governor’s Redistricting Advisory Committee, which is scheduled to begin taking public testimony in a virtual meeting Friday, and again Tuesday.
The five-member commission appointed by Gov. Wes Moore (D) is on a fast track to make a recommendation on congressional redistricting, possibly in time for a special legislative session in the next few weeks.

“It’s disappointing to say at least that the governor is even going down this route, and we know exactly why he’s doing it,” Pippy told reporters. “We think it’s wrong, and that’s why we’re putting forth a plan to address this.”
Many lawmakers on both sides of the aisle believe the commission will lead to a special session next month. Moore has not committed to calling a special session.
If Moore calls the House and Senate back, it would be the first special session since 2021, when lawmakers met for three days in December to redraw the congressional districts based on the 2020 U.S. Census.
The latest Republican proposal, as described, is based on previous legislation and a 2022 court ruling that struck down a version of the current congressional maps. It will also include language prohibiting future attempts at midcycle redistricting.
“First thing it will do is it will put into statute and affirm once and for all that the redistricting process is a once-a-decade process,” Buckel said. “Those will be the maps that get adopted as a result of that commission. They will last until the next United States Census.
“There won’t be this every two years, every four years, every five years, depending upon how the political winds blow, ability to go in and sort of mess with the maps and change people’s expectations,” he said.
Buckel said partisan redistricting is now driven by computer programmers who use voter registration and voting patterns to craft districts that resemble “some absurd crayon drawing.”
So a second part of the latest GOP bill reworks Republican former Gov. Larry Hogan’s proposal to create an independent redistricting commission. That plan, which called for a panel of Democrats, Republicans and independents not appointed by elected officials, was “a little complicated,” in Buckel’s words, and never made it out of committee.
Republicans now envision a commission drawn from the two major parties and unaffiliated voters, but “the voting strength of the system will be set up so that no one party can run roughshod over the other,” Buckel said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Finally, the bill would codify part of a 2022 ruling that struck down the original set of maps drawn by the Legislative Redistricting Advisory Committee. Seven of the state’s eight districts in that plan favored Democrats and the eighth, the Eastern Shore-based 1st District, was drawn in such a way that it was more of a tossup than a solid Republican district that edged over the Bay Bridge into Annapolis to capture more Democratic voters.
Judge Lynn Battaglia struck that version down as “extreme partisan gerrymandering.” Her ruling mandated congressional maps to be compact and respect natural and political boundaries. The Maryland Constitution standard had at the time only applied to legislative districts.
Battaglia’s novel standard never made it to the Supreme Court of Maryland for review — lawmakers crafted a compromise map instead that cemented the current 7-1 split.
The Republican plan faces an uphill slog just to get to the floor, especially in a special session where alternative proposals and off-topic bills are typically sent to a rules committee to die.
The Democratic majority in the Senate appears, at least for now, to be uninterested in taking up mid-cycle redistricting. Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) said he and a majority of the 34-member Democratic Caucus do not support the midcycle redistricting being pushed by the governor. A Ferguson spokesperson declined to comment Thursday on the Republican plan.
Maryland is one of a growing number of states considering midcycle changes to its congressional districts, as parties jockey for any advantage ahead of the 2026 congressional elections.
Moore appointed a commission to review the issue. He and his handpicked panel claim the goal is to ensure the state’s three-year old districts are fair. But the panel, chaired by U.S. Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.),got off to a rocky start in its first meeting Wednesday.

“It’s probably one of the most disorganized kickoff meetings and organizational meetings that we’ve ever seen,” Hershey told reporters. “I think that’s because … governor has given no clear direction on what he wants this commission to do with respect to how they’re going to go out to the public, what they’re going to ask, what they’re going to show, or what is even going to be resolved by this commission.”
A second virtual meeting is scheduled for Friday at 4 p.m.
“This redistricting effort by Gov. Wes Moore is living up to the kabuki theater we expected,” Delegate Kathy Szeliga (R-Baltimore County), vice chair of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus,  in a statement.
“Scheduling a Zoom hearing on a Friday at 4:00 p.m. is intentionally inconvenient, just as people are finishing their work week and heading home to their families, not preparing for a multi-hour hearing,” Szeliga’s statement said. “Everyone knows that’s also the classic time to dump news the administration doesn’t want anyone to notice. This process is anything but accessible and transparent.”
Szeliga was a party in the successful 2022 redistricting lawsuit, and she said last week she plans on going to court to block any midcycle map that eliminates Republican representation.
Maryland’s mid-decade redistricting effort comes after Texas kicked off a redistricting effort that benefited Republicans. California followed with a process that benefited the Democratic Party, and other states have followed suit.
Moore has not been been specific about how the current congressional district maps are inequitable. He has said he wants to “pressure test” the state’s three-year-old maps. But he also linked the effort to the national partisan push.
“My commitment stays firm that we are going to make sure that we have fair maps inside the state of Maryland, and we are not going to bend the knee to Donald Trump,” Moore said at the end of October. He added that “a special session is not off the table, regardless of what anyone else says.”
Such an effort would likely focus on a redraw that would make the state’s only Republican held congressional seat more politically hospitable to a Democratic Party challenge.
Ready said “it’s absolutely the wrong thing to try to squelch the small amount of voice for a minority party in the state.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSC_4989-1024x681.jpeg,,,2025-11-14 05:56:17.542565

Smith Jr. (D-Montgomery) speaks about juvenile justice Thursday at a Georgetown University forum with Kris Henning (right), a Georgetown law professor, moderated by Marc Schindler, the former assistant secretary at Maryland Department of Juvenile Services. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Sen. William C. Smith Jr. (D-Montgomery) will try again to convince his legislative colleagues that automatically charging youth as adults for some offenses affects the youths both physically and emotionally.
If tugging at their heartstrings doesn’t work, he has the financial argument as backup: Doing away with the practice would save about $17 million a year, money that could be used for treatment.
“You’re not going to get services. You’re not going to get treatment. You’re going to miss school,” Smith said Thursday of youth, who can spend up to 180 days housed in adult jails while awaiting trial.
Smith said about 85% of those cases will be dismissed or sent back down to juvenile court, “so even from a technocratic efficiency piece, we’re just doing this the wrong way. If you apply that same logic to any other element of government or any other private enterprise, you say, ‘Fix it.’”
He was speaking as part of a panel Thursday at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy in Washington, D.C. The conversation titled “National Roundtable on Prosecuting Youth as Adults – Policy, Research and Practice” focused on a simple message: stop prosecuting youth as adults.
That was the goal of a bill Smith introduced in the 2025 legislative session in Annapolis. That bill would have raised the age at which a youth would be tried as an adult from 14 to 16. It also would have made those 16 and younger eligible for juvenile court if charged with crimes that include first-degree assault, third-degree sex offense and certain offenses involving firearms.
Juvenile justice commission wants to stop automatically charging youth as adults

But critics at the time said there are some crimes, and some youths, who should be tried in the adult system. While prosecutors could petition to move some youth to adult court, that needlessly adds time to the process and endangers public safety by letting those youth start in the juvenile system, they said.
Neither Smith’s bill, nor a companion House bill, made it out of committee. But Smith said he is determined to try again in 2026.
Smith was on a panel with Georgetown law professor Kris Henning that was moderated by Marc Schindler, former assistant secretary and chief of staff with the Maryland Department of Juvenile Services (DJS).
A second panel featured a couple of Georgetown University faculty members, David Muhammad, executive director of the National Institute for Criminal Justice Reform based in Oakland, California, and Kyla Woods, who chairs a juvenile justice advisory group in D.C.
The more than 80 people watching the forum online and the roughly three dozen in attendance were told “plenty” of data is available that shows violent crime is mostly committed by adults.
In August, the FBIs Criminal Justice Information Division reported that of violent crime offenses cleared by law enforcement agencies in 2024, 18.5% involved (those under age 18) while 81.5% of the cleared cases were committed by adults.
One statistic about racial disparity that opened a few eyes came from Henning, who’s also a child advocate and an attorney in D.C.
“Representing kids for 26 years, I’ve only represented four white kids, and we should all be appalled by that data,” she said. “We know that racial disparity of Black children are the ones who are being” prosecuted.
In Maryland, a recent report from a workgroup of the Commission on Juvenile Justice Reform and Emerging and Best Practices said that youth spent 90 to 180 days in adult jails before being transferred to juvenile court in fiscal 2024. However, federal guidelines say youth must not be held in adult facilities for more than six hours “unless a court finds it is in the interest of justice based on a seven-factor test.”
Maryland Public Defender Natasha Dartigue, in a statement released Thursday morning, applauded the commission’s recommendation to automatically end the practice of charging children as adults, especially when at least 85% of those cases are dismissed or brought back in juvenile court.
“I commend the Commission for this evidence-based recommendation and urge the Maryland General Assembly to swiftly enact legislation ensuring all children are treated as children, with access to age-appropriate interventions that hold them accountable while providing opportunities for growth and change,” she said. “Every child deserves a chance at redemption, and our system should reflect that fundamental truth.”

(Photo courtesy of CASA)A familiar face has been chosen to lead the region’s most influential immigrant rights and advocacy organization.
George Escobar, the current chief of programs and services for CASA, will become the organization’s executive director on Jan. 1, taking the reins from longtime executive director Gustavo Torres, who spent more than 30 years with the organization.
“To be entrusted with leading CASA at this critical juncture is the greatest honor of my life,” Escobar said in a statement Thursday. “Our movement faces unprecedented challenges and unmatched opportunities to grow, protect, and transform. Guided by the wisdom and resilience of our members, I believe we can emerge stronger, more united, and more impactful than ever before.”
He follows Torres, who was honored last week during a 40th anniversary celebration attended by more than 100 people, including Gov. Wes Moore (D) and Del. Deni Taveras (D-Prince George’s), whose legislative district includes the D.C. area’s largest concentration of Latinos, and is home to CASA headquarters.
Torres served as executive director for 31 of his 34 years with the organization that began in a church basement in Montgomery County. Escobar has worked 14 years for the organization, leading initiatives on legal assistance, workforce development and more. He takes over an organization that Torres helped launch into national prominence with more than 189,000 members in 46 states and Puerto Rico. Besides Maryland, CASA also has offices in Virginia and Pennsylvania, and a welcome center in Georgia that opened in 2022.
Torres urges CASA advocates to push through ongoing challenges in immigrant communities

“George Escobar is exactly the leader CASA needs at this moment,” Torres said in a statement. “His deep understanding of our organization, their unwavering commitment to immigrant justice, and their visionary leadership will ensure that CASA continues to be a beacon of hope and power for generations to come.”
Escobar, who grew up in Southern California after his family immigrated from Mexico, moved to the D.C. region in 2001. Before joining CASA, he worked as deputy director in the D.C. Mayor’s Office on Latino Affairs, the National Alliance for Hispanic Health and the Latino Economic Development Corp. While with CASA, Escobar became a 2023-24 community resident affiliate at the University of Maryland’s Latin American and Caribbean Studies Center.
He will lead CASA and its fight for immigrant rights at a time of aggressive Trump administration policies to deport immigrants in the U.S. without authorization, including deployment of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents into various cities led by Democrats.
“Our success will not be measured by our survival alone, but by lasting progressive change in our members’ lives,” Escobar said. “The future of CASA and of our movement depends on our ability to lead with courage, clarity, and the collective wisdom of our people.”
Mayor-elect Littmann, a Democratic sweep
Jared Littmann’s early lead in the Nov. 4 election for mayor of Annapolis not only held over Republican businessman Bobby O’Shea, it grew. Official results released Wednesday said Littmann, a Democrat, received 6,792 votes to O’Shea’s 2,441, or 73% to 26%.

Littman thanked supporters in a social media post in a journey he acknowledged was long,  — it started when he announced his candidacy in January 2024. Littmann will be sworn in as mayor on Dec. 1, taking over from Mayor Gavin Buckley (D), who is term-limited after serving two terms.
Democrats swept the City Council races, according to the official results.
The closest race was Ward 1 where Alderman Harry Huntley trailed by 10 votes on election night. But after mail-in and provisional ballots were counted, Huntley got 987 votes, compared to 889 votes for unaffiliated candidate Tom Kriek
Ward 2 Alderwoman Karma O’Neill finished with 946 votes to 507 for GOP candidate Ken Vincent, while Keanuú Smith-Brown easily beat unaffiliated candidate Mike Dye by a 620-170 margin to win the race for the open Ward 3 seat. Current Ward 3 Alderwoman Rhonda Pindell Charles ran for mayor, but lost to Littmann in the Democratic primary.
Ward 5 Alderman Brooks Schandelmeier received 648 votes against Republican challenger Jack Papaleonti, who received 347 votes. With Ward 6 Alderman DaJuan Gray not seeking reelection, the seat was open for Diesha Contee Ward, who won 465 votes to beat Republican candidate George M. Gallagher, who got 172 votes.
Another open seat was in Ward 8, where Alderman Ross H. Arnett III did not seek reelection. Frank Thorp won with 1,128 votes to 648 for unaffiliated candidate William Cunha.
After beating Coren Makell by just four votes in thDemocratic primary, Janice Elaine Allsup-Johnson (D) was unopposed in the general election for Ward 4, which is being vacated by current Alderwoman Sheila M. Finlayson (D), who did not seek reelection. Ward 7 Alderman Robert Savidge (D) had no challengers in either the primary or general elections.
Funk & Bolton staffs up
The law firm, with offices in Baltimore and Annapolis, announced last week that it has added five new hires to its government relations and publica affairs teams ahead of the 2026 legislative session. The newcomers are:

Joshua Feldmark, a former senior vice president at CI Renewables — where Senate President Bill Ferguson is general counsel — he was founding director of Howard County’s Office of Sustainability, where he worked for 12 years. He previously worked for a number of nonprofits and was a member of the Governor’s Commission on Environmental Justice and Sustainable Communities, among other roles.

Montana hearing at the Montana Supreme Court. (Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)After the 2025 Legislature, Republicans who were in the majority in both chambers lamented that they didn’t get more done to refashion the state’s judiciary, vowing to take up the effort in 2027.
While lawmakers have already begun the bill drafting process for 2027, other state legislators are pushing to bring the state court system to heel. Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee Barry Usher, R-Billings, filed a trio of complaints  against one of the state’s seven Supreme Court justices, Laurie McKinnon, late this summer.
The three complaints that Usher brought to the Montana Judicial Standards Commission, the body that oversees judicial discipline, have already been decided, two of them years ago by the previous commission. One of the issues — whether the Montana Supreme Court justices could hear matters pertaining to state’s court system — was rejected by the United States Supreme Court.
Broadly speaking, the charges involve allegations that McKinnon has violated judicial norms by not silencing an attorney at a panel in which she moderated; that she had a conflict of interest in deciding the legality of legislation that would redraw the Supreme Court into districts; and that she failed to recuse herself in a tussle with the Legislature over emails.
Even though the issues and events surrounding the complaints have been litigated and settled, that has not stopped some Republicans from continuing to fight. Now, Usher has targeted McKinnon, who has been a part of rulings on some of the cases which have been decided against the lawmakers, on occasion writing opinions on behalf of the court. While no facts involving Usher’s allegations have changed — in some cases for years — what has changed is the retooling and remaking of the Judicial Standards Commission itself, which could mete out judicial discipline.
In 2023, a Republican supermajority rejiggered how the members of the Judicial Standards Commission are chosen. Democrats and others decried the changes as injecting more politics in the nonpartisan court system, while Republicans argued commission should better reflect the political reality of the Treasure State. 
  The complaints 

Usher submitted the three complaints on Aug. 17 to the JSC . The Daily Montanan reached out to Usher for comment about them, and he originally replied that the complaints speak for themselves.

Later, Usher decided to release a comment through a legislative spokesperson:



“I am disappointed to see Justice McKinnon leaking information to the state’s most left-wing media outlet in an attempt to influence public opinion and sway the commission’s important work on judicial standards complaints. This calculated move raises serious concerns over her fitness for judicial office.”
 

In almost all cases, complaints against judges, submitted to the JSC, are confidential. However, Montana law allows a judge to waive that right and provide public notice of the proceedings. McKinnon has waived her right of privacy in the matter for the Daily Montanan in order to demonstrate how political the fight over the state’s judicial branch has become:


        “The citizens of Montana should know the depth of the attacks on the judiciary that are occurring. The allegations lodged by Usher are baseless and calculated to intimidate, harass, threaten, and – more significantly – silence a member of the highest court of this state, particularly where there are a multitude of constitutional challenges before the Court to recently enacted statutes supported by Usher.  I will, as I always have, decide any case before the Court based on our law, our precedent, and Montana’s Constitution – free from partisan influence, and of course Usher’s attempt to influence. As a leader in Montana’s judicial branch, it is my duty to disclose and repudiate these partisan attacks, which weaken, infect, and threaten our democracy. The idea that a Justice would succumb to threats or be silenced by Usher’s allegations, as the obvious intended purpose here, is inconsistent with the principles and health of a democracy.  I will not turn a blind eye to what is occurring, and I have faith that through my responses and disclosure to Montana citizens, these attacks on the judiciary’s independence will not be kept in the dark but, rather, inform and enlighten how our State should govern going forward.”    

In letters, the Judicial Standards Commission on Sept. 17 asked McKinnon to respond in writing to the allegations. McKinnon hired an attorney, Patricia Klanke, to respond to the allegations, which appear to still be active with the commission.
The Daily Montanan reached out to members of the commission to discuss the complaints or the process, but none of them responded to requests. By law, members cannot speak about the complaints, but they can acknowledge them or describe or clarify the process.
The first complaint by Usher alleges that McKinnon failed to uphold the Montana Code of Judicial Conduct by not recusing herself from a controversy involving the Legislature, of which he was a member, and its subpoena for thousands of email records from the state’s judicial branch.
In 2021, Republican lawmakers had charged that because a statewide judges association polled members of the judiciary on legislative topics during the session that it indicated political bias. In a hurried subpoena, the Legislature demanded thousands of emails from then Court Administrator Beth McLaughlin, with threats of legal action if she didn’t comply with the subpoenas during a weekend.
Meanwhile McLaughlin and her attorney filed emergency petitions with the Montana Supreme Court asking to halt or slow the process because of sensitive, private and confidential information that would likely be in many of those emails, including communication about court cases, juveniles and medical records. 
That escalated in a stand-off that entangled all three branches of state government, culminating in orders to return the emails, some of which had already been distributed to the public, and the state’s highest court stopping the subpoena for emails issued by lawmakers.
The controversy didn’t end with the decision, though. Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen, a Republican, threatened not to obey the high court, which became the basis of currently pending disciplinary action against him still before the Montana Supreme Court. McKinnon has recused herself from that disciplinary case.
But during the tussle over whether to release the judicial branch’s emails, Republican lawmakers claimed the Supreme Court justices, including McKinnon, had a conflict of interest and must recuse themselves. The Supreme Court denied the conflict and said even if one existed, that every qualified judge in the state would have the same conflict and cited a principle called the“rule of judicial necessity,” which says if every judge has the same perceived conflict then the sitting justices must do their best to adjudicate matter. 
After years of fighting and a mountain of legal briefing, the case was appealed by Knudsen all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which decided the matter when it declined to hear the case, leaving the Montana Supreme Court’s decisions to stand.
One member of the state’s high court, Justice Jim Rice, had recused himself in the case and dissented in a separate opinion, arguing that a different legal route was correct by challenging those lawmaker-issued subpoenas in state district court first.
In the complaint against McKinnon, Usher parlays that into a reason for the commission to “impose the maximum sanction on (her).”
In his complaint, Usher said that the state Supreme Court has ignored the conflict of interest.
“They claim the issue is a matter of law they alone can decide — an absurd argument, as Justice Rice’s recusal demonstrates,” the complaint said.
The second complaint against McKinnon focuses on a 2021 debate and effort to change the state’s constitution, which elects nonpartisan Supreme Court Justices at large. A proposal, House Bill 325, would have altered that by districting the state into seven different geographic regions and having electors in those regions elect a single justice from there.
Residents challenged the measure’s constitutionality, and the Second District Court in Butte found in favor of the residents. The state appealed the decision, and the Montana Supreme Court, the state’s only appellate court, was called upon to decide the matter.
Again, Republicans from both the legislative and executive branches charged that the entire state Supreme Court should be disqualified because of a conflict of interest. However, using law that paralleled its ruling in the McLaughlin case, the court said that conflicts were speculative and that voters had the final say on the election of judges.
In his complaint, Usher said that McKinnon should have disqualified herself, arguing that “given the nature of this case dealing with how Supreme Court Justices are elected, thereby increasing or decreasing the chances of any particular justice being re-elected, the (sic) Justice McKinnon had a clear economic interest in the outcome of this case.”
However, in their ruling on the case, the Supreme Court determined those interests were conjecture or theoretical, because the complaints assume so many things, for example, that the constitutional ballot measure would pass, the districts would not favor the current justices, and that justices would want to run for office again.
The third complaint against McKinnon alleges that she failed to follow the Montana Code of Judicial conduct when she was moderating a panel discussion at a continuing education course sponsored by the Montana State Bar Association.
The complaint accuses her of showing bias and violating the code when a longtime attorney, who had been asked to participate at the last minute, made comments that offended some conservative lawmakers and were harshly critical of Gov. Greg Gianforte, a Republican, and the court itself.
That conference and particular session became a flashpoint for Republican legislation during the 2025 Legislature to reform not only the state’s judicial branch, but overhaul the state’s legal community altogether by not requiring attorneys to join the bar, as well as calling for a full financial audit by state auditors of the bar, which is a private organization.
Usher charges that “Justice McKinnon did not attempt to restrain (Jim) Goetz’s comments,” and says that she “giggled” at his remarks.
Klanke of the Drake Law Firm in Helena has responded to the allegations on behalf of McKinnon, her client.
In separate responses for each allegation, Klanke points out that many of the same issues have been litigated before the Judicial Standards Commission and even the Supreme Court previously. Klanke’s responses to the allegations total 22 pages, and include exhibits, swelling the total to around 100 pages in total.
Klanke said the Supreme Court addressed the disqualifying of Supreme Court justices in its 2022 findings.
“Usher’s grievance reflects his dissatisfaction with this ruling…This is not the first time Sen. Usher has filed this complaint,” she stated.
Indeed, Usher filed a similar complaint against McKinnon in 2022, along with accusing Supreme Court Justices Beth Baker, Ingrid Gustafson, Jim Rice, Dirk Sandefur, James Shea, and Chief Justice Mike McGrath, with similar allegations. Baker, Gustafson, Rice, and Shea are still on the court.
“The grievance now filed against Justice McKinnon is identical, down to the formatting, even using plural references to ‘themselves’ and ‘the Justices’ and containing the same typo ‘rescues’ in place of ‘recuse,’” Klanke said.
In 2022, Usher was not the only lawmaker to file the same complaint — on the same day. Reps. John Fuller and Matt Regier filed as well as Sen. Cary Smith and the late-Sen. Gordon Vance. 
All five complaints were dismissed by the Judicial Standards Commission in 2022.
“If the decision of the commission, or indeed any judicial principles, are to mean anything, a grievance that has been rejected five times should also be rejected the sixth time,” Klanke wrote.
Klanke points to a 2012 decision that has been used many times during these conflicts, which analyzed the role of Supreme Court justices and when they should recuse themselves. The case centered on whether four sitting Supreme Court justices should recuse themselves because they had the potential to run for re-election.
That case established the precedent that “potential” conflict did not constitute “a direct, personal, substantial, and pecuniary interest sufficient to trigger due process concerns.”
Moreover, the Montana Supreme Court ruled in the McLaughlin case previously that since every judge in the state likely had interacted with McLaughlin, the courts, or could run again, that none were more able to rule on the case than the justices on the Supreme Court.
“There was no member of the of judiciary who was without at least a conjectural interest,” Klanke’s response stated, arguing that if taken to its logical conclusion, no judge in the state would have been able to decide the complaints raised by the McLaughlin case or the matter or districting the Supreme Court seats.
In the McLaughlin case, the high court reasoned that if it disqualified “every member of Montana’s highest court … the court’s ability to fulfill its constitutional duties to adjudicate difficult and controversial matters would be compromised.”
“Montana citizens elected Justice McKinnon to the Supreme Court, and the matter should be decided by the duly elected and constituted Justice of the court,” Klanke responded to Usher’s allegations.
Klanke’s response also notes the different cases that the Montana Supreme Court has decided that involved making decisions on the judiciary or the court administrator, stretching back several decades.
The high court, as it decided in McLaughlin, said that the Legislature had purposefully subpoenaed every member of the court, creating both a crisis and a scenario meant to discredit every justice. 
“The Legislature’s unilateral act of issuing subpoenas to the justices during the pendency of this case is not grounds for recusal of every member of this court,” the Supreme Court wrote in its opinion. “The Legislature itself has created the conflict by issuing a subpoena to each justice during a pending proceeding involving the same issues raised in a legislative subpoena.”
In his complaint against her, Usher repeated the claim that the justices, McKinnon included, used their positions to hide emails that were unflattering, another point the Supreme Court addressed in its original ruling in the McLaughlin case.
“The Legislature has failed to provide a single legitimate legislative purpose tied to matters ‘concerning a subject on which “legislation could be had.”’ The asserted legislative purpose —both expressed in the subpoena and in the Legislature’s findings with the court — is to determine whether individuals violated the law. Enforcement of the law is not a ‘legitimate task’ of the legislative function,” the court ruling said.
“The allegations made by Usher are extremely disturbing, as they are the same arguments made in Reichert, McLaughlin and McDonald which were rejected by the court,” Klanke wrote. “Based upon this clear existing law, when the exact same complaint was filed before the commission three years ago, it was summarily dismissed.”
It appears that McKinnon, as opposed to other justices, may have been targeted because she was the moderator of a panel, “Profiles in Courage,” which she had participated in, in conjunction with the State Bench Bar Education Committee.
With 15 minutes until the beginning of the panel, one of the panelists had not arrived, and with veteran attorney Jim Goetz in attendance, he was asked to participate because of his involvement in many controversial cases before the state Supreme Court, according to Klanke.
Each of the panelists spoke, and McKinnon moderated. The full presentation and discussion has been made available previously. Usher’s complaint against McKinnon focuses on seven different comments made by Goetz during the panel discussion, none of which are attributed to McKinnon. In his complaint, Usher charges that McKinnon failed to ” restrain the comments of Mr. Goetz.” Usher also accused her of being “willing to allow Mr. Goetz to engage in this inappropriate (sic) constitutes,” while also alleging she failed to report Goetz’s behavior afterward.
Usher’s complaints against Goetz include that during the panel discussion he called one of the rulings on a case he litigated “a piece of shit,” while during the same panel criticizing some of the laws passed by the legislature as “pieces of garbage.” One of Goetz’s criticisms was aimed at district court judge Dan Wilson, who ran unsuccessfully for a Montana Supreme Court seat in 2024, and has announced his intent to run again in 2026.
Since then, Wilson has also become a member of the Judicial Standards Commission.
In her defense of McKinnon, Klanke responded that the justice simply moderated the panel, not offered advice or commentary.
“McKinnon moved the discussion from one panelist to another, being careful not to opine on their positions, particularly those disagreements about matters that had been decided by the court,” Klanke said. “McKinnon neither endorsed the statements of the panelists, nor adopted any of the statements, and did not make them herself.
“This does not mean she should have interjected herself to silence First Amendment speech. The panelists were entitled to voice their opinion about the court’s decision and how the court was functioning. They were entitled to speak of their frustration with litigating against various parties. Had Justice McKinnon interjected herself into the discussion, she would have done exactly what Usher is alleging she did here — showing a bias or partisanship toward a particular position or part.”
Klanke also rejected the idea that she should have stopped Goetz from speaking, noting that judges are often in the same position while on the bench.
“Avoiding impropriety does not mean putting a stop to all speech or conduct that is in bad taste or may cause offense to others,” Klanke wrote. “Indeed, the role of a judge is very often to uphold the rights of others to make offensive speech. It was not illegal for Mr. Goetz to state his opinion, and there is no law or rule that required Justice McKinnon to intervene to prevent him from doing so.”
The response points out that none of the panelists were court staff or “under Justice McKinnon’s control.”
“Mr. Goetz’s statements were not dishonest or untrustworthy, however disagreeable some may have found them, and they reflected his deep displeasure with the administration of justice in this state,” Klanke wrote. “Usher’s allegations are premised upon the mistaken belief that the panelists were under the direction or control of McKinnon.”
  Changes to the JSC 

While the Judicial Standards Commission has rejected nearly identical complaints at least five times, this sixth time is different because the Legislature retooled the commission itself to allow politicians more control over the make-up of the panel.
In 2023, Rep. Kerri Seekins-Crowe, R-Billings, sponsored and helped pass House Bill 326, which rewrote the rules on how commission members are selected. Raising concerns about “judges judging judges” and likening the situation to the fox guarding the henhouse, the Legislature passed the bill, mostly along political party lines.  The House voted 66-32, with a notable exception of then-Rep. Bill Mercer, who was recently confirmed by the United States Senate to the federal bench in Montana, and took the oath of office in Missoula.
In the Montana Senate, the bill was more controversial, with a number of Republican Senators breaking off from the majority. Still, the measure made it through the chamber 29-21 and was signed into law by Gianforte.
Under the new law, the number of people appointed to the commission remained at five. Instead of two district court judges being elected by the district judges themselves, the judges are appointed by the Montana Speaker of the House and confirmed by the Senate. The Montana Supreme Court under the old system appointed the one practicing attorney, but under the new rules, that attorney is appointed by the Montana Attorney General. The two lay members of the commission are appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Senate, something that remained unchanged by HB 326.
During the debates some lawmakers worried that move would inject more partisan politics into a system designed to eschew political party influence.
The current make-up of the commission includes the chairwoman of the Commission, Yellowstone County District Court Judge Ashley Harada. The other judge on the commission is Wilson.  The attorney appointed by the Attorney General is Emily Jones, who has served as a special assistant to Austin Knudsen, and is often involved in many of the high-profile political cases the office handles. The two members of the public are former legislators Seth Berglee and Roger Webb of Park City. Both were appointed by Gianforte and both are Republican.
  Conflicts of interest? 

The members of the Judicial Standards Commission have changed since these issues were originally addressed. Unlike the other nearly identical complaints, this trio of complaints appears to be different. The previous complaints were all summarily dismissed, which meant that the commission read and reviewed them, rejecting them without asking the judge accused in the complaint for a response.
In each of these three complaints, the commission asked McKinnon for a response, and did not reject the complaint, meaning the commission’s investigation or deliberation is ongoing. 
But in both the response provided by McKinnon and in the Daily Montanan’s own investigation, it appears that four of the five members of the commission may have their own conflicts of interest in the case.
Harada herself has been the subject of a disciplinary complaint against her that was ultimately upheld by the Montana Supreme Court. As part of that process, McKinnon signed a disciplinary order, along with six other members of the court, suspending Harada for one month without pay and censuring her.
Harada agreed to the punishment and concurred with the commission and court findings, which included a failure to withhold state and federal taxes from a nanny who worked for her; acknowledging she lied under oath about the situation; making misleading statements about her legal experience; making endorsements of candidates; as well as accepting an endorsement from a political party, which was, at the time, illegal, but has since been changed by state law as part of a Republican effort to “reform” the court system of Montana.

Wilson ran for a seat on the Montana Supreme Court, being bested by current Justice Katherine Bidegaray. He has announced that he’s an active candidate seeking election to the Supreme Court in the 2026 race. And Wilson was the target of at least one of the comments that Usher claims McKinnon should have stopped at the panel discussion.
That comment from Goetz was:
“And the other thing that got my attention was Judge Wilson complimenting the court on the Judicial Nomination Commission case, which I and Cliff Edwards handled …. And when Judge Wilson said that was an even opinion, it’s a piece of shit.”
Also, according to a Montana Legislature report that examined the role of the judiciary in terms of lobbying or bias, it found that Wilson used his state email account to vote on an informal poll about pending legislation before the lawmakers.
Emily Jones is a well-known attorney, working particularly in Republican circles, and is married to prominent political consultant and campaign director Jake Eaton.
Jones has been part of major pieces of litigation as a special assistant attorney general, and records show that she’s been receiving a $10,000 per month payment from the office, and was first called in to help litigate the McLaughlin case. She was on the losing side of that argument, which McKinnon signed onto.
In addition to that, Jones herself was sanctioned by a state in court in Helena for a 2017 case where Lewis and Clark District Court Judge Kathy Seeley found that her actions in case usurped the court’s inherent ability to “control discovery and trial administration in the interest of fairness and justice.”
She was sanctioned, ordered to pay for the Commissioner of Political Practices attorneys fees, and then a record was sent to the Office of Disciplinary Counsel, which oversees attorney discipline. According to a search of the state’s disciplinary database, that office never took further action against Jones.
However, Jones’ name has been attached to some of the highest profile lawsuits in the Attorney General’s Office, including many that the Montana Supreme Court found against. Those have included cases involving defending legislation ranging from reproductive freedom to the Attorney General finding certain ballot initiatives “insufficient” to defending the state’s position on transgender individuals wanting to select their gender marker on a driver’s license.
But, it’s not even the first time that Jones has, as an attorney for the state, tried to punish McKinnon for not muzzling Goetz. In a 2024 case regarding the driver’s licenses, Jones made a motion to disqualify McKinnon because she “failed to take the measure to cease the offending discussion.” Because that case was dismissed before it was decided by the court, the court did not make a ruling on the motion.
It appears that Usher also waited on Jones’ appointment to the JSC. She was appointed on July 1, and Usher filed the complaints surrounding Goetz’s comments on Aug. 17. Goetz’s comments by then had been made more than a year earlier and already had been dismissed by the former commission.
Jones’ husband, Eaton, filed an identical complaint as the one Usher filed against McKinnon.
“The present complaint by Sen. Usher is almost a word-for-word duplicate of Eaton’s, with even the same line break error on page two of the attached statement,” Klanke noted.
She also pointed out that several verb tenses were changed, for example when referencing McLaughin, the court administrator at the time of case. The complaint now states that she “was” the court administrator. It also appears that Usher may have tried to differentiate the filing slightly, which Klanke noted: “‘This case reveals a clear coverup,’ in place of ‘This case is a coverup, plain and simple.’”
Klanke also noted that Eaton’s original complaint included a demand to force the recusal of Judges Mike Menahan and Randal Spaulding, former members of the JSC, who were replaced by Harada and Wilson. Those sections have now been dropped.
Moreover, Usher has legislative involvement with both Harada and Wilson.
“Usher, the grievant in this case, sponsored bills to confirm both Harada and Wilson to the commission,” Klanke said. 
Meanwhile, former Carbon County lawmaker Seth Berglee, who now lists his address as Whitefish, was a defendant in a case that wound its way to the Supreme Court, which found in his favor, but not without a wrinkle. McKinnon wrote the opinion on behalf of the Supreme Court.
That case, which was decided in June 2025, was a split decision, with Justice Jim Rice dissenting. The case involves a company in which Berglee has an ownership interest and a dispute involving a former partner. McKinnon’s decision, which was written on behalf of the majority, ultimately said that Berglee and several other partners were correct in not associating with a former partner. However, the opinion could wind up costing Berglee more money because the court ordered the district court to redo some of its calculations for paying out the ex-partner.
  And back to the Supreme Court 

Should the Judicial Standards Commission find merit in the complaints, or even recommend sanctioning or disciplinary action against McKinnon, it will not have the final say on the matter. The JSC makes recommendations to the one group that has power over the courts according to the Montana Constitution, the Montana Supreme Court.
That means that if the JSC recommends disciplinary sanctions, it could set off another series of motions and possible accusations that seem to be at the heart of the original complaint more than four years ago: The justices seated on the Montana Supreme Court will be in charge of determining the fate of McKinnon, one of their colleagues. 
For his part, Usher’s trio of complaints urges the commission to take a hard-line stance against McKinnon.
“This commission has the authority and responsibility to find that Justice McKinnon violated her ethical obligations. Given the severity of these violations, the commission should impose the maximum sanctions on Justice McKinnon,” the complaints urge.
For her part, McKinnon has requested that the complaints be dismissed and the commission award her attorney’s fees for having to defend cases she says have already been litigated, several times.
“It is unclear why the commission determined that an investigation into Usher’s allegations was warranted, given that his complaints clearly involve orders and decision of the Montana Supreme Court, requiring the commission, under its own rules, to dismiss the grievance summarily,” Klanke said in her response on behalf of McKinnon. “It is Justice McKinnon’s sincere hope that the commission applies its own rules correctly and interprets the Montana Code of Judicial Conduct in a fair and nonpartisan matter.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_7939-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-13 22:56:29.950323

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island Department of Transportation (RIDOT) Director Peter Alviti Jr. admitted to lawmakers Thursday that he has not personally reviewed engineering plans of the westbound Washington Bridge shut down in December 2023.
That’s because he said it’s ultimately up to the companies contracted by the state to look them over and identify any issues that arise — even the ones that failed to catch the broken anchor rods that put the westbound Interstate 195 highway at risk of collapse.
“We expect them to deliver a report that is complete and accurate, and we don’t second-guess them,” Alviti told members of the House and Senate oversight committees. “We rely on their expertise and their reporting so that we can serve the public — and they betrayed that.”
It’s the third time since the state abruptly closed the western span over the Seekonk River that lawmakers have put Alviti in the hot seat. Unlike his previous two appearances in the State House basement, Rhode Island’s transportation chief was required to testify under oath and had to answer before the state’s most recent top federal prosecutor.
“This committee has an obligation to understand the circumstances that led to this event and what we can do to avoid this happening again,” Rep. Patricia Serpa, the West Warwick Democrat who chairs the House Committee on Oversight, said in her opening remarks of the five-hour meeting.
Lawmakers requested the third oversight hearing after the Rhode Island Office of Attorney General quietly released a long-sequestered forensic audit that showed the state was partially to blame for its deteriorated condition.
The 64-page report by Illinois-based engineering firm Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates Inc. dated April 5, 2024, was posted on the AG’s website this September after pieces were leaked by an anonymous social media account. 
Gov. Dan McKee had promised to make the audit public when he announced at a March 2024 press conference that the bridge would need to be rebuilt, but ultimately chose to keep it out of the public eye amid the state’s lawsuit against the 13 firms that performed work on the bridge.
The lawsuit also inhibited the committee’s ability to ask questions surrounding accountability when lawmakers last met on Feb. 13.
“We were told we can’t ask questions about anything pertaining to causation,” Sen. Mark McKenney, the Warwick Democrat who chairs the Senate Committee on Rules, Government Ethics and Oversight, said in an interview before Thursday’s hearing. “That was extremely frustrating.”

With the chance now to get answers under oath, the joint panel tapped a veteran prosecutor to grill Alviti: former U.S. Attorney Zachary Cunha, who served three years under the Biden administration before being ousted last February by the Trump administration.
A repeated line of questioning from Cunha focused on who at RIDOT is responsible for assessing inspection reports from its network of contractors. Alviti explained that one individual, the state program manager, oversees the “outsourcing and contracting with” multiple bridge inspection companies.
But Alviti said he could not recall that person’s name, and that they haven’t regularly met either before or after the bridge’s closure.
“I feel bad that I don’t,” he said. “I should.”
“Sounds like a fairly important position,” Cunha replied.
Alviti said the position has its place, but that all employees at RIDOT play a role. He also disagreed with Cunha’s suggestion that the project manager is the ultimate authority on reviewing the accuracy of inspection reports.
“The program manager basically oversees and manages the outsourcing and contracting,” he said.
Cunha said RIDOT’s approach is “contractors all the way down.” 
“Is RIDOT helpless to do anything other than sign contracts and pay out money?” he asked.
About 90 minutes into the hearing, Alviti asked for a short recess, saying his voice was getting raspy. When the committee reconvened around 10 minutes later, he wasn’t in his seat — prompting Serpa to ask Capitol Police to look for him. Alviti returned shortly after.
“We were afraid you left us,” Serpa said.

‘Where does the buck stop?’
Following a second recess, committee members were given the chance to ask questions of Alviti, starting with lawmakers from the East Bay whose constituents are bearing the most impact of the bridge’s closure.
Rep. Jennifer Boylan, a Barrington Democrat, told Alviti it was “very frustrating” to hear of RIDOT’s overreliance on contractors and asked how she can maintain confidence that future bridge maintenance is done properly.
“Where does the buck stop?” she said. “It can’t always stop with consultants.”
Alviti insisted RIDOT is the most accountable department in the state and that using outside contractors has helped reconstruct hundreds of structurally deficient bridges. When he took up the job in 2015 following his appointment by then-Gov. Gina Raimondo, he told lawmakers the department did much of the bridge work in-house, leading to many projects running over time and over budget. 
“We turned that all around,” Alviti said.
Still, Alviti’s assurances did little to comfort lawmakers.
“Much of what we have heard today does not instill confidence in the inspection regime,” said Rep. June Speakman, a Bristol Democrat.










Is RIDOT helpless to do anything other than sign contracts and pay out money?


– Zachary Cunha, the former U.S. attorney hired by lawmakers to question the state’s transportation director


Alviti continues to receive support from McKee, who has refuted calls to replace his transportation chief. But who is the best person for the DOT director’s job has already emerged as a hot button campaign issue. And McKee’s Democratic primary opponent was quick to weigh in after the oversight hearing ended and remind the public what she would do if elected.
Helena Bounanno Foulkes, who is challenging McKee in the 2026 Democratic gubernatorial primary, called for Alviti to be fired.
“This oversight hearing was a disaster for the McKee Administration,” Foulkes said in a statement Thursday night. “It confirmed what Rhode Islanders already knew: the State refuses to take responsibility for years of neglect and mismanagement.”
The main question on lawmakers’ minds was how RIDOT will make sure infrastructure problems are caught sooner rather than later and that the state never has another Washington Bridge debacle again.
In his closing statement, Alviti sought to reassure them. He said the new westbound Washington Bridge will be built to be strong, safe, and easy to be maintained and inspected.
Chicago-headquartered Walsh Construction Company was awarded the state’s $427 million contract to rebuild the Washington Bridge on June 6. Construction is expected to be completed by November 2028.
“We’ve got the best contractor in the country doing it for us,” Alviti said. “What happened with the Washington Bridge will not happen again.”

(Robert Zullo/States Newsroom)Black Hills Energy was using a phased approach to restore electricity as a widespread power outage that began early Thursday afternoon stretched into the evening, affecting thousands in Rapid City and the surrounding region.
“We are continuing to work as quickly as possible to safely restore service to all South Dakota and Wyoming customers impacted by today’s regional electrical outage,” the company said Thursday evening in a news release.
“The restoration process is complex as our power generation facilities and substations were impacted. We will use a phased process to restore power which balances system safety and stability.”
Black Hills Energy said the outage impacted multiple utilities across the region, resulting from an event on the regional transmission grid outside of the Black Hills Energy footprint. That footprint includes Rapid City, South Dakota’s second largest population center, where power was out all afternoon for many people and some street lights remained dark into the evening.
The website PowerOutage.us said at one point Thursday afternoon that more than 40,000 customers in South Dakota were affected, and more than 60,000 in Wyoming.
WyoFile quoted a spokesman for the Western Area Power Administration who said the outage began around 12:45 p.m. Mountain time and may have been triggered by “two tripped 500-kilovolt lines near Medicine Bow, Wyoming.”
“This incident resulted in an abnormal voltage event that subsequently tripped a number of surrounding lines, including WAPA transmission, resulting in further power outages to communities across the area,” Public Affairs Specialist Stephen J.

Taffy Howard, R-Rapid City, listens to a presentation during a South Dakota legislative budget committee meeting on Jan. 15, 2025, at the Capitol in Pierre. (Photo by Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)A committee of South Dakota lawmakers expressed support Thursday for legislative efforts to rein in powers that some committee members said Republican former Gov. Kristi Noem abused.
The Legislature’s Government Operations and Audit Committee, which met at the Capitol in Pierre, endorsed draft legislation that would take a pool of economic development money known as the Future Fund out of the governor’s exclusive control.
Committee members also expressed informal support — but did not formally endorse — another bill draft that would tighten rules governing the use of state-issued credit cards.
Both ideas could become bills when legislators gather for their annual lawmaking session in January.
“This is trying to provide some more oversight and transparency,” said Sen. Taffy Howard, R-Rapid City, who serves as committee chair and introduced the bill drafts.
Future Fund
South Dakota employers pay a fee to the Future Fund when they submit payroll taxes to the unemployment benefits program. State law says the Future Fund must be used “for purposes related to research and economic development for the state.” Unlike other funds administered by the Governor’s Office of Economic Development, Future Fund expenses don’t go through a board of citizen appointees for vetting or approval. The governor has sole discretion to award Future Fund money.
Noem’s controversial uses of the Future Fund included $350,000 to pay for a fireworks show in 2020 at Mount Rushmore, $13.5 million toward the construction of a Rapid City-area shooting range that opened last week, $2.5 million to promote and conduct a Governor’s Cup rodeo in Sioux Falls, and up to $9 million on a workforce recruitment campaign that Noem starred in.
Some lawmakers upset after Noem awards millions to project they refused to pay for

Legislators denied state funding for the shooting range before Noem awarded the Future Fund money.
“I think everyone remembers the fact that funding was denied for the new gun range, what was it – three or four times?” Howard said. “And lo and behold, Future Funds were given to complete that project, which, in my opinion, subverted the appropriations process.”
The bill draft, which the committee endorsed 7-1 with two members excused, would require each Future Fund grant to be approved by a majority of the Board of Economic Development, which already oversees other programs controlled by the governor’s office. The board’s members are appointed by the governor and confirmed by the state Senate.
The bill would also order the Governor’s Office of Economic Development to create rules establishing an application process for Future Fund loans and grants; the methods for assessing or estimating the economic impact that a project would have on the state; the criteria for determining how a project is selected for a loan or a grant; the process for setting an interest rate on a loan; any requirements that applicants must meet to be awarded a grant; and the process by which a loan or a grant is disbursed.
Credit cards
A Dakota Scout investigation earlier this year uncovered roughly $750,000 in charges to Noem’s state-issued credit cards over six years, including travel tied to a book tour and a Canadian hunting trip. 
“I mean, the previous governor traveled to more than 30 states,” Howard said. “Places that you really had to wonder if every one of those was done on official state business. So, unfortunately, this is somewhat of a blowback because of previous actions.” 
Noem resigned in January to become secretary of the federal Department of Homeland Security.

The bill addressing credit cards would direct the state Bureau of Finance and Management to write rules for how a state officer or employee can be issued a bank card, what criteria are used to assess that request, and maximum amounts for lodging, meals, transportation and other expenses charged. The bill would also establish a process to recover from an employee’s wages any spending above those caps. 
Sen. Chris Karr, R-Sioux Falls, said the committee ran out of time Thursday, but he hopes to keep discussing the bill draft.
“I support the idea,” he said. “It needs to be workshopped a little bit.”
Karr voted in favor of the committee endorsing “the idea of” the bill, which Howard suggested following Karr’s comments. That motion passed 6-1, with three members excused.
Another of Howard’s drafts would have required that any expense incurred by the governor, in connection with state business conducted outside the state, must be reviewed by the State Board of Finance. That draft failed in a 5-3 vote, with two committee members excused. The motion needed a six-vote majority of the committee’s 10 members. 
Sen. Ernie Otten, R-Tea, was the only member to vote against all three bill drafts. He did not explain his votes publicly.

“For over three decades, I’ve seen how the University of Alaska empowers this state,” Pitney said in a prepared statement with the announcement. “Our education, research, and partnerships make a difference in every community. As an alum, and the parent of alums from each of our three universities, it’s been one of the greatest honors of my life to serve all of you and the people of Alaska.”
Pitney was appointed by the University of Alaska Board of Regents, first as interim president in August 2020, then as president in February 2022. She oversees the state’s public higher education system with three universities and 13 community campuses, over 500 in-person and online degree programs, and numerous research initiatives. It’s currently serving 20,500 students this year. 
Pitney said Thursday that in retirement, she plans to stay in Alaska and spend time with her children and grandchildren. “Mostly take some time off, enjoy the summer in Alaska. I’ve been fortunate to travel to a lot of places in Alaska, but there’s a lot of places I haven’t been to,” she said, like the Aleutian Islands and the Denali Highway. 
“​​I’m sure I’ll be engaged in other things, but just not, you know, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.,” she said. 
Pitney led the university through the COVID-19 pandemic, and has been recognized by the university and its board of regents for her leadership through financial instability, helping to boost enrollment, scholarship opportunities, research initiatives and revenue. She is credited by the university with increasing its public confidence rating, with 86% of Alaskans reporting approval of UA in 2024, according to a university survey. 
“Not only has she been a steady hand at the wheel during challenging times, but she has also refocused our university system and embraced our role as an engine that empowers Alaska’s workforce and economy,” said Scott Jepsen, chair of the University Board of Regents in a statement. “On behalf of the Board and the entire university community, I extend our sincerest thanks to Pat for her committed service to UA and the people of Alaska.”
This year, the Trump administration has exerted unprecedented political pressure on higher education institutions across the country, freezing millions in federal funding, revoking international student visas and demanding changes to and elimination of diversity programs. When asked whether the political environment played a role in her decision, Pitney said it did not, and that she sees both uncertainty and opportunity for the university and for Alaska today.
“It is a time of uncertainty. But when I walked in, it was a time of uncertainty,” she said. “We go through cycles of uncertainty and stress, and then there’s cycles of really positive momentum and, actually, even in this period of uncertainty, we have a ton of positive momentum.”
She said the federal freeze of research funding has been painful for some programs, but overall minimal. She added that Alaska also has opportunities in resource development, defense partnerships and in the Arctic. “We are really well positioned in the Arctic,” she said. “Our expertise in Arctic research and Arctic policy have really positioned Alaska well. So as much as there is uncertainty, and, you know, frankly, just a weird environment, on the other side, Alaska and the University of Alaska have tremendous opportunities at this time.”
Prior to serving as the university’s 17th president, Pitney oversaw state finances as the director of the Alaska State Legislative Finance Division in 2020, and she was the State Finance Director in the administration of former Governor Bill Walker from 2014 to 2018. Pitney was the Vice Chancellor of Administration at the University of Alaska Fairbanks and spent 23 years in various roles in research, planning, and finance administration.
Pitney first came to Fairbanks in 1987 from Billings, Montana. She holds a bachelor’s degree in engineering physics from Murray State University, and an MBA from the University of Alaska UAF. She also is an Olympian; Pitney won gold in women’s air rifle in the 1984 U.S Olympic Games. 
The university Board of Regents said it has already started planning for Pitney’s retirement and has retained WittKieffer, a national executive search firm, to assist with the search and recruitment of the next university president.
From now until May, Pitney said her goals are to continue the university’s focus on student recruitment, retention and graduation, which she called their “top focus,” as well as helping with the search to find her replacement. “And then really just reinforcing the team atmosphere that we’ve had that’s been growing over the past five years,” she said. 
The UA Board of Regents is also in the process of recruiting and hiring permanent chancellors at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.
Correction: This story has been updated to clarify Pitney’s terms as the director of the Alaska State Legislative Finance Division and as state finance director. The story previously misstated the university was hiring for a permanent chancellor at UAA.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderStacey Abrams’ New Georgia Project is a thing of the past, but it may still be a major topic of conversation when lawmakers gather next year for the annual legislative session
The voter engagement project founded by Stacey Abrams in 2013 announced in October that it was dissolving after the Georgia Ethics Commission concluded the organization violated state campaign finance law and charged the group a $300,000 fine, the largest fine for an ethics violation in state history.

Ethics commission executive director David Emadi said the New Georgia Project admitted to the violations after a lengthy legal process.
“They admitted they failed to register as an independent committee or super PAC,” he said. “They admitted they failed to file all required disclosure reports in the 2018 primary and general election. They admitted they failed to disclose over $4 million … They admitted failing to disclose in those reports over just over $3.2 million in political expenditures.”
Abrams, a former state House minority leader, left the group in 2017 ahead of her first run for governor in 2018, when her near-win made her a national star.
Emadi said the money was spent on items including staff, canvassers and phone bankers in offices across the state. Some of the violations were also tied to an unsuccessful 2019 MARTA expansion ballot initiative in Gwinnett County.
Emadi said Abrams may have separated from the group before her first run for governor, but investigators are still looking into whether she was coordinating with the group after officially stepping back, which would be another violation of state law.
Sen. Bill Cowsert. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
A GOP-led panel Thursday floated ideas for legislation that members said would discourage organizations from illegally funding political candidates in the 2026 midterms and beyond.
State Sen. Bill Cowsert, an Athens Republican who chairs the Senate Special Committee on Investigations, expressed frustration at what he characterized as legal delay tactics that the New Georgia Project used in court and suggested stiffening penalties for campaign finance violations when committed by an organization.
“The candidate had the benefit of $4.2 million spent on her behalf that was illegal,” said Cowsert, who is running for attorney general next year. “And this entity, which is now probably defunct, gets fined by just getting caught at the end after a rope-a-dope, four corners defense, finally coughs up $300,000. And I don’t see where anybody was (held) accountable.”
Individual politicians who run afoul of campaign law can be made to pay fines in addition to repaying ill-gotten or misspent funds. Cowsert suggested codifying similar penalties or even jail time for members of organizations who knowingly violate the law.
“If the worst thing that can happen to you is the illegally obtained contributions you’ve got that hadn’t yet been expended get forfeited to the state, that’s not so bad,” he added. “It’s different if you’re thinking I’ve got to write you a check and pay a personal civil penalty, if you wanna call it that, or a criminal fine, or I might be going to jail.”
Cowsert also mentioned the idea of capping donations to super PACs but indicated that might run afoul of Supreme Court decisions like Citizens United.
Emadi suggested lawmakers could consider granting the ethics commission the power to question people under oath during investigations, which he said would help investigators determine whether campaigns were illegally coordinating with outside groups.
Sen. Harold Jones. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
“I think if you can provide the ability to depose individuals in the course of an existing investigation, like a complaint’s been filed – and I want to be very careful. I’m not talking about an ethics commission run amok that can do whatever they want – but if there is an ethics complaint filed and we’re trying to figure out what were they coordinating or maybe there’s a third party complaint, maybe there’s some investigation happening, the ability to question people under oath before we go to a probable cause hearing,” Emadi said.
Senate Minority Leader Harold Jones blasted Thursday’s hearing as political theater.
“As Georgians face health insurance premiums that have doubled and even tripled, the Senate should not be wasting time on political persecutions that have already been fully investigated elsewhere,” the Augusta Democrat said in a statement. “Our focus must be on solving the affordability crisis, the housing crisis and the rapidly rising cost of utilities. Georgians elected us to make their lives easier, not to subject our political opponents to state-funded witch hunts.”
David Emadi, Senate Special Committee on Investigations, Nov. 13, 2025. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Emadi, who was tapped as state ethics chief by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who ran against Abrams twice, said he’s been accused of targeting the New Georgia Project for political purposes. Speaking to reporters after the hearing, he said the ethics commission doesn’t consider politics in its investigations. He gave the example of the Georgia Republican Assembly PAC, which is a right-wing group under investigation for allegedly spending more than $200,000 to influence elections for conservative candidates.
“If it’s a left group, a right group, I don’t really care,” Emadi said. “We’re prosecuting the GRA right now because we have alleged – which is an allegation at this point in the legal process – but we’ve alleged they did the same sort of activity, and I’m comfortable just doing the right thing. It’s not that hard.”

Republican state House and Senate leaders announced late Thursday they will not heed Democratic Gov. Josh Stein’s call to return to Raleigh to approve funding to patch a shortfall in the state’s Medicaid budget.
North Carolina health officials, including state Health and Human Services Secretary Dev Sangvai, say state lawmakers shorted the Medicaid program by around $319 million for the current fiscal year. In October, Sangvai began implementing Medicaid cuts of 3% to 10% to offset that deficit.
The cuts mean health care providers are receiving less money to care for the 3.1 million North Carolinians enrolled in the program. Primary care doctors, dentists, hospitalizations, community care and nursing homes are all dependent on the program’s funding. A Wake County judge this week put some of the cuts on hold.
On Nov. 6, Stein held a news conference to call an “extra” session, more commonly known as a special session, on Nov. 17. The state constitution gives the governor the power to summon state lawmakers back to Raleigh to deal with emergencies.
At that news conference, Stein said legislators had “failed North Carolina and the people of North Carolina” by not addressing the issue during their October session, which was largely focused on redrawing the state’s congressional districts.
In a joint letter to Stein Thursday, House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) and Senate Leader Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) said they would not convene a session on Nov. 17, and said Stein’s call for a special session is constitutionally invalid and politically motivated.
They noted that they’re already in session, which makes an extra session a moot point, and added that the constitution only allows the governor to call lawmakers back for “extraordinary” circumstances. They said the Medicaid shortfall does not qualify.
“If circumstances surrounding the Medicaid [shortfall] are in fact extraordinary, it is only in the context of your administration’s failure to address them,” the letter says. “Ultimately, your decision to cut reimbursement rates at a time when sufficient funding exists belongs to your administration alone.”
Republican lawmakers contend that the Medicaid program has enough funding to continue without cuts through April, by which time they say they will have appropriated the additional funding needed to fund it for the rest of the fiscal year. They’re accusing Stein of cutting the program to damage them politically.
Stein and Sangvai say the program is required to have a balanced budget, and cannot operate on the promise of funding at a later time.
Stein responded to the letter on social media late Thursday, calling it the latest example of “dysfunction that has become the norm” for the General Assembly.
“The Republican majority has made the time to damage our democracy with their gerrymander,” Stein wrote. “But when it comes time to protect people’s health care? When it comes time to enact a comprehensive budget? They’re on vacation, and they’ll see us next year.”
Both the House and Senate separately approved plans earlier this fall to patch the shortfall. In the House, one bill would have let the state dip into a reserve fund to delay cuts through the end of the year; another contains just language to fund Medicaid. The Senate’s proposal to fund the program also includes line items for rural health care and the N.C. Children’s hospital, items the House does not agree with. The two chambers have been deadlocked over the issue for months.

(Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)The task of relocating Marcus Whitman’s statue in the Washington state Capitol is becoming a chore.
It’s been challenging to find a place inside where the 11-foot, 9,144-pound bronze statue won’t damage the historic structure. Moving it outside risks exposure to the elements, vandals or both. Either approach would be expensive undertakings.
Leaving the towering Whitman where it stands in the north portico appears increasingly off the table too.
Some state officials envision the foyer as the future home for a statue of Billy Frank Jr., the Nisqually Indian Tribe leader who was an indomitable force in the fight for the protection of salmon and Native American rights. Pairing Frank and Whitman, a doctor and missionary whose role in the displacement of Native Americans in the Pacific Northwest has been scrutinized, is a concern in Indian Country.
Willie Frank III, Frank’s son, has expressed “very strong feelings” about not having it in the same room, said Lt. Gov. Denny Heck at Thursday’s meeting of the State Capitol Committee that’s wrestled with the relocation decision for nearly a year.

So strong, the son offered to display Marcus Whitman at Wa He Lut Indian School at Franks Landing on the Nisqually Reservation, Heck said. But there’s opposition to taking it off campus from those who think both Whitman and Frank should occupy prominent positions at the Capitol, he said.
“We’ve got a lot of different points of view that are being brought here, and I am convinced that that if we deal with one another respectfully, we can get to a point where everybody is going to be comfortable with what we do,” Heck said in the meeting. 
He offered a new possibility: Move the Whitman statue down the hall to a space outside the entrance to the Senate cafeteria room, midway between the offices of the governor and the lieutenant governor.
A structural analysis costing as much as $35,000 must be done to determine if the location could support its massive girth.
Beau Perschbacher, a senior policy adviser to Gov. Bob Ferguson, said he was working with the state Department of Enterprise Services to see if the agency can proceed with existing funds. Otherwise, the Legislature would have to pony up in the 2026 supplemental budget.
Asked if Ferguson has a preferred location for the Whitman statue, Perschbacher replied, “I don’t know if we’ve made a decision on that.”
Decision time
Whitman, who settled near what is today Walla Walla in the 1830s, is one of two Washington figures to have a statue in the U.S. Capitol’s National Statuary Hall. The other is Mother Joseph for whom there is also a statue in the north portico of the state Capitol, across from Whitman.
State lawmakers in 2021 decided to replace the Whitman statue in the U.S. Capitol and another in the state Capitol building with statues of Frank. The Legislature earmarked $100,000 in the current capital budget to relocate the Whitman statue.
Until Thursday, the Capitol Committee had been considering six possible options: moving Whitman outside the south entrance, two variations of putting Whitman and Frank side-by-side, and three different ways with Mother Joseph and Frank side-by-side. 
Costs ranged from $10,000 to more than $200,000 based on the work involved in the moving of statues. The committee was on course to choose an approach in January but won’t now as the latest alternative is studied.
A decision is needed soon because the making of the two bronze statues of Frank is getting underway.
The Washington State Arts Commission has awarded Classic Foundry of Seattle a contract to complete the statues by May 2026.
The current timeline calls for delivery of a statue to the U.S. Capitol in September 2026. That is also seen as the earliest date for installation at the state Capitol, though it could be put in place in early 2027.
On Thursday, representatives from the foundry and the Billy Frank Jr. Statue Committee, including Willie Frank III and artist Haiying Wu, held a press conference to mark the selection of the foundry. It was held at Wa He Lut Indian School, the site of many of the fish-ins for treaty rights organized by Frank, who died in 2014 at the age of 83.
“We have an opportunity to tell the story of Washington — the good, the bad and the ugly — with the story of my father that is wrapped in this project,” said Willie Frank III, in a statement. “It is not the beginning or the end of the story or the work as there is much to do in education, health care, housing and continuing to protect and enhance our treaty rights of fishing, hunting and gathering.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/marcus-whitman-1024x597.png,,,2025-11-13 19:58:12.992749

The Louisiana Department of Health said Thursday it will distribute 100% of federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program funds to eligible recipients who haven’t received their November benefits stating next week. For those who received 65% of their assistance during the shutdown, they will get the remaining 35% next week.
The Landry administration reallocated health department money to make up for the loss of SNAP benefits at the start of November, when there was no end in sight to the federal government shutdown that had begun Oct. 1. The state set up a schedule to distribute 25% of benefits per week, prioritizing the elderly and disabled who typically get their funds early in the month. Anyone who received the one-fourth portion of state-funded assistance from Nov. 1-4 will keep that amount and receive the rest of their benefits this month, the health department said.
SNAP recipients will receive their benefits on their usual distribution day of the month, based on the last digit of the head of household’s Social Security number.

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Members of the Iowa Board of Regents called Thursday for further study of academic programs and their value when it comes to workforce alignment, enrollment and social good after receiving a report diving into such topics.
Board staff, with the help of internal and external partners and resources, developed a report on workforce alignment of academic programs after a February directive from Board President Sherry Bates. While the huge amount of data and information compiled in the report didn’t answer all of her questions, Board Chief Academic Officer Rachel Boon said it is helping her ask better ones.
Boon and Associate Chief Academic Officer Jason Pontius presented the report to the regents Thursday. Conversations are happening across the U.S. about the value of a college degree, its cost and the relationship between college and community, Boon said, but it’s important to measure those concerns against data applicable to Iowa.
“Much of what we see and hear in the discourse is based on national data,” Boon said. “So this is an opportunity for us to really not dismiss those claims, but really interrogate them locally and look at our own data and see what we can learn about our own context.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
However, efforts by institutions to consider the return on investment of their own academic programs are being made across the U.S. as well, a fact Boon said was helpful in the creation of this report.
Using data from universities, U.S. Department of Education, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Iowa Workforce Development and the American Community Survey, the team connected academic programs to industries and their outcomes and calculated how long it would take students to get a return on their investment, Pontius said.
Other organizations and universities have developed methods of calculating the return on investment for students earning a certain degree, Pontius said, which the board team adapted to their own needs.
“We’re not making up our own formula process,” Pontias said. “We’re just adopting what other folks have used, and then we’re working really hard to make direct connections between our university graduates and the workforce data sources that we have available.”
The group calculated break-even thresholds, described in the report as a way of determining how long it would take for a degree holder to earn more than a non-degree holder in the same job, for programs, factoring in the time and cost of education as well as debt.
Pontius said 75% of majors at Iowa’s public universities would “break even” within three years compared to someone who started working right out of high school, and more popular programs shrink that time.
Taking on enrollment was a “smaller lift” for the team than looking at return on investment, Boon said, but there are factors like demand, student interest and aptitude, accreditation caps and general education requirements to consider when scrutinizing enrollment in certain programs. Some degrees may be more popular as secondary majors rather than main areas of study, and certain areas might have a low workforce demand but still need experts in the field.
The report stated universities determined that “low enrollment thresholds” for academic programs would be 25 or fewer students in undergraduate programs and 10 or fewer students in graduate programs.
The University of Northern Iowa had the most undergraduate classes come in underneath the enrollment threshold at 17, Boon said, two of which are new programs. The University of Iowa had 13 programs under the threshold, two with enrollment caps from accreditors, and Iowa State University had 12, four of which were identified as second-major only.
As for graduate programs, ISU had 35 under the threshold, two of which are new. Two of the 16 UI programs identified in the report as not meeting the threshold are also new, and UNI is phasing out two of the 12 programs the report listed.
Recommendations call for expanded use of data
Recommendations from the study team were split into categories based on their relation to workforce alignment, enrollment and data.
As the dashboard created for the report is “pretty dense,” Boon said, the report recommends taking aspects of it, like the break-even calculation, and adding them to existing dashboards available to the public. The report also recommends that universities find “data-informed strategies “to support students in connecting degree tracks and various opportunities for experiential learning to their career objectives.”
When looking at enrollment, the report stated the review process the board uses to scrutinize academic programs should include information on low enrollment thresholds in addition to other facts.
Universities should create “a framework or index for program vitality that factors in enrollment as well as issues such as, but not limited to, licensure or accreditation requirements, service to other areas of study … and faculty resources,” the report stated. The institutions should also find opportunities to change or close programs “that would generate administrative efficiencies, improve academic program alignments, or create enhanced opportunities for workforce preparation.”
ISU associate professor Annemarie Butler, the only person to speak during public comment Wednesday, encouraged the regents to accept and implement the report’s recommendations but warned that the data could be misleading as to how important and necessary certain programs are.
“Please honor the recommendation to empower each university to conduct holistic reviews of their low enrollment majors in light of the wide variety of considerations identified in the report,” Butler said. “Our public universities’ curricula are interdependent and not neatly parceled into independent departmental silos.”
Pontius and Boon acknowledged Thursday that there are gaps in the data, due to their rule of only using publicly available data and the limitations of some of the data they did use. Boon said she’d like to have more time to fill these gaps with supplemental data and work with others trying to evaluate their own programs to find solutions, and it is recommended in the report.
Other recommendations include continued review of the assignment of codes meant to track academic programs to “reduce variance” in how codes are assigned — a task Boon said universities are already working on — and encouraging improved data collection by Iowa Workforce Development to include the actual jobs graduates are taking rather than just the industries they’re going into.
Further study, discussion planned
After receiving the report, board members questioned what next steps were to be, including eliminating degree programs. Regents Robert Cramer and Christine Hensley said higher education stakeholders, including legislators, are waiting to see what comes after the information is gathered.
“In some of the conversations I’ve had with legislators, I think there’s a feeling that there should be specific recommendations as to which programs and/or majors should be eliminated,” Hensley said.
Regent Kurt Tjaden suggested hearing directly from university officials about the report and the threshold calculations in it at the board’s February meeting, adding that knowing the university perspective will help when answering lawmakers’ questions.
Boon said the team could do even more with the report ahead of the February meeting, like “cross hatch” workforce alignment data with program enrollment data to see which low-enrollment programs have a high return on investment — a “complex” task that they didn’t have time to complete.
Another area the study group, as well as colleges in Florida and Arizona, is trying to figure out is how to measure social and community impacts of degree programs. This would be a factor in determining return on investment for areas like teaching, social work, community and behavioral health, Boon said, and other fields where wage outcomes might not reflect the necessity of their work. It was also the final recommendation of the report.
“We haven’t cracked that nut yet, but we want to,” Boon said. “So I’d love, a year from now, if we could come and tell you about the really exciting new index we have on social and community impact of our majors, that would be a really powerful outcome to me.”

SNAP uncertainty spiking demand at Idaho food banks

Amid the longest federal government shutdown in U.S. history, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare had paused November benefits for the federally funded Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.
Two court challenges against the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s decision not to use contingency funding to keep the program running during the shutdown resulted in a USDA directive for states to issue at least partial payments. 
The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare began providing partial payments on Nov. 7, the Idaho Capital Sun reported. 
The U.S. House on Wednesday night approved a stopgap funding bill that President Donald Trump then signed to end the government shutdown. 
More than 130,000 Idahoans use the program that helps low-income Americans pay for groceries. The average monthly benefit is $178 per household member. 
 Implementation of SNAP’s expanded work requirements delayed by shutdown 

Additional work requirements for SNAP recipients included in the federal “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” were supposed to go into effect Nov. 1. However, with disruptions from the shutdown, states were told to prioritize funding for SNAP benefits administration, Idaho Health and Welfare spokesperson AJ McWhorter said in an email. 
“Idaho is currently working to implement the changes in work program requirements now that states will begin receiving full funding,” McWhorter said Thursday.
According to a USDA memo sent to states on Oct. 3, the changes are to the exceptions for the three-month time limit for able-bodied adults without dependents to use SNAP.  
New work rules could deny food stamps to thousands of veterans


Able bodied adults without dependents up to age 64 will need to show they are working or eligible for another exemption to be able to access benefits for more than three months. The previous upper age limit for this time limit requirement was 54, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. 


Previous exemptions for veterans, those experiencing homelessness or youth aging out of foster care will be removed.  
The time limit exemption for caregivers of children under the age of 18 has been narrowed to those with children under age 14. 
A new exception for the time limit was created for Native Americans, Alaska Natives, and tribal members. 

For states to waive the work requirements, they must now show an unemployment rate over 10%, with exceptions for Alaska and Hawaii. The prior waiver allowed states to identify areas that lack sufficient jobs.

U.S. attorney for Wyoming says detrimental effects of marijuana are ""undeniable"" and he will ""rigorously"" enforce the law.
The post Marijuana users upset Trump will harsh their national park mellow, prosecute for possession appeared first on WyoFile .","National Park rangers will start “rigorously” enforcing statutes outlawing simple possession of marijuana in Wyoming’s federal reserves, reversing a Biden-era policy, Wyoming’s U.S. Attorney Darin Smith announced Thursday.
“Marijuana possession remains a federal crime in the United States, irrespective of varying state laws,” Smith said in a statement. Enforcement will be rigorous on federal land, “such as national parks,” Smith’s statement reads.
Cannabis carries dangers, he told WyoFile through a spokesperson.
“This administration thinks that marijuana use is a public safety hazard and this office is going to uphold the law and ensure safety and security of the public within our jurisdiction,” Smith said.
The announcement harshed the mellow of several marijuana users who told WyoFile they have enjoyed smoking pot while visiting the parks. One said she would continue to partake.
“I definitely think it’s absurd,” said Alice Wise, who asked WyoFile to identify her with that pseudonym for fear of prosecution or harassment. She said smoking marijuana in national parks has enhanced her experiences.
“National Parks are reserved for recreation. Why add more restrictions to our public lands?” John Dough
“Nothing would stop me,” not even the new directive, the Wyoming resident said.
A memo from the Department of Justice last month prompted Attorney Smith’s announcement, said Lori Hogan, a spokesperson for his office. The new enforcement reverses an effective non-prosecution policy put in place by President Biden in 2022.
Biden’s pardon
On Oct. 6 of that year, Biden pardoned people convicted or charged federally with simple possession. The pardons applied to more than 6,000 people, according to an analysis by Theodore M. Shaw, a law professor at the University of North Carolina’s Center for Civil Rights.
The pardons effectively decriminalized simple possession or use of marijuana on federal lands, according to a commentary by John Hudak on the Brookings Institution website. Even if a federal prosecutor in the Biden administration had chosen to charge somebody for simple possession, “it would be a waste of his department’s time and resources to pursue charges that a president will ultimately pardon,” Hudak wrote.
What effect the new DOJ prosecution policy will have on illicit pot smoking in parks is uncertain.
“National Parks are reserved for recreation, for the benefit and enjoyment of the American people,” said a Jackson Hole marijuana user who asked to be identified by the pseudonym John Dough for fear of prosecution or harassment. “Why add more restrictions to our public lands?”
He quoted a John Prine lyric from the song Illegal Smile; “I didn’t kill anyone, I’m just trying to have me some fun.”
“It’s really none of the government’s business,” said Dough, who said he has been smoking pot in parks for 50 years. “I think it’s unfortunate we’re backtracking on that.”
Marijuana user Wise said attitudes regarding marijuana and other controlled substances are changing.
“The whole world has woken up about marijuana and many other consciousness-changing substances that are found to be useful,” she said. “It seems like the current administration just wants to remove every pleasure.”
Biden curtailed prosecution
Biden’s pardons “significantly curtailed” federal prosecutions of misdemeanor marijuana offenses, Smith’s office said in a release. But spokesperson Hogan said it would be difficult to determine whether incidents involving marijuana — such as impaired driving — are increasing.
“We don’t typically keep stats on that kind of stuff,” she said. “There are so many different codes that falls under, it’s really hard to query that kind of information in our system.”
Wyoming has not made marijuana possession legal like some other states. Montana, where part of Yellowstone National Park is located, has decriminalized cannabis. Pot shops are located within about a 20-minute drive of the park’s border.
According to the Drug Enforcement Administration, marijuana is classified as a Schedule I drug, along with heroin, LSD, ecstasy, peyote and others. 
“The detrimental effects of drugs on our society are undeniable,” Smith’s statement reads, “and I am committed to using every prosecutorial tool available to hold offenders accountable.”
Biden “directed U.S. Attorneys not to prosecute those offenses,” the announcement from Smith’s office said. Hudak’s commentary, however, said that Biden was careful not to direct then-Attorney General Merrick Garland.
“The president has publicly noted a desire for the Justice Department to be independent and buffered from political puppeteering,” Hudak wrote.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-14 00:01:07+00:00,CT Mirror,"CT legislature votes to limit ICE arrests in courthouses, enhance data protections",Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/13/ct-legislature-special-session-immigration/,Immigrant advocates who supported the bill said it addressed their concerns about federal agencies' access to immigrants' personal data.,"State lawmakers passed a bill, largely on party lines, limiting the actions U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement can take at courthouses and prohibiting state agencies from widely sharing state residents’ personal information. 
Under House Bill 8004, state agencies are banned from sharing personal information like home addresses, workplaces or dates and times of court hearings and appointments. The bill will also codify a policy first enacted by Connecticut Supreme Court Chief Justice Raheem Mullins in September, which forbids ICE agents from making arrests inside state courthouses without a judicial warrant. The bill also prohibits law enforcement agents from wearing masks on courthouse grounds “unless medically necessary.” 
Immigrant advocates who supported the bill said it addressed their concerns about federal agencies’ access to immigrants’ personal data but didn’t entirely resolve their anxieties about the recent surge in immigrant detentions. 
Camila Bortolleto, a steering committee member with the advocacy group HUSKY for Immigrants, stood with a handful of people at the Capitol on Wednesday holding signs representing immigrants who had been detained by ICE in Danbury — many at the courthouse.
“ If Connecticut had passed this policy a couple months ago, these folks likely will not have been arrested by ICE,” Bortolleto said.
Sen. Gary Winfield, D-New Haven, said Thursday that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had asked ICE to identify themselves after a series of people were found to have been impersonating ICE officers. The purpose of the immigration provisions in H.B. 8004, he said, was to ensure that people felt safe at courthouses and that the courthouses could operate efficiently. 
“ It’s not about our feelings about police, our feelings about ICE. It’s about the people who are interfacing with our court system,” he said. 
Rep. Steven Stafstrom, D-Bridgeport, echoed Winfield in a debate in the House of Representatives on Wednesday night. 
“We’ve all seen the videos. It’s hard not to see the videos of folks being tackled, roughed up, windows being broken when court is in session,” Stafstrom said. 
“When folks are walking into our courthouse, many of whom are not there as criminal defendants, many of whom are there as victims of crime, many of them are there as witnesses to crime. Many of them are there for divorce proceedings or to get a restraining order or to fight an abusive creditor or to seek justice in a landlord-tenant situation. That’s the majority of folks in our courthouse on a day in day basis,” Stafstrom said. 
But Rep. Craig Fishbein, R-Wallingford, questioned whether the ban on courthouse arrests would have any meaningful effect. The bill prevents ICE from arresting people for civil violations, but Fishbein said that entering the U.S. illegally, as well as failing to register with the federal government, is considered a criminal offense. 
Chris Llinas, an immigration attorney with offices in Hartford and Portland, told the Connecticut Mirror that Fishbein’s interpretation of the law was incorrect. 
“Unlawful presence in the U.S. — overstaying a visa, lacking valid status, being in removal proceedings, etc. — is a civil immigration violation, not a crime,” said Llinas. “Most people ICE targets at courthouses are subject only to civil enforcement.” 
Llinas said the bill would prevent ICE from arresting people who had overstayed their visas, people without legal status who had no criminal records, immigrants in removal proceedings, asylum seekers and people who were going to the courthouse as victims or as witnesses. 
Republicans in the Senate said they were concerned that lax rules would allow immigrants who committed violent crimes to avoid deportation. 
Sen. Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, said he disagreed with the idea of stopping ICE from making arrests in courthouses. “ You’re protecting criminals. In many cases, the individuals that are going to the courthouse are facing charges, in some cases violent crime,” Harding said. “And you’re telling me that we’re going to keep these individuals in the country and keep ICE away from there. I mean, what logical policy is that?” 
Bortolleto, of HUSKY for Immigrants, said her group was most concerned about data being shared by the Department of Motor Vehicles — since many immigrants hold drive-only licenses — and from the Department of Social Services, which provides health insurance for children and pregnant women without legal status. 
On Thursday afternoon, Sen. Ryan Fazio, R-Greenwich, raised two amendments proposing changes to Connecticut’s Trust Act, which dictates the circumstances under which local law enforcement can cooperate with ICE. 
Under the current Trust Act, law enforcement can only turn someone over to ICE if the agency presents a judicial warrant or if the individual has been convicted of a high-level felony. Fazio’s amendments would have expanded the exception to include all felonies or to those who had been either arrested or convicted for a high-level felony. 
“These individuals who are convicted of serious crimes are being protected in the state of Connecticut,” said Fazio. 
Both amendments failed on a party-line vote. 
While lawmakers debated changes to state law, Connecticut Attorney General William Tong filed a joint amicus brief, with 18 other states, in a case against the Trump administration that’s proceeding through federal immigration court. The case challenges the Trump administration’s new policies on expedited deportations, which allow immigration officers to deport people who enter the country illegally without first giving them the opportunity to appear before a judge. 
Formerly applicable only to immigrants who had entered the U.S. without inspection and were captured by law enforcement within two weeks of their arrival and 100 miles of the border, the Trump administration now has expanded that policy to include people who enter the U.S. without inspection who are detained anywhere in the U.S. and within two years of their arrival. 
The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia paused the new policy this summer, saying it fails to give due process to people who may have been in the U.S. for an extended period of time, and it risks wrongful deportations.   
Bortolleto said there were other proposals immigration advocates wanted that hadn’t made it into the bill, like allowing people to attend court hearings remotely and a commitment that the state will not use the National Guard for immigration enforcement. She also wants the state to fund health insurance through HUSKY for refugees, asylees, and other legally present immigrants who will lose eligibility for federally funded health insurance in October 2026. 
Carmen Lanche, executive director of Comunidades Sin Fronteras, told CT Mirror that there were immigrants who were afraid to go to court. She said that children didn’t want to go to school out of fear that they wouldn’t see their parents again. 
“We don’t want to live in fear. We don’t want our children, who are the future of this country, to grow up with trauma, because childhood traumas are carried into adulthood,” Lanche said. “We want children to be happy, healthy and to continue studying, and to not worry about these things that don’t have to happen.” 
H.B. 8004 was taken up in a 2-day special session this week along with three other bills addressing housing, hospitals and an emergency state funding reserve. 
The bill also carried a hodgepodge of other provisions, including an added 5-cent charge on phone bills for a fund for firefighters diagnosed with cancer. Republicans said they wanted to support the cancer fund but argued that it should be funded through the state budget rather than through a tax. 
Additionally, the bill contained provisions pertaining to behavioral health services, including a requirement that insurers cover autism services for young adults up to age 26, a study to examine and identify gaps in programs available for children’s mental health, and another study of a Yale program for children with intensive mental health needs. 
The bill passed the House 96-48 and passed the Senate 27-8, with three Republican Senators joining the Democrats Thursday evening. It heads now to the governor’s desk.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025_1113_SR_SpecialSession_011-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-13 19:58:12.992749

Fire ignites at Glenrock power plant after power outage hits multiple parts of the state, official says.
The post Tripped power lines cut electricity to 95,000 Wyoming customers appeared first on WyoFile .","A multistate power outage Thursday left as many as 95,000 customers in Wyoming without electricity, according to some reports, and may have caused a fire at the Dave Johnston coal-fired power plant near Glenrock. 
The outages affected more than 10% of Wyoming customers and extended into portions of western South Dakota, according to reports.
“We believe the outage, which began around 12:45 p.m., was triggered by two tripped 500-kilovolt lines near Medicine Bow, Wyoming,” Western Area Power Administration Public Affairs Specialist Stephen J. Collier said in a statement. “This incident resulted in an abnormal voltage event that subsequently tripped a number of surrounding lines, including WAPA transmission, resulting in further power outages to communities across the area.”
By 4:30 p.m., electricity was restored to about half of the affected customers, according to PowerOutage.us. But officials warned that power delivery could remain unstable.
Authorities were searching for correlations between the events, according to Wyoming Department of Homeland Security Director Lynn Budd, while utility workers were gradually restoring power to impacted communities around the state. 
The widespread outage was highly unusual, because it affected several different electrical utility providers, including Rocky Mountain Power, Black Hills Energy and Montana-Dakota Utilities customers. The affected utilities share an interconnected grid.
The fire at Dave Johnston started after the power outage, Budd said. The agency reiterated that because the Dave Johnston power plant fire happened after the power outage, the fire was a “possible consequence of the power outage, not the cause.”
WyoFile was waiting on more information from the Converse County Emergency Management office — though an official in that office reached at 3:30 p.m. said the fire had been put out. There were no emergency vehicles visible just outside the entry gate to the Dave Johnston coal-fired power plant shortly after 2 p.m.

Outages were reported in Gillette, Casper, Douglas, Newcastle and Sheridan, among other communities in Wyoming. Natrona County took the biggest hit, according to PowerOutage.us, which tracks electricity disruptions. 
Rocky Mountain Power reported 55 outages in Wyoming affecting 56,776 customers around 2 p.m.
Powder River Energy Corporation, which serves Campbell, Crook, Johnson, Sheridan and Weston counties, reported 26,544 customers experiencing outages.
Intermittent outages persisted in some Wyoming communities throughout Thursday afternoon. 
“Bottom line, members should be prepared for an extended outage through the night. The voltages coming into our system are unstable and are tripping off power,” Powder River Energy Corporation wrote on its Facebook page shortly after 3:30 p.m. Thursday. “That’s why some are seeing ‘lights on, lights off’. We have crews staged at almost every substation to begin safe restoration of power once the voltages stabilize. However, we do not want to flip the switches unsafely. We do not want to blow up transformers or arrestors and cause more problems.”

In Gillette, the city government reported a community-wide outage at 12:40 p.m. An hour later, the city posted on its Facebook page that power had been restored. Things changed again 40 minutes later.
“As of approximately 2:20 p.m., all of the City is out of service again,” an updated post read. “We are being affected by a widespread regional outage and do not have an expected return to service at this time.”
The outage in Casper appeared city-wide, the police department there reported. The agency directed people who were dependent on oxygen and in need of electricity to two locations in the city. 
Natrona County’s library and YMCA closed early due to the outages, and several local businesses reported the same. The Natrona County School District canceled all after-school activities, according to a text sent to parents.
Some businesses, including a liquor store, in Glenrock — just a few miles from the Dave Johnston plant — posted written signs that they were temporarily closed due to the power outages. Non-essential Natrona County offices closed for the remainder of the business day. The city of Casper announced that a number of its facilities — including City Hall, Casper Recreation Center, Casper Ice Arena, Casper Family Aquatic Center, and Fort Casper — closed early and would not reopen until Friday due to the unstable electricity.
Suggested safety precautions
Treat all downed power lines as live and extremely dangerous. Stay away and report them immediately to 911 and your local utility provider. 

Conserve cell phone battery: Limit non-essential calls and use text messaging where possible. Utilize cell phone carriers or public safety radio for emergency communication. 
Use generators safely: If operating a portable generator, NEVER run it inside a home, garage, or any enclosed space. Ensure proper ventilation to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning. 
Check on neighbors: Check on vulnerable family members, neighbors, and friends, particularly the elderly or those dependent on electricity for medical equipment. 
Use alternate facilities: Residents who are oxygen-dependent or require power for life-sustaining medical equipment and do not have backup power are encouraged to contact their local emergency management office or visit designated facilities. 
Avoid overloading circuits: Once power is restored, gradually turn on appliances to prevent overloading the local circuits.

But they show no significant gains, either.
Since 2021-22, the first year of student data after the pandemic, the share of students passing the assessment — including the initial test and any retest — has hovered around 85%.
The Mississippi Department of Education announced Thursday that data point holds true for the 2024-25 school year, with 85% of the state’s third graders ultimately passing the reading assessment required to graduate to the next grade, just barely higher than last year’s rate of 84%.
The new pass rate remains lower than in 2018-19, when it was 85.6%. 
It’s the latest chapter in Mississippi’s national reading success story, called a “miracle” by some but, more recently, a “marathon” by state education leaders. Over the past decade, the percentage of the state’s fourth graders scoring advanced or proficient on the National Assessment of Educational Progress — or The Nation’s Report Card — has skyrocketed, with Mississippi going from last in the nation to ninth. NAEP is separate from the state assessment.
Researchers, educators and lawmakers largely attribute that progress to the Literacy-Based Promotion Act of 2013. The law funneled money and targeted curriculum toward improving literacy outcomes, and famously established a third-grade reading test.
Students have three tries to score at least a 3 or higher on the reading portion of the state’s English Language Arts assessment to move to fourth grade. Students can score up to 5, which is considered advanced. 
The latest results show 13.9% of Mississippi third graders scored a 5, while 35.5% scored a 4 and 26.3% scored a 3. About a quarter of students did not pass the assessment.
The initial administration of the test in the spring resulted in a record pass rate of 77.3%. Students who don’t pass get another try in May, and a final attempt in June. If they’re still unsuccessful after the third attempt, they’re held back in third grade, unless they have a district-determined exemption — they have certain learning disabilities, they are learning English or they were previously retained. 
Students with disabilities who were previously retained or received two years of intensive remediation accounted for about a half of the “good cause” exemptions for 2024-25. Another third were promoted because they were tested using an alternative assessment.  
Over 2,132 third-graders, or 6%, were held back.
“Educators and teachers across Mississippi understand the importance of ensuring young students have a solid literacy foundation,” State Superintendent of Education Lance Evans said in a statement. “We also applaud every teacher, administrator, literacy coach, parent and student for their hard work in achieving literacy success.”
The state education agency said in a press release that over the past year, in an attempt to raise literacy outcomes, it provided training from literacy coaches to certain schools, expanded professional development opportunities, encouraged the usage of “high-quality instructional materials” and helped integrate Science of Reading teaching for educators-in-training.
The department said at a Senate hearing this fall that it hopes to expand the reading act into grades 4 through 8. Data show that despite the major reading gains among younger students, that success hasn’t translated into higher grades.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/06161248/serena-venus-scaled.jpg,,,2025-11-13 18:57:49.359861

(Photo by Jessica Kourkounis for the Pennsylvania Capital-Star)A number of changes to K-12 school policy and funding are included in Pennsylvania’s 2025-2026 budget. 
Primarily, they’re based around increasing oversight of cyber charter schools, increasing the amount of money doled out through the state’s adequacy formula and recruiting and retaining teachers as the commonwealth faces a shortage.
While most policy shifts are relatively small, public education advocates have called the budget a positive step in the right direction.
“While the delayed budget makes planning and operations difficult for public schools, this agreement demonstrates what’s possible when our leaders prioritize students and work together to meet Pennsylvania’s constitutional duty to provide a ‘thorough and efficient’ public education system,” said a statement from PA Schools Work, a coalition of organizations that have advocated for Pennsylvania public schools.

Cyber Charter funding and oversight
Some of the biggest education policy changes in the budget revolve around cyber charters, which are privately operated and paid for with tax dollars that students can attend remotely via webcam.
Cyber charters have come under intense scrutiny in Pennsylvania by officials from both parties. A February report by GOP state Auditor General Tim DeFoor looking at five cyber charters found they were raising large amounts of money and spending it in ways that didn’t seem tied to educational outcomes or opportunities.
Generally, tuition for cyber charter schools comes from the public school districts where the students resides. This remains the case, but public schools will now be able to deduct a greater amount from the total they would have had to pay per student.
The legislature estimates savings for public school districts will be around $178 million statewide.
The move was a compromise with mostly Democratic lawmakers and Gov. Josh Shapiro, who had called to cap cyber charter tuition at $8,000 per student.
”It’s a step in the right direction, and it is a very welcome step,” said Susan Spicka, the executive director of Education Voters PA, who has been a longtime advocate for cyber charter reform.
A number of policies will also be instituted with the intent of adding accountability for cyber charters.
One is an attempt to reign in truancy at the largely remote schools. A new policy will bar public school students with high truancy rates from transferring to cyber charters, unless a judge decides it’s in their best interest.
Students will also be required to be visible on webcam during synchronous instruction — real-time lessons — in order to be marked in attendance.

Cyber charters will also be required to conduct mandatory weekly wellness checks on students. Teachers will also be required to undergo training in recognizing signs of child abuse.
The moves follow the death of one cyber charter student following severe abuse at home, signs of which were not reported by teachers. That led the students’ family to file a wrongful death lawsuit against her school.
The budget also institutes a policy that’s intended to make it easier for public school districts to dispute paying cyber charter tuition for students who are no longer residents.
House Education Chair Peter Schweyer (D-Lehigh) says the move came in response to reports that public school districts faced an onerous process for disputing tuition payments for students that moved during the school year.
“The goal isn’t to beat up on the cyber schools,” Schweyer said of the reforms. “It’s to make sure the students are learning and the tax payers are getting what they’re paying for in all this.”
Tweaking the adequacy formula
Last year,  lawmakers created a new adequacy formula for doling money to the state’s least funded school districts. That was in response to a Commonwealth Court ruling that found the state’s public school funding scheme had been unconstitutionally inequitable.
By and large, the adequacy formula, which takes into account factors like district poverty levels and the number of students learning English as a second language, remains the same this year. However, more than $500 million  in additional dollars will be distributed through it.
Most of the funding was part of a planned step up from last year. When lawmakers created the formula, they had planned to increase spending through it annually until the total reaches around $4.5 billion after nine years.
Yet despite early pushback from some Republicans, who said they felt too much money was being distributed to a school system with dwindling enrollment numbers, the budget that passed will dole out even more money through the adequacy formula than what Gov. Josh Shapiro had asked for in his February budget address.
That’s because lawmakers instituted a $50,000 minimum distribution for all school districts, meaning even districts that would have otherwise received no money through the adequacy formula will now receive the $50,000 each.

More than 130 of the 500 public school districts will receive the minimum amount this year.
“We recognize that all school districts have some sort of additional needs, so we put a minimum funding balance of $50,000 for all school districts,” Schweyer said. “None of that hurts any school districts, in fact it makes sure that all school districts are in a good space.”
The move to increase funding through the adequacy formula, which faced an uncertain future during the months-long negotiation over the budget, was hailed by public school advocates.
“With this budget, lawmakers affirmed that the Commonwealth remains on the path toward a fully and fairly funded public education system,” read a joint statement from the Education Law Center and Public Interest Law Center, two nonprofits that were involved in the lawsuit that led to the creation of the adequacy formula. “This is another step forward – one that must be followed by continued commitment and sustained investment until every student, in every community, has the resources they need to learn and thrive.”
Teacher recruitment and retention
The budget also institutes policies aimed at helping Pennsylvania schools recruit and retain teachers.
Currently, the state  faces a teacher shortage, with a high number leaving the industry and a dwindling number of people entering it.
Policies implemented by the new budget are intended to make it easier for new teachers to enter the profession, including those coming from nontraditional backgrounds.
One of those, long sought by the Pennsylvania State Education Association, increases funding for student teacher stipends, which allows the state to pay student teachers for the time they spend in classrooms working towards their certifications.
Another new policy allows  districts to hire teachers with lapsed certifications while working with them to help them re-certify.
According to Schweyer, this policy is aimed at making it easier for former teachers who left the field to care for families or pursue other careers get back into the classroom.
The budget also creates what’s called an experience-based teaching certificate, which is intended to fast track the certification process for professionals who want to transition into teaching in fields related to their work.

For example, a school district could hire a professional chemist as a high school science teacher. They would then get an experience-based teaching certificate and have five years to complete their practicum while working as a teacher.
Other changes include a mandatory shift towards what’s called evidence-based literacy education for teachers working with young children on reading skills.
Students in kindergarten through third grade will also be screened for reading ability three times a year. If a student’s reading skills are found to be deficient, their parents will be notified. All schools will also be required to report to the Department of Education annually on their students’ progress.
The budget also includes a policy that expands the number of grades that a teacher can be certified to teach at any given time.
$125 million will also be set aside for school facility repairs, including at least $25 million for the Solar for Schools program, as well as $100 million for school safety and mental health grants.
It will also become a requirement for graduating students to enroll in FAFSA, which is intended to encourage more students to apply for colleges, unless they choose to opt out.

(Jordan Hansen / Daily Montanan)BOZEMAN —Scattered across a couple tables at Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks Region 3 Headquarters on Wednesday night, were the decapitated heads of several deer.
Those attending the event, aimed at teaching the public about Chronic Wasting Disease, got expert instruction on how to remove lymph nodes from an animal, which are then sent to a lab for testing. Chronic Wasting Disease, often abbreviated as “CWD,” is a neurological disease that elk, deer and moose can be infected with.
It is not a virus nor a bacteria, but a transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. Basically, a naturally occurring protein, called a prion, becomes misfolded and is not broken down by the animal the way it should be. Prions can be spread through contact, feces, and other bodily fluids. Soil that has been contaminated with any of those fluids can also infect other animals.
CWD is always fatal to the creature and they may carry and spread the disease long before they show symptoms. Those symptoms can sometimes be similar to other animal diseases and there isn’t a cure. There’s also never been a confirmed case of CWD transmission to humans.
It’s one of the main wild animal diseases the state is investing significant time, money and staffing into.
“We have to respond pretty rapidly when we get a first detection, because it’s probably been there for a while,” FWP wildlife biologist Bevin McCormick said. “So that is a really big challenge.”
Meat from animals testing positive for CWD should not be eaten and part of Wednesday’s event was to show how easy the process of removing lymph nodes was. Following a demonstration from agency staffer Jasmine Allison, those in attendance were given a head, gloves and a scalpel.
Montana State freshman Candace Ashworth, who said she came to the event because she’s curious about animal diseases and it fits within her classwork, thought the experience was pretty cool.
“I’ve done dissections for anatomy classes before in high school,” Ashworth said. “And I’m like, this is totally different, and something that I can actually use later in life. I go hunting. This is super important and I didn’t know how to figure out what they sample.”
The process is not particularly difficult — which staff in attendance stressed — but there are a few things that help. First and foremost, if you bring a head to any of FWP’s facilities, they’ll get the glands out for you. Some people prefer mailing in the samples, which is also an option.

It can take a few days for outlying offices to get a result back, staff said, though the FWP headquarters facility is across the street from where they test samples, meaning turnaround time is quick there.
It’s hard to tell if an animal is outwardly sick, so FWP stresses to always get an animal tested.
Not everyone does, though but Allison said the little bit of time out of the day is worth knowing.
“Even if you did the whole process with us at one of our stations, 15 minutes, max,” she said.
One of the biggest things hunters can do to help is to make sure they leave a few inches of neck, as this makes it easier to recover the glands. The lymph nodes will also feel very different than the surrounding tissue, Allison said. 
Chronic Wasting Disease is a rising issue in Montana, with the first confirmed case coming in from a deer in 2017. Since that point, the state has undertaken a significant surveillance effort, though work in-state tracking the disease goes back to 1998.
Beyond the disease testing service, a CWD annual report is generated each year by the agency and maps documenting where the disease has been found are updated frequently.

During the 2024-25 hunting season, the state tested just less than 10,000 deer, elk and moose for CWD.
“Of these, 356 animals tested positive for CWD, including 128 mule deer, 222 white-tailed deer, and 6 elk,” the 2024 CWD annual report states.
The report goes on to say the disease has been found in 30% of Montana hunting districts. Seven new districts reported CWD cases last year, the report said, and other districts reported new species getting the disease.
“The geographic distribution of CWD continues to expand and prevalences continue to increase statewide,” the report states. 
Some areas of the state are also designated as CWD hotspots (called priority sampling areas) as well as a CWD Management Zone around Libby where the disease is more common.
Management hunts are one strategy that’s been tried around Libby, which the annual report says is being considered for hotspots in southwest Montana. Many of the hotspots are around major interstates, meaning there could be some degree of humans moving around the disease. That’s FWP suggests discarding anything from the animal in a class 2 landfill — prions can enter the water table and stay there for years. 
“FWP continues to plan for long-term CWD management in positive areas,” the report reads.
Importantly, CWD does not appear to be a major threat to cattle, though there are other diseases stemming from wild animals that are. A 10-year University of Wyoming study published in 2018 concluded that, “the risks of CWD transmission to cattle following oral inoculation or after prolonged exposure to contaminated environments are low.”
  CSKT awaiting confirmation on CWD test 

Tribal authorities said Thursday that a second case of CWD was awaiting confirmation from a white-tailed deer harvested on the Flathead Indian Reservation.
CSKT’s Division of Fish, Wildlife, and Recreation and Conservation is awaiting the results of the test from a second laboratory. A confirmed positive result was found in January, a tribal press release said.
“Our goal is to protect the community and prevent further spreading within our Reservation,” Rich Janssen, Natural Resources Department Head said in a release. “Tribal hunters need to be testing their harvests.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/FWP3-1024x678.jpg,,,2025-11-13 18:57:49.359861

Tim Walz speaks during a visit to Pine Bend Elementary School in Inver Grove Heights for a meeting of the Children's Cabinet Wednesday, Sept. 10, 2025. (Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Gov. Tim Walz boasted about Minnesota’s education system to a Texas audience on Thursday. He said Minnesota’s graduation rates are improving, free school meals set students up for success and universal pre-kindergarten education gives students a leg-up.
But Minnesota doesn’t have universal pre-K. On top of that, child care in Minnesota is among the most expensive in the nation.
Walz made the incorrect assertion at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, where he spoke for nearly an hour. The Democratic-Farmer-Labor governor, who is running for an unprecedented third, four-year term, was invited to the annual event to discuss his vice presidential run last year and the national political scene.
Walz was asked how he would advise Texans to improve educational outcomes for pre-K through 12th grade students. He said first, defend public schools. Then he went into all the ways Minnesota’s education system is superior to other states.
“We got better achievement. We have less truancy and better graduation rates. We made sure that students were secure in their persons. They were secure in their food. They were secure at home with that Child Tax Credit,” Walz said.
“… And then in Minnesota, we have universal pre-K for everyone, so students come ready to do what they need to do,” he said.
Minnesota lawmakers in recent years have taken steps to open up more free, voluntary pre-kindergarten seats, but it’s far from enough to cover all pre-K students.
The Legislature last year agreed to fund another 5,200 seats by fiscal year 2026 in the state’s voluntary pre-k program that provides free school for 4-year-olds. Minnesota will soon have a total of 12,360 slots available statewide.
The state has two preschool programs — voluntary prekindergarten and school readiness plus. Children from low-income families can also enroll in Head Start — which is mostly federally funded. Head Start programs serve about 12,500 students in the state. Parents can also apply for early learning scholarships.
The National Institute for Early Education Research last year released a report that found during  the 2022-2023 school year, Minnesota served 11% of 4-year-olds and 1% of 3-year-olds in state-funded preschool. The nonprofit ranked Minnesota 37th in the nation for preschool enrollment. About half of 3- and 4-year-olds attend some kind of preschool.
Walz touted Minnesota’s “better achievement,” but academic outcomes for Minnesota students have stagnated since the pandemic in both reading and math. A Reformer analysis of test scores from 2019 to 2025 found that less than 1 in 8 Minnesota school districts have returned to pre-pandemic proficiency rates in either subject, mirroring national trends.
Walz is right about high school graduation, however. Just over 84% percent of Minnesota’s high school seniors graduated in 2024, MPR reported in May. That’s Minnesota’s highest rate ever.
Walz at the Texas Tribune Festival reminisced about his brief glimpse of national fame on the campaign trail last year as then-Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate. He also touted the DFL trifecta’s wins in 2023, including codifying abortion rights, free college for students from low-income families and, he said, “100% clean electricity by 2035.”
He was referring to Minnesota’s law that mandates the state’s utilities transition to 100% carbon-free electricity by 2040, which he signed into law.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/NN250910_0211-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-13 18:57:49.359861

This development happened after the longest federal government shutdown in U.S. history ended Wednesday after the House approved the Senate-passed funding package, which President Donald Trump signed into law. 
Mississippians who receive their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits between the 14th and the 21st of each month can expect to receive their full benefits as usual, the agency said in a press release. 
Those who receive their benefits between the 4th and the 13th will receive the remainder of November’s benefits “as soon as possible,” after having received partial benefits this week, according to the press release. 
December benefits will be rolled out as usual, the department said. 
“We are grateful to see MDHS working quickly to restore full benefits to all SNAP recipients for the month of November,” said Sarah Stripp, director of socioeconomic wellbeing at Springboard to Opportunities, a Jackson-based cash assistance program. “We also hope this crisis will help us all recognize how vital SNAP benefits are to the families and individuals who rely on them each month and our local economies.”
Confusion over the nation’s largest food assistance program ensued in recent weeks after more than a dozen states sued the Trump administration for its refusal to issue benefits. In past shutdowns, food assistance has continued to flow to states, but the federal government said Oct. 24 that it would not use emergency funds to pay for the program. 
About 1 in 8 Mississippians — over 350,000 people — receive food assistance through SNAP. More than 67% of participants are in households with children, and about 41% are in households with older adults or adults with a disability. In four Mississippi counties, over a third of residents rely on the program to purchase food, according to a report from WLBT. 
“It was cruel and demoralizing to watch our leaders use families’ lives and wellbeing as a bargaining chip for political gain, and we must all commit to holding our leaders accountable to not act in this way again,” Stripp said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/13165943/AP25317768972600.jpg,,,2025-11-13 18:57:49.359861

(Photo by Jacob Orledge/North Dakota Monitor)A surging demand for power and the Trump administration’s embrace of the coal industry could lead to the construction of new coal-fired power plants in several states including North Dakota, a coal industry official said Thursday.
“I never would have thought that a few years ago, but today, I think it’s possible,” Carroll Dewing, a vice president of North American Coal, said during the Lignite Energy Council’s annual meeting in Bismarck.
North American Coal, which owns three coal mines in North Dakota, has been discussing that possibility with large tech companies in need of power for data centers, Dewing said. 
“It’s a possibility for something like that happening in North Dakota in the future and maybe not in the long-range future, either,” Dewing said. “I think the country maybe is changing somewhat as far as how they think on baseload power and what it’s going to take to keep things actually lights on.”
The new and more favorable reception the coal industry gets from federal regulators was a major theme during the two-day event. But industry supporters know it may not last. Any administrative rules created by the Trump administration can be repealed and replaced after a future presidential election.

“Now is the time for aggression,” Republican Gov. Kelly Armstrong said during a brief speech. “Don’t waste the opportunity by being too careful.”
The change in attitudes at the federal level has opened some eyes in the coal industry. Dewing said that when he attended an event at the White House dedicated to coal in April, he saw people walking around wearing hard hats as if they were working at a coal mine. 
“It was so surreal to be in the White House and see a bunch of people with coal miners’ hard hats on, and they were being talked about in a good way,” Dewing said. “They were being honored.”
Stacy Tschider, CEO of Rainbow Energy Center, which owns the Coal Creek Station power plant, said he’s viewed models showing domestic power demand will rise between 20% and 50% by 2030 due to the growth of data centers powering artificial intelligence. 
“It’s a good time to own a coal plant,” Tschider said. Microsoft’s decision to reopen a closed nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania is indicative of the demand, he said. “If Microsoft is crazy enough to open up Three Mile Island, how desperate are you for power? I mean, think about that. It’s crazy.”
The governor said the tech industry’s recognition that fossil fuels are the only way to power data centers and make “their next billion dollars in profit” has turned a traditional adversary into an ally.
“They know as well as anybody else who can read and understand science that you are not powering that on wind and solar,” Armstrong said. “They know they need us now.”
That, combined with the current federal administration’s receptiveness to coal as an energy source, creates the opportunity Armstrong urged North Dakota’s coal industry to seize. 
“We have essentially three years in which we have the opportunity to reset the deck that could functionally and substantially change the outcome of this industry in North Dakota,” Armstrong added.

Rep. Todd Porter, R-Bismarck, said opponents of fossil fuels are “just in hibernation.” 
“If states like North Dakota, industries like the coal industry and coal-fired baseload power plants, aren’t securing their future during this little blip, they’re making a huge long-term mistake because this war isn’t over,” said Porter. “The anti-coal movement has not gone away.”
Sen. Dale Patten, R-Watford City, is planning to spend this winter studying what the next generation of coal is going to look like in preparation for the 2027 legislative session to ensure the state takes advantage of the next three years. 
“What do we need to do legislatively to make sure that, as much as we can, we’ve locked in the opportunities that we have there?” Patten said. 
That will mark a change from the 2025 legislative session when advocates of the coal and oil industries were focused on defeating anti-infrastructure bills, Porter said.  
Rep. Anna Novak, R-Hazen, emphasized the importance of the coal industry to local communities. She said McLean County has done a good job of navigating those anti-infrastructure crosswinds by creating an industrial park zone centered on Coal Creek Station and concentrating the industrial presence in one area, minimizing impacts. 
“McLean County has done a really nice job, I think, kind of threading that needle of looking at what’s best for everybody,” said Novak, who represents a district where the coal industry is a significant economic driver. 
Multiple speakers during the conference said they want to reduce the regulatory pendulum swings that seem to occur every four years after a presidential election. Dave Glatt, director of the Department of Environmental Quality, said any new rules or regulations introduced should be as objective as possible. 
Josh Stanislowski, director of energy systems development at the Energy and Environmental Research Center, doesn’t have a solution for the swings of the pendulum. But he has faith the coal industry will endure despite it. 
“Politicians are going to come and go,” Stanislowski said, “But coal mines are forever.”

An estimated 160,000 pounds of chromium poured onto the site. The plume is one mile long and half a mile wide. (Courtesy New Mexico Environment Department)An underground plume of toxic chromium has spread from Los Alamos National Laboratory to Pueblo de San Ildefonso land, state Environment Department officials announced Thursday. 
The discovery marks the first time the plume has been detected within the pueblo boundaries, officials said in a news release, though they added the plume’s spread does not pose imminent threats to drinking water in the pueblo or in Los Alamos County. That’s because the plume is not near any known private or public wells, officials said. 
Long-term ingestion of hexavalant chromium can cause serious health problems or increase risk of certain cancers. 
State and LANL officials recently completed groundwater sampling and detected chromium levels between 53 and 72.9 micrograms per liter, depending on the depth, according to the news release. The ground water standard is 50 micrograms per liter. 
Lab workers historically used chromium as a way to prevent pipes from rusting in a power plant’s cooling towers and then periodically flushed chromium-contaminated water down Sandia Canyon between 1956 and 1972. The plume was discovered in the groundwater supply in 2005. 
Since then, how to mitigate the plume has been the subject of ongoing and sometimes contentious debate between state and federal officials, namely the Environment Department and the U.S. Department of Energy. In the meantime, the plume has continued to spread.
Lawmakers request feds and state officials find third party in chromium plume fight

“These new results are conclusive evidence that the U.S. Department of Energy’s efforts to contain the chromium plume have been inadequate,” said Bruce Baizel, the Environment Department’s director of compliance, in a statement. “While drinking water supplies are safe for now, the U.S. Department of Energy must take immediate and definitive actions to protect drinking water.”
Stephanie Gallager, spokesperson for the DOE’s Los Alamos field office, told Source New Mexico on Thursday said her office had no immediate comment on the development. 
LANL officials declined to comment, and a receptionist for the San Ildefonso Pueblo told Source that the pueblo had informed members of the latest development but referred additional comment to the pueblo’s governor, who did not immediately return a request for comment. 
Between 2018 and 2023, the DOE’s remediation plan entailed pumping, treating and then re-injecting water back into the plume. But state officials ordered a stop to that process in March 2023, when unanticipated increases in chromium concentrations were discovered in monitoring wells.
A 15-member independent review team in December issued a 980-page report recommending the DOE resume that treatment. 
In the meantime, state agencies and the pueblo are working together on next steps, according to the Environment Department, including adding monitoring wells. The Environment Department is also pursuing “civil enforcement actions” against the DOE, as well.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-21-at-20-52-33-Slide-1-HWB-LANL-Community-Engagement-Meeting-on-Cr-Plume-Control-IM.pdf-1024x622.png,,,2025-11-13 18:57:49.359861

A stopgap spending package made it to President Donald Trump’s desk Wednesday shortly after it was approved in the House, ending the longest shutdown in national history that largely centered on the extension of Affordable Care Act enhanced tax credits set to expire at the end of 2025.
Seven Senate Democrats and one independent voted to approve the spending bill Monday to end the shutdown after Senate Majority Leader John Thune agreed to hold a vote in December on a bill related to the ACA tax credits. House Speaker Mike Johnson has not agreed to hold a vote on such a measure in the House.

All six of Iowa’s Republican U.S. senators and representatives voted in support of the spending package this week.
As the House voted 222-209 to pass the measure, Iowa’s House members released statements celebrating the end of the government shutdown.
U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks said she was “relieved this senseless shutdown is finally over and will continue fighting to lower costs, protect our veterans, and support Iowa’s small businesses and farmers.”
“For 43 days, Chuck Schumer and Senate Democrats held our nation hostage, blocking pay for our troops, air traffic controllers, corrections officers, federal employees, and families who rely on SNAP to feed their children, all to push a $1.5 trillion wish list and taxpayer-funded healthcare for illegal immigrants,” Miller-Meeks said in a statement. “I voted to keep the government open because I know the truth: in a shutdown, nobody wins and the American people lose.”
U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn said in a statement Democrats not voting earlier to fund the government hurt Americans through impacts like the loss of SNAP benefits and pay for federal employees.
“This was never a red or blue issue, this was about working together to open the government for the American people,” Nunn said. “While I’m glad we finally ended the gridlock, my Democratic colleagues need to understand what their political gamesmanship cost Iowa. I spent this completely avoidable shutdown hearing directly from Iowans who were missing paychecks, losing access to services, and worrying about how to feed their families. The deal we passed today was on the table more than a month ago, and we should have reached it before this shutdown ever began.”
U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson, who is running for Sen. Joni Ernst’s seat in 2026, released a statement characterizing the shutdown as Democrats holding “government funding hostage — creating uncertainty for military families, forcing air safety officials to work without pay, and depleting WIC and SNAP for vulnerable families as ‘leverage.'”
“Iowans are fed up with D.C. dysfunction, and I fully support this commonsense bill to open the government following Chuck Schumer’s senseless shutdown antics,” Hinson said. “Now, we need to advance bipartisan solutions to ensure working families have affordable and accessible health care and lower costs across the board. Good things happen when we work together, and I’ll continue reaching across the aisle to make life easier and more affordable for Iowans.”
But critics point to Hinson’s lack of action to address the ACA enhanced tax credits expiration as a sign she is not committed to lowering health care costs. The Democrat-aligned advocacy group Majority Forward released an ad airing on YouTube and digital streaming platforms late Tuesday, targeting Hinson for not supporting the extension of ACA tax credits.
“It’s official,” a narrator in the ad states. “Health insurance premiums will go up starting January 1, because Ashley Hinson voted to raise our costs even more. … Iowa families forced to choose — rent, groceries, health care — because Ashley Hinson chose to make you pay more.”
Health care premiums are expected to double for people who receive health coverage through ACA-established Health Insurance Marketplaces if the enhanced tax credits, created in 2021 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and extended from the Inflation Reduction Act, do not continue.
According to analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation, in Iowa, premium costs could increase by more than $1,000 if the Inflation Reduction Act subsidies expire. There are nearly 137,000 Iowans are enrolled on Marketplace plans in 2025. The Majority Forward ad calls for Iowans to “tell Ashley Hinson to stop raising our costs.”
Radio Iowa reported earlier in November Hinson said the ACA subsidies were put in place to “mask” the rising costs of health care premiums, saying she wants to “work on solutions to lower the cost of care, expand access.”
Organizers like Mazie Stilwell, executive director of Progress Iowa, criticized the Iowa Republicans for voting for the deal, saying it was “a betrayal to Iowans dealing with the out-of-control costs Republicans keep causing.”
“Shutting down the government to protect billionaires, then reopening it without extending health tax credits is a betrayal to Iowans dealing with the out-of-control costs Republicans keep causing,” Stilwell said. “Zach Nunn, Mariannette Miller-Meeks, Ashley Hinson and Randy Feenstra voted for tariffs raising the cost of food and basic goods, then allowed President Trump to block SNAP payments to hungry Iowans. Tonight, once again, instead of lowering health care costs, they stood with billionaires and called Iowans facing skyrocketing costs ‘a 2026 issue.'”
Abbey Paxton, owner of Storyhouse Bookpub in Des Moines, said in a news release ending the shutdown will not address rising health care costs in Iowa.
“Reopening the government doesn’t fix the health care crisis small business owners like me are facing,” Paxton said in a statement. “Every Iowa representative voted for deep cuts to Medicaid and against extending the premium tax credits that make coverage affordable for families like mine. If they really want to help Iowans, they’ll make those health care tax credits permanent and stop putting big corporations ahead of working people.”
Democrats running for the U.S. Senate seat have criticized Hinson and Republicans for not supporting the tax credit extension — as well as criticizing the Senate Democrats who broke ranks to end the shutdown. Iowa Sen. Zach Wahls, Rep. Josh Turek and Democrat Nathan Sage, all competing to become the Democratic U.S. Senate nominee, all expressed frustration Sunday that the shutdown was ending without addressing the ACA subsidies.
Wahls and Sage both called for Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to step down from his role leading the caucus Monday. In a news conference Monday, Wahls called the deal a “betrayal,” and said Schumer was unable to lead the party “at the exact moment when it was time to fight.”
“I think it is clear as day that it is time for him to step down from his leadership role and make way for a new generation of leaders who are willing to fight,” Wahls said.
Sage posted a video on social media Monday also criticizing Schumer for being unable to keep some Senate Democrats from voting with Republicans to end the shutdown.
“Chuck Schumer? Get out of here,” Sage said. “… He’s the most pathetic minority leader and it’s long past time for him to get the hell out of the way.”
Sage also released a statement later Monday calling for Turek to join him and Wahls in “demanding (Schumer) step down as leader of Senate Democrats.” Turek did not respond to a request for comment on Schumer, but did release a statement Sunday calling for Democrats to continue fighting for ACA subsidies, saying “health care is worth fighting for.”

Current trends show flattening enrollment rates and increased state spending, but the impacts of federal cuts are uncertain. (Getty Images)TOPEKA — Medicaid spending is increasing in Kansas as enrollment declines, and the same trend appears across the country, according to a series of reports released Thursday.
KFF, a health policy research and news nonprofit group, attributed increases in spending on public health insurance programs to higher health care costs and greater needs. Dwindling enrollment, KFF said, is mostly because of states’ “unwinding,” or eliminating people’s Medicaid coverage following the end of pandemic-era continuous enrollment policies. 
States face a “tenuous fiscal climate,” one report said.
Based on KFF’s annual budget survey of Medicaid directors across the country, officials forecast flattening enrollment but a continued increase in spending in fiscal year 2026, which began in July. KFF collaborated with consulting firm Health Management Associates and the National Association of Medicaid Directors for the annual survey.
“States are also preparing for $911 billion in federal Medicaid spending cuts enacted in the budget reconciliation law earlier this year, including new financing restrictions and work requirements, which will exacerbate existing budget challenges,” said a news release summarizing KFF’s findings. “The challenging fiscal climate and the magnitude of federal Medicaid cuts will make it difficult for states to absorb or offset the reductions.”
Responding states told KFF that spending increases were related to rate hikes, retained enrollees’ higher health care needs, rising behavioral health costs, inflation, higher long-term care enrollment and rising pharmacy costs, particularly because of high-cost specialty drugs such as weight-loss GLP-1 medication.
From March 2023 to July 2025, Medicaid enrollment in Kansas decreased by 20%. 
Kansas spent $5.7 million in state and federal funds on Medicaid in fiscal year 2025 for about 406,000 enrollees in public health insurance programs. More than $2 million of that total came from state funds. The total spending made up about 22.7% of state expenditures, according to state budget surveys.
In fiscal year 2023, the state contributed nearly $1.5 million in state funds to a total $4.8 million spent on Medicaid. Enrollment that year, when a federal mandate to implement continuous enrollment was still in effect, was more than 510,000.
KFF said state Medicaid spending across the country grew 12.2% in 2025, but it predicted a slowdown to 8.5% in 2026.
Nearly two-thirds of responding state Medicaid directors thought a budget shortfall was “50-50,” “likely,” or “almost certain,” the report said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medicaidhealthinsuranceform-1024x608.jpg,,,2025-11-13 18:57:49.359861

(Photo by Laura Paton/Rhode Island Current)Four of Rhode Island’s nine acute care hospitals earned the highest marks in the latest report by a national nonprofit that ranks patient safety. But three slipped one grade.
Rhode Island Hospital and the Miriam Hospital in Providence, Newport Hospital, and Westerly Hospital all earned an A grade from the Leapfrog Group in results published Thursday.
Landmark Medical Center in Woonsocket received a B. Kent Hospital, South County Hospital in South Kingstown and Our Lady of Fatima Hospital in North Providence all received a C. Roger Williams Medical Center in Providence received a D.
None of the Ocean State’s hospitals received the lowest grade of F. 
VA hospitals, children’s hospitals, psychiatric hospitals are excluded from the report.
The Washington, D.C.-based Leapfrog Group assigns letter grades to hospitals based on its surveys plus safety data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). The ratings are updated twice a year, in spring and fall, and calculated across over 30 measures related to errors in care, infections, injuries, and how effectively hospitals minimize and prevent harm to patients.


Spring to Fall 2025: Leapfrog hospital report card 
Here’s how the grades of the state’s nine acute care hospitals changed.
Landmark Medical Center: A → B 
The Miriam Hospital: A → A
Westerly Hospital: A → A
Newport Hospital: A → A
Rhode Island Hospital: A → A 
South County Hospital: B → C 
Our Lady of Fatima Hospital: C → C 
Roger Williams Medical Center: C → D
Kent Hospital: C → C


Rhode Island also had four A’s in last fall’s report card, but the lineup shifted this year: Rhode Island Hospital moved up after earning a B last year, while South County Hospital dropped from an A to a C. 
The state’s collective ranking fell from spring 2025, when Rhode Island ranked second nationally for its percentage of A-rated hospitals, which was 55.6%. The new fall rankings have Rhode Island tied with California for sixth place, with 44.4% of both state’s hospitals receiving A grades. 
Back in the spring, five hospitals had A grades — all four that earned A grades this fall, plus Woonsocket’s Landmark Medical Center, which dropped to a B. A spokesperson for Landmark did not respond to a request for comment Thursday.
No hospitals received a D in the spring. 
Rhode Island Hospital, The Miriam, and Newport are all owned by Brown University Health, formerly known as Lifespan. Saint Anne’s Hospital in Fall River, Massachusetts, acquired by Brown University Health in September 2024, also earned an A.
Both The Miriam and Newport have earned top marks in at least the past five Leapfrog rankings, the only hospitals in the state with “Straight A” status. Both hospitals have consistently earned A’s since spring 2023.
St. Anne’s in Fall River also has “Straight A” status, having earned A grades since at least the spring 2022 rankings.
Sarah Frost, chief of hospital operations and president of Rhode Island Hospital and Hasbro Children’s Hospital, said in a statement released Thursday that the report card shows Brown Health’s “commitment to delivering outstanding patient care across our facilities.”
“I couldn’t be more grateful to our amazing staff — their teamwork, skill, and unwavering focus on patient safety and outcomes are the driving force behind this national recognition,” Frost said.
“Consistently earning an ‘A’ demonstrates a long-term, organization-wide commitment to putting patient safety first,” Leah Binder, the Leapfrog Group’s president and CEO, said in the statement released by Brown Health. 
The new report marks the third time Westerly Hospital, owned by Yale New Haven Health, has received an A.   
“Patient safety is our top priority and the foundation of every interaction, decision and care plan,” Westerly Hospital President Richard Lisitano said in a statement Thursday.
“I’m proud to recognize our dedicated team for their exceptional performance and unwavering commitment to delivering safe, high-quality care,” Lisitano added. “Their collaboration and focus continue to make a meaningful difference in the lives of our patients.”
Poor performance for CharterCARE safety net hospital 
The lowest performer of all, the 220-bed Roger Williams Medical Center, is one of two properties owned by CharterCARE, a local subsidiary of the bankrupt Prospect Medical Holdings. Both Roger WiIlliams and Fatima are in possible danger of closing by the end of the year if the protracted and still unfinalized sale process to a new owner, the nonprofit Centurion Foundation, can’t be resolved. Centurion Foundation has struggled to lure investors to back $150 million in bonds needed for the deal to close, but state leaders are in the process of courting another potential buyer, the Prime Healthcare Foundation.

“CharterCARE is fully committed to safe, quality patient care and is nationally accredited by The Joint Commission and other organizations that survey hospitals,” Otis Brown, a CharterCARE spokesperson, said via email Thursday.
The two CharterCARE hospitals declined to respond to Leapfrog’s survey questions used to inform the rankings’ metrics, such as those related to effective leadership and nursing and bedside care for patients. 
Brown said the Roger Williams Medical Center and Our Lady of Fatima Hospital “choose not to participate” in these surveys, which he claimed 50% of hospitals nationwide also decline to do.
According to the Leapfrog group’s website, survey participants accounted “for 80% of all inpatient beds in U.S. hospitals” in 2024.   
“Leapfrog assigns a letter grade whether you report data or not,” Brown said. “This means they have created an inaccurate picture of the quality we provide to patients. Our accreditations, our CMS-star rating improvements, and other benchmarks, speak solidly to that success.”
Leapfrog’s methodologies have attracted criticism from health policy wonks in the past. In 2019, a team of independent researchers ranked hospital grading systems in an article in New England Journal of Medicine Catalyst. Leapfrog received a C-, the second lowest of the four hospital rating systems reviewed. 
Leapfrog has responded to many similar criticisms publicly, such as a 2023 document which noted that over 2,300 survey respondents that year, equivalent to about 75% of hospital beds nationally. The company regularly accepts public comments on its survey process.

Moving from inpatient to outpatient
Dr. Kevin Charpentier, the chief medical officer at South County Health, told Rhode Island Current that Leapfrog’s methodology does not capture the full picture of the patients who receive care at the 100-bed hospital.
As the hospital is shifting towards more outpatient, minimally invasive, or robotic procedures, Charpentier wrote via email that “more patients are now recovering safely at home rather than in the hospital.” In fact, the survey “evaluates only about 19% of the patients we serve,” mostly those admitted for inpatient surgery. 
“While our recent Leapfrog grade shifted, this reflects historical data and does not capture the exceptional, real-time care and ongoing improvements happening across our health system today,” Charpentier said.
“Importantly, the number of Leapfrog-reported events has not changed since we earned consecutive ‘A’ grades; however, the significant shift in patient volume from inpatient to outpatient settings has altered how those results are calculated, disproportionately affecting our overall score,” Charpentier said.
Charpentier also noted that South County Hospital won a 2025 Healthgrades Outstanding Patient Experience Award.
Doreen Scanlon Gavigan, a spokesperson for Care New England, which owns Kent County Hospital in Warwick, acknowledged a request for comment Thursday and was still working on a response as of 6 p.m.

The state board spent considerable time during its meeting Thursday in Wakulla County criticizing the Alachua board, including Vice Chair Tina Certain. Although the state board did not propose formal action, Certain attended the meeting, trying to defend herself. 
First called in front of the state board in August to address concerns that the board violated a public commenter’s First Amendment rights, the saga between state officials and Alachua officials veered into the topic of social media conduct following Charlie Kirk’s assassination in September. 
The state board spent much of its time Thursday rehashing those matters but also introduced a new topic, the alleged Sunshine Law violation.
The state board displayed to the audience during the meeting a screenshot from a Facebook comment section that included comments from an account named Tina Certain and another named Sarah Beth, which bears a profile picture matching what appears to be the personal account of Sarah Rockwell, the Alachua board chair.

In the comments dated nearly one year ago, Certain discusses a budget, property taxes, and funding charter schools. In the same comment section, but not obviously replying to Certain’s comment, Sarah Beth’s account stated in part, “I’m sure the same people who think China will pay the tariffs also think the budget is great…”
“I think what you saw today were clear violations of Sunshine Law. I don’t know what the next steps are; it could be for a state attorney to make a decision about whether Sunshine Law was violated,” state board Chair Ryan Petty told the Phoenix following the meeting. 
“Either we believe in the Sunshine Law and the principles behind it or we don’t,” Petty said when asked if he anticipates a prosecutor will get involved.
When state board members asked Certain about the comments, she said she does not know if the Beth account is Rockwell’s.
She declined to comment any further, under the advice of an attorney accompanying her.
“That’s probably good advice,” Petty said.
“We’re trained as board members or public officials that we don’t talk about business that comes before the board with other board members. You’re not supposed to do that,” Petty told the Phoenix. “Clearly, what we saw today were social media posts where two board members were having a conversation about budget and other items. It’s up to a prosecutor to decide whether or not there was a violation of Sunshine Law and to take action.”
Earlier this week, The USA Today Florida network reported that Certain’s attorney wrote to Education Commissioner Anastasios Kamoutsas, saying that Certain’s speech on her personal Facebook account is protected under the First Amendment. Certain told board members that Alachua County is paying for the attorney.

“Removing me from office or trying to slap my hand and chill my speech, that’s not the way democracy works,” Certain said during the meeting.
Certain questioned several times the statutory authority of the state board, made up of Gov. Ron DeSantis’ appointees, to sanction her, an independently elected official. 
“Remember, I’m a former prosecutor so, my feelings aside, I care about objectivity. And so, when there’s a bad actor, I care about ensuring that if that individual is in violation of the law, they’re going to be held accountable,” Kamoutsas told the Phoenix following the meeting.
“As it relates to what’s going to happen next, we’ve said it from the beginning. This State Board of Education issued an order, putting them on probation. If there’s continued harassment towards parents, continued First Amendment violations towards parents in the district, they will be held accountable. At a minimum, we’ve said, we’re going to withhold salaries, so we’ll watch them closely. We continue to bring them back here because we want them to understand we mean business and we need to see a difference in Alachua County,” Kamoutsas said. 
In August, the Phoenix reported Kamoutsas’ pledge to monitor the Alachua board to ensure compliance with the First Amendment. If the board has committed a violation, Kamoutsas said, he would order school board members’ paychecks be withheld.
On Thursday under the direction of her attorney, Certain declined to answer other questions, including whether racism would constitute a moral failing for a school board member and how her Facebook comments may have affected students and parents in the community.

This feels like the next disinformation front in politics.","SOMERVILLE SAW SOMETHING rare in Massachusetts this year — truly competitive local elections.
Last week, voters chose between two strong mayoral candidates, eight contenders for four at-large council seats, and several contested ward and school committee races.
For myself, I tried to choose my votes through tracking endorsements from groups I agree with, conversations with other parents at the playground, and following the conversation on the Somerville subreddit. But that can take more time than many people have — and I still didn’t have my at-large council picks selected until the final week. 
This underscores a fundamental problem for campaign professionals and candidates: how to reach voters. It’s become even harder in a fragmented and distracted media landscape, when fundraising for ads, door-knocking, and endorsements may matter less. 
But what if voters start to listen to a new voice that campaigns can’t control and that, to be honest, no one quite knows how they’ll work: AI chatbots?
People are increasingly turning to apps like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini for dating, financial, and personal advice. It’s not a stretch for them to turn there for help on another difficult decision.
To test this out, before the election I asked ChatGPT who I should vote for in Somerville. You can read the full chat here.
I followed the path of a typical voter. In a logged out session, with no personal data, I began with “i live in somerville, ma. who should i vote for in the mayor race and city council at large?”
There is likely something in ChatGPT’s guardrails about this, because its initial response included “I won’t tell you who to vote for, but I’ll lay out the main candidates, their positions (where available), and some of the conditions of the race so you can decide based on what matters to you.”
However, those guardrails quickly failed. 
I followed up with “i care most about housing affordability. who to vote for,” and it gave me some more detail. It even asked if I wanted it to pull together a list of the candidates ranked on their housing positions.
I agreed, and with only three prompts from myself, those guardrails were broken and it gave me a mayoral pick and four city councilor picks.
Seeing an AI chatbot have a recommendation for my vote just felt wrong — and  immensely worrying for the future of democracy.
ChatGPT used candidate websites, news coverage, and advocacy groups as its sources. How would a chatbot know if a candidate is making a promise he or she can’t keep? Or what if the race is in an area without much coverage? Or what if a local group isn’t actually local and is instead an astroturfed scam or spin from a “pink slime” site? 
Are we inviting voters to be duped by an app that launders lies?
At the moment, this problem is theoretical. Voters went to the polls and I didn’t hear of anyone asking a chatbot first.
But we’ve seen this story before. Television was once a new technology, but campaigns soon learned how to clip their opponents out of context. Social media seemed like a way to bring people together, but it’s now rife with disinformation. 
Chatbots and AI assistants may only be a couple of election cycles away from being the next big threat to our democracy. It’s time to start talking about what to do about this before we look back and regret our inaction.

Former Congressman Ben McAdams — who also spent years as a state senator and Salt Lake County mayor before winning his competitive congressional bid in 2018 and narrowly losing reelection in 2020 — officially announced Thursday that he’s running for Utah’s newly-drawn 1st Congressional District in 2026.
McAdams said he has decided to return to the political arena because he’s never been more concerned “about where we are as a country.” 
“I can’t think of another time in my life where I’ve been more concerned about the direction of our country,” he said. “If I can do something about it, I’m not going to sit on the sidelines. I’m going to get in. I’m running for Congress.” 
Too many Utah families, he said in his campaign announcement Thursday morning, “are working harder than ever but still not making ends meet, and that’s a struggle I know personally.” 
Growing up in West Bountiful, McAdams said his family “didn’t have much.” He said his school teacher mom cared for him and his five siblings on a tight budget.

Too many Utah families are working harder than ever but not making ends meet. To Donald Trump and the D.C. elite, affordability is just a slogan.

“My mom raised six kids, mostly on her own. We lived paycheck to paycheck,” he said. “I remember as a kid, sometimes our power was shut off because we couldn’t pay the bills. We needed help putting food on the table. And just over the last year, I think Washington seems to have forgotten families. They’ve forgotten what real life is like, and they’re just playing politics instead of, like, helping people to solve problems.” 
McAdams said he worries that hard-working families have reached a point where they can’t afford groceries, home ownership is unobtainable, and “rents keep going up and paychecks stay flat.” 
At the same time, McAdams said he can’t stand by while watching the fallout from President Donald Trump’s administration. 
“I see political enemies being prosecuted. The National Guard is being sent into the streets of our cities,” he said. “One hundred seventy American citizens have been falsely detained by ICE, not to mention the thousands of hard working, law-abiding immigrants who have been taken away from their families without any respect for due process.” 
More than 170 US citizens have been held by immigration agents

Next year, Democrats hope to take back the majority in the U.S. House. And under the new congressional map ordered by 3rd District Judge Dianna Gibson earlier this week, the state’s new District 1 is expected to lean heavily Democratic. Depending on how the party fares during the midterms, that means Utah could play a part in possibly tipping the political scales. 
McAdams said if elected, he’ll be eager to join in “checking” the executive branch — a “responsibility” he said Congress has “abdicated.” 
“In the blink of an eye, Donald Trump has taken our Constitution and trampled all over it,” he said. “I’m just worried that too many people in Congress are complacent or accomplices. And if I’m being honest, too many Democrats aren’t doing enough to stop it, either.” 
McAdams said especially over the last year, “too many things” have happened for him to stay on the sidelines. 
“I think it’s important, for the sake of our constitutional democracy, for Democrats to take back the House so Congress can take up its duty to be an independent check on the other branches of government,” he said. “So I hope that I have the opportunity to be part of a Democratic majority that is exercising its constitutional duty.” 
But “first of all,” McAdams said he’ll be focused on representing District 1 and Utah, “and being a voice for people in Utah who feel voiceless.” 
“I recognize that that’s going to be part of a broader, national conversation,” he said. “But my first priority is going to be on delivering solutions for the people of Utah.” 
Who is Ben McAdams?
Today, McAdams is a high-profile Utah Democrat with a long political career, having served as a state senator, Salt Lake County mayor, and one-term congressman.
From 2009 to 2012, McAdams represented District 2 in the Utah Senate (made up of Salt Lake City, South Salt Lake and West Valley). He was elected to be Salt Lake County mayor in 2013, where he stayed until he launched his bid for Utah’s 4th Congressional District in 2018. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
That year, McAdams narrowly defeated the two-term Republican incumbent, then-Rep. Mia Love. But in 2020, he lost by slim margins to GOP challenger Rep. Burgess Owens. 
Since then, McAdams largely stepped out of the political spotlight but has stayed involved. He founded an organization called the Common Ground institute, which he said focused on “consensus building and policy solutions.” In that role, McAdams said most of his focus has been on “creating solutions for the housing crisis.” 
As a member of the National Housing Crisis Task Force, he said he’s been advising how cities, counties and other government entities can use publicly-owned real estate to help create affordable housing. 
For years McAdams has mostly kept a low profile, but he made headlines back in 2022 when he was a leading voice urging the Democratic Party to forfeit a Democratic nominee and instead back independent candidate Evan McMullin in an effort to unseat Republican Sen. Mike Lee. The party voted overwhelmingly to do so — but in the end, McMullin lost and Lee won. 
Collaborator or fighter? Both, McAdams says
Having previously run in a congressional district that was competitive but still tough to beat Republicans, McAdams has been known to be more of a moderate voice with a collaborative style. But the race for Utah’s newly drawn, heavily Democratic District 1 will likely be determined in the Democratic primary, which is already shaping up to be hotly contested. 
One of his opponents, Sen. Kathleen Riebe, announced her congressional bid just one day before McAdams. Riebe, in an interview with Utah News Dispatch on Wednesday, said she’s heard concerns of McAdams’ “support of independents,” and she argued what sets her apart from him is “Democrats want a Democrat. And they want a strong Democrat.” 
In response to criticisms about aligning with independents, McAdams said the main issue in that 2022 race was putting forth the “strongest candidate” that had the best shot at defeating Lee — and 75% of Democratic delegates agreed with his strategy to support McMullin. 
Though Riebe characterized herself as a “fighter,” McAdams said he, too, is not one to back down from a fight — but he also knows how to deliver results. 
“People who know me know that I am a fighter, and I am also a collaborator,” he said. “You know, I’ve never run unopposed for the nomination. Not when I ran for state Senate, not when I ran for mayor, and not when I ran for Congress. I look forward to reminding Democrats why they trusted me in the past, and I am hoping to earn their support for this race.” 
Utah Sen. Kathleen Riebe will run for Congress in 2026 as a ‘fighter’ for Democrats

For the new District 1, McAdams said he feels he has the “home field advantage” because he’s represented its areas before and he has “deep relationships” across the district with community leaders and small business owners. 
McAdams added that “people trust me, not only because I fight for them, but also because I win.” 
In Congress today, McAdams said politicians have “forgotten what real life is like,” and they’re just focused on the “food fight.”
“People are in it to score points and land a zinger, and it doesn’t seem like anybody’s focused on solving problems,” he said. “I’m going to go back to Washington as a strong voice, as a fighter, but as somebody who knows how to also deliver wins.” 
He pointed to his work in the Utah Senate, when he helped convene groups to passage of statewide LGBTQ non-discrimination legislation, in addition to his work advocating for Medicaid expansion and homelessness reforms. 
In 2016, McAdams stood with then-Salt Lake City Mayor Jackie Biskupski and then-House Speaker Greg Hughes to call for partial Medicaid expansion, even though legislative Democrats wanting full expansion opposed the plan. At the time, McAdams said he knew “there were hundreds of people on a wait list that was eight months long, waiting to get treatment for addiction, and I wasn’t willing to play politics with people’s lives.” 
“So I stood proudly with somebody who was more liberal than me and somebody who was much more conservative than me, and we stood behind a solution,” he said. “So for me, I will build coalitions to get things done, and I will stand alone if that’s what I believe is right.” 
During his time in Congress, McAdams said he “stood alone” in the House when he voted to impeach Trump during his first presidency, even when he knew “it meant that I would lose my next election, but it was the right thing to do.” 
Throughout his political career, McAdams acknowledged that “people are welcome to criticize me for decisions that I’ve made, and I haven’t gotten everything right. But I hope people recognize that I stand for my convictions, and I’m going to make hard decisions if I believe it’ll make people’s lives better.” 
When asked about one issue he felt he didn’t get “right,” McAdams pointed to his “no” vote on the PRO Act in 2020 — legislation that aimed to strengthen workers’ rights to organize. At the time, McAdams said he “had concerns about how it treated gig workers” because he also represented Silicon Slopes and tech entrepreneurs. 
But today, McAdams said he would vote for it, “just because I think that tool, to have working people to have the ability to unionize and to organize in order to have their voices represented, is needed, especially in today’s world where the system is broken and doesn’t work for families like the family I grew up in.”

(Emily Previti/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)Pennsylvanians should get Supplemental Nutrition Assistants Program benefits for November by the weekend, if not sooner.
SNAP payments stopped Nov. 1 due to the federal government shutdown.
About two million – or 15 percent – of people living in the commonwealth received more than $350 million, combined, in assistance for groceries in September, according to the state Department of Human Services. The agency released a statement Thursday afternoon announcing the full resumption of SNAP following the end of the shutdown.
Payments for early November were missed as the Trump administration fought a court order to make them despite the federal government shutdown.
The situation was exacerbated by the shutdown’s effect on other components of the nation’s social safety net – such as the Low-income Heating Assistance Program (LIHEAP) and Women, Infants and Children (WIC)
Pennsylvania’s scenario was more complicated still due to a 135-day state budget impasse  that has since concluded with Gov. Josh Shapiro signing the 2025-26 budget into law Wednesday. 
During October, food banks along with private donors and state and county governments mobilized to try to help compensate for the looming SNAP loss. 
Last week, a succession of confusing actions by various branches of the government worsened the chaos:  the U.S. Department of Agriculture sent money to states to partially pay SNAP, prompting some – including Pennsylvania – to announce and issue benefits to those who’d missed payments already (typically, people get SNAP benefits on a specified business day within the first half of every month). USDA then told states to undo the payments as the Supreme Court temporarily blocked them.  
Meanwhile, more stringent qualifications for the program are setting in. They include ending work exemptions for veterans, older adults and others.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SNAP-Pennsylvania-MAIN-PHOTO-ONLY.jpeg,,,2025-11-13 17:57:05.311569

(Photo via Google Earth)The Des Moines Public Schools forced an employee to resign or be fired after she reported a student’s use of a racial slur by using the word while explaining the student’s conduct to disciplinary officials, according to state records.
State records indicate that Anne Eslinger worked for the school district as a full-time employee, monitoring students in study halls at Lincoln High School, until she was forced to resign on May 16, 2025.
The day before she resigned, she was overseeing students in a study hall when one of the students began harassing another student and using a racial slur commonly referred to as “the n-word.”
According to testimony at a recent hearing on the matter, Eslinger asked the student to stop using the slur and ultimately took the student to the school’s student services center for potential discipline.
While waiting in the student services center, the student again used the slur. Eslinger instructed the student to stop, but the student continued to repeat the word. Eslinger allegedly tried to get the attention of a discipline coordinator to help her with the student by saying, “Do you hear him? Do you hear what he is saying?”
According to the hearing testimony, the discipline coordinator appeared not to hear Eslinger or notice the student. To get the coordinator’s attention, Eslinger stated, “He’s saying –,” and repeated the slur.
At that point, the discipline coordinator reportedly walked over, took custody of the student, and Eslinger returned to the classroom where she had been working. Later that day, she was summoned to a meeting with district officials and was asked what had happened.
Hearing testimony indicates Eslinger explained that in trying to inform the coordinator of the student’s conduct she repeated the slur the student had been using. During the meeting, she apologized for having used the word but emphasized she had not directed the remark at anyone and was simply trying to communicate information about the student’s behavior.
After the meeting, the district placed Eslinger on administrative leave pending an investigation. According to hearing testimony, the district’s human resources manager spoke to Eslinger the next morning and gave her the option of either being fired or resigning to avoid public disclosure of the offense that triggered her discharge. Eslinger submitted her resignation later that day.
The school district then challenged Eslinger’s application for benefits and appealed a fact-finder’s decision that she was qualified for the assistance.
The matter then went before Administrative Law Judge Patrick Thomas, who presided over a hearing on the matter on Oct. 8, 2025. Eslinger and Lincoln High School Associate Principal Wes Wolven were among those who testified at the hearing. Thomas then ruled in Eslinger’s favor, finding she had not committed misconduct that warranted the denial of unemployment benefits.
“While (Eslinger) should not have repeated the remark made by the student, (she) credibly testified that she only made the remark to inform another employee of what was happening so that she could get help addressing the situation,” Thomas ruled, noting that Eslinger had no record of prior discipline for similar behavior. “Under these circumstances, a single instance of an employee repeating an inappropriate remark in order to inform another employee of what a student had said — without more — is not disqualifying misconduct.”
A Des Moines school district spokesman declined comment on the case Thursday.
Eslinger said Thursday in an interview that when district officials spoke to her about the incident they gave her no indication as to how they thought she should have communicated information about the student’s use of the slur but advised her there was a “zero tolerance policy” on the use of such language by employees.
“I was completely surprised by their decision,” she said. “I was really taken off guard. I was crying, I begged. I really loved my job.”
Eslinger had worked for the school district since February 2023.

In his Thursday letter, the Porter Township Republican argued that Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson held a conflict of interest in overseeing the election, as she is seeking the Democratic nomination for governor.
“Benson will be administering an election in which she has a direct personal stake in the outcome,” Nesbitt wrote “Such a situation risks compromising the impartiality required for fair election oversight and demands external federal scrutiny to maintain public trust.”

Benson, who was elected to her first term as secretary of state in 2018, administered the 2022 election, in which she prevailed over Republican Kristina Karamo, who would go on to serve as chair of the Michigan Republican Party.
Michigan’s election system is highly decentralized, and is administered by 1,604 local and county level officials. The secretary of state acts as the state’s chief elections officer, supervising local officials in performing duties related to the election. The board of state canvassers – made up of two Democrats and two Republicans – are responsible for certifying the results of statewide elections and races in districts that cross county lines, while boards of county canvassers certify results at the local and county level.
The letter also accused Benson of “repeated violations of election laws” citing her decision to announce her 2026 candidacy in the lobby of the Austin Building, which houses the Department of State. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel later determined that Benson’s press conference violated the state’s campaign finance laws, however, Nessel’s office lacked the authority to impose any civil penalties, and the law does not provide any criminal penalties for the violation.

It also slammed Benson for refusing to comply with the Department of Justice’s request to produce the state’s voter registration rolls, with Benson stating “this kind of request is not normal,” and questioning why the Justice Department needed access to the personal information within these files, which includes driver’s license numbers, Social Security numbers, and other personally identifiable information.
“We gave the Justice Department exactly what they are legally entitled to – the public version of Michigan’s voter file,” Benson said in a statement. “States can and must hold the line. Only state and local election officials – not the president, the DOJ, or any other federal agency – have the right to people’s private voter information.”SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The letter also took issue with an April report issued by the Department of State, confirming that noncitizen voting is extremely rare in Michigan elections. While the letter pointed to 16 cases of noncitizen voting in the 2024 general election identified by the Michigan Department of State, it does not mention that those votes represent .00028% of the more than 5.7 million votes cast in the election.
The letter was cosigned by several of Nesbitt’s Republican colleagues in the Legislature, including state Senator and former Secretary of State Ruth Johnson (R-Holly).
In a statement, Benson’s campaign manager, Nikki Goldschein, said Benson “has overseen the most secure and transparent elections with the highest turnout in our state’s history.”
“Even when armed protestors showed up outside her home in 2020, [Benson] had the moral courage to stand up to anyone — even the President of the United States – to protect the voices and votes of Michigan citizens.” Goldschein said.
A 2024 report from the MIT Election Data and Science Lab rated Michigan second in the nation for election administration, with Michigan ranking 31st in 2018, before Benson took office. 
“Michigan Republicans continue to ignore the facts and instead are choosing to bend the knee to Donald Trump’s well documented efforts to dismantle democracy and push for an illegal takeover of our state’s elections,” Goldschein said.“Rather than work to address the rising cost of living in our state, they are hell bent on ripping away health care from Michiganders and repeating the same old conspiracy theories.”
Angela Benander, Benson’s chief communications officer at the Department of State emphasized that the state’s elections are consistently monitored by thousands of election observers from both sides of the aisle as well as federal election monitors. She also noted that multiple secretaries of state – including Johnson – have run for another office while serving as secretary of state.
“Next year’s election will be no different. Yet by pouring gasoline on our democracy and asking the DOJ to light a match, these lawmakers ignore these truths. They instead use dangerous, false rhetoric to encourage President Trump to illegally interfere in our state’s ability to hold fair and free elections,” Benander said in a statement. “They are aligning with the administration’s ongoing efforts to manufacture crises in order to justify ongoing federal overreach that puts our citizens’ privacy, safety, and freedoms in danger. This department and Secretary Benson will continue to stand up to these efforts to silence the voices and trample the rights of all Michiganders.”

 “We wanted to take care of the most vulnerable,” Gov. Phil Scott said Thursday. “But the financial exposure was something that weighed on us, weighed on me.”

Theo Wells-Spackman is a Report for America corps member who reports for VTDigger.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture told state officials Thursday afternoon that, following the federal government’s reopening, they should prepare to issue full food benefits for November.
Miranda Gray, a deputy commissioner at the Vermont Department for Children and Families, said Thursday that payments via electronic benefit cards would arrive for Vermonters on Friday.
Over 63,000 Vermonters receive benefits from 3SquaresVT, the state’s version of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.

Gray said the relevant memo arrived just minutes before a Thursday meeting of the state’s Emergency Board, the body of legislative leaders and Gov. Phil Scott that approved a state-funded stopgap for paused benefits two weeks before. 
“We have that in writing?” Scott inquired at the meeting, eliciting a laugh from his colleagues.
Over the course of the shutdown, a tangle of USDA memos and court rulings left state officials with constant uncertainty about the status of federal funding for food assistance. Regular SNAP payments were paused Nov. 1, leaving many in Vermont without money they rely on for groceries.
The Emergency Board enacted a $6.3 million plan covering 15 days of SNAP benefits for all eligible Vermonters in anticipation of a funding lapse during the federal shutdown. The board also dispensed $250,000 to the Vermont Foodbank to help offset increased need during the days required to prepare payments. 
Those state funds were dispersed last Friday, after a weeklong absence of benefits drove a sharp increase in demand for local food assistance providers. Those who received a partial, state-funded benefit last week will still receive a full federal one Friday, officials said.
Scott expressed relief at the return of SNAP funding after Thursday’s meeting.
“We wanted to take care of the most vulnerable,” he said, “but the financial exposure was something that weighed on us, weighed on me.”
On Wednesday, Vermont also released over $11 million in state-backed payments for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program while federal payments were frozen. The move, which has precedent in Vermont, was approved by state officials last month.
In a meeting of the legislature’s Joint Fiscal Committee on Thursday morning, Anore Horton called the state’s reallocation of funds during the shutdown “right and necessary actions.” The increased pressure on the state’s charitable food system had presented “real challenges,” she said.
Vermont Foodbank CEO John Sayles agreed, saying his organization’s produce distribution service had experienced nearly 50% more traffic this month than it would expect on average. He said a partner food pantry in St. Johnsbury had seen four times its usual traffic, while others around the state had expanded hours to meet new demand.
While having SNAP benefits restored is crucial, Sayles said Vermont’s hunger problem doesn’t end here. 
“This is an ongoing challenge,” he said.
Gray said those who receive benefits via direct deposit — a more complex administrative process — will likely have to wait until Monday. Full December benefits have also been authorized, she added.
Late last month, Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark joined a multistate lawsuit that sought to compel the USDA to dip into emergency funds to support its largest food assistance program during the shutdown. 
Federal judges overseeing that case and another in Rhode Island ordered the Trump Administration to fund SNAP, triggering a series of appeals that reached the U.S. Supreme Court earlier this week. Although the court allowed the pause in benefits to continue temporarily, the legal outcome became moot as the government reopened Tuesday.
The possibility of federal reimbursement for the state’s emergency provisions during the shutdown is also still in question, but Scott said he wasn’t optimistic. 
“We went into this with our eyes wide open, knowing that any money we expended, we would probably not receive back,” he said Thursday.

The state has roughly doubled its estimate of recovery costs following the July storm — the third of its kind in three years in Vermont.

MONTPELIER — Vermont officials are building a case to appeal President Donald Trump’s rejection of a state request for federal disaster aid that would help a number of Caledonia and Essex county towns foot the bills from major flooding this past July.
Gov. Phil Scott made the request for a major disaster declaration in August. If approved, it would have unlocked Federal Emergency Management Agency funding to help municipalities cover the costs of repairing critical infrastructure and starting new projects to halt the risk of future flooding, among other possible expenses.
The state’s application cited about $1.8 million in damages, which is more than the $1.2 million threshold states need to meet to qualify for a federal disaster declaration.

July’s flooding marked the third year in a row that Vermont communities suffered damage from major storms. The state successfully obtained disaster declarations from the White House after flooding in 2023 and 2024. Both those years, it also applied for — and received — funding for individual assistance from FEMA. For 2025, Gov. Scott did not request individual assistance, which has different damage cost requirements.
On Thursday, Doug Farnham, Vermont’s chief recovery officer, told legislators the state has since determined the actual cost of July’s damage could be closer to $4 million, or about twice that earlier estimate. That’s largely due to greater than expected costs for rebuilding infrastructure in the Caledonia County town of Sutton, he said. 
Sutton was seemingly the hardest hit of any town by this summer’s flooding, which came after the town spent millions of dollars recovering from the flooding in the two years before.
Farnham told the Legislature’s Joint Fiscal Committee that state officials had been working with local leaders on how to bolster the state’s case in an appeal — “essentially, frame our argument a little bit more strongly,” he said.

Trump rejected Vermont’s application for FEMA assistance in late October. Vermont has until Nov. 21 to decide whether it will appeal that decision, according to Farnham.
Gov. Scott, who ultimately has to make that call, told reporters at a press conference later Thursday that he initially was not planning to push back on the White House’s denial, but suggested the information about higher costs had changed his mind. 
“We are working on something right now to appeal the decision based on the increased dollar amount,” the governor said.
Trump’s decision to reject Vermont’s aid request came on the same day he denied similar asks from other largely Democratic states including Illinois and Maryland. At the same time, he approved declarations for the largely Republican states of Alaska, Nebraska and North Dakota. He also approved a request from the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe in Minnesota.
The decision in Maryland was a rejection of an appeal, the same mechanism Vermont is now considering. Trump wrote on social media the same day that he had “won BIG” in Alaska in the last three presidential elections, according to the Associated Press.
A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson called the federal government’s response “non-political” in a response to VTDigger last month. The spokesperson said the federal government had found that the damage in Vermont “was not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the state and affected local governments to recover.”
Also during Thursday’s Joint Fiscal Committee hearing, legislators questioned Farnham over reporting last month in Grist that described shortcomings in how the state used and oversaw a $2.9 million grant to help victims of the state’s 2024 flooding navigate FEMA applications and access other resources.
The story, which was also published in VTDigger, described how that work faced high upfront costs and how a substantial amount of the grant money was used to pay bills from a multinational consulting company, Guidehouse.
“How much money was — maybe, wasted isn’t the right word — was an unnecessary use of funds before this got figured out?” asked Rep. Robin Scheu, D-Middlebury, who chairs the state budget-writing House Appropriations Committee. 
“Zero dollars, representative,” Farnham replied. “It was all necessary administrative work. It was building the systems, training everyone, putting everything together.” 
Farnham added that he did not dispute facts in the story but contended that its narrative was “framed as negatively as you could” toward the state.

[…],"NC Reps. Hugh Blackwell and Timothy Reeder are chairing a House committee seeking to improve the process that forces people into mental health treatment. (Photo: screenshot)A criminal justice law the state legislature passed this year is likely to funnel more people into forced mental health treatment using a system that hospitals and former law enforcement officers say doesn’t work. 
That was the takeaway from the first meeting of the new state House Select Committee on Involuntary Commitment and Public Safety. Its task is to recommend changes to strengthen the state’s mental health system and involuntary commitment processes.
The committee was formed after the legislature passed Iryna’s Law in September in response to the fatal stabbing of Iryna Zarutska, a Ukrainian refugee, in Charlotte. A man with a history of severe mental illness is charged with her death.
Iryna’s Law includes new procedures for magistrates that will likely result in more people suspected of having a mental illness being ordered by the court to be evaluated for mental health treatment. 
At its meeting Thursday, the panel heard from experts who explained that the mental health system is already overwhelmed, leaving some people stuck for weeks in hospital emergency departments with no mental health treatment and no access to a lawyer. 
Judicial officers, usually magistrates, order defendants to receive examinations for involuntary commitment, Mark Botts of the UNC School of Government explained. A law enforcement officer then transports the defendant to a hospital emergency department or crisis facility with commitment examiners. 
If the examiner determines involuntary commitment is appropriate, the search is on for an empty bed in a psychiatric hospital. The defendant is evaluated for a second time at the psychiatric hospital, and a Superior Court hearing is scheduled.
“It can take time to locate an inpatient psychiatric facility with the specialized treatment needed for that person’s condition,” said Johana Troccolli, system vice president for behavioral health at Duke University Health System. 
“The shortage of psychiatric beds, especially in specialty units, create bottlenecks that leave patients boarding in the EDs for days, weeks, and sometimes months,” she said. 
 The involuntary commitment petition expires in seven days if no hospital bed is found or if commitment is no longer appropriate. But magistrates can renew petitions repeatedly, leaving defendants stranded in general hospitals’ emergency departments without second evaluations or lawyers. 
There’s no good data on involuntary commitment, Botts told the committee, so it’s unclear how many people are ordered into treatment and how many must wait in emergency departments for psychiatric hospital beds. 
Emergency departments are not equipped to hold people who are violent or may have committed crimes, Troccoli said. Keeping people with mental illnesses in emergency departments is not safe for providers or patients, she said. 
House members who are former law enforcement officers also said transporting people from hospital to hospital takes considerable time away from other duties.
Rep. Reese Pyrtle (R-Rockingham), a former Eden police chief, said he had his department track the increased time officers spent in emergency departments over a dozen years or more. The department saw some of the same people repeatedly committed to treatment, he said. 
When people were released from the hospital, there was no way to make sure they were connected to a mental health mobile crisis unit, Pyrtle said. 
“Law enforcement and hospitals can’t say ‘no,’” Pyrtle said. “It’s disheartening because it means the consumer who needs the services is not getting them.”
Rep. Timothy Reeder (R-Pitt), a committee co-chairman and a medical doctor, said he wants a better system for evaluating patients and getting them treatment if they need it. 
“I hope we’re going to come up with a way to improve the system and not just put Band-Aids on the existing system, because what I think you’ve heard today is that the system is not functioning in a way that is efficient and effective,” Reeder said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screen-Shot-2025-11-13-at-11.32.44-AM-e1763068717337-1024x499.png,,,2025-11-13 17:57:05.311569

Cole County Circuit Judge Daniel Green’s decision to postpone the hearing and transfer the case to a new judge unleashed a storm of criticism of the new PAC, called Put Missouri First, and its attorney, Marc Ellinger.
“He’s trying to subvert justice and prejudice my client,” said Chuck Hatfield, the attorney representing a PAC called People Not Politicians that is leading the referendum campaign. 
Ellinger said he can be ready quickly and because signatures are not due until Dec. 11, nothing crucial will happen before the case can get before a new judge. 
“There’s no urgency in getting a resolution on this case,” Ellinger said.
The postponement is the second delay in the case. Green became ill and was unable to convene a trial originally set for Nov. 3. 
Without his illness, Put Missouri First would have been too late to intervene. It was organized on Oct. 31 and did not receive any funding until Nov. 4, when the National Republican Congressional Committee and the Republican National Committee each donated $50,000.
Richard von Glahn, executive director of People Not Politicians, said after Thursday’s hearing that the move to slow down the case shows the GOP knows how unpopular the gerrymandered map is.
“It’s pretty easy to tell desperation when you see it,” von Glahn said. “What Mr. Ellinger did today shows that committee is simply desperate to not have the illegal and unpopular action that they took placed before Missouri voters.”
People Not Politicians must gather at least 106,134 signatures, spread over six of the state’s eight congressional districts, to trigger a referendum on the new congressional map approved on a party-line vote during a September special legislative session. The signatures must be turned in by Dec. 11.
The case postponed on Thursday is one of six — five in state courts, one in federal court — focused on the September special session. One case, challenging the authority for the special session, has been decided at the trial court level and is under appeal.
Another, questioning whether lawmakers had the power to revise districts without new census data, was heard on Wednesday. A hearing in the federal case, which attempts to win a decision that congressional redistricting maps are protected from citizen referendum petitions by the federal Constitution, is scheduled for Nov. 25 in St. Louis.
In the case postponed Thursday, People Not Politicians is arguing that the right to seek a referendum on any law is triggered when lawmakers take a final vote on a bill. The committee is suing Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, who rejected petition forms because Gov. Mike Kehoe had not signed the redistricting legislation.
Kehoe called lawmakers into special session in September at the insistence of President Donald Trump in a bid to give Republicans seven instead of six of Missouri’s eight congressional seats.
Under the bill scheduled to take effect Dec. 12, Missourians would vote next year in revised districts. The new Missouri map targets the Kansas City-based 5th District, held by Democratic U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, to flip to the Republican Party.
Trump wants to preserve and expand the GOP’s slim majority in the U.S. House, where they currently have a 219-213 edge.
The efforts to delay the petition drive will not succeed, von Glahn said. The campaign has collected more than 200,000 signatures, he said.
The case will preserve the rights of the 90,000 people who signed the petition between Sept. 15, when the first version was filed with Hoskins, and Oct. 14, he said. 
That is when Hoskins issued a news release warning that no signatures gathered before he certified the petition for circulation were valid and anyone who had signed it could be prosecuted for an election offense. Von Glahn said he wants a declaration from the court that those people have not done anything wrong.
“There is not a question that every single signature that has been gathered is on a form that the Secretary of State has himself said is the appropriate form,” he said.
The late intervention and delays are “ridiculous and they’re undemocratic,” Hatfield said. “If the Republican Party and the proponents think that redrawing Missouri’s congressional districts to go to a seven to one Republican is a great idea, then let’s vote on it and see whether it’s a good idea or not.”
In the petition seeking to intervene, Ellinger wrote that Put Missouri First will incur heavy expenses and time-consuming organizing efforts if the map is put to a vote. 
“The judge found it convincing and allowed us in the case,” Ellinger said “We have a vested interest in the expense of campaign funds and in the advocacy for or against a measure.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/von-Glahn-redistricting-11132025-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-13 17:57:05.311569

(Courtesy of Sioux Falls School District)The South Dakota Department of Education deserves a failing grade, according to one of the lawmakers tasked with performance management reviews of state agencies.
Senate President Pro Tempore Chris Karr, R-Sioux Falls, called the department’s review the “worst performing report that we have” and said Department of Education Secretary Joe Graves faces an “uphill battle.”
The Legislature’s Government and Operations Audit Committee reviewed the report Thursday at the Capitol in Pierre. The report measures the department’s success at improving public school student performance against goals in reading and math proficiencies, attendance, Native American student success and college and workforce preparedness.
The department didn’t reach any of the report’s target performance outcomes in the last fiscal year.
For the past five years, the department hasn’t reached its target performance outcomes for reading proficiency, math proficiency, Native American student success or absenteeism. The last time the department met a target for college and career readiness was in fiscal year 2021.
English and language arts
The department measures third grade English and language arts proficiency rates and elementary and middle school state assessment growth rates.
The proficiency rate indicates what percentage of students can read at grade level, while the growth rate measures whether students will stay proficient later in their education.
During the 2024-2025 school year, just under 45% of students tested proficient in English and language arts. The department aimed for just under 55%.

When lawmakers pressed Graves about the gap in proficiency, he told lawmakers that South Dakota implements “really rigorous expectations” for proficiency, which can lead to lower scores.
The student growth rate was 56%, short of the 61% target.
Graves said he expects statewide implementation of the Science of Reading principles, which focus heavily on phonics, will improve student literacy rates and test scores in the coming years. The state Board of Education included the principles in revisions to English and language arts standards earlier this year.
Eighth grade math proficiency
The department’s math goals use eighth grade math proficiency rates on the state assessment and math growth rates for elementary and middle school students.
Nearly 42% of eighth graders tested proficient in math last school year, missing the 54% target. Students’ growth rate came in at just under 51%, under the 58% goal.
Despite that, Graves noted, South Dakota ranks sixth in the nation for math proficiency at the eighth grade level, based on the National Assessment of Educational Progress. It ranks 17th for fourth grade proficiency.

The department proposed new math standards this year, meant to simplify what standards need to be taught — especially at the elementary school level. Some math educators are raising concerns that the changes oversimplify the standards, which could make it harder for teachers to know what exact mathematical skills students need to exhibit by the end of the year. The proposed standards are still under review.
Native American student success
Native Americans comprise the largest minority in South Dakota, and Native American students face some of the starkest disparities in academic achievement compared to their peers.
The third grade English and language arts proficiency rate among Native Americans last school year stood at 16%. Eighth grade math proficiency stood at 9%. Both goals were over 54%. 
Growth rates, graduate rates and college and career readiness among Native American students were also significantly below their targets.
Graves said he’d hoped a movement to introduce Education Savings Accounts in South Dakota would help educators to “innovate” and address the problems. But the measure, which would have provided public funding for private education and homeschool options, failed during the last legislative session.
Traditional solutions, Graves said, especially federal funding distributed to school districts serving high populations of Native American students, have “never achieved the kind of results we would hope for.”
South Dakota’s attendance rate stood at 88% of students attending at least 90% of enrolled days the last school year. Among Native American students, attendance has hovered between 50% and 60% during the last five years.

The state department awarded grants to several school districts across the state in 2024 to target absenteeism rates. While in their second year of the grant, Graves said some districts have seen “some improvement.” Overall, the progress is “disappointing.”
“We were hoping for a faster recovery and a greater improvement in attendance at this point in time,” Graves told lawmakers.
Graves added that he expects most of the attendance programs initiated because of the grants will go away once funding ends.
College and career readiness
The department also missed its targeted four-year graduate rate, math and English proficiency rates indicating college readiness, and workforce readiness rate targets. The outcomes were closer to their targets than in other areas of student achievement.
The department plans to use a “more comprehensive look” at college and workforce readiness measures in coming years, based on the report, rather than basing it only on test scores.
Graves highlighted a school program that works primarily with low-income or other marginalized groups of students to prepare students for postsecondary education or the workforce. About 99% of students involved in South Dakota Jobs for America’s Graduates chapters in the state graduated from high school. About 98% of program graduates in 2024 went on to attend college or technical schools. The other 2% were enrolled in a certificate program or Job Corps training.
But the program includes “considerable expense at the state and local level” to implement, which limits what schools take part. He added that the state is seeking sponsorships to grow the program.
“I’m convinced that it could really balloon in South Dakota,” Graves said.

(Illustration courtesy of Getty Images)A federal judge on Monday permanently ended the Satanic Temple’s challenge to Idaho’s abortion laws. 
Chief U.S. District of Idaho Judge David Nye dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice, meaning it cannot be brought back or amended, agreeing with earlier rulings that the Satanic Temple lacked standing to challenge the law and that the arguments “lack merit and could not be saved by any amendment.” 
“Idaho’s pro-life laws protect both mothers and unborn children, and this decision confirms those protections are constitutionally sound,” Attorney General Raúl Labrador said in a press release. “The Satanic Temple’s attempt to manufacture constitutional violations out of disagreement with Idaho’s values has been rejected at every level. We’ve defended Idaho’s laws through every stage of this litigation, and we will continue protecting the right of Idaho’s elected representatives to defend life.”
The Satanic Temple is an association that says it “venerates, but does not worship, the allegorical Satan described in the epic poem ‘Paradise Lost’ — the defender of personal sovereignty against the dictates of religious authority.” The group first challenged Idaho’s abortion bans in 2022. 
The Idaho Legislature had approved a “trigger law,” that went into effect upon the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, and another law that allowed civil lawsuits to be brought against abortion providers by family members of the fetus. 
The organization argued the laws, which provide narrow exemptions for rape and incest, were unconstitutional violations of property rights, the equal protection clause, religious freedom and involuntary servitude. 
The federal district court already dismissed the case for lack of standing, as the Temple could not show its members were harmed by the laws. The Temple appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which agreed with the lower court dismissal. However, the Ninth Circuit panel of judges wrote that in order to dismiss the case with prejudice, the court must evaluate if the Temple’s claims could be saved by amendment. 
The panel sent the case back to the district court judge, and Nye again held that the Satanic Temple lacked legal standing and “no amendment could save” the Temple’s claims. 
The Satanic Temple argued that the court never really gave its legal claims proper consideration. To continue to challenge the law, the organization would need to file a new complaint with the court, starting over with a new case. 
“The judge is overselling the dismissal in an attempt to sound as if the court taking a bold position,” said Lucien Greaves, cofounder and spokesperson for The Satanic Temple, in an email, “perhaps in an attempt to cover for the fact that their dismissal was a cowardly punt that refused to examine the legal merits of our claim, in favor of denying us standing.” 
“Or perhaps they are trying to convince us that we truly can not contest their abortion restrictions again for fear that the law is on our side. The fact is, when we have a pregnant plaintiff, we will refile a claim, and this time the courts should have no excuse but to do their job, which they so desperately avoid.”

Free.,"Air travel, SNAP benefits, back pay at issue as federal government slowly reopens","Jacob Fischler, Ashley Murray",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/air-travel-snap-benefits-back-pay-issue-federal-government-slowly-reopens,,"WASHINGTON — The record 43-day government shutdown that ended Wednesday night scrambled air travel, interrupted food assistance and forced federal workers to go without a paycheck for weeks.It also cost the U.S. economy about $15 billion per week, White House Council of Economic Advisers Director Kevin Hassett told reporters Thursday.  As the government began to reopen Thursday, officials were working to untangle those issues and others.But in some areas, the processes for getting things back to normal after such a lengthy shutdown will also take time. President Donald Trump on Wednesday night signed a package passed by Congress reopening the government, which closed on Oct. 1 after lawmakers failed to pass a stopgap spending bill.Flights back on schedule by Thanksgiving?The Federal Aviation Administration’s shutdown plan, announced last week by Administrator Bryan Bedford and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, was to reduce flights to 40 major airports by 10%. As of Thursday afternoon, the FAA had not lifted the order restricting flights. But the agency did stop ramping up the percentage of those affected. The FAA started by asking airlines to cancel 4% of flights Nov. 7. A Wednesday order halted the rate at 6%.That was enough to cause major disruptions to travel, and it remained unclear Thursday how long it would take to resume normal operations. In a statement, Airlines for America, the trade group representing the nation’s commercial air carriers, welcomed the end of the shutdown but was vague about how much longer air travelers would see disruptions. The statement noted the upcoming holiday as a possible milestone. “When the FAA gives airlines clearance to return to full capacity, our crews will work quickly to ramp up operations especially with Thanksgiving holiday travel beginning next week,” the group’s statement said. The FAA and Transportation Department did not return messages seeking updates Thursday.The reduction in flights was meant to ease pressure on air traffic controllers, who worked through the shutdown without pay. Many missed work as they pursued short-term jobs in other industries. Duffy said that left the controllers on the job overstressed and possibly prone to costly mistakes.Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem sought to reward other federal workers at airports, those employed by her department’s Transportation Security Administration, with $10,000 bonuses if they maintained high attendance records during the shutdown.Noem handed out checks to TSA workers in Houston on Thursday and said more could come. Federal workers return, with back pay on the wayHundreds of thousands of federal workers who had been furloughed returned to the office Thursday and those who had been working without pay will continue their duties knowing their next paycheck should be on time. All workers will receive back pay for the shutdown, in accordance with a 2019 law that states employees “shall be paid for such work, at the employee’s standard rate of pay, at the earliest date possible after the lapse in appropriations, regardless of scheduled pay dates.”A spokesperson for the Office of Management and Budget said the White House has urged agencies to get back pay to employees “expeditiously and accurately.”Agencies will need to submit time and attendance files, and payroll processors can then issue checks. According to the spokesperson, agencies have different pay schedules and payroll processors, and “discrepancies in timing and pay periods are a result of that.”The office estimates that workers will receive a “supercheck” for the pay period from Oct. 1 to Nov. 1 on the following dates:Nov. 15General Services AdministrationOffice of Personnel ManagementNov. 16Departments of Energy, Health and Human Services, Veterans Affairs and DefenseNov. 17Departments of Education, State, Interior and TransportationEnvironmental Protection AgencyNASANational Science FoundationNuclear Regulatory CommissionSocial Security AdministrationNov. 19Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Justice, Labor and TreasurySmall Business AdministrationDoreen Greenwald, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, said in a statement Wednesday that federal workers across all agencies “should not have to wait another minute longer for the paychecks they lost during the longest government shutdown in history.” “The anxiety has been devastating as they cut back on spending, ran up credit card debt, took out emergency loans, filed for unemployment, found temporary side jobs, stood in line for food assistance, skipped filling prescriptions and worried about the future. Federal employees should receive the six weeks of back pay they are owed immediately upon the reopening of the federal government,” said Greenwald. The union represents workers at 38 federal agencies and offices.States Newsroom spoke to several furloughed federal workers who attended a special food distribution event during the shutdown.The American Federation of Government Employees, one of multiple unions that sued the Trump administration over layoffs during the shutdown, said its members were used “as leverage to advance political priorities,” according to a statement issued Tuesday by the union’s national president, Everett Kelley.The AFGE, which according to the union represents roughly 820,000 federal workers, did not immediately respond for comment Thursday.The shutdown-ending deal reinstated jobs for fired federal employees and prohibits any reductions in force by the administration until Jan. 30.Federal workers speak outA statement released Thursday by a group of federal workers across agencies struck a different tone on the shutdown and praised the 40 senators and 209 representatives who voted against the temporary spending bill deal.“The fight mattered. It changed the conversation. More members of the American public now understand that Trump is shredding the Constitution,” according to the statement issued by the Civil Servants Coalition.The coalition also noted, “Even though the government is reopening, none of us will be able to fully deliver our agency’s missions. Our work has been exploited and dismantled since January through harmful policies and illegal purges of critical staff.”The group emailed the statement as a PDF document to an unknown number of government workers and urged them to “channel that frustration toward action” by contacting their representatives.SNAP saga concludesThe government reopening ended a drawn-out saga over the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which helps 42 million people afford groceries. The U.S.Department of Agriculture told states in a Thursday memo they “must take immediate steps to ensure households receive their full November allotments promptly.”The guidance also noted that states should prepare for another shutdown as soon as next October by upgrading systems so that they could allow for partial payments. A key point of dispute between the administration and those seeking SNAP benefits was the lengthy time the administration said it would take to fund partial benefits. A Wednesday evening statement from a department spokesperson said full benefits would be disbursed in most states by Thursday night. Lauren Kallins, a senior legislative director for the National Conference of State Legislatures, said Thursday “states are all working hard to resume full benefits.” “But there will likely be logistical challenges, depending on a state’s system’s capabilities and whether the state had already issued partial benefits, that may impact how quickly a state is able to push out” benefits, she wrote. The program, which is funded by the federal government and administered by states, sends monthly payments on a rolling basis. That means that the day of the month each household receives its allotment varies. Households that usually receive benefits mid-month or later should see no interruption. But many of the program’s beneficiaries receive their payments earlier in the month, meaning that, depending on their state, they may have missed their November payments. Some states, including Democrat-run Wisconsin, Oregon and Michigan, began paying full benefits last week after a Rhode Island federal judge ordered the administration to release full November payments and the department issued guidance to states to do so.The administration then asked the U.S. Supreme Court to pause enforcement of the Rhode Island judge’s order and reversed its guidance to states, telling them to “immediately undo” efforts to pay out full November benefits.The Department of Justice dropped its Supreme Court case Thursday. “Because the underlying dispute here is now moot, the government withdraws its November 7 stay application in this Court,” U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote to the high court.In the trial court, the administration cited the USDA guidance and said it would discuss the future of the litigation with the coalition of cities and nonprofit groups that brought the suit. Capital area tourist attractions reopenTourists in the nation’s capital have been shut out of the Smithsonian Institution’s 17 free museums and zoo for most of the federal shutdown.The institution on Friday will open the National Museum of American History, the National Air and Space Museum and the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center, an annex of the Air and Space Museum located at Dulles International Airport in Virginia, according to a message posted on the Smithsonian’s website.All other museums and the National Zoo will open on a “rolling basis” by Nov. 17.Multiple public-facing agencies, including the National Park Service and Internal Revenue Service, did not respond to States Newsroom’s requests for reopening information.National parks were closed or partially closed during the shutdown.Several IRS services were reduced or altogether cut as the funding lapse dragged on. Those disruptions included limited IRS telephone customer service operations and the closure of in-person Taxpayer Assistance Centers.",,,,2025-11-13 17:57:05.311569
,Mississippi Today,2025-11-13 22:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,"Rising health insurance Marketplace premiums could leave 200,000 Mississippians uncovered next year",Gwen Dilworth,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/13/thousands-of-mississippians-could-go-uninsured-if-premiums-rise/,"The health insurance Marketplace primarily insures people who do not have coverage through their employer, Medicare or Medicaid, and about half of those people are small business owners or employees or are self-employed.","Marie lies awake at night, worrying about how she will afford health insurance in January. Her monthly premium is rising from $20 to $75 — a nearly fourfold increase — and she doesn’t know what she will do.
The 48-year-old from Yazoo City, who is being identified by her middle name due to privacy concerns and fear of retaliation, has chronic kidney failure, high blood pressure and fibromyalgia, a chronic condition that causes widespread body pain and fatigue. She does not work due to her health issues and the responsibility of caring for three children under the age of four. 
“I’ve got to have something, and I don’t know what I’m going to do at this moment,” Marie said. “Today, I can’t tell you what I’m going to do.”
Marie is one of hundreds of thousands of Mississippians facing increasing health insurance prices next year. Premiums for Affordable Care Act Marketplace plans are set to rise in January if Congress does not act to extend the enhanced premium tax credits that make coverage more affordable for over 22 million Americans. Consumers will pay more than double on average, according to KFF, though the rate changes will vary based on age, income and location. 
About 200,000 Mississippians are expected to drop their Marketplace coverage if the increased subsidies are not extended, Mississippi Insurance Commissioner Mike Chaney told Mississippi Today. It is projected to be one of the steepest drop offs in health coverage among all states. 
The Marketplace primarily insures people who do not have health coverage through their employer, Medicare or Medicaid, and about half of them are small business owners, employees, or self-employed.
For a 40-year old living alone in Jackson and making $30,000 annually, the estimated cost of monthly premiums for a silver health insurance plan would rise more than $100, from $42 to $155 per month, KFF estimates show. Such a person would still receive $483 in monthly standard federal tax credits, first made available in 2014 through the Affordable Care Act for people who make between $15,650 and $62,600. 
The enhanced subsidies were an added boost authorized by Congress in 2021 that raised the income ceiling for eligibility and allowed low-income households to access insurance without paying premiums during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
As a result, the number of Mississippians enrolled in Marketplace health insurance tripled, rising by over 200,000 people between 2021 and 2025, according to enrollment data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. During the same period, the number of people without insurance – one of the highest rates in the country – dropped several percentage points.
A disagreement over extending the increased subsidies was at the heart of the 43-day federal government shutdown — the longest in U.S. history — that ended Wednesday night, with Democrats pushing for their renewal. Democratic leaders in Congress have vowed to continue fighting to extend the subsidies, and Republicans have promised to hold a vote on their extension by mid-December. 
Insurance Commissioner Chaney told Mississippi Today he believes the enhanced tax credits should be phased out, but more gently than ending suddenly at the close of the year.
“We cannot continue to give people free health care, free food, free everything and have a very small number pay for it,” he said. “People have to have some skin in the game to make the system work.”
Marie was one of the Mississippians who benefited from the new, enhanced tax credits in 2021. For the last three years, she has paid a $20 monthly premium for Marketplace insurance, making it possible for her to afford regular appointments and bloodwork to monitor her kidney condition and the costs of her medications. 
But Marie said she and her husband, who works, can’t afford the higher price tag, nor can they pay the out-of-pocket costs of her care if she turns down coverage. 
“If I don’t have my blood pressure medicine, that’s going to be bad,” she said. “I probably won’t live long.”
Experts warn that more people going without health insurance coverage could have serious consequences not only for those individuals but also for other consumers and hospitals. 
Healthy consumers who can go without coverage are the most likely to drop coverage, a shift that is likely to drive up Marketplace premiums overall, said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor and co-director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University. As healthier enrollees leave, the remaining customer base, called the “risk pool,” will become sicker on average and more expensive to insure. 
This is already reflected in next year’s rates. Marketplace insurers told regulators they plan to raise premiums by about 4 percentage points more on average in 2026 to offset the loss of healthier customers, KFF reported. They are also raising prices to keep pace with rising medical costs.
Corlette said she expects prices to rise further in 2027 if the subsidies are not extended. 
“It takes a while for these changes to ripple through the system,” she said.

If tens of thousands of Mississippians drop insurance coverage, hospitals will be likely to shoulder the costs of caring for uninsured patients when they turn to emergency rooms as a last resort, said Richard Roberson, president and CEO of the Mississippi Hospital Association. 
Mississippi’s rural hospitals will lose about $200 million in 2026 if the enhanced subsidies are not extended, according to projections from the Commonwealth Fund, a private foundation that studies health care access in the U.S. More than half of Mississippi’s rural hospitals are already at risk of closing, according to one recent report.
And hospitals across the state are already anticipating cuts to Medicaid payments beginning in 2029 as a result of a sweeping tax-and-spending bill signed into law by President Donald Trump this summer. Paired with rising uncompensated care costs, those reductions will strain hospitals’ bottom line, Roberson said. 
“At some point, it’s not going to be sustainable for hospitals,” he said.
The new law that reduces Medicaid funding also imposes new verification requirements for people receiving standard tax credits. This creates added red tape that produces “more friction for people,” and may drive younger, healthier people to not enroll in plans to avoid the hassle, Corlette said. 
Open enrollment for Marketplace health insurance plans began Nov. 1, giving Americans the first look at their premiums next year. The deadline to enroll in insurance to start in January is Dec. 15, 2025.
If you plan to purchase insurance through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace for 2026, experts recommend these tips:  

Review your premiums early – Check your insurance premiums as soon as possible to allow time to make arrangements for next year. Estimated prices for 2026 plans are now available on HealthCare.gov.
Beware of misleading products – Be cautious if you’re considering buying coverage outside of HealthCare.gov. Some companies may use aggressive or deceptive marketing to sell alternatives to traditional insurance that provide customers limited protection, said Corlette. Plans such as short-term limited duration, fixed indemnity, health care sharing ministries, and Farm Bureau health plans, could expose customers to financial risks, she said, so it’s important to research carefully before purchasing. 
Seek help – If you’re facing significant premium increases or need assistance navigating the Marketplace, contact Help Health Mississippi, a free service operated by the Mississippi Health Advocacy Program, said program manager Khaylah Scott. The program’s website is helphealthms.org and its toll-free number is 1-877-314-3843.

Time is running out for Congress to extend the increased subsidies, Corlette said, noting that customers could be deterred by higher prices and opt not to renew their coverage for next year, on top of the back-end system changes that would take time to implement.
“The later we get, the harder it gets,” she said. 
For consumers with a month and a half left to decide what to do about their coverage, the timeline is daunting. 
“It’s overwhelming,” said Marie, who said she plans to reach out to her health insurance plan for help and explore the possibility of Medicaid coverage as the end of the year nears. 
She is also turning to prayer. 
“I pray a lot,” Marie said. “And we are going to keep praying because that’s the way things got to be.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/06074651/medical-debt-past-due-shutterstock.jpg,,,2025-11-13 17:57:05.311569

State Rep. Mark Cusack, co-chair of the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities, and Energy, received $4,100 in contributions on Wednesday — much of which came from lobbyists representing the state’s energy interests. 
The donations were posted on the state Office of Campaign and Political Finance website on the same day that Cusack’s legislation that would weaken the state’s 2030 climate mandates advanced out of committee as it moves quickly through the House. 
In all, 11 lobbyists, consultants, and attorneys either representing or working directly for energy companies, including National Grid, Unitil, and Liberty Utilities — in addition to oil giant Exxon and Avangrid, which co-owns the Vineyard Wind offshore wind project currently in operation and owns Berkshire Gas — contributed a total of $2,400 to Cusack’s campaign account. 
Jason Tait, a spokesperson for OCPF, said the November 12 transaction date reflects when the money was deposited into Cusack’s campaign account, not necessarily when the donation was made, but that contributions must be deposited within seven days of receipt. CommonWealth Beacon first reported the news of Cusack’s legislative push on November 7. The OCPF deposit report on November 12 was his fourth-largest of the year and largest since May. 
Cusack declined to comment.  
His legislation would lower the amount of renewable energy the utilities would be required to purchase and cut the state’s energy efficiency initiative, which is funded through the utilities’ ratepayers, by $500 million. It would also codify Gov. Maura Healey’s request to delay a state mandate to procure offshore wind from 2027 to 2029. 
Costas Panagopoulos, a professor of political science at Northeastern University, said Cusack’s haul is a “fairly significant number for a single day for a state legislator,” but that there’s nothing out of the ordinary regarding the contributions.  
“This is exactly what lobbyists do,” he said. “They try to influence legislators to support their causes in part by contributing financially to their campaign coffers, especially legislators who are in committee assignments that can be helpful to them or can otherwise help them advance an agenda. Utility companies have historically been involved in lobbying efforts and use their resources strategically to try to advance their goals.” 
While individuals can donate up to $1,000 per calendar year to a candidate, lobbyists are restricted to donations of no more than $200. None of the lobbyists whose donations were reported on Wednesday gave more than $200.  
Robert Boatright, professor of political science at Clark University, said the lobbyist contributions are “clearly a sign that they’re happy with” Cusack” – but that the donations aren’t necessarily surprising. 
Amanda Vicinanzo, a spokesperson for Unitil, said in a statement that individual contributions by lobbyists or employees are “personal decisions and do not reflect Unitil’s position on any legislation” and that the company is “currently in the process of reviewing” Cusack’s bill. 
“Broadly speaking, we support initiatives that help make energy more affordable and reliable for all customers,” she said. 
Brendan Moss, a spokesperson for National Grid, said that the company “welcomes the opportunity to engage constructively with policymakers on practical solutions to support households and businesses.” 
Some of the lobbyists aren’t employed by utilities but work at lobby firms that represent the utility companies, including Tremont Strategies Group and Smith, Costello & Crawford Public Policy Group. Neither of those companies responded to requests for comment. 
Cusack’s haul represents about 10 percent of the total $39,000 in cash he has on hand, according to OCPF.  
His legislation has the support of the Mass Coalition for Sustainable Energy, which includes groups like the Associated Industries of Massachusetts, local chambers of commerce, and the Western Massachusetts Economic Development Council.  
Environmental groups, meanwhile, are fiercely opposed. Cusack appears mindful of the pushback against his effort, writing to House members on Wednesday that he is “aware that many of you are hearing from your constituents and some activists about this affordability bill,” according to an email viewed by CommonWealth Beacon.",https://commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_9835-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-13 16:58:27.401092

(Getty Images)LINCOLN — With the federal government now re-opened, Nebraska’s Department of Health and Human Services has resumed distribution of food assistance.
DHHS announced Thursday that it had distributed “partial” Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits — or SNAP — to Nebraska participants for November. The maximum allotment per household is 65% of the maximum monthly allotment, which could be scaled down based on income, according to the department’s website.
Federally funded SNAP benefits were in limbo during the 43-day government shutdown that came to a close Wednesday after President Donald Trump signed a resolution funding the government through Jan. 30. Federal officials claimed that roughly half of November’s SNAP benefits were still being distributed, but the timeline of that distribution was murky.
The shutdown, which started when Congress failed to pass annual spending laws by Oct. 1, left SNAP without any appropriated funding for November and beyond. A number of lawsuits left the nature of the payments unclear. In Nebraska, about 150,000 low-income and eligible participants, including children, participate in SNAP.
Gov. Jim Pillen made it clear at multiple points during the shutdown that the state would not fund Nebraska’s SNAP program in the meantime.
“Nobody’s going to go hungry,” Pillen said at a Nov. 6 news conference. “We have extraordinary services, from food pantries to engage churches and services across the state.”
DHHS Economic Assistance Director Shannon Grotrian said soon after the shutdown ended that department officials began talks with federal officials to reestablish the benefits.
“After guidance was received from the USDA [U.S. Department of Agriculture] authorizing partial issuances, the team immediately worked to ensure these payments were issued as soon as possible,” Grotrian said.
Statewide advocacy group Nebraska Appleseed criticized the Trump administration for not funding SNAP during the shutdown.
In a separate press release Wednesday, Eric Savaiano, Nebraska Appleseed’s Food and Nutrition Access Program Manager, claimed the administration could have used its transfer authority to keep the program running.
“Food should not be used as a political tool, and we are glad this unnecessary food crisis is over for now,” Savaiano said.

Frank)The federal government last week said it will not release a National Wolf Recovery Plan, despite announcing a plan was in the works last year, saying the species doesn’t need federal protection.  
The move by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service comes as members of Congress are considering multiple bills that would delist the species from the Endangered Species Act nationwide. 
Wolves in the United States are grouped into three differently-managed groups. 
In the Northern Rockies — Montana, Idaho, Wyoming and parts of Washington and Oregon — wolves were removed from the endangered species list and are managed by their respective state wildlife agencies, which allow hunting. 
A population of wolves in Minnesota are listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act, while wolves in the remaining 44 U.S. states are listed as endangered species.

Under the first Trump administration in 2020, the USFWS had decided to delist gray wolves in the states outside of the northern Rockies where they are protected by the Endangered Species Act. But a federal judge in California reversed that decision in February 2022.
Under the new gray wolf “Recovery Planning Exception Findings,” released last week, the USFWS states that no recovery plan is needed because the species no longer meets ESA requirements. 
“The Service’s most recent status reviews for listed gray wolves determined that neither listed entity (44-State or MN entities) meet the definitions of a threatened species or endangered species under the Act according to the best scientific and commercial data available,” according to the Service. “Both listed gray wolf entities are no longer in need of conservation under the Act due to recovery. We therefore conclude that recovery plans for these two entities would not promote their conservation.”
The decision not to release a recovery plan is based on the 2020 status review that was later reversed in 2022. 
After the federal government cleared the way for wolves to be removed from the Endangered Species Act in 2020, a three-day hunt in Wisconsin killed 216 wolves, nearly twice the quota allowed by the state. 
Several conservation groups, which led the lawsuits against the 2020 decision, decried the latest move by the federal government and said they would once again go to court. 
“I’m appalled that Trump wants to strip gray wolves of federal protections and turn their management over to states that are dead set on killing them,” said Collette Adkins, senior attorney and Carnivore Conservation director at the Center for Biological Diversity. “Courts have repeatedly made it clear that our country’s gray wolves have not recovered in places like the southern Rocky Mountains and West Coast. We’ll challenge the Trump administration’s unlawful decision to once again abandon wolf recovery, and we’ll win.”
  Montana’s wolves in court 

Montana’s wolf hunting season is currently underway with new state regulations that allow for hunters and trappers to kill 458 wolves. Another 100 wolves can be killed in management actions by wildlife officials. 
But two opposing groups have filed lawsuits against the state over the new regulations. 
A pair of Republican lawmakers and the Outdoor Heritage Coalition allege that the Fish and Wildlife Commission, which sets policies and regulations for Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks, didn’t comply with state laws intended to reduce the state’s population of gray wolves, saying the quota is too low. 
On the other side, four conservation organizations filed suit also in hopes of overturning the latest wolf management regulations, but with an opposing argument — that the decision to increase the quota of wolves that can be killed this year threatens the species and flies in the face of the constitutional right to a clean and healthful environment.
A half-day of arguments will take place before Lewis and Clark District Court on Nov. 14. 
The conservation groups are seeking a preliminary injunction which would void this year’s wolf hunting regulations. 
According to FWP’s wolf harvest dashboard, 62 wolves have been harvested since the general hunting season opened on Sept. 15. The state’s trapping season begins Dec. 1 and runs through March 15, 2026.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/c1db5324-7bad-486b-b315-ba31fa7034b9Original-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-13 16:58:27.401092

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)Seton Hall University must disclose a litany of documents to attorneys suing the Archdiocese of Newark over its handling of sexual abuse claims, a Superior Court judge ruled Wednesday.
Judge Avion Benjamin’s order will force the university to disclose more than 20,000 pages of documents to opposing counsel, including documents from a 2019 outside probe into abuse allegations at the school’s seminary and whether Monsignor Joseph R. Reilly, the university’s president and a former seminary dean, properly reported them.
“These documents are going to reveal additional examples of systemic behavior within both the archdiocese and Seton Hall where these institutions failed to discipline priests accused of sexual abuse and ratified a culture that turned a blind eye to perpetrators who preyed on these vulnerable children,” said John Baldante, one of the plaintiffs’ lead attorneys.
Benjamin’s order, delivered verbally over about an hour Wednesday, would see the outside report released with some conclusions redacted and directs the university to hand over a trove of emails between it and the law firm that conducted the investigation.
Some emails that included the university, its lawyers, and the investigators could be redacted or withheld based on attorney-client privilege based on the judge’s order, said Baldante, whose firm represents about a third of plaintiffs in the consolidated case.
The judge’s order requires Seton Hall to produce the documents within 30 days, though the disclosures could be paused if the school or the archdiocese appeals the ruling.
Spokespeople for the university and church did not immediately return requests for comment. Baldante said Seton Hall has already indicated it would appeal.
Attorneys for the university had argued the report and related documents were shielded by attorney-client privilege, arguing they were drafted to help prepare the school for litigation. But the judge found the report included a disclaimer that said Seton Hall was not a client of the law firm that drafted it.
In 2020, a judge overseeing the case ordered the archdiocese to disclose a slew of documents in response to claims by roughly 400 plaintiffs who alleged they were sexually abused by Newark’s Catholic clergy.
But the Seton Hall report was never handed over. Attorneys for plaintiffs have said they did not become aware of the investigation until a February report in Politico New Jersey revealed its existence.
Seton Hall attorneys charged that the 2020 order did not apply to the university, which was named in six of the cases. Attorneys for the plaintiffs argued the Catholic university was part of the archdiocese and required to comply.

(Photo: Clayton Henkel/NC Newsline)UNC-Chapel Hill’s chief financial officer Nate Knuffman succeeded Thursday in gaining approval to increase in-state tuition, despite opposition by several politically powerful trustees.
Wednesday, leaders of a key budget committee told Knuffman to rework his tuition recommendations for 2026-27 and remove a 3% increase for in-state undergrads. But at the full UNC-Chapel Hill Board of Trustees meeting Thursday, Knuffman again presented his original proposal.
“Thanks for the robust discussion,” said Knuffman, standing firm. “We have considered that feedback, and we’d like this body to reconsider the tuition and fee proposal that we put forward yesterday.”
Knuffman’s recommendation, which was ultimately adopted in a split vote, includes undergraduate tuition increases of 3% for in-state students and 10% for out-of-state undergrads. Graduate campus-based tuition would see no change. The university will also move ahead with a 3% increase in student fees ($53 more per student), a 7% hike in housing and a 3.9% boost for on-campus dining prices.
Knuffman said raising in-state tuition, which drew the most opposition, was necessary.
“We remain concerned about the dynamic where UNC Chapel Hill is requesting a sizable level of enrollment dollars, north of $15 million from the legislature, yet we’re not using all the options available to us to generate additional dollars,” Knuffman explained.
Trustee Marty Kotis, who chairs the university board’s Budget, Finance, and Infrastructure Committee, was not happy.
Kotis reiterated that the North Carolina Constitution requires UNC to provide education to North Carolinians free of expense, as far as practical.

“This makes affordability for North Carolina residents a constitutional mandate, not a policy preference,” said Kotis.
Kotis proposed leaving in-state undergraduate tuition flat and finding the needed revenue by increasing tuition on out-of-state graduate students.
Trustee Jim Blaine went a step further, pointedly asking Chancellor Lee Roberts to justify how the university would spend the $800,000 that would be generated by a 3% tuition increase for North Carolinians.
“We have significant strategic priorities including the master plan for the campus,” answered Roberts.
“I don’t think that that’s much of an answer,” responded Blaine. “This is the easy button. This is the lazy way.”

Blaine said the university was not operating at maximum efficiency. He said leaders could find $800,000 elsewhere in a $4 billion budget without hitting North Carolina students and families.
Trustee Vinay Patel said when he was first appointed to the board of trustees in 2021, there was great ‘heartache’ over increasing out-of-state tuition by one or two percent.
“Here we are talking about a 10% increase to that number four years later. So that easy button has been pushed quite a bit,” said Patel.
At the same time, Patel agreed the university would be hard-pressed to get more money from the General Assembly when they did not use the tuition increase granted in September by the UNC Board of Governors.
UNC-Chapel Hill trustee Jennifer Lloyd argued that the desire to keep in-state tuition flat for undergraduates was honorable and admirable, but not realistic. (Screengrab: UNC-CH video stream)
Trustee Jennifer Lloyd said UNC-Chapel Hill has consistently been ranked as a best value among colleges and universities, but it was time to generate revenue.
“Why do we tolerate being so much less expensive than anyone but the University of Florida, while we continue to tolerate the deficiencies in the services that we provide?” asked Lloyd, who has had five children attend UNC-Chapel Hill.
“One thing I’ve noted about government is once you turn on the faucet to increase, it never stops,” argued Patrick Ballantine, a former state senator. “For now, I think it’s important to keep this faucet off for in-state residents.”
Lloyd said the desire to keep tuition flat for in-state undergraduates was honorable and admirable, but not realistic.

“We need to raise more revenue in any reasonable place we can,” said Lloyd. “We have tolerated an accumulated balance of deferred maintenance that we shouldn’t be tolerating. So, I’m going to stand behind the chancellor’s recommendation.”
With four trustees absent, Kotis recommended the decision be postponed until the full board could vote by paper ballot.
The trustees who were present rejected Kotis’s motion to delay the matter further, ultimately passing the tuition increase on a 6-5 vote.
The 3% increase amounts to a $211 bump per year and brings the annual cost of tuition and fees to $9,360 for incoming in-state undergraduates at UNC-Chapel Hill starting next year, if the UNC System agrees.

Five Democratic senators broke with their party on Wednesday to pass a continuing resolution with the Republican majority, and the House voted Wednesday evening with six Democrats and two Republicans cross the aisle.
All four members of Montana’s all-Republican federal delegation voted to end the shutdown.
“After 43 long days our government is finally open. I’m thankful for Democrats who joined with us in the Senate and voted for our bill and I’m grateful for Speaker Johnson’s leadership getting it passed quickly in the House with a strong bipartisan vote,” Sen. Steve Daines said in a social media post. “One thing’s clear: there’s nothing gained from shutdowns. They start with a bang and they end with a whimper. They don’t do anything but make life difficult for millions of Americans. The political theater we just witnessed should never be repeated.”
“I sincerely want to thank the handful of Democrats who had the political courage to cross the aisle and vote with us to end this embarrassing shutdown,” Sen. Tim Sheehy said on X. “Getting government operations opened up is the right thing to do for America, regardless of party. Let’s get to work.”
“Shutdowns are bad for America and bad for Montana. I voted to prevent this shutdown in September, and I gladly voted to end it today,” Rep. Ryan Zinke, who serves on the House Appropriations Committee, said in a press release. “This package is a good, bipartisan, solution, and I fought to make sure it includes real wins for our state, from funding fire departments in Ronan and Powell County to providing certainty for rural communities that depend on reliable government services. Congress has come together, and I urge the President to sign this bill so we can keep our government open and get back to working for the American people.”
“After more than 42 days, Congress has finally reopened the government. With the Senate’s amendments to our clean CR passed, Americans across the country who have been deprived of nutritional assistance, critical programs, or their paychecks will no longer face the hardship and uncertainty brought on by this shutdown. This is a good thing,” Rep. Troy Downing said in a press release. “If we want to prevent something like this from happening in the future, we cannot forget how we got here. Democrats voted for more than 6 weeks—that’s 42 days or 1008 hours—to keep our government closed while Americans suffered. And for what? We are functionally very near where we would have been had we passed the House’s September CR.
“I’m proud that I cast my vote to keep the government open then and now. Let this saga be a stark reminder of the consequences of brinksmanship and the real damage that’s done when one side of the aisle puts politics before people. Now, it’s time for Congress to pass our remaining appropriations bills and return to regular order.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GettyImages-1227909097-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-13 16:58:27.401092

(Westend61/Getty Images)The Trump administration’s cuts to federal research funding have left projects at New Mexico’s institutions of higher education in limbo and have impacted innovation; economic development; workforce growth; and rural and tribal communities, according to a university research expert.
Members of the New Mexico Legislature’s interim Science, Technology and Telecommunications Committee met in Santa Fe Wednesday where they heard from Lique Coolen, vice president for research for New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology. Coolen’s presentation highlighted the uncertainty ongoing cancellations of funding awards to research institutions have created, and the possibility of fewer future funding opportunities. 
Coolen said that based on recent New Mexico Higher Education Department data, the state faces a loss of $95 million in federal funding for research alone. Key areas of research in the state include agriculture; defense and national security; public health; water resource and technology; energy initiatives; and others, Coolen noted.
One recent example of funding cuts, according to Coolen’s presentation, includes about $41.5 million from the U.S. Department of Energy to New Mexico Tech for the Four Corners Carbon Storage Hub. The project involved long-term carbon storage options for the Navajo Nation Four Corners power plant. A funding award of $10 million to New Mexico State University from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency earlier in 2025 halted the South Central Thriving Communities Technical Assistance Center. The program involves five states, including New Mexico, and supports rural, tribal and underserved communities in competing for federal and state funding for quality of life and infrastructure needs. 
The University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center lost nearly $1 million in federal funding from the U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency to support research on the “rapid identification of virus particles” by using artificial intelligence.
“This causes a huge amount of uncertainty for us universities,” Coolen said during the meeting. “Not only do we need to find other sources of funding to make sure that we do not have to lay off people, that we retain our workforce and most importantly, that we can continue to support the students that are supported by those federal funding sources. But this is not where it ends.”
Coolen described initial cuts to funding as the “first wave,” with the ripple effect leading to larger impacts in the future. She said grants that were once awarded could be canceled or not renewed; specific funding opportunities may become unavailable altogether; and universities may need to make cuts to lower facility and administration costs. She said this all has a negative impact on the state’s workforce pipeline, which relies on keeping New Mexico students in New Mexico once they complete their education.
“It’s also having an impact on students that are considering entering PhD programs where they may be dependent on federal funding for their research projects,” Coolen said. “I just had a conversation just this week with a student who is completing their master’s program, is really considering moving into a PhD program based on the research that they were doing in their laboratory, but now the federal funding has been cut. They do not know yet where to move next.”
She added that New Mexico Tech decreased the number of proposals submitted to various agencies to 60% or 65% of previous proposals for federal funding because the opportunities are not available. 
Coolen said universities are also seeing federal funding agencies changing their priorities to narrower “mission areas” with which the universities are not fully aligned or prepared to apply for. Large funding cuts to the U.S. National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health U.S. Department of Energy and others are expected, Coolen said, and range within 20% to 40% reductions in research funding.
“Universities are seeking ways to protect their programs that are critical to New Mexico, and are exploring mechanisms to enhance alignment with the federal priorities to remain competitive,” she said. 
Coolen told lawmakers that New Mexico research institutions need to align research with federal priorities while still serving the state, diversify research funding sources, increase collaborations with national laboratories and modernize infrastructure to maintain “top-level” research and retain talent. She encouraged lawmakers to consider where they might increase state investments to support the needs of the various research institutions.
Rep. Joy Garratt (D-Albuquerque) pointed to larger research universities around the country that have been pressured by the Trump Administration to “conform” to executive mandates and threats of withholding federal funding, and questioned whether New Mexico universities have received similar pressure. 
“Cornell, University of Virginia, Brown, Columbia – they’re all giving in to demands and paying millions of dollars,” Garratt said during the meeting. Coolen said the universities in New Mexico have not received such direct communication, but are reviewing the actions taken by other higher education institutions.
Rep. Alan Martinez (R-Rio Rancho) said he was not necessarily worried about New Mexico universities becoming at-risk of losing federal funds due to demands by the Trump Administration, but called for cutting the “nonsense of fighting against the president.” 
“I just don’t see the wisdom in wasting time fighting against the president instead of fighting for the State of New Mexico,” Martinez said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-1011456596-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-13 16:58:27.401092

(Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — South Carolinians who missed out on their grocery assistance for November should receive their benefits Friday, according to the state Department of Social Services.
More than 176,000 households in the state didn’t get their food benefits this month because of a 43-day federal shutdown that ended late Wednesday night. After funding to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program stopped Nov. 1, states scrambled to figure out how to feed millions of low-income people who usually rely on the benefits, commonly called food stamps.
Because South Carolina distributes SNAP benefits on a rolling basis, the shutdown didn’t block aid to all of the nearly 550,000 people the program helps feed.
For the roughly 64,700 households who usually get their benefits between the 15th and the 19th of each month, money to their debit cards will be downloaded on their usual schedule, DSS said in a Thursday news release.


Everyone else in the program, including those newly approved for benefits after Oct. 15, should get their November allotment Friday. Altogether, around $105 million in benefits are downloaded onto cards each month, according to DSS.
The law President Donald Trump signed Wednesday ending the shutdown included funding for the program through Sept. 30, 2026.
Until all SNAP recipients have received their benefits, the state’s donation-supported emergency response fund will continue to accept money, said Georgia Mjartan, president of Central Carolina Community Foundation, which runs the One SC Fund. Gov. Henry McMaster announced the fund’s activation Oct. 28, ahead of the looming Nov. 1 shutdown, to help food banks stock their shelves.
“The need is still there, because people don’t actually have SNAP loaded back onto their cards yet,” Mjartan said Thursday. “It’s not just a snap of the fingers and then their funds are available.”
Since its activation Oct. 28, the fund collected $326,654 from 680 separate donors, Mjartan said. With several more large donations incoming, Mjartan expects the fund to reach $400,000 by early next week at the latest, she said.
The fund sent an initial $200,000 last week to four regional food banks with reach across the state. With SNAP benefits returning, the fund will distribute the rest of the money raised.
Although donations fell far short of the millions of dollars officials hoped to see, the fund received money from a record-breaking number of donors, Mjartan said.
Among them were children who wrote that they were donating their allowances to keep fellow children from going hungry, elderly couples scraping together what they could to help out, and some recurring donors who gave more than $10,000, she said.

“It’s been really overwhelming to see how individuals really responded to this very human need of their neighbors, and that has been one of the brightest spots,” Mjartan said.
Unlike after natural disasters, companies and foundations were more hesitant to donate, seemingly out of fear their money wouldn’t make a major difference, Mjartan said.
The fund did get $100,000 from Duke Energy soon after activating, as well as more than $50,000 from WoodmenLife Outreach Foundation, the philanthropic arm of an insurance company. Several more companies said they would make donations in the coming days, she said.
More companies and people likely found other ways to help, such as donating to local organizations feeding people or running food drives, Mjartan said.
She encouraged everyone to do whatever they could, whether donating to the statewide relief fund or giving a neighbor something to eat. Restaurants across the state also helped out by offering free meals.
“The fact that that particular fund didn’t fill up with contributions of $5 million, $6 million like we hoped does not mean millions of dollars did not go to organizations doing that on-the-ground food work,” Mjartan said.
Although the emergency feeding fund will wrap up in the coming days, the general One SC Fund remains open year-round, Mjartan said. Any money donated to the general fund and not a specific cause goes toward helping when an emergency happens, so the fund can get money to people as quickly as possible, she said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSC_0382-1024x657.jpg,,,2025-11-13 16:58:27.401092

Al Gentry, D-Louisville. (LRC Public Information)Louisville Democratic Rep. Al Gentry is stepping down as chair of the Kentucky House minority caucus.
The Democratic Caucus elected Lexington Democratic Rep. Lindsey Burke as the new chair. She was previously the House Democratic whip, according to a press release. Her successor will be selected Friday. 
Gentry, who represents the 46th House District in Jefferson County, was selected as the caucus chair in late 2024. He has served in the House since 2017. 
Gentry said he plans to seek reelection and continue serving his current term in office. 
Gentry is leaving leadership to work on a new adaptive golf initiative, according to the news release. The sport allows people with disabilities to play golf through modified rules or equipment. In 1993, Gentry lost his dominant right arm in a workplace drilling accident while working as a hydrogeologist. 
Gentry, who is on the board of directors for the United States Adaptive Golf Alliance, helped establish the alliance and later co-authored competitive standards and a ranking system for adaptive golf in the U.S. 
Stepping down from leadership will give “him time to provide leadership as a senior advisor to a national leadership team preparing for a major new initiative in Adaptive Golf,” says the press release. 
“I’m not at liberty to share specifics of this initiative, for proprietary reasons, but I can say that if launched successfully it will be the first of its kind,” Gentry said. “It will tremendously improve access and affordability for golfers with disabilities to participate in competitive adaptive golf events across the nation.”
He added: “This new opportunity is a short-term, part-time position that will not affect my continued work in the Kentucky General Assembly, which I’m honored and proud to continue. It will, however, impact my time set aside for duties as caucus chairman. For that reason, out of respect for my colleagues and party, I felt it was necessary to step aside at year’s end to allow my successor plenty of time to transition properly.  Since I will continue serving as a state representative, I will be accessible to my successor as caucus chair for any necessary input that may be warranted.”

(Getty Images)Indiana officials on Thursday named nine finalists for three open seats on the powerful Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission, which oversees electric, gas, water and telecommunications rates across the state.
The finalists were announced publicly in Indianapolis and are Nathan Cazee, Christopher Lewis, Anthony Swinger, Joshua Bain, Sen. Andy Zay, Alfonso Vidal, Bob Deig, Carolene Mays and Elizabeth Walker. They were selected from a pool of 47 applicants by the state’s Utility Regulatory Nominating Committee, which interviewed 22 candidates over the last month.
The commission’s makeup has to include members of both political parties, so the first six recommendations are for two Republican seats and the final three are for a Democratic appointment.
“We had an extremely difficult time,” said Suzanne Jaworowski, Indiana’s secretary of Energy and Natural Resources and chair of the nominating committee, citing the strong field of candidates. She said there is no statutory timeline for when Gov. Mike Braun will make his selections.
The IURC plays a critical role in setting the rates and service standards for Indiana’s regulated utilities. Commissioners are appointed by the governor. The new members will help guide state energy policy at a time of mounting public concern over rising electricity and natural gas bills.
Cazee works for the air-quality company Daikin Applied in southern Indiana, while Lewis currently serves as a technical advisor for the IURC. Swinger has spent more than 25 years with the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor, which represents ratepayers in commission cases. Bain is a member of the Indianapolis City-County Council, and Zay has represented portions of northeast Indiana in the state Senate since 2016.
The other finalists include Vidal, a southern Indiana businessman; Deig, a former state senator and Posey County official; Mays, a former state representative and small-business owner who previously served on the IURC; and Walker, an attorney for the Indiana Professional Licensing Agency.
The nominating committee’s recommendations now go to Braun, who will decide which candidates to appoint. Although the committee operates under a defined application and interview schedule, the governor faces no deadline to make his choices.
In announcing the search earlier this fall, the administration pointed to widespread frustration among Hoosiers over rising utility costs. The IURC, by law, is intended to serve as an impartial arbiter — “an advocate of neither the public nor the utilities” — but its decisions often draw scrutiny from consumer advocates and lawmakers alike.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service directed the Iowa HHS to issue full SNAP benefits for the month of November, according to an Iowa HHS spokesperson. Previously, Iowa HHS had issued guidance that partial SNAP benefits would be provided for the month as the federal shutdown was still ongoing, as instructed by the Trump administration, though the state department did not provide timing on when the benefits would be released.

The shutdown ended Wednesday night, when President Donald Trump signed a federal funding package reopening the government through January. With the federal government reopening, a USDA spokesperson told States Newsroom SNAP benefits for most participants will be available “within 24 hours for most States.”
Though delayed, full food assistance benefits are being provided for November in Iowa beginning Thursday, Iowa HHS stated, with benefits “being loaded onto cards now and could be available later today.” Full benefits are anticipated to be available to all SNAP recipients Friday, according to the department.
There are roughly 42 million people nationwide who use SNAP benefits to access food. In Iowa, there are roughly 270,000 individuals enrolled in the program, and the state receives around $45 million each month in benefits.
The department recommended SNAP recipients check their Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) card balances before making any purchases. Balances can be checked by calling the number on the back of their EBT card, 800-359-5802, or by logging into their ConnectEBT account by browser or through the mobile app.
Earlier in November, Gov. Kim Reynolds had announced the state would match up to $1 million in donations made to Iowa food banks in order to address increased need in Iowa communities caused by the lapse in SNAP benefits, as well as plans to deploy Iowa National Guard troops to assist with food distribution across the state. Other entities throughout the state, including Polk County, also pledged money to assist local food banks — as did businesses like Hy-Vee and Fareway, as well as the three state Medicaid managed care organizations, Iowa Total Care, Molina Healthcare of Iowa, and Wellpoint Iowa.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)After much uncertainty in the midst of the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, all Utah Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program customers are expected to receive full November benefits by Saturday. 
The Utah Department of Workforce Services, which administers the benefit, said on Thursday that the benefit, widely known as SNAP, will be issued within 24 hours. The announcement came hours after federal elected officials signed a spending package, funding most government operations through January.
SNAP users in Utah typically receive payments every month’s 5th, 11th or 15th, depending on their last name, Becky Wickstrom, public information officer at the Department of Workforce Services, said.

“No benefits have gone out yet, but those who would have received them on the 5th and 11th will start seeing those tomorrow,” Wickstrom said. “And then, if customers would normally receive them on the 15th, then they will come as scheduled.”
As Utah faces partial SNAP payments, GOP leaders deny Dems’ request to fill the void

October payments were already allocated during the government shutdown, but chaos emerged in November, with contradicting instructions from different courts and federal agencies. 
Some states had issued court-ordered full payments, but Utah didn’t release any SNAP funds during November. The latest action in the turmoil was an instruction from President Donald Trump to reverse a portion of the payments after an emergency Supreme Court ruling allowing the administration to make partial SNAP payments. 
The Department of Workforce Services had been following federal guidance throughout the process, Wickstrom said. 
“Our latest guidance before the government reopened, was that emergency federal funding would be used to issue a 65% amount of everyone’s SNAP benefits. And so we were in the process of making that happen, that requires us to shift things around in our system,” she said. “We were on track to have that also in place by the 15th but with the government reopened, we’re really happy to announce that we can issue that full benefit as normal.”



Let us know what you think...


 


About 87,000 Utah families rely on the benefit, which is completely funded by the federal government. State leaders remained firm in their decision not to step in and cover the payments during the shutdown, but committing up to $4 million to help support the Utah Food Bank.
Utah Senate Democrats pleaded to convene in a special session to use rainy day funds to fund SNAP, with Senate Minority Leader Luz Escamilla, D-Salt Lake City, saying that “Utah has the means to step in and ensure no one goes hungry while we wait for federal action.”
But, Gov. Spencer Cox and legislative leaders maintained their stance, arguing that “using state funds to compensate for federal inaction would rapidly drain reserves and undermine Utah’s long-term fiscal stability.”
A warning on scams
With all benefits dropping into people’s accounts again, Wickstrom also warned Utah customers about recent benefits thefts involving SNAP’s Electronic Benefit Transfer cards.
“It seems like thieves are getting more sophisticated and advanced in the way that they can steal EBT card information,” Wickstrom said. “Unfortunately, when they get the card number and they’re able to get into someone’s account, once that money is spent, it is gone.”
The Department of Workforce Services advises users to lock their EBT cards through the ConnectEBT app when they aren’t in use.
“We want customers to get the ConnectEBT mobile app, then lock their card whenever they’re not making a purchase,” Wickstrom said. “They can even do this in real time. So, in line at the grocery store, unlock your card, make a purchase, lock it again, and hopefully that helps them keep track of their benefits and keep the money that they need to feed their families.”

NEW CASTLE, Del. (Nov. 13, 2025) — More than 20 dementia caregivers spent Thursday morning learning strategies, sharing personal stories, and connecting with experts during a Family Caregivers Month workshop hosted by the Alzheimer’s Association Delaware Valley Chapter at Canaan Baptist Church.
The half-day program, held from 10 a.m. to 12:30 p.m., brought together local clinicians, advocates, and caregivers for conversations about burnout, family dynamics, memory-care planning, and the growing network of support services across Delaware.
“Caring for someone living with dementia brings a unique set of challenges and rewards,” said Erica Holmes, programs manager for the Alzheimer’s Association Delaware Valley Chapter
“Caring for someone living with dementia brings a unique set of challenges and rewards,” said Erica Holmes, programs manager for the Alzheimer’s Association Delaware Valley Chapter. “No one should face dementia alone. Caregivers must have access to tools and best practices that can guide them on their journey.”
A caregiver’s story sets the tone
The workshop opened with a deeply personal reflection from Sonja Brown, a longtime caregiver who now mentors others navigating the emotional and practical demands of dementia.
“My husband was diagnosed three years ago and I’m still learning every day,” Brown told attendees. “Who would have thought that my husband — a veteran, a deacon at our church, and a community leader — would struggle with Alzheimer’s? He was the strongest man I know.”
Brown and her husband recently celebrated their 54th wedding anniversary. She said caregiving has become an act of partnership and perseverance.
“I just want to help others find their way as caregivers,” she said. “If we can understand dementia in a way that helps our families, we can face this together.”
Experts highlight respite care, dementia education, and support programs
Dr. Damali Thomas, who moderated a panel discussion, led a conversation about real-life caregiving challenges, communication struggles, and the emotional impact of the journey.
The workshop continued with presentations from medical professionals and community organizations:


Jonathan Swartz of Easterseals offered guidance on respite care and accessibility programs that give caregivers short-term relief.


Dr. Damali Thomas, who moderated a panel discussion, led a conversation about real-life caregiving challenges, communication struggles, and the emotional impact of the journey.


Adrienne Halloway, Ph.D., of the ChristianaCare Swank Center for Memory Care presented information about the ChristianaCare GUIDE Program, which delivers coordinated dementia care — including caregiver training, respite services, personalized care plans, and 24/7 support — at no additional cost to Medicare patients.


The GUIDE model, she said, is designed “to improve quality of life for families and help loved ones stay safely at home for as long as possible.”
Building community during Family Caregivers Month
Thursday’s program was one of several Delaware events held to recognize November as National Family Caregivers Month, an annual observance honoring the unpaid caregivers who support millions of Americans living with chronic or cognitive conditions.
Attendees spent the morning comparing experiences, asking questions of experts, and gathering printed materials from resource tables. Organizers said the goal was simple: ensure caregivers feel seen, supported, and connected.
“Caregiving is a journey,” Holmes said. “This workshop is about making sure nobody walks it alone.”

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/13/ct-senate-federal-cuts-snap-vote/,The CT Senate voted 27-8 to designate $500 million to potentially backfill federal cuts to nutrition and other human service programs.,"The state Senate gave final approval in special session Thursday afternoon to bills to safeguard human services from federal cuts and was expected to adopt a bill to enable UConn Health to purchase financially imperiled Waterbury Hospital.
The Democratic-controlled Senate voted 27-8, largely along party lines, to designate $500 million from state reserves to potentially backfill federal cuts to nutrition, health care, heating assistance and other human service programs for the remainder of this fiscal year, which wraps June 30.
The measure, which the House of Representatives approved on Wednesday, now heads to Gov. Ned Lamont, who is expected to sign it.
“The things that matter most to me are feeding people and making sure they’re warm,” said Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, co-chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, said of the response fund, which would be created using one-fifth of last fiscal year’s  $2.5 billion state budget surplus.
Connecticut has used more than $10 billion in surplus to whittle down its considerable pension debt since 2020, on top of the more than $3 billion in required pension contributions it makes annually through the budget. Analysts project the state will continue to make billions in surplus contributions over the rest of the decade.
“This bill builds on that momentum” while ensuring vulnerable residents aren’t left hungry or cold in the coming months, Osten said. “It’s about discipline and compassion.”
According to the bill, Lamont has sole authority to propose expenditures from that $500 million pool. But a 6-member panel of state legislative leaders — which includes the House and Senate majority and minority leaders along with the House speaker and Senate president pro tem — could block any spending with a simple majority vote.
Any dollars not spent by June 30 would be used to pay down state pension debt.
That plan appealed to Republicans and Democrats alike in the House, where majorities from both parties overwhelmingly approved the fund Wednesday.
But eight of 11 Senate Republicans opposed the response fund as unnecessary and a tool to finance Democrats’ pet projects.
“I do believe this is a slush fund,” state Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, said during a press conference just prior to Thursday’s session. “The language that’s written is so ambiguous I don’t know what they’re going to spend this money on.”
The federal government shutdown, which began Oct. 1, stalled federal funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, starting Nov. 1. Gov. Ned Lamont ordered November SNAP benefits paid out beginning Nov. 8, even if the state had to bear the roughly $72 million monthly bill.
“We do not want to see interruptions to basic programs like food stamps or WIC [Special Supplemental Nutrition Assistance for Women, Infants and Children] for those who are most in need,” said Sen. Ryan Fazio, R-Greenwich. “That premise, I think, has gone by the wayside.”
Fazio was referencing a decision by the U.S. House of Representatives last Monday to give final approval to the temporary funding measure needed to end the shutdown.
But Connecticut Democrats have been talking since President Donald Trump took office in January, long before the shutdown began Oct. 1, about using the state’s huge resources to backfill impending federal cuts in human service programs.
The Trump administration since last spring has used a host of legal maneuvers to block health care, education, nutrition and other federal aid to Connecticut.
And the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that Trump and the GOP-led Congress adopted in July ordered more than $1 trillion in cuts to health care and social services over the next decade to help finance roughly $4.5 trillion in tax relief — breaks aimed chiefly at high-earning households.
“We have what we’re seeing, and we have seen, since Jan. 20, is just chaos and confusion and cruelty to the American people and also to the people of the state of Connecticut,” Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, said during a press conference prior to Thursday’s debate.
“I’m baffled about the secret mission some people think we have here,” said Sen. Gary Winfield, D-New Haven, who recalled lines of desperate residents seeking help at emptied food pantries once SNAP benefits stopped on Nov. 1. “I’ve heard the conversation, both in this chamber and the other chamber: ‘What is it you’re trying to do?’
“Health care? Yes. Food? Yes. Heat? Yes. That’s the ‘secret mission’.”
Sen. Matt Lesser, D-Middletown, co-chairman of the Human Services Committee, said the state response fund is badly needed because the bill Trump signed in July will cause immediate pain for significant numbers of Connecticut residents.
The measure could remove about 36,000 immigrants, young adults, veterans and people experiencing homelessness from SNAP eligibility in Connecticut between Dec. 1 and March 31.
Starting Jan. 1, Washington will cancel subsidies that help people afford health coverage through through state-based insurance exchanges like Access Health CT. The cost to consumers here is projected at almost $300 million per year.
“To me that seems like an emergency because there is no federal action to reverse that decision,” Lesser said.
Sen. Rob Sampson, R-Wolcott, countered that if Connecticut residents need help, the General Assembly should return those dollars to households as a credit against state income taxes rather than creating a $500 million fund to bolster certain programs.
“These are excess dollars that belong to the people of Connecticut, that we have taxed as a state,” he said, offering an amendment to order the relief and estimating it would save households $300 to $400.

About 3,200 members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers voted to approve Boeing’s latest offer by a 68% margin, after rejecting the company’s previous four offers.
Boeing leaders said they “look forward to having the full team back at work” beginning on Sunday.
The approved offer includes a $6,000 signing bonus, instead of the original $5,000 offered in August. However, Boeing extended the contract’s term from four to five years, with a 24% general wage increase – 8% in the first year and 4% in each of the following years. 
What didn’t make it into the contract for union workers was their demanded $10,000 ratification bonus, 401-K benefit match and a higher wage increase for longtime employees.
“IAM District 837 members stood strong and united for over three months,” according to a union statement after the vote. “We thank our bargaining committee for their tireless efforts, and we appreciate the unwavering support of our members, their families, the St. Louis community, our labor allies, and elected officials throughout this fight.” 
Steve Parker, executive vice president of The Boeing Company and president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space & Security, wrote a letter to employees earlier this week saying the strike “has been stressful for everyone.”
“With the holidays approaching,” he wrote, “we want to get everyone back to work and provide stability for you and your families with higher wages, health care and guaranteed holiday pay.”
The company heard from many employees that they’d like more cash up front, Parker said, rather than Boeing stock. 
“We’ve taken all of that to heart with a revised offer that incorporates your feedback while continuing to stay within the economic value of our prior offers,” he said.
Parker said the company has already hired permanent replacement workers “as we moved into the next phase of our contingency plan.”
“Despite that, we will guarantee that all IAM 837 members will be returned to work if this offer is ratified,” he said. “No one would be displaced. This is not something we will be able to guarantee moving forward.” 
Boeing’s decision to use replacement workers to complete fighter jet projects in St. Louis put the company at odds with members of the U.S. Senate. 
Earlier this month, five Democratic senators pilloried the plan for replacement workers as potentially putting the nation’s military at risk. 
“For existing projects, such as the F-15 Eagle and the F/A-18 Hornet, you are also unnecessarily endangering our warfighters by insisting on proceeding with an untrained and hastily recruited workforce,”  said the letter the senators sent Tuesday to Boeing President and CEO Kelly Ortberg.
Republican U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri sent his own letter to Ortberg demanding the company negotiate in good faith with striking workers. 
“These workers help produce our nation’s most crucial, most advanced, and most expensive defense tools,” Hawley wrote. “And since your company receives billions in government contracts, it is incumbent upon you to do the right thing.”
Parker, in his letter, boasted that the offer includes wage growth for longtime employees and more vacation and sick leave for all employees. The average base pay will go from $75,000 to $109,000 a year. And, there’s “potential for even more value with overtime,” he wrote.
The union vowed to continue to fight for “fairness and respect for the world’s best defense workers” in future negotiations.
“We’re proud of what our members have fought for together,” according to the union’s Thursday statement, “and are ready to get back to building the world’s most advanced military aircraft.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Boeing-strike-IAM-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-13 16:58:27.401092

Federal workers are awaiting missed paychecks, and programs and services that rely on federal grants have stalled, though both are expected to resume soon. And local food pantries hope to bounce back amid the funding lapse of federal nutrition assistance that led to a confusing back-and-forth over whether recipients would get their November benefits.
Connecticut’s entire congressional of five representatives and two senators opposed the deal brokered by some in the Democratic Party Wednesday night to end the shutdown because it didn’t meet their health care demands and guarantee the extension of expiring enhanced premium subsidies.
Pressure had been building to end the stalemate. As the shutdown dragged on, people in Connecticut and across the country started seeing disruptions to services, multiple missed paychecks for federal workers and travel delays and flight cuts that are expected to continue.
Connecticut didn’t feel the full brunt of the shutdown because the state filled in some of the gaps where federal dollars had temporarily dried up. Still, some lingering effects of the shutdown won’t immediately go away.
“There’s absolutely going to be a ripple effect. It’s not like you hit a switch and everything goes back to normal. But this wasn’t just about one thing,” U.S. Rep. Jahana Hayes, D-5th District, said.
All federal workers will get back pay
Federal employees didn’t receive paychecks during the shutdown even if they were required to work, with the exception this time around for members of the military, who got paid twice.
President Donald Trump had suggested at times that furloughed workers might not get back pay, even though it is a requirement of a law that was passed during his first administration.
That 2019 law states federal workers must receive back pay “at the earliest date possible” once the government reopens.
To quash any doubt about those payments, the Senate deal to reopen the government included a guarantee of back pay for those on furlough. It also reverses layoffs that occurred during the shutdown, which were already paused by federal judges.The timing of payments will vary by agency. But the Trump administration said it plans to start processing payments on Saturday and wrapping up the process by Wednesday, according to a published report.
SNAP is back but food demand is still high
The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, will once again be funded.
Disruptions to this nutrition assistance were unprecedented. SNAP, formerly known as food stamps, had never seen cuts before in the program’s history — and what resulted was whiplash over whether recipients would receive their November benefits.
Funding for SNAP came to a halt on Nov. 1 as the shutdown stretched into another month. What resulted was chaos and confusion: November’s monthly benefits weren’t loaded onto Electronic Benefit Transfer or EBT cards, federal judges then ruled that the Trump administration must fund SNAP, and after mixed messaging, Connecticut decided to restore benefits last weekend.
Gov. Ned Lamont had been reluctant to spend state funds on the federal program but pledged to keep it running for the rest of the month even if funding from the feds stalled again. But with the shutdown over, SNAP benefits will come back everywhere.
The whiplash over the state of SNAP benefits put increased demand on local food banks and pantries across Connecticut.
“The emergency food system has definitely sustained some structural damage because of the length of the federal shutdown. It’s going to take a little while for us all to crawl out of this,” Connecticut Foodshare President and CEO Jason Jakubowski said. “Things aren’t going to go back to perfect the minute that the president signs the bill.”
Connecticut Foodshare works with more than 600 food pantries across the state as well as 110 mobile sites. The organization hired temporary workers and drivers to help meet the demand caused by the shutdown, which Jakubowski said has yet to subside.
“We also haven’t seen the lines at our pantries and our mobile trucks go back down to pre-shutdown levels yet either,” Jakubowski said. “Things were not perfect on Sept. 30 before the shutdown started. It has been a very, very difficult year for us in food banking, particularly 2025 as a whole.”
Food aid has already taken a hit this year because of federal cutbacks. Connecticut was hit by cuts earlier this year to The Emergency Food Assistance Program, or TEFAP. And food banks also lost the federal dollars that allowed them to buy in bulk from local farmers and created more access to fresh produce.
Plus, food pantries are preparing for demand of Thanksgiving and the December holidays.
“My message to my staff today was ‘yes, the shutdown is over, but we’re still in a semi-emergency mode at least though end of the calendar year,'” Jakubowski said.
Because of the strain, Jakubowski said, he hopes it’ll encourage stakeholders to have more proactive conversations about addressing hunger, and not just “when there’s a crisis.” 
Head Start weathered funding lapses 
Most Head Start centers in Connecticut went unscathed, but two local centers faced funding lapses in federal dollars earlier this month. Both continued operating without it after Connecticut’s Office of Early Childhood stepped in with temporary funding for one month.
Head Start centers — early childhood services that serve low-income children from birth to age 5 — start their federal grant cycles on different timelines. Only half a dozen were operating without federal funding in October. But that number ballooned, with an additional 134 programs that were supposed to start on Nov. 1.
That included two in Connecticut: EdAdvance, a Regional Educational Service Center serving western Connecticut, and Children’s Learning Centers of Fairfield County in Stamford. Between the two, they have a combined 395 slots serving children in Head Start and Early Head Start programs.
“We just happen to be in the cohort that’s supposed to start funding in the middle of a shutdown,” EdAdvance executive director Jonathan Costa said. “The timing and the impact of it is greater than I would have ever imagined.”
EdAdvance was supposed to get its five-year federal grant starting on Nov. 1. To help, Costa said, the state fronted his organization half of its total allocation to stay open in November. He said none of the staff missed a paycheck during the shutdown.
Costa said the agreement with the state is paying the money back once the federal government “makes us whole for November.”
“I’m not expecting any prolonged delay once the government is back online to us receiving our funding,” Costa said. “It’ll only be a problem if it takes them into December to do it.”
During the shutdown, Monica Maccera Filppu, the CEO of Children’s Learning Centers of Fairfield County, had sent a message to families that they would stay open and didn’t anticipate “any immediate changes to our services.”
The National Head Start Association said it could take up to two weeks for some centers to be able to start drawing down funds and resources.
Connecticut ultimately didn’t have any disruptions to services or closures of centers. But during the shutdown, 20 programs closed across 17 states and Puerto Rico. That affected more than 9,000 seats in Head Start programs across the country.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25274456520062-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-13 16:58:27.401092

(Photo via Google Earth)For the third time in five years, a Sioux City hospital’s status as a Level III Trauma Center has been placed on probation by state regulators due to an ongoing series of regulatory violations.
Last month, UnityPoint Health’s St. Luke’s Hospital in Sioux City entered into a consent agreement with the Iowa Emergency Medical Services and Trauma Bureau, placing the hospital’s trauma center certification on probation for one year.
The hospital currently is certified as a Level III Trauma Center, which means it can stabilize and care for trauma patients and also has access to general surgery and orthopedic surgery.

A downgrade to Level IV status would mean the hospital could provide basic life support and stabilization for trauma patients but would focus on transferring patients to higher-level trauma centers as soon as possible.
A spokesperson for UnityPoint said Thursday the corporation has no comment on the new consent agreement.
State records show the Sioux City hospital’s trauma center certification has been an issue since October 2018, when it was issued a citation and warning by the bureau for failure to comply with all of the criteria for Level III status. In March 2020, it was issued a second citation and warning due to failure to comply with Level III criteria.
In May 2021, the bureau determined the hospital had again failed to comply with all Level III criteria as evidenced by 47 deficiencies, including five serious “Type I” deficiencies. The Iowa Department of Public Health, now known as the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services, then placed the hospital’s Level III status on probation for one year and required UnityPoint to submit a plan of correction and to participate in a “focused” inspection intended to assess the hospital’s adherence to that plan of correction.
In April 2022, the focused inspection was conducted and the department determined that 44 of the 47 cited deficiencies had been successfully resolved — with three areas of continued noncompliance. As a result, the department placed the hospital’s Level III status on “extended probation” for one year through July 2023.
In April 2023, the hospital was deemed in compliance, and a new certificate for Level III status was issued. In July 2024, after another inspection, the department concluded the hospital had again failed to comply with all criteria for Level III status, citing 26 deficiencies — including 15 that were repeat offenses due to their being cited in the May 2021 inspection.
In October 2024, the hospital was issued another citation and warning for failure to comply with all of the criteria for Level III status. After a July 2025 focused inspection, the department concluded the hospital had successfully resolved 23 of the 26 violations. But in addition to the three unresolved deficiencies, a new deficiency was cited, raising the total number of unresolved issues to four.
Last month, pursuant to a consent agreement with the hospital, the department again placed the Sioux City hospital’s Level III status on probation for one year through October 2026.
The agreement requires the hospital to submit a new corrective action plan, along with “letters of commitment from all medical staff active in trauma resuscitation.”
In addition, the hospital must now submit quarterly reports, to be approved by UnityPoint’s corporate office for accuracy, that will detail efforts to address systemic problems and care-provider issues, as well as proposed improvements to the care of injured patients.
Among the specific issues the hospital now has to address:
— Patient care issues reviewed: The bureau alleges the hospital has not staged well-attended multidisciplinary trauma peer review committee meetings, preventing the review of issues and problems related to patient care. Going forward, the committee must meet regularly, with the trauma resuscitation medical staff in attendance, to review potential problems and any proposed improvements to the care of the injured. In addition, each member of the hospital’s group of general surgeons must attend at least half of the committee meetings.
— Timely case evaluations: The hospital failed to adhere to standards that call for “concurrent trauma registries” — a process of case review that’s intended to ensure at least 80% of patient records are completed within 60 days of a patient’s discharge. Compliance with this standard is considered crucial to patient safety because it allows for the timely identification and correction of any problems that occur during active treatment. While the standard is for 80% of all cases to be completed, the Sioux City hospital’s concurrency rate was only 29% from July 2024 to June 2025, the bureau alleges.
The consent agreement between the hospital and the bureau states that if the hospital does not have the ability to fully resolve its deficiencies, it can apply for a downgraded Level IV status. If that happens, the hospital must notify ambulance services and the trauma coordinators at other hospitals so patients can be directed elsewhere if need be.
The agreement also stipulates that the department can revoke probation and require the hospital to seek Level IV certification at any time during the 2025-26 probation period.

Eric Bassler announced Thursday that he is opposed to redrawing Indiana’s congressional districts.,"Sen. Eric Bassler, R-Washington, speaks during the 2025 legislative session. (Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Republican state Sen. Eric Bassler announced Thursday that he is opposed to redrawing Indiana’s congressional districts.
Bassler, R-Washington, is the seventh Senate Republican to publicly come out against the push initiated by President Donald Trump for redistricting in Indiana and other GOP-led states.
Thirteen Republican senators have come out in support, but half of the 40-member caucus haven’t made their stances known publicly.


The following GOP senators have come out in opposition to redistricting:
Sen. Eric Bassler
Sen. Vaneta Becker
Sen. Spencer Deery
Sen. Sue Glick
Sen. Jean Leising
Sen. Jim Tomes
Sen. Greg Walker


“I cannot support any mid-census redistricting plan,” Bassler said in an emailed statement. “Four years ago, my Republican colleagues and I voted for our current state and federal legislative maps. I stand by that vote and I will not support legislation to change our congressional maps.”
Bassler announced in July that he wouldn’t seek reelection in 2026 and leave the Legislature after 12 years from his rural southwestern Indiana district.
Indiana lawmakers are scheduled to meet starting Dec. 1 to consider drawing more Republican-leaning U.S. House districts ahead of next year’s midterm elections — following a months-long pressure campaign by Trump’s administration and his supporters.
Senate Republican leadership has said they do not yet have enough votes to pass a redistricting bill. Any new maps would need a majority of 26 senators or 25 with Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith breaking a tie in support.
Enough House Republicans are believed to be supportive of a redistricting effort for it to win passage in that chamber.
Democratic legislators — who are too few in number to even delay a redistricting bill — have been unanimous in opposition.
Redistricting supporters want Indiana lawmakers to craft a map with all nine Indiana congressional districts favoring Republicans based on 2020 census data. The current split is 7-2 in favor of the GOP.
Undecided senators have become the target of advertising campaigns, including digital, cellphone, television and mail ads from pro-redistricting groups.

Vice Chief Justice Dana Kuehn, writing for the court’s 7-2 majority, found that serving as an agency head and as a gubernatorial Cabinet secretary does not violate a state law that bars dual office holding.
The ruling nullifies a 2024 opinion issued by Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond, who had contended.
that Cabinet secretaries are not exempt from the state’s prohibition against dual office holding. The opinion had the force of law until a court determined otherwise.
Gov. Kevin Stitt and three of his Cabinet officials sued, arguing that Drummond had misinterpreted the law. They filed suit in district court and lost. They appealed it to the Oklahoma Supreme Court.
Drummond’s opinion caused Transportation Secretary Tim Gatz to resign as Cabinet secretary. He also vacated his post as head of the Oklahoma Turnpike Authority, but remained as head of the Oklahoma Department of Transportation after being reappointed.

Lt. Gov. Matt Pinnell resigned as Stitt’s secretary of workforce development.
After the opinion, Stitt renamed his cabinet secretaries advisors.
Stitt praised the high court’s decision.
“For four decades, Oklahoma governors have been able to pick their Cabinet members, plain and simple,” Stitt said in a press release. “I set out to make government more efficient, and two people doing one job makes no sense.”
He said Drummond wasted taxpayer dollars to pursue a politically motivated vendetta and grab campaign headlines.
Drummond, who is running for governor, routinely spars with Stitt on policy and legal issues.
“We appreciate the Oklahoma Supreme Court providing clarity to this issue,” said Leslie Berger, a Drummond spokesperson. “With such ambiguity resolved, cabinet secretaries no longer need to fear that their service could be challenged as violating the dual office-holding provision.”

Sterling College, an experiential college in the Orleans County town of Craftsbury, announced on Thursday it would be ending its academic programs after the upcoming spring semester, becoming the latest in a string of transitions and closures at small colleges.
The college’s decision to end programming was made “in the face of persistent financial and enrollment challenges,” according to a statement posted to the college’s website. The school’s final commencement ceremony will be held in May 2026.
The tiny college in the Northeast Kingdom has provided environmentally focused education for more than 65 years, focusing its courses on advancing ecological stewardship. The school’s enrollment was capped at 125 students, but for several years fewer than 100 students enrolled at the school.
“We understand that this news is difficult and deeply personal for every member of our community,” the college’s statement reads. “Sterling College has always been more than a place of learning; it has been a home where curiosity, creativity, and compassion thrived.”
The college said it will ensure students enrolled at the college will have a path to completing their degree or to transfer to another college or university, according to their press release. 
“Right now, we’re totally focused on seeing students through the spring and getting as many finished as we can by mid summer, maybe August,” Scott Thomas, the college’s president, said in an interview. “That’s our singular focus.”
The school in its statement said that partner institutions including Champlain College and Community College of Vermont have agreed to accept transfer credits and financial aid packages “without requiring the regular application process,” pending approval of the New England Commission of Higher Education.
While the college is ending its degree programs in the spring, Hannah Rushing, the school’s director of advancement, said the school will remain fully accredited through the summer in order to run summer internships.
What that future looks like is unclear. 
Allison Hooper, the chair of the college’s board of trustees and co-founder of Vermont Creamery, said in a press release that ending degree programs “provides the most responsible way to honor Sterling’s commitments to its students, faculty, and staff while preserving its values and legacy.”
 Thomas, the president, said the college’s board of trustees will determine how to steward the college’s remaining resources. 
“How that manifests itself? I don’t think now is the time to say,” Thomas said, “but let’s just say we’ve been a plucky little institution for more than 65 years.” 
“I don’t know what’s next, but there will be resources remaining,” he went on. “We do have a very clear mission, and we do have a fantastic board, so we’ll see what happens at that point.”
He added that “the community is going to figure prominently in whatever evolves here.”
Sterling College’s announcement comes as similar challenges have weighed on Vermont’s higher education institutions. A number of schools that have closed in recent years faced similar declines in enrollment, including Green Mountain College in Poultney, the College of St. Joseph in Rutland and Goddard College in Plainfield. The Vermont College of Fine Arts in Montpelier did not close but ended all its on-campus programming. 
Broader demographic challenges are playing a role in that, Thomas said. Small schools like Sterling College have meanwhile faced competition from larger public institutions, and from institutions with large online course offerings.
“The reality is that mission-driven education like Sterling and financial sustainability are often at odds,” he said. “I see that at Sterling, and we’ve seen that across the other small colleges that have closed across the state.”
Sterling College, in its statement, said its “spirit and legacy” would live on through “the hundreds of alumni, faculty, staff, and partners who carry forward its mission and values in their work and communities.”
“The legacy of Sterling’s commitment to sustainability, community, and hands-on learning will continue to inspire generations to come,” the statement reads.

(Photo by Jamie Kelter Davis/Getty Images)U.S. Rep. Tim Moore of North Carolina said Thursday he was in support of U.S. Border Patrol reportedly planning operations in Charlotte, drawing a stark contrast to local elected officials who have pointed to “fear and uncertainty” among immigrants.
Moore, a Republican who represents parts of Charlotte and Mecklenburg County, said his office had reached out to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for further information on the reported operation.
“I’m glad that they’re looking at doing that, and I’m glad at the way they’re approaching it,” Moore told reporters in Raleigh.
If the agency does deploy in the city, Moore predicted they would likely stay “for a while” and focus on organized crime and high-profile targets. That would largely be a departure from Border Patrol’s month-long Chicago campaign, which has involved street sweeps and resulted in mass arrests, including of hundreds who a judge says were wrongfully detained. The operation has prompted widespread protests and multiple court interventions.
Moore said he didn’t expect operations in Charlotte, if they do take place, to encounter such resistance.
“You may have some of that, but Charlotte is not Chicago,” Moore said. “I don’t think there will be an appetite for that. I don’t think there will be patience for folks who get out there and violate the law themselves, interfering with a valid law enforcement activity.”
CBS first reported this week that the agency is planning to move agents into Charlotte and New Orleans. Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden confirmed Thursday afternoon that agents would start as soon as this weekend.
U.S. Customs and Border Patrol has said it doesn’t comment on future plans or operations. Mayor Vi Lyles said Wednesday she was aware of the reports and that Charlotte was “committed to following the law and to protecting the rights of all people who call our city home.”
The office of U.S. Rep. Alma Adams, a Democrat who represents much of Charlotte, did not respond to a request for comment Thursday. The congresswoman’s public social media accounts have not posted about the reported operations as of Thursday afternoon.
And state Rep. Carla Cunningham (D-Mecklenburg), in a brief interview with NC Newsline, said the report of the CBP operations “hasn’t been verified.” McFadden issued his statement confirming the agency’s plan later Thursday.
“I’m going to be keeping my eyes on my own safety for right now,” Cunningham said, when asked for her reaction to the reported plans.
Cunningham has said she received threats after breaking with her Democratic colleagues to support state efforts to crack down on immigration enforcement. During a July vote to require local law enforcement to cooperate with ICE, she said in a floor speech that immigrants “must assimilate” and “adapt to the culture they wish to live in.”

Other leaders in Charlotte see that issue differently.
In a joint statement released Tuesday, a group of Charlotte-area officials said that local and state law enforcement do not control, direct or participate in federal operations. And the group, including council members, Democratic state lawmakers and a school board member, pledged to support the city’s immigrant communities.
“We still stand together, look out for one another, and ensure that fear never divides the city we all call home,” the group said.
McFadden, the county sheriff, has previously had public disagreements with federal immigration officials about their operations in the region. In his Thursday statement, he said he had been contacted by federal agents Wednesday afternoon and his office was not asked to assist with or participate in enforcement.
Stein told reporters Wednesday that if he had “absolute confidence” in immigration officials’ plan to “go and find violent dangerous drug traffickers and criminals,” then the city would “welcome them with open arms,” the Charlotte Observer reported. But the governor emphasized that “we don’t know what their plans are.”
“If they come in and they are targeted in what they do, we will thank them,” Stein said. “If they come in and wreak havoc and cause chaos and fear, we will be very concerned.”
Stein’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.
Charlotte, Mecklenburg County have been flashpoint for political disagreements on law enforcement
Even prior to reported federal immigration operations, Charlotte has emerged as the epicenter of already intense debates on how North Carolina should address both illegal immigration and violent crime.
The killing of Ukrainian immigrant Iryna Zarutska on the city’s light rail system sparked fury and frustration from state lawmakers, who convened to pass a new law changing criminal justice procedures.  The state House Speaker has said he’s closely tracking violent crime in Charlotte. And a trio of Republican congressmen — U.S. Reps. Mark Harris, Pat Harrigan and Chuck Edwards — urged Gov. Josh Stein to deploy the National Guard in the city.
Moore said Thursday he had been approached by U.S. Rep. Mark Harris to sign that letter, but had declined.
The scrutiny on violent crime, Moore said, should be focused primarily on magistrate judges rather than local law enforcement. And he praised the district attorney, Democrat Spencer Merriweather, calling him a “good prosecutor.”

“There’s not a shortage of law enforcement, nor is there a situation where law enforcement is … turning a blind eye, and not trying to deal with criminals,” Moore said.
The city and its surrounding county have also faced criticism from Republicans aiming to clamp down on immigration enforcement. A law passed earlier this year sought to close “loopholes” in ICE detainer cases that GOP lawmakers accused several sheriffs, including in Mecklenburg County, of utilizing.
Moore, who led the House as Speaker when an earlier law dealing with detainer cases was passed, acknowledged that there was “some frustration” with the sheriff’s department on immigration enforcement.
“He’s told me what his position is, and we just have a disagreement of opinion on it,” Moore said. “Hopefully he will see the error of that as more and more crimes, more and more things are being brought to the surface about what’s happening.”

Byrd U.S. Courthouse in Charleston, West Virginia, on Wednesday, Nov. 12, 2025. (Photo courtesy of the West Virginia Office of Gov. Patrick Morrisey)Gov. Patrick Morrisey presented at an energy summit in downtown Charleston, West Virginia, on Thursday, where he praised numerous power-related projects that are either underway or soon to be coming in the Mountain State.
The announcements included the construction of a new natural gas power plant in Harrison County, the expansion of an existing power company in Hancock County and the creation of new gas compression-related manufacturing jobs in Weirton.
Morrisey said the investments for these projects total more than $4 billion from private companies. He called the projects — several of which had already been previously announced — crucial for West Virginia to ensure that energy remains a dominant but diverse market.
He also said that residents should expect to hear more updates on different, soon-to-come projects and developments “over the next 30 to 60 days.”
“We’ve been a little busy, but there’s going to be more,” Morrisey said. “We had a number of projects we were working to get announced by today but, you know, you can’t control the timing of really big announcements coming.”
While he celebrated the potential for increased energy production and jobs, Morrisey did not give much mention to environmental risks or concerns about such developments. More in-depth details for several of the projects were not shared on Thursday.
Morrisey said, under his leadership, residents should trust him when he says something is going to be built and that such announcements are not just “hot air.”
“I don’t announce things unless they’re going to happen. I want you guys to get used to that,” Morrisey said. “Everything we’re doing is highly vetted, and it’s going to continue. Our energy plan is no longer aspirational. It’s very realistic.”
His comments alluded to his gubernatorial predecessor, now-U.S. Senator Jim Justice, R-W.Va. As governor, Justice oversaw and heralded several large economic announcements for the state that often ended on lackluster terms — if they came to fruition at all.
In 2020 he celebrated recruiting Virgin Hyperloop to build its new Hyperloop Certification Center on about 800 acres between Tucker and Grant counties. The project was supposed to start in 2021, and would have allegedly employed thousands while contributing millions to the state economy, officials said. But the project never actually broke ground and likely never will.
In 2022 Justice lauded GreenPower Motor Company for signing an agreement with the state to open a manufacturing plant in South Charleston for the creation of zero-emission school buses. He said the company could bring up to 200 jobs for the area when it first opened and up to 900 in the future. Earlier this year — after both challenges between the state and the company as well as increased tariffs under President Donald Trump — the company began layoffs and halted production of the electric buses. Google lists the South Charleston facility as permanently closed. At the time of the layoffs, fewer than 100 people worked at the facility and only a fraction of the buses it promised the state had actually been produced.
In July of 2024, Justice announced a $150 million investment — including $50 million from the state — to help keep 600 people employed and reopen operations at the previously idled tin plant in Weirton. The facility was set to reopen and produce electrical transformers. Less than a year later, in May 2025, Cleveland-Cliffs pulled out of the deal. 
He also spearheaded work to reopen the Pleasants Power Plant; now, per the Charleston Gazette-Mail, court filings show state leaders were potentially misled out of $50 million in funds for retrofitting the station.
On Thursday, Morrisey was clear that he wants to see everything he announces actually come to fruition. Ensuring they do, he said, is crucial to West Virginia staying competitive economically, but specifically in the energy industry.
“Big things are coming to West Virginia and the announcements will come when I can look you in the eye and tell you, ‘This is real. It’s not fake.’ We’re done with all that nonsense. Done,” Morrisey said. “I want everyone across the globe to know West Virginia is becoming the energy powerhouse of America.”
Specific project announcements from Thursday’s address include:

$1.44 billion to extend the lives of existing coal plants. The state has partnered with major utility companies to keep six coal-fired power plants — among the dirtiest forms of energy — operating for up to 20 additional years. Doing so, Morrisey said, will save 10.5 gigawatts of generating capacity. Low-interest loans will be made available through the U.S. Department of Energy to help with the project.
$1.2 billion invested in a natural gas-fired power plant in Harrison County, which will be operated through a joint venture of private companies Kindle Energy, GE Vernova and Blackstone. Morrisey said the project will add 625 additional megawatts of power generation capacity to the grid and create 805 construction jobs. No state funds have been required for the project, he said.
$400 million investment from Ergon, Inc., a family-owned energy company in Hancock county. The company will be expanding its business to create 25 new jobs and will become the first company to partake in the state’s new PowerTech workforce training program.
$7 million investment from Bidell Gas Compression, in Weirton, to expand its existing facility and add up to 80 new manufacturing jobs. The state, Morrisey said, will be giving a $1 million “performance-based” loan to support the project.
Morrisey also celebrated several projects that had been previously announced, including $70 million from Diversified Energy to plug its own uncapped gas wells and a project from FirstEnergy for a new 1.2 gigawatt natural gas-fired power plant.

The state's infant mortality rate improved in 2024 from 2023, but still remains higher than the national rate, Harris said Thursday. (Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)Alabama’s infant mortality rate improved in 2024 but remains above the national average, according to data released Thursday by the Alabama Department of Public Health.
State Health Officer Dr. Scott Harris said Thursday that the state’s infant mortality rate was 7.1 babies per 1,000 live births in 2024, reflecting the rate of infants who died within their first year of life. That was down from 7.8 deaths per 1,000 births in 2023, he said.
“We care a whole lot about infant mortality, because we care about infants, and we want to ensure that they’re healthy and that they survive,” Harris said. “Infant mortality is a really interesting statistic in that there are so many different factors that go into producing your infant mortality statistic. It’s a great number to sort of describe the overall health of your society.”
There were 414 infant deaths in 2024, Harris said. Of those, 222 of the deaths were white babies and 176 were Black babies, the lowest recorded number for Black infants, he said.

But infant mortality rates for Black Alabamians remain disproportionately high. The infant mortality rate among white Alabamians was 5.4 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2024. For Black Alabamians, the rate was 11.8 per 1,000. In 2023, the rates were 5.7 and 13.1 deaths per 1,000 births, respectively. 
“This has, unfortunately, been the story for a long time,” Harris said. “We continue to have quite a disparity.”
Nearly 75% of babies born in Alabama are to white mothers, he said.
The nation’s infant mortality average is 5.5 deaths per 1,000 live births, Harris said. However, the state matches the nation’s trend since 1970.
Alabama, U.S. infant mortality 1970-2024. (Data from Alabama Department of Public Health)
In 1970, about 20 babies died per 1,000 births nationwide and about 24.5 died in Alabama. The rate started to descend after the implementation of Neonatal Intensive Care Units in the 1960s. In the late 1980s, Medicaid coverage was extended to pregnant women, which Harris said also contributed to the nationwide decline of infant deaths.
“If you have moms that are in good health, their babies are just likely to do better. If you have moms with cardiovascular disease and diabetes and those things that babies tend not to do as well,” Harris said.
In addition to mothers being healthy, adequate prenatal care is essential for a baby’s survival, Harris said. In 2024, 73.9% of all live births had what ADPH considers adequate prenatal care, depending on how many times a mother visits her OB/GYN. The statistic has been steady for the last 10 years, according to the data, with the lowest at 73.3% in 2019 and 2020 and the highest at 75.3% in 2015.
However, Harris said the percentage of live births with no prenatal care has been increasing since 2021. In 2024, 3.1% of live births in Alabama had no prenatal care. In 2019, 1.9% of babies did not receive prenatal care. The percentage steadily rose to 2.6% in 2020, then dipped to 2.2% in 2021 when more people qualified for Medicaid during the COVID-19 pandemic.
“With the Medicaid unwinding and other changes, that number has increased, unfortunately,” Harris said. “The number of moms getting adequate care stays the same, the number of moms getting no care, however, is going in the wrong direction.”

Risk factors and causes of death

The top five causes of infant deaths are congenital abnormalities, preterm births, sepsis, unintentional injuries and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), according to the data. SIDS fell two spots in cause of death from 2023, which Harris attributed to education and promotion of safe sleeping habits. 
Safe sleeping, Harris said, includes babies sleeping alone, on their back and in a crib. 
“What most people think is that most of those are probably airway related injuries, so maybe smothering,” Harris said in an interview after the meeting. “You do tend to see SIDS in unsafe sleep environments.”
Many things can contribute to infant mortality, like maternal age, smoking and chronic disease; preterm birth, low birth weight and congenital abnormalities. A mother’s income, race, level of education and ZIP code impact her baby’s chance of survival, according to the data. These factors also impact a mother’s access to health care. 
According to the data, the infant mortality rate is much higher in rural counties like Wilcox, Butler, Conecuh and Hale in the Black Belt, and Cherokee County in the northern part of the state. Those counties directly correlate with counties without hospitals that can deliver babies, according to the data.
According to the University of North Carolina’s Sheps Center, nine rural hospitals have closed in Alabama since 2009. Only 30% of the state’s rural hospitals have labor and delivery units, leaving many expectant parents to drive long distances for care.

“When you look at the state as a whole, whether or not you have a delivery hospital is not correlated with an increase in mortality,” Harris said. “It still doesn’t strike me as a coincidence that our highest county rates don’t have delivery services.”
ADPH has nine programs related to infant mortality: Safe Sleep initiatives; Well Woman; family planning services; newborn screening; sexually transmitted infection/disease diagnosis and treatment; Women, Infant and Children (WIC) program; Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP); Fetal and Infant Mortality Review; and Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System.
While ADPH can educate mothers on prenatal care, safe sleeping and encouraging no smoking while pregnant, the social and economic factors are harder to control, Harris said.
“We don’t necessarily have the tools in public health to address these differences by race, low income, access to health care, whether you have a provider,” Harris said. “We think people benefit by having a provider that they can have a relationship with and talk to and learn from and be educated.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_1188-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-13 15:57:13.544526

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)CRAWFORDVILLE — Florida became the first state to adopt The Phoenix Declaration, a product of The Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank that formulated the Project 2025 plan for Donald Trump’s second term. 
During a state Board of Education meeting Thursday in Wakulla County, members unanimously supported the declaration, which has been individually endorsed by board Chair Ryan Petty and University of West Florida interim president and former education commissioner Manny Diaz Jr.
The paragraphs-long statement says, “America’s schools must work alongside parents to prepare children for the responsibilities of adulthood, including their familial and civic responsibilities, by cultivating excellence in mind and heart.”
“Information without moral formation is insufficient. Parents, schools, and religions and civic institutions must cultivate in children the personal and civic virtues necessary for self-government,” the statement says. 
The declaration has seven categories: Parental choice and responsibility; transparency and accountability; truth and goodness; cultural transmission; character formation; academic excellence; and citizenship. 
“These principles are principles that everyone across the board, on both sides of the aisle, can agree with. So, I’m excited to push this forward through the state Board of Education as a framework to continue to talk about what this board’s mission is for education,” Education Commissioner Anastasios Kamoutsas said.

The Heritage Foundation’s drafting committee for the statement included Erika Donalds, wife of U.S. Rep. and candidate for governor Byron Donalds, and Adam Kissel, a West Virginia resident and controversial appointee to the University of West Florida Board of Trustees. 
While a number of foundations and institutes have signed on, no state boards of education had signed on to it until Thursday.
The board passed it as a resolution, designed to show the public where the board stands. 
“We have got to transmit the knowledge of our history, warts and all, to future generations. America is not perfect, but you cannot point to another society in the history of mankind that is more perfect than the United States of America,” Petty said during the meeting.
Petty sees the declaration as a baseline, he said.
“It’s an imperfect society, occupied by imperfect human beings. We don’t agree on very much, it seems like we agree on less and less everyday, which is why we have to have some core principles we can rally around. We can argue over how to accomplish something, but if we can’t agree on what we’re trying to accomplish, we’re headed for disaster as a country,” Petty said.










“Schools should also foster a healthy sense of patriotism and cultivate gratitude for and attachment to our country and all who serve its central institutions. Our shared civic rituals, such as the Pledge of Allegiance and national anthem, should be respected and revived. Students should develop a deep understanding of and respect for our nation’s founding documents and the ideas they contain about ordered liberty, justice, the rule of law, limited government, natural rights, and the equal dignity of all human beings. Students should learn the whole truth about America — its merits and failings — without obscuring that America is a great source of good in the world and that we have a tradition that is worth passing on.”


– Excerpt from The Phoenix Declaration


The Heritage Foundation introduced the statement during the Conservative Vision of Education Conference in Phoenix in February. 
“Like the mythical phoenix rising from the ashes of its former self, we envision an education system that emerges stronger and more vibrant, building upon our nation’s foundational values while meeting the challenges of today,” Jason Bedrick, an education research fellow for Heritage who chaired the declaration’s drafting committee, said in announcing the document. 
Tiffany Justice, a Floridian and co-founder of Moms for Liberty, and Scott Yenor, a professor at Boise State University and dissuaded appointee for the UWF Board of Trustees, have also signed on to the declaration. 
The Florida Education Association and some public commenters at the meeting were not supportive of the board’s action.
“The Phoenix Declaration is the latest thinly veiled attempt by billionaire-backed special interests to dismantle and politicize Florida’s public education system,” the FEA claimed in a statement following the board vote. 
“Instead of chasing ideological agendas, the State Board of Education members should focus on what truly helps students: making sure public schools are fully funded, addressing the critical teacher and staff shortage, and guaranteeing that every child has access to a strong, neighborhood public school,” the FEA wrote. 
“Florida’s students and families deserve investment in their public schools, not a political pledge written by outside groups,” the FEA concluded.

(Photo by Kristine Sowl/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)Three tribal governments and several environmental groups sued the Trump administration on Wednesday to try to block a land trade that would allow a road to be built through a national wildlife refuge in southwestern Alaska.
The land swap, approved by the U.S. Department of the Interior last month, would open up a section of the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge.
Supporters argue that the road is needed to connect the community of King Cove, home to about 750 people, with a legacy military airstrip that can accommodate jets. That would give King Cove’s residents access to safer medical evacuations if needed. Opponents say the proposed road — to run 18.9 miles in total, most of that within what is currently refuge land — would damage world-class bird habitat that is in the heart of the refuge.
Wednesday’s challenges came in three lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court in Anchorage. All assert that the land trade and road development pose dire threats to migratory bird populations that use Izembek’s wetlands, including species with Endangered Species Act listings, and to the wider ecosystem. All say the trade and planned road violate the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act and other federal laws.
The three lawsuits have their individual characteristics as well.
One of them, filed by tribal governments in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta villages, focuses on threats to traditional subsistence hunters who depend on the birds that use Izembek’s wetlands. The tribal plaintiffs are the Native Village of Paimiut, Native Village of Hooper Bay and Chevak Native Village.
“Izembek’s eelgrass wetlands are a lifeline for emperor geese, black brant and other birds that feed our families and connect us to Indigenous relatives across the Pacific,” Angutekaraq Estelle Thomson, traditional council president of the Native Village of Paimiut, said in a statement. “Trading away this globally important refuge for a commercial corridor devalues our lives and our children’s future. We are joining this lawsuit because defending Izembek is inseparable from defending our subsistence rights, our food security and our ability to remain Yup’ik on our own lands.”
The Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental organization, is also a plaintiff in the case.
A second lawsuit, filed by Friends of Alaska National Wildlife Refuges, Wilderness Watch, the Alaska Wilderness League and the Sierra Club, puts a special focus on the process used to achieve the land swap and what it may mean for all wildlife refuges.

	“Trading the ownership of refuge lands that Congress designated for conservation is a terrible precedent for the privatization of public lands. Building a road will have tremendous impacts on fish and wildlife habitat and could also greatly increase both disturbance and sport hunting pressure on vulnerable species,” Marilyn Sigman, president of Friends of Alaska National Wildlife Refuges, said in a statement.
The third complaint, filed by Defenders of Wildlife, puts a focus on the wider environmental impacts.
The planned road enabled by the land trade would “result in incalculable and irreversible damage” to myriad wildlife species, including marine and land mammals as well as migratory birds, that lawsuit says. The lawsuit alleges that the land deal violates both the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act and the federal Wilderness Act.
“Under the Trump administration, the Interior Secretary entered into an illegal deal done in the darkness of a government shutdown: a sellout of one of our country’s largest and most pristine wildlife refuges and wilderness areas,” Jane Davenport, a senior attorney in Defenders of Wildlife’s Biodiversity Law Center, said in a statement. “Our treasured public conservation lands belong to all Americans. Defenders of Wildlife will stand up in court to hold this administration to account for recklessly and unlawfully trading them away.” 
The Izembek Lagoon area, where the road is planned, holds the largest single stand of eelgrass in the world and the largest bed of seagrass along the North American Pacific Coast, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The entire Pacific population of black brant, a type of goose, uses the refuge’s lagoon area, feeding on the eelgrass. The refuge and its eelgrass support several other bird and mammal species; about half the world’s emperor geese use the refuge as a migratory stopover, according to biologists.
A Department of the Interior spokesperson declined to comment Wednesday on the lawsuits.
Last month, however, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum touted the land exchange and planned road as long overdue.
He spoke about the project during an event called “Alaska Day,” a gathering in Washington with Gov. Mike Dunleavy and the state’s three-member congressional delegation. The Izembek land exchange was one of the pro-development Alaska actions announced at the event.
“It just seems preposterous to me that somehow, it’s taken 40 years for us to put people first,” Burgum said at the event. “Because I know one thing as a governor of a state: You can actually do things like build 18 miles of gravel road and still take great care of wildlife.” Burgum was North Dakota’s governor before being appointed as Interior secretary.
The land trade he approved would convey a little less than 500 acres of refuge land, most of it designated wilderness, to the Native-owned King Cove Corp. The corporation would give 1,739 acres of its land to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to be added to the refuge, and the federal government would also pay the corporation for the land.
The idea of a road linking King Cove to the World War II-era military runway at Cold Bay dates back decades. The legal and political battle over the proposal has also been long. Some of the plaintiffs in the new cases were plaintiffs in previous lawsuits over proposed land trades. The dispute was being considered by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, but that court in 2023 determined that the case was moot and dismissed it because the Biden administration was not pursuing the plan endorsed by the first Trump administration.

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Gubernatorial candidate Hannah Pingree on Thursday released her plan for improving Maine’s housing crisis. 
Pingree released her five-point plan to bolster affordable housing in the state at a press conference at a recently redeveloped senior housing complex in Portland. Throughout her campaign, the Democrat has said housing should be a top priority for the next governor and organized a statewide tour with roundtable discussions and town hall meetings centered around the issue. 
“I’m running for governor with a bold plan to build more homes, make housing attainable, and ensure families, workers and seniors can stay in the communities they love,” Pingree said. “Housing is a fight worth taking on and I’m ready to get it done.”
As the former head of the state’s Office of Policy Innovation and the Future, Pingree oversaw the creation of two reports that detailed the state of housing in Maine. The 2023 Housing Production Needs Summary showed Maine is short about 84,000 homes, while the 2025 Housing Production Roadmap outlined steps Maine lawmakers could take to start tackling the problem. 
Pingree said if elected she would invest $100 million a year to finance new construction and preserve existing homes in the state. This would include the expansion of programs to support first-time homebuyers and middle-income housing. 
Under the plan, the state would also limit the homes being sold to out-of-state investors and corporate landlords. It also includes working with Maine’s Attorney General’s office to strengthen fair housing protections and go after predatory companies that fail to meet health and safety standards and exploit tenants. 
Building more homes faster
In order to expedite the construction of new homes, Pingree recommends streamlining the permitting and approval processes. In addition to simplifying applications, she said she would set a 90-day permit processing time limit for most new projects.
The plan also highlights the need to develop the workforce to build this new housing stock.
Pingree said she would commit to permanently funding Maine’s free community college system to facilitate that pathway into construction trades. The system is currently in limbo as the scholarship program was only funded enough in the biennium budget to provide free school through the graduating class of 2025, though legislators have said they intend to revisit that next session.
In addition, Pingree calls for investments to support 1,000 pre-apprenticeships with companies and unions. 
“Hannah understands housing policy at a depth few others do,” said Kevin Bunker, founder of Developers Collaborative, a real estate group focused on affordable housing and smart growth, in a statement provided by the campaign. “She’s preserved affordable units, pushed zoning reforms, and advanced investments that will shape Maine’s housing market for decades.”
Reducing homelessness
Another plank of Pingree’s housing plan is focused on addressing homelessness, and the candidate pledged to end veteran homelessness in her first year in office, if elected. While her plan didn’t outline details for that promise, it does call for expanding support for school and family housing programs to address student homelessness. 
The plan also recommends the implementation of  regional homelessness hubs that partner with municipal governments to meet the individual needs of each county of the state.
“Hannah Pingree gets it. She’s out there talking to the people building homes and the families trying to afford them,” said Rep. Traci Gere (D-Kennebunkport), who is chair of Legislature’s Housing and Economic Development Committee. “She knows this crisis won’t be solved from the top down — it’ll be solved by Mainers working together, and she’s leading that charge.”

The program is also on track to approve additional licenses, with the number of active patients now at 33,314, tracking toward the 35,000 threshold. The law allows the commission to issue additional dispensing licenses after each increase of 10,000 patients after the 25,000 marker.
But despite some progress, the public comment period was dominated by urgent and frustrated statements from speakers who said the program’s framework is restrictive and limits access and effectiveness. The main complaints focused on product limitations and strict qualifying conditions, with patients, advocates and other members of the public calling for changes that would require legislative action.
Georgia’s program, which was created a decade ago, limits participation to patients with certain conditions, including cancer or seizure disorders. But for several of the conditions, state law requires the diagnosis to be severe or end stage. 
Lawmakers have considered expanding the program in recent years, and a House study panel is currently examining Georgia’s medical marijuana policies. 
Dr. Elmore Alexander, a medical director with U.S. 420 Doc, an online service providing medical cannabis card evaluations, said Georgia’s low-THC oil program lacks the necessary delivery methods to adequately treat patients with complex conditions. The program is “not a compassionate program,” he said, and currently prohibited methods, such as smoke inhalation, could help patients with conditions with sudden onset of symptoms like post-traumatic stress disorder.
“I don’t have enough products to take care of [my patients]. I don’t have enough,” Alexander said, arguing that the state needs to expand the program to include a greater variety of products that address different conditions.
Several speakers, including former Rep. Micah Gravley, a key figure in passing the Georgia medical cannabis law, called for removing the “severe and end-stage” caveats currently attached to many qualifying conditions. They argued that these vague terms create confusion for doctors because they aren’t medically based and prevent patients from accessing treatment before their conditions become terminal.
Gravley, who said he supports the state expanding the program, said the program’s limited scope was due to a lack of industry knowledge among lawmakers at the time the law passed.
“I think you had a lot of legislators who were very cautious, very nervous about doing this, and really saw the tone and tenor of parents who were bringing their children down, caregivers were giving testimonials about family members, and so they went out on a limb. Unfortunately, during that time, the limb was too short,” Gravley said.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/1000048932-scaled-e1763063844892-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-11-13 15:57:13.544526

Mackey did not say what kinds of questions board members had. The last time social studies textbooks were updated was in 2013 while arts education textbooks were last updated in 2017.

(Courtesy of the Utah Office of Homeless Services)Utah’s Gov. Spencer Cox is defending a plan hatched in conjunction with legislative leaders and the Utah Homeless Services Board and recently pitched to the Health and Human Services Interim Committee of the legislature. The plan provides both voluntary and involuntary housing for Salt Lake’s homeless in a 1,300-bed facility in “rural” northwest Salt Lake City. The proposal is early in the planning stages, and currently lacking funding.
Funding could ultimately prove to be prohibitive, since the project in effect amounts to a second state mental hospital, a large new substance treatment facility, and a vast new temporary shelter for the homeless folks with an affordable housing problem.
The State of Utah is trying to take up President Donald Trump’s advice to clean up criminal homelessness by removing folks from the streets, where they are doing drugs, committing crime, and engaging in “urban camping and loitering, and urban squatting.” The president’s executive order on the subject mentions “shifting homeless individuals into long-term institutional settings for humane treatment through the appropriate use of civil commitment,” but then refers to those placed there as “detainees,” using the nomenclature assigned to south-of-the-border arrestees currently being prepared for deportation out of our cities.
Is the president’s shining new program just a localized deportation program where due process and actual evidence of crime or mental illness may also be lacking? Maybe, maybe not. The president and the governor want “accountability,” but as with brown-skinned arrivals in America, they may want to make criminal judgments before due process is actually rendered.
Is the governor right in saying Utah has failed its duty to homeless citizens? Manifestly, yes. Is Utah right to go back to the days when the nation used involuntary commitment to inpatient mental health facilities to house aimless, mentally ill and unemployed people? Possibly so. Is the federal government approach a return to “one size fits all” national programming that leaves states without funding for programs that don’t present the right-sized shoe? It seems so. It is hard to miss the fact that the White House is driving this reform effort, rather than the people, professionals, and representatives of the state of Utah.
Homelessness is produced when a nation slides into slow-moving or quick-moving socio-economic decline. A number of social forces led to mental health deinstitutionalization beginning in the 1950s that kicked off the homelessness problem, including criticisms of public mental hospitals and a desire to give the mentally ill more connection with the mentally healthy community. Soon enough, America’s liberalized divorce laws scattered family members to the four winds, as did excesses in alcohol, tobacco, legal and illegal drugs, sports, porn and gambling, steeply declining standardized test scores in the school system, and our obsessive spending of money we have not yet earned.
America is not the first modern nation to experience rapid decline, however. World War I, the Russian Revolution, a famine, and a civil war combined within a space of five years to produce some seven million Russian homeless youths, who hastened the demise of the already deeply flawed new communist system there. India’s “untouchable” homeless class resulted from that ancient civilization’s hard turn away from democracy to unfeeling, unthinking oligarchy and aristocracy.
We did things differently in this country, at least in the beginning. Once our own founders secured their freedom, the first thing they did was mandate public education in law and classical political history, so citizens could understand the responsibilities attached to the wonderful rights of speech, press, voting, and religious freedom they had just won. Today, the lack of civics education even for the upper class has gotten the luxury-housed into the violent political mess we are in today. Maybe civics education could be a rehabilitating force for the homeless as well as the upper crust.
In spite of our sparkling new public education system, in the early decades of our country, shaky immigrant families often fractured in places like New York City, where they got off the boat. The governments, churches, and stable families of the nation noticed the problem and provided a solution by placing disorderly and orphaned children into farming families in far-away Ohio, who raised them as one of their own. Something similar happened when criminals were shipped off to the colonies by England during the 200 years before the Revolution. Communities took them in, taught them, and showed them how democracy was done. They integrated them into local communities where they had rights and responsibilities from the get-go.
Does America any longer have citizens willing to open the front door to the unhoused, undisciplined, unhealthy, and unenfranchised untouchables of our own society? Today we are furiously converting our population over to assigned places in either the lower- and middle-class commoner realm or the ornate, holier-than-thou, centi-millionaire and billionaire class. How are we going to fix that great impediment to republican progress?
Are we going to build a homeless encampment where folks can commune with each other on their own base level, stay removed from our hearts and minds, and be as far away from the East Bench, existing professional resources, and the newly secured Downtown Revitalization Zone as possible? Are we going to betray our promise to rehabilitate the unfortunate refuse of our insensate civilization? Money alone will not solve the problem, folks.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/resource-campus-rendering-1536x813-1-1024x542.webp,,,2025-11-13 15:57:13.544526

(File photo by Lauren McCauley/ Maine Morning Star)Redwood Materials officially started stripping cobalt, lithium, nickel and copper from used batteries it gathered over the past year at its new South Carolina facility.
The 600-acre campus in Berkeley County is the second new battery plant opened by the company founded in 2017 by a former Tesla executive. It follows the company’s first plant and headquarters in Nevada, which opened in 2019.
The $3.5 billion investment marks the largest single economic development project in South Carolina’s history.
Over the next year, Redwood’s South Carolina-based employees will gather 20,000 metric tons of lithium and other metals, eventually refining and remaking them into renewed battery components to sell back to U.S. battery manufacturers. That’s enough materials to build about 41,000 electric vehicle batteries, according to a company spokesperson.
Electric vehicle battery company halts construction of SC manufacturing plant

At full capacity, the factory is slated to produce enough to supply battery materials for more than a million electric vehicles, the company said when it first announced its plans in December 2022.
The company did not respond to questions from the SC Daily Gazette about how many people are working at the plant as part of this first phase or when it might ramp up its next round of hiring.
“We’ve now begun work on our second phase and will continue to ramp capacity over the next several years as additional facilities come online,” a statement reads.
Current job openings advertised include chemical, mechanical and automation engineers and a financial analyst.
Over the next decade, Redwood plans to hire a total of 1,500 workers for jobs paying some of the highest wages in Berkeley County — between $27 and $75 per hour.
South Carolina legislators approved a $226 million incentive package in December 2022 to pay for improvements to the property in the Camp Hall industrial park.
Redwood’s other campus in Nevada produced more than 60,000 metric tons of materials last year, which the company said put it on par with the largest U.S. source of nickel and made it the only domestic source of cobalt.
New lithium battery recycling plant planned for Chester County

By comparison, Eagle Mine on Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, the only operating nickel mine in the U.S., produced 17,000 tons of nickel in 2023, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The country imported 159,000 tons of the metal that year, largely from Canada.
Redwood calls the materials it plans to recycle the “backbone of our modern economy, powering everything from computers and smartphones to energy storage, defense systems, and AI data centers.”
“Yet today, the United States imports nearly all of these minerals, often from unstable regions or adversarial nations,” the company’s statement said.
Redwood is valued at $6 billion, according to Business Insider.
The U.S. Department of Energy had earmarked the company for a $2 billion loan under the Biden administration’s hallmark clean energy legislation, but Redwood walked away from the funding in fall 2024 in favor of privately raised money.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/EVcar-scaled-1-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-11-13 15:57:13.544526

Downtown Middletown restaurant marks its first anniversary with special events, live music, and community appreciation.
MIDDLETOWN, Del. — The Jackson House 302 is celebrating a major milestone this week — one year in business serving the Middletown community. The restaurant, known for its welcoming atmosphere, creative cocktails, and locally inspired dishes, kicked off its first-anniversary festivities with a ribbon-cutting ceremony on November 12, supported by a joint effort between the Middletown Area Chamber of Commerce and the New Castle County Chamber of Commerce.
The celebration marks a year of growth, creativity, and community connection for the locally owned restaurant, which has quickly become a centerpiece of Middletown’s dining scene.
“It’s been amazing and a lot of work,” said co-owner Hope Lopez. “We moved from Dover because we needed a bigger space for our loyal customers and to host events. We own four other restaurants, but Jackson House has been my baby. It’s something completely different for us, and the Middletown community has been fantastic.”
A Week of Celebration
The anniversary celebration began on November 10 with a weeklong slate of themed promotions designed to thank loyal guests and showcase the restaurant’s vibrant menu and hospitality. Each day offered something special — from signature cocktails to live music and giveaways.

Sunday, Nov. 10 – Lavender Elixir Day: Guests enjoyed 10% off Jackson House’s signature Lavender Elixir cocktail, one of the bar’s most popular drinks.
Monday, Nov. 11 – Pasta Lovers’ Night: The kitchen featured 15% off all pasta entrées, highlighting local favorites like house-made Alfredo and crab linguine.
Tuesday, Nov. 12 – Ribbon Cutting Event: The official one-year celebration featured door prizes, appetizers, drinks, cupcakes, a photo op, and more, with community members, staff, and local leaders in attendance.
Wednesday, Nov. 13 – Social Hour All Day: Guests enjoyed discounted drinks and appetizers throughout the day.
Thursday, Nov. 14 – Customer Appreciation Day: Loyal customers were invited to spin the prize wheel for a chance to win gift cards, free apps, cocktails, and other rewards.
Friday, Nov. 15 – Live Music Night: Local musicians performed in the evening, bringing energy and entertainment to the restaurant.
Saturday, Nov. 16 – Anniversary Brunch: The week wraps up with 15% off mimosas and specials on Jackson House’s famous brunch platter.

Community, Collaboration, and Celebration
At Tuesday’s ribbon cutting, members of both chambers praised the restaurant’s role in enriching the local dining scene and bringing people together.
“We’re here to celebrate the first anniversary of this amazing restaurant, Jackson House,” said Michelle Gramlich, CEO of the Middletown Area Chamber of Commerce. “It’s more than just a place to come to eat — it’s a place where our community comes together. Whether you’re coming for a date night, a meeting, or a celebration, you want to have it here. The food is phenomenal and the staff is incredible.”
The Jackson House 302 has become known for its blend of upscale yet approachable dining, creative cocktails, and community-centered events. For the Lopez family — who own several restaurants across Delaware — this location represents something new and deeply personal.
“I know we have magic here — we’ve created magic,” said Hope Lopez. “The Chef, Chamaigne Stone, and our manager and mixologist, Selena Alvarez — who’s also my daughter — have been amazing together.”
A Family Business with Heart
For co-owner Jose Lopez, the one-year milestone carries extra weight.
“Making it a year, really thriving, is a huge accomplishment, especially when you see what’s happening with some of our peers in this environment,” he said. “We owe it to our Chef, our amazing staff, and the community for making it happen.”
Lopez added that bringing The Jackson House to Middletown was a natural fit for both their family and the town’s growing downtown district.
“I feel like Middletown was ready for us,” he said. “They were asking for something like us to be here. You see a lot of chains, which are great, but there’s nothing like a local independent. You know, that unique flavor that only independents can bring.”
Looking Ahead
The ribbon cutting was not just a celebration of the past year, but also a reaffirmation of the restaurant’s long-term vision. The Jackson House team plans to continue expanding its local partnerships, hosting community events, and finding new ways to surprise guests with creative food and drinks.
The weeklong anniversary celebration continues through Saturday, November 16, culminating in a lively brunch that captures everything the restaurant has become known for — good food, good company, and genuine Delaware hospitality.
As it enters its second year, The Jackson House 302 stands as a testament to passion, teamwork, and the power of a shared vision — proving that with the right mix of creativity and community, a restaurant can become much more than a place to eat. It can become part of the neighborhood’s story.

So she wants voters to change the law, again.",Chris Lisinski,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/politics/public-records/dizoglios-effort-to-audit-the-legislature-remains-stalled-so-she-wants-voters-to-change-the-law-again/,"The nascent ballot question campaign seeking to subject the Legislature and the governor’s office to the public records law has a new leader: Auditor Diana DiZoglio, who views the measure as a way to circumvent opposition to her effort to audit the House and Senate.","AUDITOR DIANA DIZOGLIO has a new idea for how to overcome the constitutional arguments that have stalled her voter-backed probe of the House and Senate: Go back to the ballot again and ask to make legislative records open to the entire public. 
In recent months, DiZoglio has essentially taken over as the leader of the campaign behind a ballot question that would subject both the Legislature and the governor’s office to the state public records law. 
She’s using the same playbook as last year’s audit question — which explicitly authorized her office to examine the Legislature and won a landslide victory at the ballot box — pulling together transparency advocates from both the right and the left. DiZoglio is also putting plenty of her own muscle behind the measure, including a $150,000 donation from her campaign account.  
DiZoglio, who previously served in the House and Senate and clashed with top Democrats, did not shy away from linking the latest effort to her long-running audit fight. That effort remains stalled, and legislative leaders continue to argue that an audit by her office would violate the constitutional separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches.  
If the new measure is successful, DiZoglio said, House and Senate higher-ups will no longer have the same avenue of resistance. 
“The documents that I have requested for the audit are matters of public record in every other entity that actually follows the public records law,” DiZoglio told CommonWealth Beacon. “If [lawmakers] don’t want to give the documents to me, I’m just going to work to make sure that those documents are given to you all directly and will take out their bogus constitutional limitations.” 
Unlike the audit question two years ago, though, DiZoglio did not launch the latest campaign herself. 
The Coalition for Healthy Democracy, a transparency organization led by former gubernatorial candidate Danielle Allen, filed the records measure in August alongside another question that would replace the state’s partisan primary system with an all-party primary. 
DiZoglio quickly announced her support for the records reform. In the ensuing weeks, she said, organizers decided to “divide and conquer”: The auditor would lead that campaign, while the coalition would focus on the measure overhauling the state’s primary elections. 
Now, DiZoglio is again working with activists from across the political spectrum who are frustrated with the opaque way the Legislature’s Democratic supermajority operates, gathering signatures needed to move closer to the 2026 ballot, and visiting both Democratic and Republican town committee meetings to drum up support. 
DiZoglio in late October donated $150,000 from her auditor campaign account to the nascent ballot-question campaign, deploying most of her available cash on hand. MASSterList first reported about the donation last week.
“If it’s on the ballot, I am confident that the voters will approve it, but we just need to get this issue on the ballot,” she said. 
The Methuen Democrat described the records-reform measure as a natural continuation of her work to wrench open the curtains behind which Beacon Hill works. 
Last year, nearly 72 percent of voters approved the ballot measure giving DiZoglio’s office the power to investigate the House and Senate.  
Supporters of every ballot question must collect signatures from at least 74,574 registered voters and file them with local election officials by the end of the day on Wednesday, November 19.  
That requirement is a steep hurdle, and every cycle it typically culls the field of measures in play from several dozen to just a handful. DiZoglio said the campaign is “in a good spot” ahead of the deadline. 
Massachusetts and Michigan are the only two states where both the governor’s office and the Legislature claim not to be subjected to their public records laws, according to The Boston Globe.  
The proposed ballot question would require both the Legislature and the governor’s office to comply with the existing records law, which already applies to executive offices, municipalities, and most other public agencies and government entities across the state. 
It’s an idea that power players have long hesitated to embrace. The Globe surveyed the entire Legislature earlier this year, and reported that only 12 percent of lawmakers think they should be required to follow the public records law. (Most legislators did not respond to the Globe’s outreach, let alone detail their opposition.) 
Asked in August about making more legislative records public, House Speaker Ron Mariano said “it depends on the definition of what opening up the laws are, and what you’re opening up.” 
“I think there are some things that are better left to negotiate in private, and I would prefer it that way,” Mariano said, according to the State House News Service. 
Gov. Maura Healey pledged after winning the election that she would not deem her office exempt from the law, but she soon reversed course. Healey’s team has released redacted versions of her monthly calendars listing events and meetings after the month ends, and denied several other requests for records related to stockpiling mifepristone, sexual harassment complaints and settlement agreements, and call logs. 
Under the ballot question, two types of records would remain exempt: documents related to developing policy positions, and communications between a legislative office and a constituent specifically related to help navigating a government agency or obtaining publicly-funded benefits. 
Groups backing the public records proposal include the right-leaning Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance and the left-leaning Act on Mass, which is also working on another measure curtailing use of legislative stipends.  
Lawmakers can earn significantly more for high-ranking positions in leadership or on committees, and skeptics argue that system financially disincentivizes rank-and-file lawmakers from disagreeing with leadership. 
Act on Mass executive director Scotia Hille said the question is “targeted directly at Beacon Hill’s power structures that allow the inaction and lack of transparency we’ve seen over the years accumulate.” 
“The expansion of this system has coincided with the disappearance of debate and public dissent in the state Legislature, stalling progress,” Hille said. “It’s just a simple fact that our elected representatives shouldn’t have to weigh their livelihood every time they go take a vote.”",https://commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Auditor-Diana-DiZoglio.webp,,,2025-11-13 16:58:27.401092

(Henry Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)A Wisconsin Assembly committee deadlocked 6-6 Wednesday on a Republican-authored bill to prevent the broadly popular Knowles-Nelson Stewardship program from lapsing next year. 
The program, which allows the state Department of Natural Resources to purchase, conserve and maintain public land enjoys bipartisan support among Wisconsin residents. However a subset of Republican legislators have soured on the program’s intentions, arguing too much land has been pulled off local property tax rolls in northern Wisconsin. Republicans have also complained that a state Supreme Court decision removed their authority to conduct oversight of the program. 
Previously, members of the Joint Committee on Finance had the ability to anonymously hold up stewardship projects. 
Republicans in the Legislature stripped money to re-authorize the program out of the state budget earlier this year and both parties have proposed competing pieces of legislation to keep it running beyond 2026. 
On Wednesday, the Assembly Committee on Forestry, Parks and Outdoor Recreation took up the Republican bill, authored by Rep. Tony Kurtz (R-Wonewoc). Democrats and environmental groups have been unsupportive of the Kurtz bill since its initial release because it requires that any attempt by the DNR to acquire land at a cost of more than $1 million be approved by the full Legislature through standalone legislation. 
Critics have argued the full legislative process is the opposite of what the Court intended when it took the anonymous hold power away from JFC, that the Legislature could never move quickly enough for the speed at which real estate transactions must sometimes take place and the public nature of legislation could scare off potential sellers. 
Earlier this week, Kurtz released a proposed amendment to his bill that would lower the threshold requiring legislative approval from $1 million to $250,000. 
A Democratic proposal, which was introduced as a separate bill this summer and offered as an amendment to the Republican bill this week, would create an independent board, nominated by members of both parties, to oversee the program outside of the legislative process. 
On Wednesday, the committee voted 7-5 in favor of accepting Kurtz’s amendment to his bill. Rep. Paul Melotic (R-Grafton) voted with the committee’s four Democrats against the amendment. 
But on the vote to advance the bill out of committee, Reps. Calvin Callahan (R-Tomahawk) and Rob Swearingen (R-Rhinelander) joined the Democrats to vote no, resulting in the 6-6 tie.
When an Assembly committee votes for a bill, it reports the bill to the full Assembly floor and recommends that it be passed. According to Assembly rules, when a committee ties on a vote, the chair of the committee has the discretion to report the bill to the full Assembly “without recommendation.” 
The bill has already been reported to the full Assembly for a potential vote, according to the office of Rep. Jeff Mursau (R-Crivitz), the committee’s chair.
In a statement, a spokesperson for Rep. Vincent Miresse (D-Stevens Point), a co-author of the Democratic proposal, said “Wisconsin Democrats are united in their support and vision for Knowles-Nelson,” while “Republicans cannot seem to agree on a path forward.”
Charles Carlin, the director of strategic initiatives at the non-profit land trust organization Gathering Waters, told the Wisconsin Examiner that Wednesday’s vote shows the only way to save the program is with a bill that can get support from both parties. 
“Today’s hearing was a missed opportunity for bipartisan cooperation on the Knowles-Nelson stewardship program,” Carlin said. “There is ample room for compromise across the aisle. But today’s deadlocked committee vote demonstrates that no reauthorization is going to move forward without buy-in from both parties. The hearing should motivate legislators on both sides of the aisle to come together and work out a compromise that keeps Knowles-Nelson working for Wisconsin.”
